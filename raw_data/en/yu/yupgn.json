It gives full recognition to the progress of natural science in modem times, drawing indeed, in a certain sense, the ultimate necessary consequences of the whole trend and spirit of modem science. This will be particularly evident when we come to consider questions concerning our inner life and our knowledge of the world; and to-day I will ask your attention for one such specic question. It embraces a very wide realm, and all I can do here is to give a few indications towards its solution. I shall try to give these in such a way as to throw light on what we consider t o b e t h e t a s k s o f t h e G o e t h e a n u m i n D o r n a c h . The subject before us is concemed with two ideas that man can never contemplate without on the one hand feeling an intense longing awaken within him, and on the other being brought face to face with deep doubts and riddles. These two ideas are: the inner being of Nature and the inner being of the human soul. In his knowledge man feels himself outside Nature. What would induce bim to undertake the labour of cogmtion, were it not the hope of penetrating beyond the immediate region within which he stands in ordinary life, of entering more deeply into the Nature that presents herself in her extemal aspect to his senses and his intellect ? It is, after aU, a fact of the life of soul, and one that becomes more and more apparent the more seriously we occupy ourselves with questions of knowledge, that man feels separated ' From a shorthand report, unrevised by the lecturer. Published by kind permission of Marie Steiner, and in agreement with the Rudolf Steiner Publishing Company.Anthroposophy, a way of thought rather than a body of dogma, springs from the work and teaching of Rudolf Steiner (1861-1925). He spoke of it as \"a path of knowledge, to guide the spiritual in the human being to the spiritual in the universe.\" The purpose of this Annual is to publish writings which bring the outlook of Anthroposophy to bear on questions and activities^ of the present time. The title derives from a reference by Rudolf Steiner to an old Persian legend. \"Djemjdid was a king who led his people from the north towards Iran, and who received from the god whom he called Ahura Mazdao, a golden dagger, by means of which he was to full his imssion on earth. ... It represents a force given to man whereby he can act upon and transform external nature.\" I I 11 Ifrom the inner being of Nature. And there remains always the question\u2014to which one or another will have a different answer according to his outlook on the world\u2014whether it be possible for man to enter sufSciently deeply into the being of Nature to allow him to gain some degree of satisfaction from his search. We have at the same time the feeling that whatever in the last resort can be known concerning the being of Nature is somehow also connected with what we may call the being of man's soul. Now this question of the being of the human soul has presented itself to human cognition since very early times. We have only to recall the Apollonian saying : \"Know thyself.\" This saying sets forth a demand which the conscientious seeker after knowledge will feel is by no means easy of fullment. We shall perhaps be able to come to a clearer idea of the tasks of the present day in this connection if we go back to earlier ages and remind ourselves of conceptions that were intimately bound up, for the men of olden times, on the one hand with the knowledge of the inner being of Nature, on the other with the self- knowledge of man. Let us then look for a little at some of these conceptions, even though they will take us into elds somewhat remote from the ordinary consciousness of to-day. In olden times, these two aims\u2014^knowledge of Nature and knowledge of self\u2014were associated in the mind of man with quite strange, not to say terrifying, conceptions. It was indeed not thought possible for man to continue in his ordinary way of life if he wanted to set out on the path to knowledge; for on that path he would inevitably nd himself in the presence of deep imcertainties before he could come to any satisfying conviction. In our day we are not accustomed to think of the path of knowledge as something that leads us away from the natural order of our life j it leaves us free to go forward in everyday life as before. And one must admit that the knowledge offered to us in our laboratories and observatories and clinics is not such as to throw us \"right off the rails,\" in the way attributed to the path of knowledge that the pupils of wisdom in early times had to tread. They beheld a kind of abyss betweeli what man is and can experience in ordinary life, and what he becomes and is confronted with when he penetrates into the depths of world-existence, or into the knowledge of his own being. They described how man feels the ground sink away from under his feet, so that only if he be 2strong enough not to succumb to giddiness of soul can he go forward at all into the eld of ultimate knowledge. To tread this path of knowle dge unprepared would involve man in a harder test than he is able to meet. Serious and conscientious preparation was necessary before he dare bridge the abyss. In ordinary life man is unaware of the abyss ; he simply does not see it. And that, they said, is for him a blessing. Man is enveloped in a kind of blindness that protects him from being overcome by giddiness and falling headlong into the abyss. They spoke too of how man had to cross a \"Threshold\" in order to come into the elds of higher knowledge, and of how he must have become able to face withoyt fear the revelations that await him at the Threshold. Again, in ordinary life man is protected from crossing the Threshold. Call it per sonication or what you will, in those ancient schools of wisdom they were relating real experiences when they spoke of man being protected by the \"Guardian of the Threshold,\" and of imdergoing beyond it a time of darkness and uncertainty before ultimately attaining to a vision of reality, a \"standing within\" spirit-lled reality. It is inevitable that in our day all manner of confused and hazy notions should connect themselves with such expressions as \"Threshold,\" \"Guardian of the Threshold.\" Let me say at once that mankind is undergoing evolution; nor is it only the outer cultural conditions that change and dOvelop, but man's life of soul is changing all the time, moving onward from state to state ; conse quently the expressions which in olden times could be used to describe intimate processes in the life of soul, cannot bear the same meaning for present-day mankind. What man meant in olden times when he spoke of the Threshold and the Guardian of the Threshold was something different from the processes that take place in man to-day, when he resolves to go forward from ordinary knowledge to supersensible knowledge; and it is only with a view to making more comprehensible what I shall have to say regarding these latter that I bring in a comparison with ancient conceptions. What was it of which the men of olden times were afraid ? What was it for which the pupil in the School of Wisdom had to be pre pared by means of an exact and thoroughgoing discipline of the will\u2014^a discipline that should make the will strong and vigorous, able to stand rm in extremely difl&cult and perplexing situations in life ? Strange though it may sound, it becomes clear to us if we 3are able to survey the course of human evolution, that what men feared in those times was actually none other than the condition of soul which mankind in general has reached to-day. They wanted to protect the pupil from coming all imprepared to the condition of mind and soul to which we have been brought by the scientic education of the last three or four centuries. Let me illustrate this for you in a particular case. We all accept to-day the so-called Copemican view of the universe. This view places the sun in the centre of our planetary system; the planets revolve round the sun, with the earth as a planet among the o^er planets. Ever since the time of Copernicus, this is the picture men have had. In earlier times, quite another picture of the world lived in the general consciousness of mankind. The earth was seen in the centre, and the sun and stars revolving round the earth. Man had, that is to say, a geocentric picture of the world. Copernicus replaced it with a heliocentric picture of the world. Man has now no longer the feeling of standing on rm ground; he sees himself being hurled through space, together with the earth, at a terric speed. As for how it all looks to the eye, that, we are told, is a mere illusion, induced by relations of per spective and the like, to which human vision is subject. Now, this heliocentric picture of the world already existed in earlier ages. Plutarch is a writer from whom we can learn a great deal concerning the men of olden times, and how they thought about the world. Let me read you a passage translated from his writings. Plutarch is speaking of Aristarchus of Samos, and he describes the way in which Aristarchus conceived the world. We are therefore taken back into early Greek times, into an epoch many centuries before the Middle Ages, and before Copernicus. In the opinion of Aristarchus, says Plutarch, the universe is much bigger than it looks; for Aristarchus makes the assumption that the stars and the sun do not move, but that the earth revolves round the sun as centre, while the sphere of the xed stars, whose centre is also in the spn, is so immense that the circumference of the circle described by the earth is to the distance of the xed stars as is the centre of a sphere to its entire surface. We nd thus in Greek times the heliocentric conception of the world; we nd the very same picture as we have to-day of man*s place in the planetary system and his relation to the heaven of the ixed stars. In olden times, however, this heliocentric conception of the world was a secret known only to a few, who had undergonea strict training of the will before such knowledge could be imparted to them.\" It is important to grasp the signicance of this fact. What is common knowledge to-day , freely spoken of by everyone, was in earlier times a wisdom known to a select few. What such a wisdom- pupil knew , for example, concerning the sim and its relation to the earth was considered a knowledge that lay \"beyond the Threshold\"; man must needs rst cross the Threshold before he can come into those elds where the soul discovers this new. re lationship to the universe. The very same knowledge that our whole education renders familiar and natural to us to-day, was for them on the other side of a Threshold that must not be crossed without due preparation. What we have shown with regard to the astronomical conception of the world could quite well be worked out for other spheres of knowledge. We should again and again nd evidence of how the whole of mankind has in the course of evolution been pushed across what was for olden times a Threshold on the path to higher know ledge. The apprehension that was felt in those times about the condition of soul evoked by such knowledge, has shown itself frequently in later centuries in the attitude of the churches, whi^ preserve and tend to perpetuate the traditions of the past. Againand again the churches have rejected knowledge that has been atfginpd in the progress of civilisation; and when, for example, the Roman Church refused to acknowledge the teaching of Copermcus (as it did imtil the year 1827), the reason was the same as in ancientt im es pr ev ent ed t he pr ies t s f r om giv ing out M y s t er y k nowledge t o the masses\u2014^namely; that the knowledge would bring man into uncertainty if he were not duly prepared beforehand. Now it is well-known that no power on earth can withstand for l o n g t h e m a r c h o f p r o g r e s s ; a n d w e i n t h e s e d a y s h a v e t o t h i n k i n an entirely new way about what one may call the \"Threshold of the Spiritual W orld.\" Spiritual Science is no \"warming up\" of Gnostic or other ancient teaching, but works absolutely on the principles of modem natural science, as I think will have been evident from the example we have been considering. How was it that men of olden times feared knowledge which to day is the common property of all mankind? In my book DieRatsel der Philosophie\\ I have described the changes that have \u00ab The Riddles of PhilosopfQ^. EngUsh translation in preparation.come about in man's mind and soul since early Greek times. The Greek had not a self-consciousness that was fully detached from the external world. When he thought about the world, he felt himself, so to speak, \"grown together\" with it; he was as closely united with it as we are to-day in the act of sense-perception. For him thought was also, in a manner speaking, sense-perception. Red, blue, G, C sharp\u2014^these are for us sense-perceptions; but thought we ourselves produce by inner activity. For the Greek this kind of inner activity did not yet exist. Just as we get red, green, G, C sharp from sense-perception, so did he get the thoughts too from the external world. He had not yet the independence that comes from the comprehension of self. Only quite gradually has the perception and understanding of the self developed to what it is to-day. Self-consciousness has grown steadily stronger in the course of time, and man has thereby detached himself from sur rounding Nature. He has learned to look into himself, inwardly to comprehend himself as something that acts independently. In doing so he has placed himself over against Nature; he stands outside her, that he may then contemplate her inner being from without. And with this detachment of thought from external objective life is connected also the birth of the feeling of freedom, that sense of freedom which is in reality a product only of the last few centuries. We have come to regard history more and more in its purely external aspect; but if we were to consider it, as we try to do in spiritual science, in a more inward way, we should discover that the experience we have to-day when we speak of \"freedom\" was not there for the Greek. Although we translate the corresponding word in their writings with our word \"freedom,\" the feeling we associate with'the word was quite unknown to the Stoic, for example, and other philosophers. A careful and unbiassed study of Greek times will not fail to make this clear. - I laid stress in my Philosophic der FreiheiP which was written in the early nineties, on the connection of the experience of freedom with what I called \"pure thinking\"\u2014^that thinking which is com pletely detached from the inner organic life, and which (if the expression be not misunderstood) becomes, even in ordinary life, cognition on a higher level. For when we permeate pure thinking with moral ideas and impulses\u2014^that is, with ideas and impulses that 9 English title. Philosophy of Spiritual Activity,are not associated with desires, or with sympathies and antipathies, but solely with pure, loving devotion to the deed that is to be done \u2014^when we do this and allow the impulse to quicken in our soul to action, then the action we perform is truly free. One cannot really put the question concerning freedom in the way that is frequently done, when it is asked : Is man free or unfree ? All one can say is that man is. on the way to freedom. By culti vating self-evolution and self-knowledge, by achieving inner liberation from his accustomed attitude of mind and soul, man is treading a path that will enable him to rise to pure thinking; and on this path he becomes increasingly free. It is thus not a matter of \"either\u2014or,\" but rather of gradual approach, or, shall we say, of both. For we are at once free and unfree; unfree where we are still governed by our desires, by what rises up out of our organism, out\" of the life of instinct; free, on the other hand, where we have grown independent of the instinctive life, where we are able to awaken within us pure love for the deed that has been envisaged in pure thinking. The condition of mind that leads to the experience of freedom \u2014^the condition, namely, of pure thinking, to which man is able to surrender himself\u2014must necessarily, for present-day man, remain an ideal; an ideal, however, that is indissolubly bound up with his worth and dignity as man. We are on the way to such an ideal, and it is natural science that has set us upon the path. - In all the development of natural science in modem times\u2014and the results of this natural science carry authority in the widest circles and tend more and more to become the groimdwork of our whole education and culture\u2014one thing stands out clearly. Study the development of natural science and you will be struck with the growing recognition of the value and importance of the thought\u2014^the thought that is elaborated by man himself inwardly. This is true in the realm of the inorganic, from physics up to astronomy, as well as in the realm of the organic, and in spite of the fact that scientists base their results everjnvhere on observation and experiment. And through the work he does in thinking, man develops an enhanced self-consciousness; which means, that his detachment from the inner being of Nature grows. We can here take once more the example of Astronomy. What Copernicus did, mdamentally speaking, was to reduce to calculation the results of observation. In this way one arrives at a world system that is completely detached from man. The world systems 7of ancient times were not so; they were always intimately con nected with the human being. Man felt himself within the world; he was part of it. In our time man is, so to speak, incidental. He sees himself hurled through universal space together with the planet Earth, and his picture of the whole structure of the world is com pletely divorced from himself; that which lives in his own inner being must on no account be allowed to play a part in his conception of the universe. Man becomes lled, that is to say, with a thought- content that is the means of detaching him from himself. True, he thinks his thoughts, and in thinking remains always united with his thoughts ; but he thinks them in such a way that they have no sort of connection with what rises up out of his organism, out of his life of instinct. He is under necessity so to think that, although the thought remains imited with him, it nevertheless wrests itself ^ free from the human-personal in him, so that in his thoughts he becomes, in effect, completely objective. And this experience brings man to greater consciousness of self. The.strenuous efforts required for nding one's way to clear con ceptions in the eld of astronomy or physics or chemistry to-day, or even only for following in thought the results of others* work, are bound to lead to a strengthening of the consciousness of self. In the ancient civilisations\u2014and herein lie's the great difference between them and our own\u2014education was not directed to the strengthening of self-consciousness. Rather had it the tendency to make man's thinking correspond with what he saw with his eyes. So arose the Ptolemaic conception of the world, which in all essentials is a reproduction of what we perceive with the external senses. Man was not thrust so far out of himself as he is by the modern ' scientic outlook; hence his self-consciousness did not grow. He remained more within his body\u2014held there, as it were, by enchant ment. Consciousness of self he derived from his inslancts, and from the feeling of life and vitality within him. Although in our age we have drifted into materialism, this living in the body has been overcome by the development of thinking; and the conscious-i ness of self has grown correspondingly . The very fact that we have become materialists, and lost our awareness of the spiritual in the objects perceived by the senses, has contributed to the achievements . . f-of thought. In olden times it was feared that if a man were brought unprepared to the kind of thinking such as is necessary , for example,to grasp the heliocentric system, he would \"faint\" in his soul; his 8consciousness of self would not be strong enough to sustain him.' This accounts for the emphasis on the training of the will; for a strong and vigorous wiU strengthens also\" the consciousness of self. The preparation of the pupil in the Wisdom School was therefore directed primarily'to the will, in order that he might grow strong enough to endure, beyond the Threshold, that picture of the world for which a highly-developed consciousness of self is required. We see, then, what it was men feared in olden times for the pupil who was to be guided into the inner being of the things of the world, into the inner being of Nature. They were afraid lest he be hurt in his soul, through falling into a condition of uncertainty and darkness, a condition comparable, in the realm of soul, with physical fainlness. This danger they hoped to avoid by a thoroughgoing discipline of the will. In ordinary life, they said, man must remain on this side of the realm where the dangerous knowledge is to be found; a Guardian holds him back from the region for which he is unt, thus protecting him from being overcome by faintness of soul. And their description of the experiences the pupil had to undergo if he wanted to cross the Threshold and pass the Guardian corres pond exactly to inner experiences of the soul. It was told how, when the pupil draws near the Threshold, he immediately has a feeling of uncertainty. If he has been sufciently prepared, he is able to stand upright in the realm which would otherwise make him giddy; he passes the Guardian of the Threshold and, by virtue of the powers of his soul, enters into the spiritual world\u2014^which the Guardian would otherwise not allow him even to behold. But he must be able also to stay in the spiritual world with full consciousness. For the tremendous experiences that await him there call for strength and not for weakness, and if he were to let go, these experiences would have a shattering effect on his whole organisation; he would suffer grievous harm. And now the strange thing is that in course of evolution a know ledge that could be attained by pupils of the ancient Wisdom Schools only after most careful preparation has become the common property of all mankind. We stand to-day in our ordinary knowledge beyond what the men of old felt to be a Threshold. The purpose they had in view in the ancient Wisdom Schools was that the pupil, when he looked into his own inner being, should feel himself united there with the inner being of Nature. And believing that if he did so tmprepared, he would sink into a kind of spiritual faintness, they 9 Iwould not allow him to attempt this exploration until he had received the right discipline and training. And yet in our age everyone penetrates into this region utterly unprepared! As a matter of fact man is experiencing to-day precisely what the ancients took such care to avoid. He acquires his knowledge of Nature; and he acquires also a strong consciousness of self that enables him to stand upright amid all the knowledge that is current to-day in astronomy, physics, chemistry, biology, etc. He imbibes this knowledge and can remain steadfast without losing his balance. Nevertheless there is a quality in his life of soul that the men of old would deeply deplore. Because in the course of evolution we have acquired thought and the feeling of freedom and a stronger self- consciousness, therefore we do not lose ourselves when we study the results of natural science; but we do lose something, and the loss is only too manifest to-day in the soul-life of mankind everywhere. 'V In this matter we labour under great illusion; we dream, and we cling to our dreams, and will not let them go. I have often spoken of how natural science brings conscientious students to a recognition of the boundaries of knowledge, boundaries man cannot pass without taking his power of cognition into forbidden\u2014^nay, into impossible\u2014^regions. A very distinguished scientist of modem times has spoken of the \"Ignorabimus,\" reading into the word a confession that however far we go in the knowledge we acquire from sense-observation and the intellect, we never penetrate to the inner being of Nature. I here touch on a subject that at once lands us in conflict, as was felt even at a time when natural science was far leSs advanced than it is to-day. It was Albrecht von Haller who expressed the \"Ignorabimus\" in the well-known lines : To Nature's heart No living soul can reach. Thrice happy he To w h o m s h e s h o w s Even her outer shell. Goethe, who used constantly to hear these words on the lips of those who shared Haller's attitude towards Nature, labelled such thinkers \"Philistine.\" For him they are men who do not want to rouse themselves to inner activity of soul; for by dint of inner activity the soul of man can kindle a light within\u2014a light which, shining upon the heart of Nature, shall carry the soul into herinnermost being. Goethe proclaims this in forcible and trenchant manner in his poem \"Allerdings,\" quoting to begin with the words of HaUer: * To Nature's heart No living soul can reach.' 0 Philistine, To me and mine What use in such a speech ? We think, through every part W e e n t e r i n t o h e r h e a r t . Still the cry goes,' Thrice happy he T o w h o m s h e s h o w s Even her outer shell.' For sixty years I have heard that cry; 1 curse it, but secretly, silently. Say to myself a thousand times. Gladly she gives and she gives us all! Nature is neither kernel nor shell. She is both in one; she is one and all. Look in your own heart, man, and tell If you yourself are kernel or shell Out of an instinctive feeling that was conscious and yet at the same time unconscious, Goethe rejected utterly the separation of the being of man's soul from the innermost being of Nature. He saw clearly that if the soul becomes conscious, in a healthy manner;, ' of its own real being, then that consciousness brings with it the experience of standing within the innermost heart of Nature. This conviction it was that kept Goethe from accepting Kant's philosophy. They make a great mistake who assert that at one time of his life Goethe came very near to the philosophy of Kant. In contradistinction to what Kant recognised as the human Goethe postulated what he called \"perceptive judg ment.\" This means that in order to form a judgment we do not merely pass in abstract reasoning from concept to concept; rather Pr do we use inwardly for thought the kind of beholding we use out wardly in sense perception. Goethe says he never thought about * English translation from Goethe and Faust j an Interpretation^ by F. M. Stawell and G. L. Dickinson. G. Bell & Sons, 1928. IItTiinking; what he set himself continually to do was to behold the living element in the thought. And in this beholding' of the thoughts he saw a way to unite the human soul with the very being of Nature. .Anthroposophical Spiritual Science would go further on the same path. This perceptive judgment\u2014which, as presented by Goethe, was still in its beginnings\u2014it sets out to develop in the direction indicated in my book \"How to attain Knowledge of the Higher Worlds.\"* Faculties of cognition, which in ordinary life, and 'in the pursuit also of ordinary science, remain latent in man, are led up to \"vision,\" to a new \"beholding.\" Just as man perceives aroundhim with the physical eye colours, or light and darkness, so with the eye of the spirit does he now behold the spiritual. By the practice of certain intimate exercises of the soul, he calls forth and develops within bim powers that usually remain hidden, and so lifts himself up to a higher kind of knowledge which is able to plimge into the very heart of external Nature. Y ou have frequently heard me speak of the successive stages of this higher knowledge, and I would like here to say a little about their evolution from a particular point of view. We are accustomed to think of the course of our life as divided between waking and sleeping. These two conditions must, we know , alternate for us if we are to remain healthy in mind and body . How is it with us from the time of awakening to the time of falling asleep ? The experiences of the soul are permeated with thoughts ; the thoughts receive a certain colouring from the life of feeling; and there is also the life of will, which wells up from dim depths of our being under the guidance of the thoughts, and accomplishes deeds. In the other condition, that of sleep, we lie still; our thoughts sink into darkness; our feelings vanish and our will is inactive. The ordinary normal life of man shows these two alternating con ditions. The picture is, however, incomplete; and we shall not arrive at any satisfactory idea of the nature of man if we are content to see the course of his life in this simple manner. We take it for granted that, between waking up and falling asleep we are awake. But the fact is, we are not awake in our whole being. This is overlooked, and consequently we have no true psychology; we come to no right understanding of the soul. If, ridding ourselves of all prejudice, we try to observe inwardly what we experience when we feel, we discover that our feeUng Hfe is by no means so illumined with the light of consciousness as is the life of thoughtand ideation. It is dim, by comparison. For a sense of self, for an experience of self, the life of feeling is undoubtedly every bit as real as\u2014even perhaps in some ways more real than\u2014the life of thought; but clarity, light-lled clarity, is enjoy6d by thought alone. There is always something undened about the life of fueling. Indeed, if we examine the matter carefully, comparing different conditions of soul one with another, we are led nally to the conclusion that the life which pulsates in feeling may be com pared with dream life. Study the dream life of man; consider how it surges up from unknown depths of his being; how it manifests in pictures, but in pictures that are vague and indeterminate, so that one does not see all at once exactly how they are connected with external reality. Has not the life of feeling the same quality and character? Feelings are, of course, something altogether different from dream pictures, but when we compare the degree of consciousness in both, we nd it to be very muchthe same. The life of feeling is a kind of waking dream; the pictures that appear in the dream are here pressed down into the whole organic life. The experience is different in each case, and yet the experience is present in the soul in the same manner in both. So that in reality we are awake only in the life of ideation; in the feeling life we dream even while we are*awake. With the life of the will it is again different. We do not as a rule give much thought to the matter , but is it not so that the impulse of will arises within us without our having any clear consciousness of its origin ? We have a thought; and out of the thought springs a n i m p u l s e o f w i l l . T h e n a g a i n w e s e e o u r s e l v e s a c t i n g ^ a n d t h e n a g a i n we have a thought about the action. But we cannot follow with con sciousness what comes between. How a thought becomes an impulse for the will and shoots into my muscle-power; Nhow thenerve registers the movement of the muscles; how , in other words, that which has been sent down into the depths of my being as thought, comes to be carried out in action, afterwards to emerge again when I perceive myself performing the action\u2014all this lives in me in no other way than do the experiences of sleep. In deep sleep we have in a sense lost our own being; we pass t h r o u g h t h e e x p e r i e n c e s o f s l e e p w i t h o u t b e i n g a w a r e o f t h e m ; a n d it is the same with what comes about through the activity of the will-impulse in man. We dream in our life of feeling, and we are asleep in our willing; dreaming and sleeping are thus perpetually present in waking life. And in these unknown depths of beingwhere the will has its origin, arises also that whicl^ we eventually gather up\u2014^focus, as it were\u2014^in consciousness of self. Man comes to a recognition of his full humanity only when he knows himself as a being that thinks and feels and wills. Ordinary life, therefore, embraces imconscious conditions. And it is just through the life of ideation becoming separated from the rest of the soul life and lifted up into consciousness, that a way is made for the development of the experience of freedom. Here, in a sense, we divide ourselves up. We are awake in a part of ourselves, in the life of ideation, whilst in relation to another part of us we are as imconscious as we are in relation to the inner being of Nature. It is at this point that Anthroposophical Spiritual Science steps in with \"its methods for attaining higher knowledge. This spiritual science is very far removed from \"any dreamy, obscure mysticism, nor does it support itself, like spiritualism, on external experiment. The foundation for the whole method of spiritual scientic research lies in the inner being of man himself; it can be evolved in iU consciousness and will manifest the same clarity as the most exact material conceptions. The world of feeling, which generally, as we have seen, leads a kind of dream life, can become flooded with the same light that permeates thoughts and ideas\u2014which, according to some schools of philosophy, themselves originate in the feelings. By means of exercises described in my book, \"How to Attain Know ledge of Higher Worlds,\" this lighting up of the world of feeling is brought about, with the result that the region which is usually dreamlike in character now lives in the soul as \"imaginative\" con sciousness. The moment man gives himself up to this imaginative consciousness, something is present for him in consciousness that remains generally beneath the Threshold.' He thinks pictures, knowing, however, quite well that he is not dreaming them, but that they correspond to reahties. Spiritual Science then leads on further, to \"inspired\" con-, sciousness, and here we are taken into the realm of the will. Little by little, we are brought to the point of being able to behold clair- voyantly\u2014please do not misunderstand the expression\u2014how the whole human organisation functions when the will pulsates in it. We see what actuaUy takes place in the muscle when the will is active. Such a knowledge is \"inspired\" knowledge. Man dives down into his own inner being and acquires a self-knowledge which 14is generally veiled from him. We come to know more of man than stands before us as \"given\" between birth and death. Feeling and willing being now also flooded with the light of consciousness, we can know man not only as a created being, perceiving in him that which wakes up every morning and enters again into a body ready-made ; we can recognise in him also the creative power which comes down from spiritual worlds at the time of birth or conception, and itself forms and organises the body. In effect, at this further :i stage man comes to know his own eternal being which lives beyond I; birth and death; he attains to a direct beholding of the eternal and } spiritual in his soul. i As man learns in this way to know himself, not merely as natural I man, but as spirit, he nds that he is also now within the inner 1' being of Nature; in the spirit of his own nature he recognises the' spirit of the Nature that is all around him. And at this point a fact of deep significance is revealed\u2014^namely, that with our modem knowledge of Nature we are already standing on the other side of the Threshold, in the old sense of the word. The men of olden times believed they would lose their self-consciousness if they , entered this region unprepared. We do not lose our self-conscious ness, but we do lose the world. The full clarity of thought and idea, to which man owes his consciousness of self, has been achieved by him only in modern times; and now this consciousness of self needs to be,carried a step further. The men of old paid particular heed to the training of the will; we have now to press forward, as I emphasised in my \"Philosophy of Spiritual Activity,\" to pure thinking. We must 0 develop our thinking; it must grow into Imagination, Inspiration 1 and Intuition. And this will bring us once again to a Threshold, a I new Threshold into the spiritual world. We must not remain in the world that offers itself for sense-perception and leaves the iimer being of Nature beyond the boundaries of knowledge. We must cross another Threshold, the Threshold that lies before our own inner being. I At this Threshold we shall no longer let our imagination runI away with us and conjure up all manner of atoms and molecules to* account for the impressions of colour and sound and heat; for when we come consciously to recognise, and be within, our own spirit, then we shall nd we are also within the spirit of Nature. We shall leam to know Nature herself as spirit. In the region where to-day 15we talk of an atomistic world (we are really only postulating behind Nature a second equally material Nature), in the very region where to-day we are losing the world, we shall nd the spirit. And then we shall have the- right fundamental feeling towards the inner being of Nature and, also, the being of the human soul. It is, as you see, a different attitude we have to attain from that of olden times. We must be conscious that we are living in con ditions the men of old wanted to avoid. This does not mean, how ever, that we are in danger of losing ourselves ; our world of thought has been too strongly developed for that. And if we develop the world of thought still further, then we shall also not lose what we t are in danger of losing. The men of olden times were threatened with the loss of self, with a kind of faintness of the soul. We are faced with the danger of losing the world for our ego-consciousness; of being so surrounded and overborne by purely mathematical pictures of the world, purely atomistic conceptions, that we lose all sense of the \"whole\" world in its innite variety and richness. In order that we may find the world again\u2014in order, that is, that we may find the spirit in the world\u2014vfc must cross what constitutes f o r m o d e m m m t h e T h r e s h o l d . We may even put it this way : if the men of olden times feared the Guardian of the Threshold, and needed to be fully prepared before they might pass him, we in our day must desire earnestly to pass the Guardian. We must long to carry knowledge of the spirit into those regions where hitherto we have relied only on external sense-perception in combination with the results of intellectual reasoning and experiment. Knowledge of the spirit must be t^en into the laboratory, info the observatory and into the clinic. Wherever research is carried on, knowledge of the spirit must have place. Otherwise, since all the results that are arrived at in such in stitutions come from beyond the Threshold, man is thereby cut off from the world in a manner that is dangerous for him. He feels himself in the presence of an inner being of Nature which he can never approach on an external path, which he can approach only by becoming awake in his soul and pressing forward to the immortal part of his own being. As soon, however , as he does this, he is at that moment also within the spirit of Nature. He has stepped aaoss the Threshold that lies in his own being, and nds himself in the presence of the spiritual in Nature. T o point out to man this path is the task of Anthroposophical 16Spiritual Science. It has to give what the other sciences cannot give. And it may rightly claim to be Goethean, for to those who say: To Nature's heart No living soul can reach. Goethe replies : Nature is neither kernel nor shell. She is both in one, she is one and all. Look in your own heart, man, and tell If you yourself are kernel or shell! We are \"shell\" as long as we remain in the life of ideas alone. We sever ourselves from Nature, and'all we can do is to talk about her. But the man who penetrates to. his own inner \"kernel,\" and ex periences himself in the very centre of his soul\u2014^he discovers that he is at the same time in the very innermost of Nature; he is ex periencing her inner being. Such, then, is the kind of impulse that Anthroposophical Spiritual Science is ready to give to the whole of human life, and in particular to the several sciences. These several sciences need not remain the highly specialised elds that they have been hitherto; rather shall each be a contribution to that quest which man must ever follow if he would rise to a consciousness of his true dignity\u2014the quest for the eternal in the human being. All that the individual sciences can teach to-day is still only a knowledge that looks on Nature from without. But if those who are working in them tread, as Well as the outer, also the inner path of knowledge, then the knowledge acquired in the different elds can grow into a knowledge of man,a comprehensive knowledge of mankind. We need such a know ledge in our time if we are to guide the social problems of the futureinto paths where right and healthy solutions can be found\u2014as I have explained in my book, \"The Threefold Commonwealth.\" One who carries deeply enough in his heart the development of spiritual science will nd himself continually face to face with this question of the connection between the being of man and the inner being of Nature. The specialised sciences cannot help us here; t h e y o n l y s p r e a d d a r k n e s s o v e r t h e w o r l d . T h e d a r k n e s s i s t o b e f e a r e d , e v e n a s t h e m e n o f o l d e n t i m e s f e a r e d t h e r e g i o n b e y o n d t h e Threshold. But it is possible for man to kindle a light that shall light up the darkness; and this light is the light that shines in the soul of mflVi when he attains to spiritual knowledge.

HARWOOD rriHE threefold order of society envisaged by Rudolf Steiner is X based on a division of function, not on a division of classes. It therefore represents something new in history, and, like all new things, is bom out of a change of human consciousness. Plato's Republic had its divisions, but they were class divisions of much strictness ; in this they merely reflected contemporary society which made an absolute distinction, for instance, betweed freeman and slave. A similar absolute distinction between the serf and the various classes of freemen (themselves fairly rigidly distinguished) survived into the Aliddle Ages, and was reinforced by the great distinction between secular and clerical society . It is only in recent times that the same man has had the ability to think of himself as belonging to the. various spheres of society, and acting differently' in a variety of capacities. It is easy to recogmse and acclaim the great discoveries and inventions that belong to the modern age. It is far more difcult to characterise the change in consciousness which has made these discoveries possible. Since the Renaissance a new type of mind has been bora, or has been undergoing a slow process of birth, to which Rudolf Steiner\u2014the first person fully to recognise and describe it\u2014has given the name of \"consciousness soul.\" One characteristic of this consciousness soul is that it moves freely and easily among material things and the forces of the physical world; another is that it can live outside time and so develop a historical sense; a third\u2014which in reality underlies the other two\u2014^is that it endows a mgn with the capacity to see himself from outside, even in the engrossing moment of action. It has been called the spec tator consciousness; it could be called the Hamlet consciousness\u2014 for who has not sometimes felt that the very play in which Hamlet i8is the principal actor takes place in his mind, that the play is in him no less than he in the play ? This new consciousness belongs to all Western Europe since the Renaissance, but it is most deeply implanted, penetrating to their' very blood and bone, in the Anglo-Saxon races. It crops up in the earliest stories of English history. There is something of it in the attitude of Thomas-a-Becket, who served the King when he was Chancellor, but the Pope when he was Archbishop. It was there when Drake played out his game of bowls. It shines brilliantly by reflection in the story that Napoleon, after Waterloo, said to one of his captors : \"What will Wellington do now ? I suppose he will make himself King of England\"\u2014^unaware that the Duke put on his civilian clothes as fast as he could, and that when he had them on, he put on also a civilian mind which could never even have conceived such a thought. Chesterton has put this attitude (perhaps a little early) into the behaviour of Alfred the Great, when his rst thoughts, on being slapped by the woman whose cakes he had burnt, are of torture and the evil things That are in the childish hearts of kings \u2014^but in a moment his mood changes, he goes out and the woman looks On a stranger sight than sylph or elf. On one man laughing at himself Under the greenwood tree. This ability to put oneself outside oneself-r-which includes, of course, the ability to laugh at oneself\u2014is, I repeat, something new i in human history. The Romans had a touch of it in some out standing personalities, but it did not become a common possession of mankind until the Renaissance, and then only gradually, and principally in this country. Historians are sometimes puzzled by the fact that former civilisations did not invent the idea of repre sentative government. But to be a representative you must be prepared and able at the right time to forget yourself and act as a representative\u2014^and you are not likely to be chosen unless other people believe that you -will do so. Your representative may announce \u00b1at he represents your interests and not your opinions,' but they are at least your interests and not his. You do not expect he will use his position to make himself King of England. He must see himself from outside acting as a representative. Without this 19ability, and general condenbe that it will be exercised, represen tative government is impossible. It is this ability which has made representative government' possible in England during the past few himdred years; it is lack of this ability which has made it impossible in other ages and other countries. Rudolf Steiner relied on it when he proposed the three fold social order for Central Europe after the rst world war. Hitler (and before Hitler, Woodrow Wilson) denied it. If you cannot separate yourself as economic man from yourself as spiritual man or man of rights, you will be a German or an Italian or a Russian in all three spheres. This is the nal conclusion of nationalism which Wilson preached and the Dictators materialised. The consciousness soul was not born even in this country in a year, a decade, or even a century. The Englishman, whom we regard as typical (he belongs perhaps more to the last century than to this), with his inexcitability and detachment, his dislike of extremes and of display, his toleration and spirit of compromise, his Roman solidity and Greek love of understatement, was simply not to be found in the sixteenth, seventeenth, or eighteenth centuries. The Elizabethan gentleman would sell an estate to provide himself with a suit of clothes ; he was personally dirty and covered up the smell with a plentiful use of civet; he was indifferent to cruelty; he c. delighted in the affected and extravagant in art; he paid outrageous and sycophantic compliments imblushingly; he was religious, and wept aloud at long sermons by great preachers; his immediate descendants were often religious fanatics. In other words, he exhibited most of the traits that we would to-day think characteristic of the Spanish or Italian peoples. Similarly, his followers of the eighteenth century, with their wit, their satire, their love of reason and proportion, their elegance and their rhetoric, were more akin to the French than to the modern Englishman. Yet through aU this exotic vegetation there is always springing up the new native growth of the consciousness soul, destined to destroy alike the good and the bad in the earlier char acter. With this growth comes an instinctive feeling towards the threefold social order; the man of the consciousness soul wants to see himself as a different being acting imder different principles, when he is a producer or consumer, when he is obeying the laws, when he is engaged in public controversy at Hyde Park Comer, or writing a book, or founding a university. It is always hard to know where to begin in tracing a new move- 20ment. Critics who seek the origins of the Romantic Movement are apt suddenly to nd themselves way back in the spacious days of Beowulf. So with the consciousness soul you can point to such a change in the law as Elizabeth introduced, when the Papists were no longer persecuted for thdr beliefs but ned for not attending church\u2014^the law no longer enquiring into your opinions but con cerning itself only with your practices\u2014^a distinction of very great importance for a country which was to introduce the new scientic views of the world against a background of traditional religion. You could no doubt go back earlier still; but, for the present purpose at any rate, perhaps the best beginning is the time of the Qvil Wars of the Seventeenth Century, so closely parallel and yet in such contrast to the Thirty Years* War in Central Europe. The Thirty Y ears* W ar began as a religious struggle; it ended as a purely secular ght for the dominance of Europe. At rst Catholic troops fought Protestant\u2014both sides almost in the spirit of a crusade; but Wallenstein found that all he needed were soldiers \u2014of whatever religion; and Richelieu, though a Cardinal of the Roman Church, was prepared to back either side if it were protable to France. The incidents of the war are of great complexity; the political development simple and imiform. The English Qvil Wars, on the other hand, present from the very beginning a much more complicated picture. From the rstt h e q u a r r e l t a k e s p l a c e o n t h r e e l e v e l s , a n d i n t h r e e s p h e r e s . T h e r e is the trade and economic quarrel. It does not matter whether tie interference of the early Stuarts with trade by means of monopolies a n d i m p o r t s a n d c o n t r o l s w a s a g o o d o r a b a d t h i n g ; t h e n e w t r a d m g and manufacturing communities believed that it was not the function of the King to interfere with trade and manufacture. Then there is the legal quarrel. It does not matter whether Ship-Money was morally right or wrong; the legal community beheved it repre sented one more act of the King against the law\u2014and they believed ( u n l i k e t h e S t u a r t s t h e m s e l v e s ) t h a t t h e K i n g w a s u n d e r t h e l a w no less than the humblest of his subjects. Finally, there was the r e l i g i o u s q u e s t i o n , n o t a l t o g e t h e r a c c i d e n t a l l y b o u n d u p w i t h t h e other two. For the trading communities were naturally Puritan.The practice of trade produced the puritan virtues of thrift and^ e c o n o m y r a t h e r t h a n t h e o l d e r i d e a l o f g i v i n g y o u r c o a t t o t h e b e g g a ro r y o u r e s t a t e t o t h e c h u r c h . A n d t h e s e v i r t u e s a g a i n w o r k e d b a c k on commercial ability and astuteness. The Stuart Kings stood for the divine right of kings, which was 21really a renaissance of ancient Egypt, where the Pharaoh was high priest and judge and economic administrator in one. Like Kepler, they \"stole the golden vessels of the Egyptians,\" but not to the same satisfactory end. For, by their policy of the unied State, they had . the misfortune to unite against them all the . elements of a threefold state struggling to be bom. They were not ghting against men alone, but against those impersonal forces in history which achieve so quickly such unforeseeable results. What was the position when the struggle was over? How different was the social England to which Charles II returned from that which he left? It would be idle to pretend that spiritual freedom had been obtained. Books and newspapers had still to be licensed; religious toleration was of the most tful kind,, and then granted for political rather than spiritual reasons; but monopolies had gone and, in spite of some forced loans, the trading commimity . had achieved a far greater measure of independence than it enjoyed imder Elizabeth. It was in the sphere of rights, however, that the position appeared most consolidated. Probably as much through the experience of military government under Cromwell as through the old resistance to the Stuarts, a temper was abroad apt to resist any infringement of the law except by full constitutional procedure. It was this temper which made it impossible for James II's nominee President to nd a blacksmith in Oxford willing to open the doors of Magdalen for him. It was this temper which drove James himself from London almost without a blow. This temper\u2014 reaching the remote islands of Scotland and undermining the very party of divine right\u2014caused the Highland fisherman guarding bonny Prince Charlie in the island of Rasay to call through the door: \"You are the King, but we are the parliament\u2014and you must do as we say!\" After the bitter experiences of the seventeenth century the law was especially regarded in the eighteenth as the guardian of in- <lividud rights and liberties. The extent to which it protected privilege is in our days almost incredible. Landlords who pulleddown whole villages because their roofs of fended the eye that viewed them from the Great House; parcels of uninhabited land which sent a member or two to parliament; professors who never taught, lectured or studied; vicars who never saw the parishes which gave them their comfortable incomes\u2014all these were supported and maintained by the law. This very support of the freedom of the. individual to enjoy his own had, however, one unexpected resultThe great individuals whom this system encouraged were certainly not going to have their mouths muzzled. Wherever they were, they spoke out their minds\u2014and it is not a far step from speaking to writing. Thus it came about, that, whereas Gibbon thought it advisable to veil his attack on Christianity imder the elaborate irony which he so much enjoyed, by the end of the century the licensing of books and newspapers was a thing of the past. The reaction against the French Revolution was to produce some erce pieces of intolerance, but virtually freedom of speech and thought and religion was established during the eighteenth century. The nineteenth-century historians, brought up in this freedom, appreciated to the full its virtues, but not perhaps its difculties. Seen from the other side of the Thirty Years' War, liberty of speech and religion must have appeared almost incompatible with a coherent society. To go to a ruler of the sixteenth century and propose to Tiitn to take away his controls over the spiritual life was much the same as to go to a modem ruler and propose the removal of all controls over the economic life. The one would have replied, as the other does reply, that Society would go to pieces without such controls. It took much experience to discover that a nation could cohere even though the individual spoke and wrote as he liked. This possibility had become plain to the nineteenth century. What the twentieth century is discovering is that this spiritual freedom is untenable unless it is supported by a pervasive and absolute belief in equality before the law. Y ou cannot grant freedom of speech to people who believe that they are the only ones who should enjoy it. No single part of the Threefold State can stand for long alone. For it was just at the end of the eighteenth century , when the new industries in England were beginning to call for a new and more conscious organisation of society, when England was rst fully realising the Consciousness Soul, that the French Revolution by a characteristic flash of genius produced the three watchwords, Liherti, Egaliti, Fratemiti. The crowds who shouted them probably never reflected that the three ideals were incompatible with each other; that equality denies liberty , and fraternity equality . Because they never sorted them out and applied them in their different s p h e r e s , b e c a u s e t h e y d i d n o t p r o d u c e a b a l a n c e d o r g a n i c s o c i e t y ,within a few years they were to suffer a rigid military dictatorship. T h e e x p e r i e n c e o f E u r o p e a t l a r g e h a s b e e n s l o w e r b u t n o t l e s s s u r e . The beginning of the nineteenth century\u2014after the Napoleonic Wars\u2014found England, for the first time since it became'a nation, 23 22without any effective enemy on the Continent. The political situation coincided with the swift development of industry on a mechanised basis, which gave England power abroad, but, at home, presented her with problems of social organisation new in the history of the world. If mechanised industry had come in the days of slavery, the right organisation for it would have been at once apparent. Gangs of slaves would have worked the machines as they worked the plantations and the ergestula and the galleys. But the very consciousness soul, which brought mankind into such close touch with the physical world that he could explore its latent forces, had also produced a sense of the ego in man which precluded slavery. The great question for England, and for the world which was to follow in England's footsteps, was, under what sign will the new industries be established ? Was it inevitable for them to be built up under the sign of laissez-faire, with its corollaries of buying in the cheapest market and selling in the dearest, and of equating labour and raw materials ? Laissez-faire is really nothing more than an extension of the eighteenth-century individualism into the factories of the nine teenth, without the aristocratic sense of social responsibility which had so often kept the great house in friendly connection with the cottages clustered outside its gates. It is therefore intere'sting to see from what side opposition to it arose. Take, for instance, the Machine Wrecking Bill, which was to make machine-wrecking a capital offence. Through the pressure of the new industrialists it passed the House of Commons; but largely tmder the influence of a speech by Byron\u2014who contrasted the industrial North highly unfavourably with the Turkish East\u2014it was thrown out by the more aristocratic Lords. Then there is the strange case of Robert Owen and his \"villages of co-operation.\" Owen is perhaps the rst case of an industrialist with a conscience who hated the doctrine of \"buying cheap and selling dear.\" His idea was to establish the new industries on a co-operative basis in communities to be nanced indifferently by rich individuals, by corporations, by townships or by the Government. Prots were to be limited, the workers were to have access to the land, living was to . be partly communal, and the general lay-out of the buildings some what like a College\u2014without the chapel. The great practical success of his mills at New Lanark attracted an immense interest to Owen's plans. The Royal Dukes, the Arch bishop of Canterbury, Ambassadors and visiting Royalties, alladmired and patronised his schemes. At one time it looked as though \"villages of co-operation\" might have been generally estab lished over industrial England. Indeed, the sudden dropping of Owen's schemes by his influential supporters was not due to any thing inherent in the schemes themselves. Like many self-made men, Owen fancied he had discovered the secret of the universe\u2014 in the fact that man is the product of his environment. This led to the corollary that religion is inherently untrue and the root of all evil. Owen carefully staged a public declaration of this startling truth at a mass meeting in London. It was too much for the Arch bishop, for the Royal Dukes\u2014^and for \"The Times.\" Owen's schemes were dropped, and he turned his attention to founding an ideal community in America. But the very name he wished to give to his industrial com munities, \"villages of co-operation,\" showed that Owen was conscious of a most important fact about the new industries. Intrinsically the old craftsman had not been co-operative\u2014^he had done the whole job himself; the old serf or peasant had not been co-operative\u2014^he had ploughed Ms strip of the great eld and kept Ms geese and Ms swine on the common pasture. There was social organisation for a variety of reasons, but the organisation did not arise from the actual act of production. Under the new machine industries the common work of many men was necessary to produce a single piece of cloth, a single pair of boots. The work of the world was calling for co operation in a sense it had never done before. The new industries were asking to be started under the sign of fraternity. UnhappUy, eighteenth-century individualism proved too strong. The fraternity which afterwards arose in the industrial world\u2014 represented by the trade unions\u2014^was not directed to economic production but to the securing of rights. Industry begot battle elds rather than villages of co-operation. Yet never had the power of free association and the forming of societies been so strong as in the nineteenth centqry. It had never, in fact, existed in the same way in the history of the world. No free association was allowed under the Roman Empire, and govern ments had hitherto regarded it as no less incompatible with social existence than freedom of speech. Association had always been regulated by charter. But now, quite suddenly, labour combin ations and societies of all kinds became legal and flourished. I the eighteenth century is the great age of the individual, the nine teenth is that of the Society. Scientic, Literary and Antiquarian 24 25Societies, Old Boys' Qubs and Ancient Orders of Buffaloes, mission ary and philanthropic societies. Trade Unions and Freemasons\u2014 all of them had, if not their actual foundation, at any rate their flowering time in this century of association. With this came two other things\u2014the fiiU realisation of free trade and the urge towards universal education. Everyone was to have access to the best books, and the result was to be something like an earthly Paradise. It seemed as though the ideal of a Threefold State was about to be realised. Here again, however, the canker of the century was at work and the buds were blighted. Free trade was not in reality free trade. It was based on the temporary and articial conditions of a monopoly. England was, for practical purposes, the only manufacturing country. All countries that wished to be in the swim were compelled to buy f r o m h e r. T h e r e w a s n o r e e d o m a b o u t i t . W i t h i n d i v i d u a l i s m rampant at home, and monopoly entrenched abroad, it was no wonder that the economic system grew up askew. We have now reached the polarity of nationalisation at home and State bargaining abroad. When Byron was a small boy a quack doctor applied an apparatus to his twisted foot which bent it an equal amount in the opposite direction^ The theory was plausible, but the foot did not improve. With the advent of the nineteenth century we enter the stage of the awakening of the working classes. They not only organise themselves in Trade Unions, but they assert their existence\u2014for the first time\u2014^in the political and spiritual spheres, represented chiefly by the Vote and by Universal Education. The experience of education for all is a very recent one and can hardly yet be said to have succeeded. But it is interesting to observe that one at least of its earliest advocates would regard our present school system as entirely on the wrong lines. John Stuart Mill was wholeheartedly convinced that the State should pay for the education of all children whose parents could not afford to pay themselves. But he was equally convinced that the State should not provide the schools. It would be a sad day for England, he said, when individuals did not rise up to create schools, provided the necessary funds were available. This was the ancient tradition of the independence of the spiritual aphere from the political. We still instinctively apply it to those educational institutions whose origiil lies' before the nineteenth century\u2014^the Universities and the Public Schools. Particularlywith regard to the Universities we plume ourselves on their inde^ pendence of the State, and deprecate the central control of the German Universities from Berlin. But in many quarters it would be regarded as heresy to give a similar independence to our ele mentary or secondary schools. In fact, the grammar schools are rapidly losing their old independence, and the turn of the Public Schools may soon come. Those who complain that universal education, so far from pro ducing an age of sturdy independent thought, has led to an epoch of mass suggestion, should remember that the schools have not thought for themselves. Freedom and independence are guaranteed by free institutions, not less than by free individuals. A hundred years ago Cobbett was touring Europe and preaching Free Trade. He was able to do so because there was a general admiration for English institutions, social and economic. That admiration vanished with the rst World War, and no amount of advertising the \"British Way of Life\" will bring it back. But a genuine step forward in social organisation could recover it. More and more people are asking themselves if there is a way between Scylla and Charybdis. It would be a magnicent fullment of the tendencies of English history for England to realise it in a balanced Threefold Commonwealth. A R E T H E R E T O O M A N Y PEOPLE IN THE WORLD? EHRENFRIED PFEIFFER, M.D. (Hon.) S t a t i s t i c i a n s p o i n t t o t h e f a c t o f t h e i n c r e a s i n g w o r l dpopulation. In spite of the losses through recent wars and subsequent starvation in certain areas, there are far more people living now than at any other period of human history . During the'thirties it was predicted that the population of the United States would increase up to i9^7i then decrease. Now the belief is that the rise may continue. The question is therefore asked whether agricultural production will cope with this increase of peo|^les. 27 26In other words^ there are doubts whether the earth will be able to maintain an adequate food standard in face of such a future. In \"World Population Estimates\" (Report O.I.R. 4192, 1947), the U.S. State Department reported: \"In spite of recent natural and man-made catastrophes^ about 17,000,000 additional inhabitants were added each year during the past decade.\" The United Nations Food and Agricultural Survey even speaks of a world increase of 20 million human beings per year. The world has some 2,500 million people now and in 25 years from now may have 3,000 million. The reasons given for these estimates are rising birth rates, and improvements in sanitation which will lead to a decline of the death rate, particularly in over-populated areas such as India, China, Java, Japan, and even in parts of Europe. It is estimated that in the whole world there are 4,000 million acres of arable land. 1.77 acres per person, therefore, are now available for the production of food and other agricultural supplies. Agricultural authorities say that 2^ acres of land are needed, at the present production level, to feed and clothe one person. Evidently, there is already a deciency of supplies and this deciency will become increasingly severe. The world is facing slow starvation\u2014 this seems to be the outlook. What is the remedy ? One school of thought favours an increase of agricultural production\u2014^that is, the yield per acre. A second stands for increasing the arable surface. A third view is less often mentioned\u2014^namely, that after all the population may not increase above a certain level. We are not thinking here so much of the frequently advised need for birth control as of the fact that during and after wars, in the past, there were abnormal increases which balanced themselves again later on. The picture presented by statistical predictions may seem open to revision if we realize that the period from 1918 to 1939 cannot be considered as \"peace,\" but that the imrest of the peoples still created a \"war\" atmosphere\u2014^as is the case at present (1948)' Over-population existed in the past, too. During the reign of the Roman Emperors there were densely populated areas in Asia Minor, Egypt, North Africa, and Italy, which are now deserted. Metropolises, teeming with inhabitants, are also known now to have existed in long-past centuries. A consideration of history shows that population masses are ever changing, fluctuating, shifting from one area to another, rising and falling. At present, only 12 per cent, of the earth's surfrce is undercultivation, and this is the most Hberal estimate. The intensive agricultural use of the land in relatively densely populated parts ofthe world, in the mountain areas of Switzerland and Norway\u2014yes, e v e n i n p r i m i t i v e l y c u l t i v a t e d r e g i o n s o f C e n t r a l A m e r i c a a n d I n d i a s h o w s t h e p o s s i b i l i t y o f a m o r e e f c i e n t u s e o f t h e s o i l t h a n i s t h e r u l e , f o r i n s t a n c e , i n t h e U n i t e d S t a t e s . T h e r e , m a n y a c r e s h e i d l e , not because of infertility , but because it does not pay to cultivate them, or else because the labour is lacking. Through the fullest appHcation of technology, much land could be brought mto cultivation. Rivers and articial lakes could be used for irrigation, even deserts can be made fertile again, for desert soils are not in herently sterile. The studies of Kiman^ show that even Saharasoils would be productive were it not for the absence of water . Another example of the possibilities in this direction is given by Switzerland and the Tyrol, where people live on steep slopes\u2014areas which, in other countries, are already eroded and depleted.Y ou may ask if it is possible to intensify the cultivation of the arable surface of the earth with conservative methods. We believethat it is, and that world starvation could therefore be overcom^ even with an increased population.

Our economic authorities should at all times realize that the basic necessities require a dif ferent treatment from that applied to the industrial upswing during the last 50 years. In the neglect of this truth we can see one of the , factors which have led to the world food crisis. Since we have industrialization, we have to cope with it. Nothing would be worse or more reactionary than to say\u2014let us go back to the primitive conditions of the old-fashioned rural way of life. But technology and engineering could be applied to increasing the agricultural surface of the earth. Industrialization has brought about centralization, and a massing of people in limited areas. This brings With it, as a consequence, the problem of distribution. A frequent symptom is the decline of the land in the neighbourhood of big cities and manufacturing centres\u2014^not because of a decline in fertility, but because of real estate speculation, of labour problems, or because, as we say, the land has become too expensive for agricultural use. Then, too, the drawing away of man-power from the farm to urban and suburban areas has weakened rural production in the regions near cities. Among the rms dealing in farm supplies, feeding-stuffs and agri cultural machinery, those located at a distance from the cities are better equipped than those near the big centres to ll typical rural needs. Whoever has farmed 120 miles away from New York City, and then moved to within 50 miles, has experienced this difference. He has suffered also from the increasing difculty of obtaining good steady labour, getting carpenters and masons for repair work, and nding a good blacksmith. . The number of people employed in farming has decreased rapidly in the last decades. The gures for the United States are par ticularly alarming. In 1910, 33% of the entire population was connected with agriculture. By 1920 this had fallen to 28%; to 23% in 1930, to 18% in 1940, to 15% in 1945; and now, in 1948, the gure stands at a mere 12%. Some people look upon this development with pride, pointing out that technology has so im proved the mechanization of farming that an increased production has been achieved in spite of dwindling manpower. But if we look at this process through the farmer's eyes, and take account of the tired bodies of those who have to toil 12 hours a day, we are obliged 10 change our point of view. Then we see the failing elds, the clogged drainage ditches, the unkempt hedgerows, the broken 30fences, the neglected buildings. In the United States, which leads the world in productivity to-day , , much land lies idle which could be brought back into production were it not for the expense and the lack of manpower. As it is, a skeleton army is all that is left to hold the fort. War-torn countries might be excluded from this picture, tem porarily at least. But even there more manpower could be used on the land. In spite of starvation, we still see people clinging too much to the devastated cities. Then we see the farm population eager to prot from the \"city slicker ,\" but loath to let him in on the farm itself. From all we have considered so far, it appears that we must formulate our initial question somewhat differently . Instead of a s k i n g o u r s e l v e s w h e t h e r t h e r e a r e t o o m a n y p e o p l e i n t h e w o r l d ,w e a r e r e a l l y f o r c e d t o a s k : A r e t h e r e n o t t o o m a n y p e o p l e m a s s e d in some spots and not enough left in others ? The world food problem has become one of uneven and insufcient distribution. Industrialization and urbanization, if they continue in this direction, cannot but end in absurdity. Decentralization\u2014^not only for social reasons\u2014^but for the s^e of the land, is the urgent demand of the time. The last war , with its ^itmgy in destruction from the air and the atomic bomb, has become a teacher, involuntarily . For security reasons, statesmenand military authorities are urging decentralization. If rural and industrial interests can be so blended that smaller towns and even v i l l a g e s t a k e p a r t i n t h i s p r o c e s s , w h i c h h a s n o w b e g u n , t h e n t h e r ew i l l b e h o p e f o r m o r e a n d b e t t e r f o o d p r o d u c t i o n , a s w e l l a s f o r amore equal distribution of the basic necessities. Over-mdus- trialization can then be avoided.

Much of the unused land in the neighbourhood of large cities could thus be reclaimed. Decentralized home-gardens would enable a large part of the population to grow their own vegetables. Farms and market gardens will still be needed to provide the larger share of food and clothing. It is estimated that about half the world's population lives in tropical and sub-tropical regions. Much can be done to develop these lands for vegetable and other food production. Since only 7 to 10% of the total world land area is under cultivation, not only can this cultivation be intensied, but means can be found to esctend the range of small subsistence gardening. It is easier to bring a small piece of land back into production than to improve a larger area. The \"garden\" style of development should, therefore, be in the foreground. The Swiss have set an example in this regard. There, except for moimtain peaks and barren rocks, every piece of land is used. Every farm has a home garden, and many factory workers live on the edges of farmland and grow vegetables, fruit and potatoes in their own grounds. Sometimes these garden operations are worked into the programme of a larger farm owned by the employing in dustry . A well-known shoe manufacturer has built up his industry in such a rural setting. The workers live on small homesteads. The company owns a large farm and rents them garden plots. One large eld is devoted to these gardens for a period of several years. Then it is taken back into the farm in order to restore its fertility with manure and the routine farm-crop rotation. Finally, it is seeded down to grass and clover . In the meantime another eld is used for the gardens. The gardeners are required to use all garbage and plant refuse for compost, which in turn is restored tothe land. An incentive programme with prizes for the best garden a n d b e s t p r o d u c t s , a n d d e m o n s t r a t i o n s i n a m o d e l g a r d e n , h e l p t o make the whole project a success. At a recent scientic meeting, representatives of the U.S. Department of Agriculture estimated that crop damage caused by^ insects *'has reached an all-time peak of four billion dollars a year in the \u00ab Cf. \"Grow a Garden, And Be Self-Sufficient,\" by E. Pfetffer and E. Wese. Anthroposophic Press, Inc.: New Y ork, Rudolf Sterner Publishing Co.: London, 1942.United States.\u00ae Improved soils could reduce this figure con siderably , for the crop grown on soil decient in trace elements and humus content is more often attacked than are plants grown on rich organic soils.^ A vital part of this whole picture is the problem of wastes. Thorough, nation-wide compost programmes, utihzing all available wastes instead of burning them or otherwise disposing of them, would add considerable amounts of organic fertilizer. The biodynamic method has developed a process by means of which kitchen garbage and weeds can be transformed into good humus earth in a few weeks. In this way it becomes practical to \"stretch\" and enrich the available supplies of manure. These compost and manure mixtures are 5\u00ae% richer in potassium, up to 100% richer in phosphates, and with proper care up to 10 times richer in nitrates, than is fresh cow manure. Since only about 20 to 30% of the entire mixture needs to be manure, important additional sources of organic matter can be made available to help solve the fertilizer problem. Agriculture can cope with the increase of world population.For once the preservation of organic matter has been added to soil conservation and erosion and flood control, we shall see how much hitherto neglected land will be usable, and how much more food can be produced. It will, however , be necessary to change the present distribution of labour. More people need to be employed again in farming. Unless humanity decides to provide in a better way for its basic necessities it will reduce the productivity of the earth, and then the pessimistic outlook of our food experts might come true. This, however, need not happen. Only the conceptof agriculture which has led to the present situation needs to be changed. \u00ae Dr . H. L. Haller and Ruth L.

Hoofs shocked j before their tread re-break and furrow-bed shook at the thmider. They were God's thews and thighs through whom fordone earth dies, and kingdoms arcane rise resurgent under. Oh! how we groomed them well; currycombed; buffed each bell; led them a Neighs like manes tossing ribboned huge chests like polished vats, bellies like barrels. Jingled the bits, and rare jargoned the songbirds there; chimed on the Hampshire air bells from old churches. Rooks would their elms forsake, and in the furrows* wake with delving beaks would make their deft researches. How, in the autumn beam sun-bumished glowed each team, rippled their coats agleam, silkenly biumed, smote earth and overturned stands of tall mustard.Ha! those triumphant days when our great trampling greys, chestnuts and blacks and bays, skewbalds and sorrels, stamped with their splendid stirs they were earth's conquerors : . . . now only silence slurs: Time's reaped their laurels. Yet Time, sweets in its sours holds, nor can take those hours when eyes like liquid flowers looked Trust's reposes; when the great Shires would oft lean from their stance aloft, nuzzling our hands with soft satiny noses. CENTENARIAN A black frost makes the hour forlomer. Leafless the land; the earth's a-cold. Behind the wain, walk I, a mourner, and even the windiest air seems old. Only the wheels rasp: on the iron roadway the iron horseshoe rings. Else all is hushed as nations noiseless before the catafalques of kings. This was no dust that knew disasters. This man was sovereign as are seers. The latest of the old earth-masters, and ageless in his hundred years. A living bestiary, he; a herbal. They come no more now to the land, the wise ones with their ways of slowness: with all oif healing in their hand. He set a hedge; the hedge grew quicker than Other hedges others set. The orchard-trees he pricked thronged thicker with goldener fruit than they could get./ He'd tier a tall rick on a down-top; others would choose the lew; they strained: theirs, half as high, a storm wrenched sideways; but his stood foursquare: his remained. He had not set foot in a dty; nor knew when Time's great acts occurred; nor what had writ the rare and witty since Caxton killed the spoken word. But in the library of Nature he read (who could not read or, write), in their bedarkened earth-bound bindings, the talismanic texts of light. If armies marched by night with noises; if men weighed moons, or trafcked through the ether with their earthly voices, such idle haps he never knew. But what the timber-span in spinneys; on what far hillsides grew what herbs, he knew; he knew the dumb beasts' grammar of silence: and the Spring's rst verbs. . . . Now, what was borrowed, back we render: this shape, to the redeeming dark; of itself, naught now : once a splendour through which the spirit poured its mark. Lower this seal; this* dusty impress, into the jewel-house whence its worth was drawn: put back this Great King's signet: this old intaglio of earth.G O E T H E A N D T H E TWENTIETH CENTURY OWEN BARFIELD Few English people know much of Goethe, and of that fewmost rather dislike him. I make this observation with some condence because it is based on a sort of private Gallup poll which I have been desultorily conducting over the last twenty years. The dislike is not violent, but its roots are deep and it will yield neither to sincere admiration of his greatness, nor to a fond love of his best lyrics. Admiration, even reverence, for a genius is one thing: the taste for a man is another . A taste for Goethe you will certainly nd here and there in England, but you will nd it in small circles wedded to the study of German language and literature rather than among the general reading public. From the point of view of literary criticism this would not matter so much. What makes it important is the fact that Goethe is rarely presented to us as a writer pure and simple. We are to look on him, we are told, rst and foremost as a teacher; and the lesson he teaches is the way to Uve. It is not a First Folio we are invited to admire, but a man. It was so that he himself wished to b e r e g a r d e d , a n d h e h a s h a d h i s w a y ; f o r i t i s s o t h a t h e i s i n f a c t r e g a r d e d b y a U t o w h o m ' h e i s m o s t d e a r . V o i l d . u n h o m m e ! s a i d Napoleon after meeting him. So say all true \"Goetheanists.\" Soalso said Rudolf Steiner. For it was by no means only the scientic work,^ and the all-important way of knowledge and attitude to Nature associated with it, to which Steiner attached importance. Indeed there can have been few men more d e e p l y s t e e p e d i n l o v i n g k n o w l e d g e o f G o e t h e ' s w h o l e w o r kand personahty; and it is a man\u2014not indeed a perfect, but a r e v e r e n d , b u t e m p h a t i c a l l y a n i m i t a h l e m a n \u2014 w h o p u r p o r t s t o b e disclosed, when the author of the Philosophy of Spiritual Actvoity '\"^8 is, however, the only part of Goethe's work whkh has any funtoen^ connection wit Anthroposophy . As it is^ being dealt with elsewhere inthis Annual I omit all further reference to it. 36points (how often in his lectures!) to the author of the Romische Elegien. The reasons for the distaste I have mentioned are fairly clear to me, and I shall begin by trying to state them as clearly and forcibly as I can. What then are the obstacles in the way of some twentieth- century neophyte who seeks in all humility to enter the temple of Goethe and worship at the shrine ? First, we are living in very bad times. In general there are none more propitious for attaching us to the great teachers of humanity:\u2014 Who prop, thou ask^st, in these bad days my mind? .... But it must be confessed that, if it is for comfort in tribulation that we turn to the Weimar of a hundred and fty years ago, we meet with a rather chilling reception. I do not know what sort of reading Wilhelm Meister may make in 1949 in a cellar in Berlin; but both the precept and the example of Goethe for the proper conduct of human life do seem to presuppose, almost as a sine qua nan, at least three good meals a day, an adequate domestic staff to make them appear and disappear, and a comfortable sum coming in, preferably quarterly, of its own accord. Given these together with unbroken physical health, the doctrine is plain to read and not unacceptable. If a man feels very badly indeed that he wants to go to Italy, let him go ! We are to warm both hands before the re of life, to reject no experience it offers and to profit by all. We are to have life\u2014^not some pale and pre- latical Ersatz of the spirit, raised from the seed of renunciation or suffering, but good, rich, fruity human life in the ordinary sense and we ace to have it more abundantly. And then\u2014we are to be at peace with ourselves\u2014heruhigt. If that is impossible for a time, we are, it is true, to acquire strength from dispeace\u2014doch starker in der Unruhe sein. But the last is only obiter. The essence of the doctrine, and all the emphasis of it, is the obligation to live a full, happyi peaceful, active life, transmuting experience ^and, above gllj jo3dul experience\u2014gradually into wisdom. Ripeness is all. I need not labour the obvious. The cry of one of Goethe's English admirers, Matthew Arnold, from the middle (as it seems to us) of the blue lagoon of Victorian security:\u2014 Strong was he, with a spirit free From mists, and sane, and clear ; Clecarer, how much ! than ours\u2014yet we Have a worse course to steerBut we, brought forth and reared in hours Of change, alarm, surprise\u2014 What shelter to grow ripe is ours? What leisure to grow wise ? \u2014^has, to say the least of it, lost nothing of its force three years after the second World War. Disappointed, we will suppose, with the teacher, our imagined neophyte, turns now to the poet. I mean the poet as a poet, the lyric poet pure and simple. And here he is on surer ground. \"The creator of German literature\"\u2014^we are no judges of that. What we do know is, that this man sings, sings, sings. Mignon's Song, the Chorus in Heaven, and the opening scene of the second part of Faust, a score of Lieder , whose settings may well have been almost from childhood a part of the very stuff of his soul\u2014till he learnt German and hardly knew which was the more precious, the melodies of Schubert or the words of Goethe!

We love in her beauty, youthfulness, playfulness, trustfulness, her character, her faults, her caprices, and God knows what all that is indescribable; but we do not love her understanding.\"^ I do not stop to enquire how an educated young woman of to-day will relish these observations of the Master. I only observe that at the point where understanding is ruled out they seem to prefer the frank appetite of Donne to the blend of cool patronage and passionate adoration, with a mild flavouring of zenana, which they will nd if they apply themselves to the study of Goethe's life and writings. So, at all events, they say; and I believe they believe what they say. Lastly, running through the whole succession of Goethe's entanglements, and indeed through his whole life, is that \"x\" which it is so difficult to name without begging the question\u2014^non-a^ch- ment, egotism, the will to self-development, the Renaissance or Faustian appetite for all experience, \"self-culture.\" And this brings us to the gravamen of the charge against him. It is notnew. It was urged, in this cotmtry , both by Carlyle's friend John Sterling and by Tennyson. It is, that at the deep heart's core there lay nothing but that rened yet ruthless egotism, that cool objectication of personal relationships as \"experiences,\" for which lesser men are called bounders. George Santayana, describing Faust (and therefore Goethe^) in his Three Philosophical Poets, put it clearly enough :\u2014 He had regretted in the same way the unhappiness of Gretchen. ... He would continue, if life could last, doing things that, in some respects, he would be obliged to regret; but he would banish that regret easily, in the pursuit of some new interest, and, on the whole, he would not regret having been obliged to regret them. Otherwise, he would not have shared the whole experience of mankind, but missed the important experience of self-accusation and self-recovery.T h i s i s a c r u c i a l p a s s a g e .

I am not addressing them. We others respond rather differently. We are, for instance, willing to believe that, if we had the time and inclination to research into , the break with Lili (for these are matters on which we prefer to form our own opinions), we should easily agree that Goethe was not to blame, or at least that his behaviour was neither mean nor unworthy. What is much harder to stomach is the sound of his voice, at Weimar later, explaining to Eckermann how important it had been for him to have the experience of being betrothed. We can swallow all the, entanglements at a gulp without so much as winking. But the old man's voice, his biography festooned about with Charlottes, Katchens, Minnas, Frederikas, Mariannes and g o o d n e s s k n o w s w h o m a l l , s o l e m n l y t e l l i n g E c k e r m a n n h o w h e h a dbeen working all his life at his own \"ennoblement\" {an meiner V eredelung)\u2014tbis is a somewhat tougher morsel. It is not so much moral comments that spring to our lips as explosions\u2014of the pithy \u00abort which Sir T oby Belch hurled from behind his hedge at the unchecked complacencies of Malvolio. No authentic Anglo-Saxon with the right twinkle in his eye should have much difficulty in disposing of \"self-culture\"\u2014if this i\u00a7 all it is.

I am here, looking on all the time.\" It was not always so. Formerly, if there were conflicting impulses, yet the one which prevailed was felt as the whole self in action. The whole Augustine sinned, and afterwards the whole Augustine repented. The whole Dante loved,.lapsed, and loved again after a different fashion. But for us, in varying degrees, there is the sinner and the one who observes the sinner, the lover and the one who observes the lover. It is not a question of whether it is a good thing or not; it is simply a fact. The only question is, what is the right way for men to deal with it, now that it has come to stay. Naturally it is nowhere more marked than in the sphere of the relation between men and women, for it is there that the experiencing soul behaves in the most surprising and fluctuant way. The device which the i8th century evolved for according recognition'to the experiencing and to the observing soul in the same moment was the whole apparatus of archness and gallantry. Mark their signicant use of the word \"conscious.\" In contemplating Goethe*s attitude to women we should always remember this. It is not simply that he accepted the conventions of his age (though we should not, either, forget that he does in fact belong to a quite remote one, having passed half his life before the French Revolution); he would instinctively feel the reason for, and the tness of them. Outmoded as all that apparatus is to-day, before we dismiss it utterly , we might just ask ourselves whether our own way of meeting the problem is so very much more satisfactory; we detach our selves ftom the little gambols of our souls by calling them \"xations\" and \"transfers\"; they spoke of \"pleasing pain\" and eyes that \"deal delicious death.\" Which is better? You pays your money and you takes your choice! But there is no doubt what Goethe's choice would have been. He looked on the soul as he looked on Nature, as an inexhaustibly rich gift to be accepted with joy and treated with reverence and delicacy. And as with Nature, so with the soul, the problem was to grow more and more fully conscious of it without destroying it in the process. Both our scientists and our men of letters are for the most part indifferent to the destruction, provided they can get on with the consciousness. Witness the popularity of James Joyce. We must also take into account the Germanity, if I may so call it, of Goethe's own soul\u2014^that subtle distinction of colouring andemphasis which is best felt as untranslateableness. Goethe's mother-tongue was one which can still, even to-day, employ the ineffable neuter gender, known also to the Greeks, in speaking of young females (feel the difference between \"I saw her on a Sunday\" and \"Ich sah es an einem Sonntag\") and which at the same time trails about it the faint aroma of a mystical reverence for woman that is as old as Tacitus. He found these things, he did not make them; just as he foimd the social conventions of an age, in which educated young women were appalled at the idea of going out imaccompanied in society (at all events when he reached Weimar) in which adulterous liaisons were nevertheless as common as they are to-day. They were part of the air he breathed as he grew up. The only thing for which he can be accountable to praise or blame is the use he made of them. And in his hands they became that wholly un- translateable ewig-weibliche. Our \"eternal feminine\" has acquired a facetious overtone puts it out of court; and yet Bayard Taylor's rendering of the closing words of Faust: The Woman-Soul leadeth us Upward and on is even more misleading, for it suggests the \"ennobling\" influence of one of Thackeray's heroines, and I do not think that was at all what Goethe had in mind. Woman as a symbol on the one hand of Nature and on the other of the human soul, would be much nearer the mark. Thus Santayana, in relating the words speci cally to Nature, says that the ewig-weibliche was, for Goethe, \"the ideal of something innitely attractive and essentially inexhaustible.\" I nd this a little supercial, for I think there was also the under- lying sense of something more than an allegorical relation, indeed of a real connection, in the foundations of the world, between Eva and the goddess Natura. Moreover , Wom^ (which in this kiiid of context always means young and attractive woman, though in the statistical nature of things there will always be one or two about who are not managing to combine both attributes) has long been a p p r e h e n d e d b y t h e p o e t s a n d m y t h - m a k e r s o f C h r i s t i a n c i v i l i s a t i o nas a symbol of the soul, and of qualities of soul. I tWnk that the ewig-weibliche stood, in Goethe's imagination and feeling, rst for some real woman,' secondlv for Nature, and thirdly for the human ^bout Goethe's relations with women, as recorded and as a whole, there was, underlying the poetic lightness of touch, a note 4343of earnestness and reverence that is unmistakable. It is doubtful whether any of the yoimg ladies suffered any lasting harm, and most of them seem to have nished up by getting happily married. The passing pain was something which Goethe at least shared with them. I fancy if I had been a Frauenzimmer living at about that time, I would not have run very fast to avoid a love-affair with Goethe, even if I could have known in advance how it would end. \"Never,\" wrote Karl Julius Schroer,'^ who was at one time Steiner's teacher, \"was the relationship a frivolous one.\" And he pointed out that in nearly every case, after the passion had waned, it gave place to a lifelong friendship or mutual regard. Symbols they might be tohis imagination, but there was always also a true personal \"meeting\" and much sincere idealism. Thackeray himself could barely have improved in this last respect on some passages from the letters to Charlotte von Stein. And then, if, as I said, the quantity of lyrics all of the same kind is at rst a little overwhelming, it is the quality after all that really counts, and the only reasonable reflection on the matter is, that you cannot have too much of a good thing. After all, we are not obliged to read them all, however good they are. Meanwhile, one of the reasons why it would be worth while growing old and acquiring some leisure is that one would possibly have time to read the whole of the West-Ostliche Divan, instead of merely dipping into it here and there. We should rather look on Goethe's poetry (and I speak now of the w h o l e o f i t ) a s o n e o f t h q a r s e n a l s o f t h e f o r t r e s s o f t h e h u m a n s o u l , now under attack from many different sides, and be thankful for any bit of ammunition or armoury we may nd there. For the soul is the Cinderella of 20th century civilisation.

R e p u t e d i n G o e t h e u n d d i e L t e b e . (Der Kommende T ag A.-G. Verlag., Stuttgart, 1922).It is Goethe's distinction, and his message to us, that he retained throughout his life both this reverence for the soul, which allowed him to surrender to its varium et mutdbile without feeling an ass, and a deep and abiding sense of man's responsibility of self-con sciousness. Only, instead of allowing the consciousness to destroy the soul, he strove to maintain it as a golden thread of self-awareness and self-control passing through all its vicissitudes and growing stronger with the lapse of time and the accumulation of experience. He was in this respect a pioneer, and it is rather our weakness than his if we allow to a few fatuities any substantial weight in the scales on which we weigh the value of \"self-culture\". No doubt he specialised somewhat in one particular brand of sentiment. What is innitely more important is, that the mind which contained as formidable a detached Onlooker as is portrayed in Mephistopheles yet never lost its faculty for simple and reverent feeling, or its sense of the greatness of man. For it is precisely this that we are to-day in such great danger of losing. But is it a danger ? Might it not be rather a good thing ? Do we not owe most of our miseries to this idea, promulgated at the Renaissance and conrmed with acclamation by the Romantics, that man is great? What signs precisely is he showing of it? Si monumentum requiris circumspice\u2014at Guernica, at Warsaw, at Hiroshima, or, for that matter, at almost any bookstall. Is not all this because we have forgotten that man is not great; that only God is great ? Has man in fact any such responsibility to be fully conscious as has been suggested, or indeed any responsibility at all except to be good and obedient ? Questions of this sort are being asked with some force in the 20th century by the sincerest and most devout Christians; they are being asked with uncompromising sincerity and oftdn with great intellectual force; and they are being Hstened to. I thinkthat any substantial revival of Christianity which may occur in the near future is likely to be one which implies this interpretation of history; one, that is to say , which rejects in toto as error thatRenaissance afrmation of the spiritual value of experience which h a s b e e n c a U e d F a u s t i a n , a n d a s b l a s p h e m o u s t h e R o m a n t i c c o n c e p t i o n o f m a n a s a c r e a t i v e b e i n g .

And I doubt if Goethe would have been much more cautious. The theological writers of the 20th century have certain advantages which he lacked. They have seen for themselves whither the postulate that God is to be found only in man may lead in art, literature and society; and in politics how easily individual self-culture degener ates into its national counterpart. And they are pretty sure that man is not the place to look for Him. The subject is clearly not one which can be pursued here at the length it deserves. Two things, however, may be observed. First, that if it be blasphemy to conceive of God as \"in\" man, in the sense of being a part of his nature\u2014some vague aspiration or higher Self \u2014^yet to conceive of Him as \"outside\" man, in the same mode as objects perceived through the senses are \"outside,\" is idolatry. Second, that such words as \"in\" and \"outside,\" \"pantheism\" and \"humanism\" are in such a context war-cries rather than instruments of thought. Through Rudolf Steiner there was revealed the process of that gradual entrusting of the Cosmic Intelligence to man, of wMch the Incarnation of the Word was the central event, and which is the meaning of history. At least either this was so or he- was under a very strange and ingenious delusion. The revelation must speak for itself to those who will be at pains to acquaint themselves with it. It is as remote from the vague evolutionary humanism of the Victorian intellectuals and their poet- manufactured God as it is from the precise, changeless Augustinian thearchy which is more often imagined to-day by the like com bination of moral earnestness with intellectual integrity. None who have once been made aware of that revelation can be in any doubt about the reality of the responsibility of which I spoke earlier in this article or the sense in which it is correct to speak of man as great. Great he is, and greater he must become, for good or evil, and the only effect of his volimtarily denying his own greatness must be to make him permissively and involimtarily great for evil\u2014 as in the case of the Hindu stationmaster who, preferring humihty to responsibility and looking always for immediate gmdance, once telegraphed to his T erminus : Man-eating tiger on up-platforni stop what do? But to return to Goethe and our imaginary neophyte. Let him lay aside all such considerations as I have been advancing and merely proceed, undeterred by the obstacles, to a closer acquaintance with the man. At a certain point he is likely to meet with a startling 46experience. Those obstacles which I began by stressing do not indeed disappear. But they suddenly dwindle in size; so much so as to seem quite irrelevant. The sheer size of Goethe's soul is suddenly impressed on him. If the water is a little brown, it is rather with sheer velocity and force and quantity than with mud. Aloof, self-contained, whole at any moment and seeming at rest in itself, on closer inspection what we were investigating under the impression that it was a brook turns out to be a roaring wall of water, a veritable Niagara. Nor would it be easy to point to any particular somce from which the impression is derived. There is no single production of Goethe's pen\u2014^not even Fatut\u2014^which overwhelms us with an unquestioned sublimity, as do the Divine Comedy, King Lear or Paradise Lost. It is the whole man, the life, character and works taken together, which weigh upon us, the even-balanced soul weathering its own storms, the deep earnestness and reverence apparent beneath whatsoever Leichtfertigkeiten (\"an habitual refer ence to interior truth\" Emerson called it), the wisdom of the head untired and untiring wielded by the ever-youthful heart. No, this is not the kind of strength which would have failed to grapple with a tragic destiny had it been called upon to do so. And, in the eye of God, may that not be perhaps the easier task ? Comfort, success, prosperity and adulation need some handling. Moreover, if Goethe's external life was an easy one by our standards, we may reflect that we have no right to assume that the good life will cdways consist of that drab sacrice punctuated by spasmodic heroism which we have learnt to accept and approve. As a teacher even of a practical way of life, he may yet speak very pertinently , if not to our children, at least to our children's children. For us, mean while, the lesson is, that such a man has in fact existed at all. There is strength to be drawn from the mere contact with his strength. We are reminded that the human soul has indeed the latent power and breadth and universality which are already beginning to be r e q u i r e d o f h e r i n t h e d i s c h a r g e o f r e s p o n s i b i l i t i e s n o w d i m l y s e e nto be \"global\" and in fact cosmic; and that, as the light of art is p u t o u t , s o n e i t h e r i s . d e m o c r a c y w e l l s e r v e d n o r G o d w e l l p r a i s e d by denying her greatness. Aloof? There is some conflict on the point. They say his friends did not nd him so in the end, and his servant, according to Eckermann, adored him. Moreover he stood well with children. Schiller, after their rst meeting, wrote 47\"I beleivcj indeed, he is an egoist in an unusual degree. He has the talent of conquering men, and of binding them by small as well as great attentions: but he always knows how to hold himself free. He makes his existance ben evolently felt but only like a god, without giving himself: this seems to me a consequent and well-planned conduct which is calculated to ensure the highest enjoyment of self- love \" Yet Schiller, a year or two later, loved the man this side idolatry and wrote of him as being \"still more loved as a man than admired as an author.\" Lewes, in his Life, in seeking to answer the charge, admits its wide currency. \"Men might,\" he says, **leam so much from his works had not the notion of his coldness and indiflference disturbed their judgment.\" It cannot be denied that, whatever it may have sigmed to meet Goethe in the flesh, the impression made by the record on posterity (and that is really all that the 20th century can be con cerned with) is very commonly one of aloofness, and of a certain chill, repelling rather than repellent. Waterfalls make all sorts of chuckling and endearing noises, but if you listen attentively to Niagara the predominant refrain of its thunder is Noli me tangere ! \"Goethe,\" said Emerson, in an essay not exactly conspicuous for lack of enthusiasm, \"can never be dear to men. His is not even the devotion to pure truth; but to truth for the sake of culture. He has no aims less large than the conquest of universal nature, of universal truth, to be his portion: a man not to be bribed, nor deceived, nor overawed : of a stoical self-command and self-denial, and having one test for all men\u2014What can yow teach me How unobtrusively judicious is that \"to be his portion ! For- the third time we touch this question as easy to keep on saying as Lord I Lord 1 And yet the spirit that rqared down the Niagara of Goethe*s soul never did become quite \"his\" spirit. For that, by virtue of the paradox at the heart of creation, only befalls those who are most vividly aware that it is not theirs\u2014^that the Lord hath chosen Sion to be an habitation for himself. Then indeed it becomes theirs and, in the mysterious chemistry of the paradox, turns sweet in all the majesty of its strength. This was a consummation which Goeihe never achieved. \"The old Eternal Genius\" (it is Emerson speaking again) \"who built the world has conded himself more to this manthan to any other.\" And yet the colossal soul was somehow not quite a sublime spirit. That Goethe was not doctrinally a Christian is obvious enough, though his early phase of pietism was taken, as he took all else, seriously , and its influence was lifelong; though he attained tothat deep respect for the Christian religion, which he expressed towards the end of Wilhelm Meister. What is more important for literature is a certain Christianising element in the soul, which is o n l y p a r t l y a n d p e r h a p s n o t n e c e s s a r i l y d e p e n d e n t o n d o c t r i n e a t all, and which, as Clutton Brock once pointed out in a brief essay , is detectable in a man's writings more as a kind of subtle flavour than anything else. Perhaps it is something to do with the soul^s most secret attitude to suffering and death.

The two things in Goethe to which Rudolf Steiner continually drew attention were, rst by a long way, his method of knowledge. Goethe's view of the limited value of purely abstract theorising about Nature vfas part of a conception of man's whole relation to Nature which is of religious as well as of scientic importance. Steiner himself taught that the Incarnation was an historical event which reached to the foundations not of human nature alone but of the whole earth; and that since that time, the mind which, in cognition, approaches Nature with imagination and reverence, will nd, not the amorphous deity of the Pantheists, but the Christ Himself in His cosmic aspect. In Goethe's attitude he foimd just such an approach, and it was on the positive value of this that he was con cerned to dwell. For, however it. may have been for Goethe himself, the importance for humanity as a whole of precisely this rare and new thing must far outweigh the question whether he had a right under standing of historical Christianity, of Christian doctrine, or of the Christ Himself in His personal aspect. For these we can look elsewhere. The second thing was that transmutation of experience into wisdom and strength, which has been both admired and criticised as \"self-culture.\" It is, I believe, true that there were no more passionate students of the mass of observations accumulated by the Ptolemaic astronomers than those who had themselves come to accept the Copemican system. The geocentric, but faithful and accmate, data spoke to the heliocentrically thinking reader a lan guage unknown to those who had originally collected them. The outstanding impression which Steiner's work and personality make on thoso acquainted with them is his deep sense of responsibility, of his own responsibility to mankind and, still more, of man's responsi bility to the Universe. I believe that the pain he suffered from his knowledge of the latter, combined with his actual observation of our feebleness and inadequacy, was something which it is im possible for most of us to imagine. Consequently, when he saw in Goethe the rare spectacle of a human soul at least struggling towards something like the fullness of stature which will one day be required of it, if, Christ-lled, it is to carry .the burden of cosmic tensions, his thankfulness far outweighed any questions about the egocentricity of this particular soul. We must remember that he also taught reincarnation. There are remarks scattered here and there which 50suggest that he felt Goethe's limitations sharply enough, but they are so few and far between as to show that he also never considered it was these that mattered. This positive attitude is clearly the only wise one; but since, if you hope to extricate people from error, you must rst do justice to their truth, I have thought t to dwell at some length on the limitations both real and supposed. Rudolf Steiner's life was neither sheltered nor leisured. It was one in which poverty played no inconsiderable part, in which selflessness was at all times para mount, which must have been, at all events in his later years, one of almost uninterrupted suffering. Yet the nger points tranquilly to that other life in Frankfurt, in Strassburg, in Rome, in Weimar. These are bad times for a philosophy of joyous experience; yet it would be surprising indeed if we looked carefully where that nger points and foimd no elixir. G O E T H E A N D B I O L O G Y: AN UNPAID DEBT HERMANN POPPELBAUM, Ph.D. T h e r e - p u b l i c a t i o n o f G o e t h e ' s s c i e n t i c w r i t i n g s , w h i c h i sbound to happen as the world prepares for the bicentenary of his birth, will create a precarious situation for all those who read them carefully. Some will say that it is only for the sake of completeness that they have to be re-published | but others may feel that this can never be a sufcient reason. There are still those who maintain the attitude taken in the second half of the nineteenth century by looking down on the \"scientic dabblings\" of the poet whose creative capacities were so great that they invaded elds which, to put it crudely , were none of his business. They are apt to look upon his excursions into science as we do upon the shing trips of a statesman. But there are now many others who see more than a personal whim in his persistent efforts to develop scientic ideas, and they are alarmed at the prospect of seeing these belittled when Goethe himself attri- 51buted so much value to them. They simply cannot beheve that an* individuality of his stature should have misjudged his own achieve ments to such an embarrassing degree. Refusing therefore to admit that there was something wrong with Goethe, they must conclude that there is something wrong with the current ideas about his scientic efforts. They begin to long for a competent introduction to Goethe's actual achievements in science instead of an apology for his whims. For these seekers, the existence of Rudolf Steiner's commentaries on Goethe's scientic writings is a most welcome discovery. Studying them, they learn to see in Goethe's efforts not only an integral part of his full human stature, but also an impulse of which our scientic age is in great need. The duty to do justice to Goethe then develops into the duty to help convey his legacy to mankind of to-day. The impressive series of Rudolf Steiner's publications on Goethe as a scientist began with a small book called The Theory of Knowledge implicit in Goethe*s W orld Conception, which appeared in 1886,^ and it culminated in the work at the Goetheamun in Domach, whose very name is a challenge to those who belittle Goethe as a scientist. The following essay proposes to give some results of a study of Goethe's scientic writings, pursued through decades with the help of Rudolf Steiner's commentaries. Needless to say that as scientists of our age we can never foster the idea of a \"back to Goethe\" movement in science. And yet there is innitely much to learn from his attitude towards know ledge in general, and knowledge of nature in particular. We can leam to look at denite scientic problems through the eyes of Goethe, as it were; or rather approach the problems posed by science in our age as he approached those of his time. It then appears how large a debt we still owe to Goethe, a debt which is not yet acknowledged, much less paid. One basic experience we owe to Goethe, in whatever eld he touches. It is his almost miraculous sense for reality in observation and thought, his imerring feeling for fair procedure in experimenting, his permanent awarehess against the intrusion of prejudice in the \"assertion\" of an idea. In all these respects he would still be an outstanding model for to-day's science, even if all of his results had to be abandoned as erroneous. Rudolf Steiner accordingly * English Edition, transl. by Olin D. Wannamaker, New Y ork, 1940. 52has put the method of Goethe above all else, and has shown that even the controversial theory of Colour is methodically sound and a prototype of a fair scientic exposition. This sense for reality allowed. Goethe to ascend from the phenomena observed in the inorganic world to the \"primary phenomena\", to be seen only with the eyes of the spirit, of which they are the transient and variable expression. T o estabhsh a primary phenomenon (for instance in the realm of colour) the student needs to train his own sense for reahty to protect him against wanton theorizing. The phenomena are mutually self-explaining 5 they do not need to be explained in terms of phenomena belonging to a different level. Colours, for instance, must explain each other by the manner and conditions in which they appear. It is vain to try to trace them to vibrations which are supposed to \"underlie\" them. The far-reaching consequences of such an attitude for a re-formulation of all laws in physics were anticipated in Rudolf Steiner's rst book, mentioned above (see ch. xv).^ As we pass from the phenomena of physics to the manifestations of life, it becomes stiU more important to acquire a capacity for tracing continuity without falling into abstractions. This is very seldom recognized to-day. In botany and zoology we still speak of \"laws\" which \"govern\" plants and animals, as if this were the same kind of \"lawfulness\" that obtains in physics and chemistry. Here, Goethe can again be our guide, by guarding,us against becoming entranced in speculations and generalisations instead of carefully \"following up\" related manifestations. In the realms of life, things which belong closely to one another may be found far apart. A species of plant, for instance, may belong to another one growing in another coxmtry in an altogether different climate. An organ of one animal may be closely akin to another organ in another animal, although this looks quite different and is endowed with a different function. The ground on whi<\u00b1 organic knowledge can grow must rst be rested from the gripof abstraction. Instead of recognizing abstract laws, we have to trace concrete/orws (types) which create a natural hierarchic system. A s c e n d i n g f r o m s p e c i c s h a p e s t o e v e r m o r e c o m p r e h e n s i v e o n e s , we arrive at the \"archetypal form\" (Urgestalt), which includes aU empirical plant forms and even many potential forms never found to exist \"and yet able to exist.\" , a T o-day, sixty years later, the \"anti-reductionist\" conception gains ground in philosophy. See Krikorian, Naturalism and the Human Sptnt, New York, 1946. 53Thus, while inorganic phenomena can be gathered up in and reduced to \"primal phenomena,\" living individuals and groups can be traced to and evolved from the \"archetype,\" which is the fountain head df their variety and the guarantor of their common character istics at the same time. If we speak, as is often done to-day, of a \"common pattern,\" we miss the essential meaning of the Urgestalt, because we still refer to a fact of mere consciousness ; while Goethe spoke of an actual treasury of potential forms which is manipulated by Nature as a sculptor handles his clay. Rudolf Steiner, when formulating this difference in precise terms, emphasized how momentous a change is involved when science turns ftom man-made collective ideas about Nature, which are employed for gathering up facts for intellectual mastery, to the formative storehouse which Nature herself handles when shaping plants and animals. (The philosopher will certainly say that this difference is known as that between realism and nominalism, and that the two medieval schools of philosophers fought a hard battle over it until nally the nominalists prevailed. But Goethe's archetype requires a realistic interpretation, not a nominalistic one. The Urpflanze is not a conceptual scheme devised by man's intelli gence, but a tool of Nature, handled by her!) It rests with the intelligent student of Goethe's writings to be on guard against nominalism, and to make an effort to seize with the power of imagination the. reality which Nature employs when moulding living forms out of invisible archetypal shapes. He can do so, as Goethe did, by following up the appearance and dis appearance of characteristic form-qualities while a plant is running its course from seed to seedling, from the leafy to the flowering state, into the fructiferous phase and then to the seed again while the body withers away\u2014a. most impressive lesson in continuity I The archetypal plant remains, in a sense, while the phases replace each other; it is the continuity underlying the change. So it is never perceived in fullness unless the student begins to \"see\" it extending through space and time.The \"space^time-continuum\" which the physicist to-day con structs in a laborious effort of abstraction to make his imperceptible ^'physical world\" intelligible, embodies itself visibly in every living being on earth, offering itself to immediate perception by man, if only he strives for \"concretion\" instead of abstraction. The effort to grasp this reality must be ever-renewed. The statement of the result in words may vary considerably. Thosewho like generalities may speak paradoxically of a conceptual entity which is active in the circulation of juices, or, conversely, of a succession of shapes which spring from a conceptual matrix. The main thing is to keep in mind that it is only in human knowledge that the conceptual ingredient of reality can be regarded separately from, and set over against, the perceptual; in Nature tiie two aspects of reality are indissolubly integrated.^ Goethe was not so naive as to assume that he could convey his ' realistic conception of the archetype to his contemporaries without running into a conflict with the Kantians. If he had fostered such a naivette, then his short skirmish with the Kantian in Schiller would have certainly cured him. , He saw quite clearly where he had, to deviate from Kant\u2014^namely, where he claimed the status of a red entity for his Urpflanzey no matter what an educated Kantian might dogmatically hold against him. Goethe could, with a smile, claim that he \"saw the idea with his own eyes\"\u2014with his spirit-eyes obviously; but the smiliug implication here is that the human spirit has eyes! These spirit eyes and their training for actual research are the crux of every effort to understand Goethe's contribution to biology. This point must never be slurred over. It is not fair to him if we try to water down his words about the spiritual visibility of the archetypal plant by calling his language exaggerated, or by attri buting his denite words to his special gift of visualization or symbolization. Rudolf Steiner spent a considerable part of his life- work in showing that Goethe had the capacity of supersensible perception, a capacity which is destined to become the general equipment necessary for future biological research. It is not to be taken as symbolical when Goethe calls the archetypal plant a \"proteus which must not be allowed to escape,\" or when he speaks of the archetype as Tim'ttng \"a generic tenacity with a felicitous pliability ,\" or when he says in another place that some species \"let themselves be lured into producing variations.\" The more we take these descriptions as literal and real, the better it is for our understanding of what is meant. In our age, we cannot imitate Goethe's pictorial language when we refer to the spiritually visible form which penetrates the material organism of living beings. We may, as Rudolf Steiner did, speak of the \"body of formative forces\" which belongs as a necessary \u00ab Rudolf Steiner, The PMlosop}^ of Spiritual Activityy Ch. V.supplement to each kind of living being and can be separated\u2014^in knowledge, not in fact\u2014from the matter which is in its reach. And yet we can again and again refresh our grip on' the reality which Goethe caught in the magnicently simple words with which he begins his little book on the Metamorphosis of Plants: \"Anyone who pays but a little attention to the growth of plants, will soon observe that some of their outer pa^ts sometimes alter and\u2014either wholly or more or less\u2014^pass over into the shape of the neighbouring parts. ...\" Is it not as if the plant world itself spoke of its secret in these lines and in those which follow them, and as if Goethe had merely lent his voice to it ? We might even learn how the archetypal plant lives and breathes in the pulsating form, as it expands and contracts, from feeling how the secret of its breathing reverberates through Goethe's sentendes ! For words can become tools of science just as are scalpels and microscopes, with the important difference that words can restore the reality which other instruments have taken apart. Here is another contribution of Goethe towards a really scientic procedure; we need not only adequate methods of research, but also ways of adequate exposition. Of this he has given a shining example in the Metamorphosis of Plants. One day , perhaps, this little book will become a standard text for all students of life's subtler secrets. There is another debt we owe to Goethe. He was the rst |o steer clear , when developing the image of the archetypal plant, of the danger of a teleological element entering into it. He did not want to interpret the types as the result of divine purposes or as \"thoughts of the creator.\" T o-day , however, we have the neo- Thomist school of philosophy of nature which does exactly what Goethe wanted to avoid; it speaks of the types as thoughts of God, Whose ideas have become manifest in them. Here a distinction which Goethe was careful enough to make is dropped, and mor p h o l o g y i s t h r o w n b a c k u p o n a p r e - G o e t h e a n p h a s e o f i t s d e v e l o p - ment. . -u a a Goethe attempted to do with the living types what he had done with the colours. He arranged them so that they could speak their secret by mutual self-explanation. Their language became so clear and audible that it needed no translation into terms of causes or ends. The type is active within the plant, so it does not need to make it grow and change by an outside impact or cause. The type 56lives also in expansion and contraction, and by its varied interplay with the outside conditions produces form upon form, without any guiding purpose. In the reahn of living forms. Nature is too free to be pushed by causes, and she is too abundant to let herself be tied down by purpose. So the archetypal plant is ave in a realm which teems with interrelated shapes, but where the human- all-too-human ideas of causes and purpose are strangers. If the knowledge of the archetype as initiated by Goethe is to act as a seed which might grow in the biology of the future (he spoke himself of the tree of botany which may freely and cheerfully imfold, but it is true for the whole of biology) it must be kept pure. In order to show what difference it makes for research whether one applies Goethe's view of the reality of the archetype and its derivative types and sub-types, or whether one disregards it, we need refer only to two elds of modem biology which still occupy central positions in research. We mean evolutionism (or history of living shapes), and genetics (or science of heredity). It becomes obvious at once what an important mission could be fullled by a further development of Goethe's contributions to biology in our time. The intense interest in the mutual relations of organic forms as forms leads to the construction of \"natural systems\" for plants and animals to illustrate their morphological kinship. Goethe took great delight in these studies because they shbwed him how his concept of metamorphosis did not apply to the individual organ ism only , but also to larger and smaller groups of forms (the systeimtic categories), which suggested that they themselves were organismsof a higher order . The whole kingdom of plants behaved as if it were one great individual, growing in regular pulsations, expanding and contracting, and coming to a culmination in the most perfect t y p e s o f fl o w e r i n g p l a n t s . L i k e w i s e , t h e a n i m a l o r d e r s , c l a s s e s a n d p h y l a , d u l y a r r a n g e d a c c o r d i n g t o t h e i r m o r p h o l o g i c a l k i n s h i p , g a v et h e p i c t u r e o f a t r e e w h i c h b l o s s o m s i n t h e w a r m - b l o o d e d v e r t e b r a t e s . Y et this arrangement does noty if we apply Goethe's view , represent an historical succession in which the later forms sprang materially from the earlier ones. All forms, the simpler and the more elaborate types, are equally manifestations of the archetype which lives in them all. We are victims of a fallacy if we credit an early and simple form of the past with being the originator of the later and more complicated forms. 57Post-Goethean evolutionism has abandoned Goethe's conception and has proceeded with the construction of lines of descent in which the simpler forms play the part of the ancestors of the more elaborate ones. Rudolf Steiner pointed out (1886) the momentous change entailed in this abandoning of Goethe's original view. \"All forms,\" he wrote, \"result from the type, the rst and the last of them are its manifestations. The type we must use as the foundation of a real science of organics, and not try to deduce the particular animal and plant genera from each other.\" The advent of Darwin's book. The Origin of Species (1859) distracted attention even more from the reality of the types by attributing all transformations to the power of. the struggle for existence which he supposed to end with the survival of the ttest, leaving nothing to the influence of the inherent dierences of the types. All interest became concentrated on the mode of trans formation, as if there were no object which was being transformed. If Goethe's impulse had been more alive than it was at the time of Darwin, it would have been seen that the struggle for existence, wjth the resulting \"adaptations,\" could a(XOimt\u2014if for anything at all\u2014for the change of the actual forms, but never for the char acteristic forms themselves. But by a curious fallacy (the so-called \u00ab*infinifp regress\"), it was assumed that the structure with which the individual entered the struggle for existence was in turn already the result of the ancestor's struggle for existence, and so on back ward to the beginnings of life. In other words, the question. What is it that adapts itself? was answered somewhat facetiously: What adapts itself is the product of previous adaptations. ... It was as if the existence of the concrete organism, which has its character istics and hears them, had fallen into complete oblivion and been replaced by the picture of the cumulative effects of bygone battles for life. During this drift into abstraction Rudolf Steiner raised his warning voice, much as he appreciated the work of Darwin. He wrote (1886): \"How does biology nowadays employ the principle of adaptation and struggle for existence, none of which we want to deny as facts ? People believe that they can deduce the character istics of a certain species from the exterior conditions in which it lived, just as they can deduce for example the increase in tem perature of a body from the sim's rays which strike upon it. They forget completely that the specic characteristics in their demte content can never be proved to result from outer conditions. These 58conditions may have a modifying influence, but a creative cause they are surely not.\" The specic pattern of a type (phylum, class or order), thus constipites a reality in its own right. It should not be \"explained\" by reference to another sphere of hypothetical causes, but ought to be followed up by relating it to other types and sub-types until they all explain each other reciprocally. The tracing of the basic characteristics of a type to the supposed influence of outer con ditions (or rather to events which impinged on the ancestors of its present representatives) is a loss on the explanatory level comparable to that which occurs when we try to \"explain\" a colour from \"undetr lying vibrations.\" Here is the \"reductionist fallacy\" again, to use a modern term. Goethe created the tool for warding it off, long before the situation became as urgent as it is to-day. It is perfectly legitimate, of course, to study the way in which the type becomes modied by a variety of outer circumstances. In this eld most valuable research work has been done in our time. Geographical and climatic variations have been studied all over the globe. Modications and even mutations (sudden hereditary varia tions) have been experimentally produced by the most varied forms of impact. But all these studies revealed only the tenacity of the type of plant or animal used; the responses to outer conditions, striking though they were, never modied the essential plan of organisation; they were always the resppnses of the type to certain influences, never direct effects of mere causes. Between the outer impact and the result, the type has always vigorously asserted its existence. The great changes which the phyla and classes of animals and plants have passed through in the course .of the earth's history cannot be \"explained\" by changes of the surroundings alone. They bear witness to the metamorphoses through which the archetype has passed. They are, therefore, of a rhythmic character, just as is the metamorphosis of the individual. The appearance and disappearance of certain sub-types, their sudden emergence and their ra(iical extinction, their \"announcement\" by forerunners and their occasional \"lingering\" in a few late survivors, give a dramatically vivid picture of the changing destinies of the plant and animal types.^ \"The book 59wrote. Indeed, it does. But only if we read it with the realisation that it is the story of the invisible archetypes of which its text speaks. The other eld of biology to which a Goethean re-casting would be of great importance is genetics (science of heredity). At rst sight, there seems to be no point where such work could begin, as genetics has become so much a matter of statistics and mathematics that the facts of observation almost disappear in a welter of abstract formulations. But if this be true, then the rst task of a Goethean approach is to restore the plain facts about heredity and to :ee them from distracting hypotheses. The most striking and yet also the most common of these facts i s t h e r e a p p e a r a n c e o f t h e p a r e n t a l s h a p e i n t h e p r o g e n y \u2014 o n e c o u l d a l s o s a y , t h e t e m p o r a r y d i s a p p e a r a n c e o f t h e p a r e n t a l s h a p e i n t h e young until they grow up. For it is growth which brings out again the vanished likeness to the parentage. In this general form the phenomenon is the same in plants, animals and man. But the general formulation also makes it evident how closely akin thesecret of heredity is to that of the rhythms of growth. It really belongs to the larger scope of riddles in which the \"invisible type manifests itself. So there should be no doubt as to the possibility of applying here the lessons learnt from Goethe. As they reappear in the next generation, the bodily character i s t i c s e m e r g e i n t h e i r p r e v i o u s , c l o s e l y i n t e r w o v e n a r r a n g e m e n t , e a c h in its proper place.

T h e w h o l e w o n d e r - 60web of the observable shape, in which the individual characteristic is nothing but a mesh, is forgotten. Gregor Mendel's idea of focussing the interest on single character istics, as toey are passed on to another generation, was certainly a stroke of genius and opened the way to systematic experimentation. But this methodical simplication has had the serious consequence of estranging genetics from its original problem and made it into an art of calculation, with gures and symbols very remote from the biological setting in which heredity happens as a process of life. Moreover, the conception of material particles (genes) as \"carriers\" of hereditary characteristics, and of their localisation in toe chromosomes, has further distracted our view from the region to which the phenomenon of heredity belongs. The well- known details of cell-division, and especially the behaviour of the chromatin, went far towards corroborating the gene-idea, and so it could seem as if the essentials of heredity were imderstood. Although it is impossible to give here the whole story pf this flmaking development of a highly abstract theory, we may venture to say that for a Goethean view one thing is obvious. We have here to do with a large-scale substitution of a complicated atomistic system as a causal explanation for &cts which have been torn from their natural setting. It is sliding down to a lower explanatory level, quite similar to that which has occurred in the case of the \"ex planation\" of colour rom vibrations in physics, and also (as wesaid above) in the case of interpreting organic shapes in terms of environmental inuences in Darwinism. Goethe wanted colour phenomena to explain each other. He also made possible an otganic science in which the types were so arranged as to illumine each other and become dedudble from the archetype by mere comparison. In both elds Rudolf Steiner hass h o w n t h e w a y f a r b e y o n d t o e p o i n t w h i c h G o e t h e r e a c h e d . W h y should not we take up the facts of heredity , too, and illumine them b y r e l a t i n g t h e m t o o t h e r p r o b l e m s w h i c h f a l l i n t o t h e s a m e o r b i t ?T h a t i s w h y w e a d v o c a t e h e r e a t r e a t m e n t o f t h e h e r e d i t y p r o b l e m b y i m t r i n g i t U p w i t h t h e o t h e r r i d d l e s o f l i v i n g s h a p e s , t h e i r a p p e a rance and disappearance, their unfoldment and simplication, their variation, their rhythmic behaviour, etc. Such an approach would also make it evident how the estrange ment of genetics from the factual has had to be paid for by auxiliary a s s u m p t i o n s , d e s i g n e d t o r e m o v e e m b a r r a s s i n g d i s c r e p a n c i e s w i t h 61the factual. We mean the hypotheses of gene-linkage, of multiple Actors, lethal factors and the like. The discrepancies, however, came really from the articial rst assumption of Mendel, namely, that characteristics are isolated units and nd their way into the progeny irrespective of others. It also becomes clear that the much-admired chromosome charts, with the genes plotted on them in linear arrangement, cannot shed any light on the essential riddle of the transfer of the shape; for, even if we knew the position of all genes- in all chromosomes, their arrangement is such that it bears no resemblance to the mutual relation of the overt characteristics in the living individual. A glance at a chromosome chart can easily show this. The gene which is thought to determine the shape of the eye may lie in a different chromosome from that which is supposed to cause the colour of the eye; the shape of the head into which the eyes must* t may be traced to a gene located in a third chromosome, etc. The genes are arranged much as are the building blocks in a boy's toy box\u2014^they are quite orderly\u2014but in a quite different pattern from the position they will occupy in the house to be built. The boy must break the rst order, to t the blocks into the second. > Thus, even if the genes are what geneticists believe them to be, we still need the active intervention of the Hving shape (the type, or body of formative forces) to bring the material into due position. For only the total form makes the characteristic into what it is and gives it sense and functional scope. Whichever way we turn it, the archetype, together with the types and sub-types, occupies a role of paramount importance in the scheme of living things. It also proves to be quite active in the experiments with hybrids which have become so famous through Mendel. T wo varieties of peas, when cross-bred, produce \u00bba uniform progeny in the rst generation. In the second, there isa \" s e g r e g a t i o n \" i n w h i c h b o t h g r a n d - p a r e n t a l f o r m s r e a p p e a r a n d also the hybrid form is continued, each of them at a certain constant p e r c e n t a g e . T h e n e w c o m b i n a t i o n s w h i c h a b r e e d e r c a n c h o o s e t o produce from these various categories bring about similar segre gations in denite proportions. We are taught how to gure outthe percentages in terms of genes distributed. But one can also try to view the process as a whole, as Goethe would have done had he known it. Then it appears that the original two types, after a transient interpenetration in the rst lial gener- 62ation, tend to separate again, elastically rebounding from another, as it were, imtil the bulk of the. ever-increasing progeny has reverted to either one or the other. Only a minority continues to waver between the two alternatives, but even their descendants lose half their numbers in each generation because of the continumg tendency to \"revert to type.\" In actual, non-experimental conditions the number of lingering hybrids would soon become negligible. In the end, there would be two true-breeding types again, clearly separated. Each type would have thrown off the other like a foreign body. Besides this impressive self-assertion of the types, the rhythmic cdiaracter of the segregation is the most striking feature in this process. Both observations, however, bring us nearer to seeing how the types really possess that elasticity whicdi they show also when responding to a variety of surroundings. Goethe was certainly right when he credited them with \"a generic tenacity as well as a felicitous pliability.\" The more we keep our eyes on the actual happenings of the realm of life, the more we become convinced that Goethe, by his discovery of the type as Nature's tool, has rendered a tremendous service to biology. There are many other problems, including some which deal with man himself, which do not only allow of, but urgently need, a similar re-casting in the light of Goethe's intentions. We owe it, indeed, to him, to pursue the paths which he has opened. If we do this, we may look forward to much of his scientic legacy which will no doubt be reprinted before long. For we may then read his words without embarrassment, and with a little better conscience. 63GOETHE'S CONCEPT OF \"LIGHT AND DARKNESS\" AND THE SaENCE OF THE FUTURE.

Tlds was an historic conflict on a grand scale and will be remembered more in times to come than it is to-day. If we ap p r e c i a t e t h e h i t h e r t o u n f a t h o m e d v a l u e o f G o e t h e ' s s c i e n t i c o u t l o o k , we shall also not begrudge the accepted school of thought its con tinued triumphs. The underlying problem begins now to emerge in a wider and more human setting. Present-day Physics, the one-sidedness of which has been so candidly described by Eddington and other writers, is threatening mankind not only by the political misuse of its inventions, but by its influence on the whole balance of our life and thought. Until about a century ago, the youthful urge of Science was sustained by W estern m a n ' s d e e p a n d u n c o n s c i o u s b e l i e f i n h i s o w n f a c u l t i e s o f k n o w l e d g e . This was a faith that had its roots in the religious inheritance of Europe, and it sust ained t he rat ionalist s and agnost ics no less t han the avowed believers. In our time it has largely faded. Thought g r o w s a b s t r u s e l y f o r m a l ; c o l d a n d i m p e r s o n a l t e c h n i c a l i t i e s b e c o m e predominant. If the robust materialism of i8th and 19th century Saence has been transcended, along with it we have also lost the self-condent s e c u r i t y o f t h o u ^ t , w h i c h i n t h e c l a s s i c a l t r a d i t i o n w a s a c c e p t e d ,one might say , as an unconscious heritage from Divine soinrces. A 20th century philosopher would not enunciate with the same assurance, \"I think, therefore I am.\" Nor is there any new dis c o v e r y o r t h e o r y , h o w e v e r e p o c h - m a k i n g , w h i c h b y i t s e l f w o u l d 64; restore what has been lost. One thing alone will renew the original j and abs olut e ent hus ias m . M an as a s c ient is t m us t br ing his ownI powers of cognition into the scope of his researches\u2014^not in the sense of mystical introspection or of an abstract epistemology, but by an all-roimd human science, which the developments of recent time have rendered possible. This is the way which Rudolf Steiner, who took his start from a more penetrative study of Goethe's scientic writings, was able then to open out in the later, anthro- posophical phase of his own life-work. Let us consider for example the mathematical faculties with which we apprehend the idea of three-dimensional space. We owe them to the upright carriage and the clear three-dimensionality of I our body . The creative forces of the great universe of space have so fashioned the human body that the indwelling spirit is able to behold the space-creating Ideas and understand all those things' in the universe which belong to the crystal-mineral domain. That this is so, emerges from many details: from the comparative anatomy and dynamics of animal and man, from human embryo- j development and the gradual attainment of upright posture in earlyI childhood, from the structure and function of the organ of balance in the inner ear , and from our knowledge of the inner bodily senses \u2014the sense of balance and the sense of movement. These scientific evidences, together with a modern underst^ding of the geometry of Euclid, reveal how man by his whole bodfly and spiritual con stitution lives in such harmony with the creative Ideas which form the universe of space that he is able consciously to perceive them. In like manner we should nd that all our faculties of Imow- ledge spring from the detailed relationship between the umverse and man. The mathematical approach to Nature is not the only one; we get beyond this Hmitation of scientic method. In the texture of the universe many realms of wisdom interweave, nor is t h e r e r e a s o n t o s u p p o s e t h a t m a n h a s a c c e s s t o o n l y o n e o f t h e s e . Even the growth of mathematics itself in the last century or two bears witness to this manifoldness of the world; the inner logic of the universe is not a one-way road. We. will here deal a little further with one outstanding example\u2014the modem, \"projective\"school of geometry and the new light it throws on the structure of space as such. For we believe that along this way Goethe's intuitive perception, both in the Theory of Colour and in the Metamorphosisof Plants, will not only be vindicated but wiU provide a starting- point for far-feaching scientic developments of the near future. > 65For normal consdonsness it goes without saying \u00b1at the point is the ultimate and indivisible element of space. Thus in geometry all other forms\u2014alines, planes, smfaces and so on\u2014are defined, to begin with, as assemblages of points. Our atomistic approach to Nature is a more outward and realistic version of this geometrical idea of space, which is indeed embodied in the axioms of Euclid. Modem geometry has, however, taken a big step forward in this respect, and though this modern geometry has not yet foimd its way into our understanding of external Nature, it promises to do so in the near future, notably in the elds of research which have been opened out through Rudolf Steiner's work. In effect. Projective Geometry has discovered that the ideal structure of three-dimensional space does not proceed one-sidedly from the point alone but from two opposite entities\u2014and plane\u2014which play a fully equivalent part in the fundamental structure. A simple illustration will serve to show the spatial signicance and mutual polarity of point and plane. Imagine a spherical surface expanding and contracting. At one extreme, it contracts into the central point; at the other, it expands into a plane that disappears into the innite distances of space. We say, a \"plane\" rater than \"innite sphere,\" because as it expands the sphere grows ever flatter, and of necessity when the radius is innite the curvature will vanish altogether; the sphere is then transformed into a plane. Space is thus bounded, as it were, by an innitely distant plane; however, as the measures there prevailing are still spherical in character, we may also refer to this imique \"plane at innity\" as the \"innite sphere\" or ultimate \"periphery\" of space. The process can also be modied so that the nite sphere from which we start, expanding e;:centrically, is transformed into any desired plane, passing through nite space. Thus the polarity of point and plane is really one of expansion and contraction, not only quantitative but qualitative. In this polarity the straight line plays the part of mediator , its formal relations to point and plane being equivalent on either hand. This polar equivalence of point and plane is the well-known \"Principle of Duality\" in projective geo metry; it might perhaps better have been called a Principle of Polarity. The fundamental entities are in fact not two but three\u2014 point, line and plane. I have written elsewhere of the interesting history of this newschool.^ Discovered and developed mainly in the 19th century, it made no little impression on those who learned of its existence. I mention for example Wordsworth and Herbert Spencer. Rudolf Steiner, too, in his student days was overjoyed by what he felt to be a kind of spiritual liberation in this way of thinking about space. In later years he frequently insisted on its importance as a new beginning, also, for the science of external Nature. Notably our ideas of \"part\" and \"whole\" are profoundly changed by the new geometry . Ordinarily we think of a plane, for example, as made up of innitely many points; but we now leam. Vice-versa, to think of a point as made up of innitely many planes. Though in the text-books it is not generally put so radically, the thought- processes of the new geometry signify no less than this. T wo polar aspects interweave. For the one\u2014^to physical consciousness self- evident\u2014the points that lie in a given plane are the infinitely many parts or members of the plane; the plane is whole, greater than any of its parts. For the other\u2014paradoxical as it may seem to begin with\u2014the point is the whole, and the planes that pass throughit are parts or members of the point. We are here learning to do what Dr. Steiner once expressed in the words \"to conceive the extensive intensively and the intensive extensively. Science will take a great step forward when we learn this not only in abstract mathematics but in our vision of external Nature. The late G. H. Hardy , in his \"Mathematician's Apology ,\"\u00ae mentions Projective Geometry among the truly signicant branches of mathematics which are not outwardly useful. While sympathizing with Professor Hardy's idealistic non-utilitarian outlook, we rather look for the saving of outer Science in its growing more akin to the pure mathematician's ideal, than for the essence of pure mathematics in its remoteness from outward use. Of the true character of mathematics and its relation to natural science as a whole, Goethe, t h o u g h a c o n f e s s e d n o n - m a t h e m a t i c i a n , h a d a v e r y c l e a r i d e a . T h ereason why so beautiil and illuminating a discipline as the new geometry has had comparatively httle application Hes in anotherdirection. Namely , the realm of Nature where it appUes has scarcely yet been recognized by science. It is the realm of the \"etheric,\" the realm from which all living entities\u2014plant, animal and man\u2014 and also the , to in footnote 4.Cambridge University Press, 1940.derive their etheric body or formative forces body. (I use the terminology of modem Spiritual Sdence, partly derived from old traditions but renewed in a scientic form by, Dr. Steiner.) If once we leam from his many detailed explanations what the great founder of modem Spiritual Science was referring to as the etheric, and if we imdergo the training\u2014^in morphological thinking above all\u2014which an imaginative study of the new geometry affords, we shall begin to see the kingdoms of Nature with newly opened eyes. Even in her material and sense-perceptible aspect. Nature is not only atomistic in structure. The atomistic, pointwise texture is shot- through by quite another kind, which is to the atom as in pure Geometry the plane is to the point. In this we have an essential key to the morphology of life. The atomistic structure pertains above all to the inorganic world, though even here it does not ex clusively prevail. It is the dual, physical-and-etheric structure of living things\u2014analogous, as we shall find, to the duality of point and plane in geometry\u2014which lifts and lightens the heavy weight and impervious texture of mere earthly matter. The inter-pene tration of the two is life; their sundering is death. We gain a funda mental concept of the essence of living matter, and by this means penetrate ever more deeply into its morphological varieties. This is no vague philosophic vitalism. The atomistic aspect of matter is above all expressed in the forces which are so clearly described in the gravitational and other \"eld-theories\" of Physics. These forces, typically physical, can always be conceived as issuing from point-centres\u2014centres of gravity , electric and magnetic poles and so on. We may accordingly describe them as \"centric forces.\" The etheric forces, on the other hand, belonging as we here contend to the planar aspect of ideal space, may be described as **peripheral'* or *'cosmic.\" Their manifestation in the realm of life is pregnantly described in the introductory chapters of the medical work; written by Rudolf Steiner towards the end of his life in collaboration with Dr. Ita Wegman : \"Observation shews, after all, that the phenomena of life have an altogether different orientation from those that run their course within the lifeless realm. Of the latter we shall be able to say, they reveal that they are subject to forces radiating outward from the essence of material substance, . . . from the relative centre to the periphery. But in the phenomena of life, the material substance appears subject to forces working from without inward ^towards the relative centre. . . . Now it is to the Earth that every earthlysubstance of process owes its outward-radiating forces When it comes to life, it must cease to be a mere portion of the Earth; it leaves its community with the Earth and is gathered up into the forces that ray inward to the Earth from all sides\u2014from beyond the earthly realm. Whenever we see a substance or process imfold in forms of life, we must conceive it to be withdrawing from the forces that work upon it as from the centre of the Earth, and entering the domain of others, which have, not a centre, but a periphery.\"' Bearing in mind that the universal periphery has the character of a plane at innity , we are therefore to conceive forces issuing not from point-centres but from the very opposite\u2014from entities of a planar character. Among'the many points acting as centres of g r a v i t y o n E a r t h t h e r e i s a u n i q u e a n d a r c h e t y p a l o n e \u2014 t h e c e n t r e of the Earth. So too among the many planes of space there is an archetypal one\u2014the \"plane at infinity .\" Such is the structure of the spatial universe to which the Earth belongs. If there be planar entities, sensitive to forces issuing from the celestial periphery , we shall expect them to tend up and outward, even as physical centres of gravity are drawn down towards the centre of the Earth. T o derive from projective geometry the precise idea of the type of space in which the etheric or peripheral forces have their eld of action, howeveri a further step is necessary . Projective geometry leads not immediately to the space of Euclid with its rigid measures o f l e n g t h a n d a n g l e , b u t t o a f r e e r a n d m o r e m o b i l e s p a c e , k n o w n scientically as \"projective for this projective or \"archetypal space,\" as we may ^ it, the rigid three-dimensional s p a c e o f E u c l i d i s d e r i v e d p r e c i s e l y b y a s s u m i n g t h a t t h e r e i s o n e unique plane-the innitely distant plane already mentioned.( W i t h i n t h i s p l a n e w e a l s o h a v e t o a s s u m e t h e p r e s e n c e o f a n i m a g i n -. a r y c i r c l e - a s i t w e r e a n e c h o o f t h e p u r e f o r m o f t h e s p h e r e , c f . p . 6 6 above It is due to this imaginary circle that spherical trigonometry p l a y s s o g r e a t a p a r t i n m a t h e m a t i c a l a s t r o n o m y .

When we derive Euclidean Geometry from the projective point of view, we \u00ae~^^Fundamentals of inerapy\" (London, 1925)- Ch. Ill, p. 27. 69must in other words assume this plane among our Axioms. Now, as in \"archetypal space\" there is the perfect polarity with respect to point and plane, the question will suggest itself: \"Why is there not a type of space, specialized in the polar opposite way to that of Euclid\u2014SL space defined, that is to say, by a unique point, func tioning as \"innitely distant,\" instead of a unique plane ?\" Our answer is: \"There- is indeed, but its relation to ourselves is such that with our normal consciousness we fail to apprehend it.\" Let us propound this, to begin with at any rate, as a working hypothesis; it will apply to a wide eld of research. Space with an innitely distant point (not innitely far away in the physical sense, but ftmctioning as innitely distant) will in effect be the type of space in which \"etheric forces\" work, and we shall look for its formative tendencies above all in the eld of life.^ In such a space the relations of \"inner and outer\" will tend to be the very reverse of what they are in Euclid. The innite will be within and not without. Physical forces, released in ordinary space, tend to lose themselves as their effects expand to the peri phery ; so in this opposite or \"negative\" type of space forces will tend to lose themselves as they approach the centre. We have to think of forces issuing not from centres but from peripheries\u2014 ideally, from planar entities\u2014^and spending themselves as they approach the unique \"point at innity\" of the space in which they work. They will be forces of suction rather than of pressure\u2014of levitation rather than of gravitation. Forces of active buoyancy, we might also call them. There wiU be an untold number of such \"etheric spaces\"\u2014 with their formative activities coming into being and passing away again in the processes of life. Concretely speaking, an etheric space will have its \"innitude within\" where there is anything in the nature of a seed or germinating centre. Seeds are minute, * A fuller description of how this type of space derives from modem Geometry, and also of its relation to the wide range of scientiiic tasks and problems arising out of Rudolf Steiner's work, will, be foimd in the essay by the present writer on \"Physical and Ethereal Spaces,\" published in Anihroposophy Quarterly '(edited by D. N. Dunlop), Vol. VIII, Nos. 3 and 4, 1933. Reference is there made to certain earlier mathematical works (e.g. by Felix Klein, W. K. Clifford, and the late Prof. D. M. Y. Sommen^e), in some of which the possibility of such a space is sug gested. An elementary systematic treatment of this \"negative Euclidean,\" or as he calls it \"polar-Euclidean\" type of geometry is given by the Swiss mathematician Prof. Louis Locher in his text-book, Projektive Geometries published by Orell-Fiissli, Zurich, 1940. Prof. Locher acknowledges his indebtedness to Rudolf Steiner. 70point-like entities. The very notion of a seed suggests a point, and to a lesser extent this applies wherever there is a concentration of germinating power, as in the \"eye\" or growing-point of a plant, and in the last resort in every living cell. The polarities of space are interlocked; point and plane inter change their roles in more than one respect. The concrete objects of physical space are always point-centred bodies; they have then- centres of gravity, etc., from which potential forces ray out. Yet the formation of this space is determined by a unique plane\u2014the innite, all-encompassing sphere. Conversely the real entities- sources of force and activity\u2014in the etheric spaces will be \"peri pheral\" or planar, whilst the formation of such a space as a whole will always be determined by a unique \"innite point\" within. In this idea we have an exact mathematical way of access to the^ spiritual-scientic notion of etheric forces as explained by Rudolf Steiner. Indeed he spoke of them as working in this very way. Thus, in a lecture at the Hague, April, 1922: \"It is as though there were surfaces or planes of force coming inward from the Universe from all sides, drawing near the EarA, and\u2014from without \u2014working plastically upon the different regions that are there over the Earth's surface.\" We cannot study the etheric forces or the etheric body of man, he went on to say , so long as we think only of the Euclidean type of space. We have to think of a space the very opposite of this, taking our start not from a point as 'origin' but from an innite sphere. We can study the etheric body of man only \"when we perceive how it is formed from the entire Universe; when we perceive how from all sides these surfaces or planes of living force are drawing near the Earth, drawing near the human being too, and from without are plastically forming the etheric body.\" We shall now have to recognize two distinct functions of a point-like centre. The Uving function of a point that acts as \"in nitude within\" for an etheric space is radically different from that of a centre of gravity or magnetic pole or other point-like source of physical forces. Its activity wiU be receptive rather than self-* centred\u2014active by virtue of what is around it, not within it. Seen ^th imaginative insight, a seed or germina^g point acts not by ^'irtue of the material amount or form that is centred in it. Such form as has already been achieved tends rather to be blotted out ^d chaoticized in this region. A very interesting example is afforded by the pupation of the 71 .caterpillar, which some' biologists have likened to a kind of second embryo-development. The well-known naturalist, Mr. E. L. Grant Watson, who has often witnessed the metamorphoses of the swallow-tail butterfly, describes it in these words:\u2014^Inside the chrysalis \"a breaking down of tissues is taking place,\" reducing most of the organs of the caterpillar \"to a kind of non-cellular mush.\" Yet at this stage \"the shape and position of the organs of the butterfly are already stamped on the pupa. These marks are on the outsidey and there is nothing yet formed inside to correspond with them. . . . Although there is within the creature nothing but the old body of the larva, which is in process of breaking down, there is on the outside of the pupa the pattern of the perfect insect, with wings, legs, antennae, etc., which are later to be occupied by the as yet unformed organs. ...\" Mr. Grant Watson draws attention to the signicance of these facts, which \"will modify the accepted idea that development takes place always and only from a centre out wards. Invisible forces outside the insect have stamped upon it the shape corresponding to that nal-cause which is inherent in its being.\"\u00ae In an essential germinating centre, therefore, relatively form less matter gives itself up to the inpouring forces, bearing a living archetype of fresh formation. Where there is life, matter resigns itself to the peripheral and cosmic forces, and it will do so the more effectively the less it \"holds its own.\" It is the liquid, watery phase which above dl proves capable of this resignation. Where living water thus resigns itself to the inpouring cosmic forces, the outcome is a process of buoyancy and expansion\u2014^ih a word, what we ex perience as growth. The upward growth of plants is a phenomenon of suction from without rather than pressure from within; the intense pressures which result while overcoming earthly-material resistances are secondary. When Goethe in his Theory of Colour uses the words \"Light and Darkness\" he has in mind ideal entities\u2014not in themselves perceptible\u2014^which come to visible manifestation in the world of colour, including all the grades of black and white. We shalld e s c r i b e a s \" L i g h t \" i n t h i s i d e a l s e n s e t h e e s s e n c e o f t h a t e t h e r e d ^ world where the forces issue from the periphery , and as \"Darkness* the world of matter where the reverse is true. Admittedly, it is not very easy to use* the word \"light** in this sense, for the prevailing = Quoted from the Journal of the Transactions of the Victoria InstituU, Vol. LXX, 1938. 72theories (e.g., the electro-magnetic theory) make hght itself appear as a manifestation of centric forces. It will be found, however, that the origind essence of the light is peripherd, not centric. Goethe*s theory of colour remained a closed book to igth century Physics because the latter aimed at including all the forces of Nature (even the hypotheticd light-bearing ether) in the \"centric** realm. The spatid polarities which it investigated were dways those that work from point to point\u2014from one point-centred pole to anoAer, It had no inkling of the primary and far more qualitative polarity of forces, centric and peripherd respectively. The light that pours in upon the Earth'from cosmic distances and calls forth the life of plants is peripherd in nature. It does not \"shoot** through space ^it is not like the corpuscular bombardments known nowa days as \"cosmic rays.** Matter as sudi is centric; the light in origin is planar and peripherd. The celestid light enveloping the Earth draws the life of plants up and outward with each returning spring and summer. We need to read the phenomena of Nature and we shall nd that this is what they tell. Just as the iron lings reved the presence of the m a g n e t i c e l d , s o w i l l t h e g e s t u r e o f t h e s p r e a d i n g l e a v e s a n d b r a n c h e s reved the character of this ethered eld of light that surges round the Earth. The leaf in its unfoldment, broadly speaking, tends towdds the plane. The myriad leaves that shimmer in the hght- fiUed dr are Uke the organs which the Earth puts forth\u2014organs responding to the buoyant forces from the plane of Heaven. The foliage of plants reveds a formative tendency the very opposite ofthat atomic, pulverizing structure which plays so gredt a part in inorganic matter . Even as matter has the tendency to fdl asunder into atoms, so has the ether-the ided negative of matter-the ten dency to planar texture. This becomes visible where the materidis rdsed and permeated with the etheric formative forces. All Hfe on Earth owes its existence to the green leaves of plants with their afnity to the cosmic light. Dust unto dust, Earth- matfer faUs and crumbles; the- Universe makes compensation in the leaves of plants that spread their buoyant surfaces and drink t h e l i g h t . o f H e a y e n . W h e r e L i g h t a n d D a r k n e s s , o r L i g h t a n d Matter\u2014the centric principle and the peripherd\u2014merge into one- another , matter is lifted into living form, and where they fall apartis death.

The triaxial right-angled cross, which in geometry and analytical mechanics we postulate at will in every point of space, is like the earthly counterpart of a mobile triangle in the celestial plane.\u00ae This archetypal triangle in the innite periphery determines the pure form of space, i.e., the law$ of Euclidean geometry pure and simple; its counterpart 'in the realm of darkness\u2014^the threefold cross in each material centre \u2014^is no less essential to the play of earthly forces. In man, the same polarity is at work as in the great universe. The human trunk and limbs are mainly axial and radial in structure. The head on the other hand is spherical\u2014^liko a minute image of the infinite sphere of Heaven. Even the ideal triangle in the celestial sphere has its tiny image in the three semi-circular canals, the organ of balance in the inner ear. Whatever man does in the earthly-spatial world by virtue of the three-dimensional radial formation of his trunk and limbs, he is at once able to cognize by means of this spherically three-dimensional organ in his head. Thus he is able to think the world of space\u2014^geometrically, architecturally. The correlation is, however, more than formal; it applies also to the forces that are at work in head and limbs. Our head is not only formed peripherally (spherically), but in our thinking activity we live and act within the realm of the peripheral forces\u2014^forces that work \"from without inward.\" Geometrically speaking, the domain of real forces within winch we live when we are thinking is polar to the spatial objects of our thinking. The objects of ordinary thought are physical\u2014that is, of paramountly pointwise form and structure,\u2014 yet in the very act of thinking them we live unconsciously in a planar, in other words, etheric realm. It is as though, whilst we conceive the cube-form of the \"salt of Earth,'* the octahedron- pyramid^ were to arise as a form of light in our head-nature. Y et this does not imply \"inside the skull.\" Inner and outer are inter changed for the etheric spaces. Inside the skull, the space-of-light in which we live as thinkers has at most its goal, or its innitude. Such is the essence of the nerve-organs and the brain: they are the \"innitude within\" towards which the ether-forces of cosmic \u00ab SdentificaUy defined as a self-polar triangle with respect to.the fundamental i m a g i n a r y c i r c l e . ,' The octahedron and the cube are mutuaUy polar forms, ^at the one is in relation to &e pointwise aspect of space, the other is m relation to tne planar, and vice-versa.thinking, pouring in from the wide world-circmnference, are directed. When we conceive a geometrical form we all of us are living even spatially within the self-same archetype; we have our several heads, it is true, and at different places on the Earth; yet in our heads are but the cosmic germinating centres into which the one archetype is sending, as it-were, its fertilizing forces. We are here indicating what wiU prove to be of fundamental signicance for our theory of scientic knowledge. The realm of ethereal light, whose fundamental nature has been explained inthis essay , is unknown to man precisely because as a knower that is, in the exercise of his faculties of cognition\u2014he lives within it and is at one with it. In relation to this world of light the objects o f h i s c o g n i t i o n m u s t a l w a y s b e o f t h e n a t u r e o f d a r k n e s s \u2014 s h a d o w s , or shadow-throwers. In the very act of throwing shadows they light up for his cognition. Just as the sunlight floodmg the clear air is in itself invisible and yet mumines every particle, every dark o b j e c t t h a t c o m e s i n t o i t s w a y a n d b y r e fl e c t i o n t h e n c e a p p e a r s t ous as light, so is the world of essential light imperceptible to us. Wrceptible is the very light within the forces of which we Uve and weave in all our thinking, in aU our conscious perceiving. Sensing and thinking, we feel our way through this sea of Hght until we touch the material, objective darkness; thereat we awaken to consciousness. Y et in its origin the darkness is akin to light ; t h e y a r e \u2014 a s G o e t h e h i m s e l f s u g g e s t e d \u2014 t h e s u n d e r i n g o f a p r i s t i n eU n i t y , a n t e c e d e n t t o a l l t h e p o l a r i t i e s o f s p a c e . T h u s w ^ s e e l i g h t when we awaken to consciousness by the touch of darkness. Dark and material though they be, the objects of sense and thought light up for us in thinking.It is characteristic of the \"exact saence\" of our time that it abandons itself completely to this world of darkness-in effect, to the material, atomistic, pointwise realm.

True, it is imperceptible to our inherited \"objective\" consciousness. In this respect, however, mankind is at the threshold of a far-reaching change. In meditative thinking, we practise the power of thought without reference to outer objects, and as we do so it grows stronger. With thinking thus enhanced, and with ah ever-devoted interest in sur rounding Nature, including all that is revealed by Science, we come to recognize that fuller world in which matter does not only surge from the dark teeming multitudes of atoms but is sustained by forces bearing inward' from the Heavens. In this real world, dark matter with its outward thrust and the in-forming light\u2014dark matter with its downward weight and the upward soaring force of light hold one another in rhythmic balance even in the normal play of Nature, makjng the surface of the Earth the home of man. Even this cosmic balance of the life of Nature is to-day involved; one-sided science and technics threaten not only the equipoise of man^s inner life. The frozen right-angled cross of the space of Euclid prevails most exclusively in the electro-magnetic phenomena of induction; so does the atomistic aspect of the world in the corpuscular electronic rays. In our electrotechmcs we have made very close acquaintance with this hidden realm of the sub-earthly depths. Our equilibrium not only of soul and mind but of out ward culture\u2014even of husbandry and economics\u2014requires us to make acquaintance also with the other realm, the ether-light that has its source in the surrounding Heavens. Alike the mental and spiritual development of modern humanity and the more recent discoveries of science and mathematics indicate this direction.

Thus I was often driven to muse: \"That brow is like a tower. The watchman on the look-out there beholds an army of spirits soaring overhead, yet they are not the angel hosts of Christendom but of Islam.\" And noteworthy was the mouth. It reminded one of the upper jaw of the barbel, with its long beard like strands, which I had so loved to watch as a boy, when it hung back in the clearly running spring water whilst the wavelets rippled over the ghstening stony bed. Suddenly I also imderstood the gleam, now bright, now shadowy, which flowed from those eyes\u2014^the inward alternation of trust and fear. A spirit who is free and yet senses that some terror hangs over him! But what was this poet fearful of?\u2014Lest he be snatched from his native element. Of course by this time I knew who he was, and he had also learnt my name. One day Rilke, who was ten years my senior, sat down suddenly at my table and started to talk of a play which he and I had seen the evening before,\u2014Georg Kaiser's \"From Mom to Midnight.\" The story went that Rilke had already seen it ve times. It was about Salvationists who failed in their duty. We went on to discuss the relationship of the word to deed and doctrine. I told of a friend who had obtained his doctorate in the history of art and then became an ofcer in the Salvation Army. Then the conversation turned upon the war. Rilke recounted how the painter, Kokoshka, who was a personal friend of his, experienced his rst attack in the Dragoons. He had held his hands over his horse's eyes to protect them. When in the coufse of conversation I observed that knowledge affected my poetry productively, he kept silent, and I felt his opposition. It would have appeared indelicate for me to have quoted Goethe's words, \". . . by means of a secret psychological turn, or frame of mind, which would perhaps repay closer study, I believe that I have raised myself to a species of production which in full consciousness brought forth that which even now nds my approval, without maybe my ever being able to swim in the selfsame river again\u2014aye, a frame of mind to which Aristotle and Other prose-writers would ascribe a kind of madness.\" That secret psychological turn had long since been known tome; J had of late found it, made trustworthy by knowledge, in the works of Rudolf Steiner. Wi\u00b1out the exercise of it, I had to say to myself, the creative power of future poets would be bound to dry up or be engulfed by those achievements of technical science which are gaining the upper hand. I held the method which Goethe applied in the metamorphosis of the plants to be an aid in awakening and keeping alive the nascent forces of the soul. It appeared to me that it would also be of benet to Rilke, who at that time often felt deserted by his genius. Naturally I did not suppose that any form of training could ever replace sheer poetry. This was, and re mained, grace. Despite this, the grain of the gods grew, more readily , if all unnoticed, on a eld daily tended by such exercise. Rilke was also one who trained himself\u2014but not in this field of knowledge. In spite of the admiration which can be felt for his poetry, this uncertain quality still clings to it. Thus, for instance, a strange contradiction runs through his work, which touches on the most profound and all-inclusive insight into destiny, the fact of re peated ves on earth. On the one hand it is said of him that he was convinced \"he had once lived in Moscow in a former in- camation\"^ whereas in the Duino Elegies he stresses like an in cantation the once only of fe on earth: ... oh, why have to be human, and, shunning Destiny, long for Destiny ? . . . Not because happiness really exists, that premature prot of imminent loss. Not out of curiosity, not just to practise the heart, that could still be there in laurel. ... But because being here amounts to so much, because all this Here and Now, so fleeting, seems to require us and strangely concerns us. Us the most fleeting of all.

I n t h e G e r m a n , R i l k e i t a h a s e s t h e w o r d o n c e t h r o u g h out this passage.At that time there was annoimced a lecture by Rudolf Steiner on the representation of those qualities in art which are both re vealed to the senses and at the same time supersensible. From my place I had an opportunity of observing Rilke, who sat among the audience, and I almost had to assume that, as commonly happened with him at that time, he did not feel at ease. The next day I met Michael Bauer and other acquaintances in our restaurant. For years I had been most deeply attached to Christian Morgenstem*s staunchest jfriend. In my diary is in scribed this sentence about him : \"Belief in a man is fellow feeling with his higher self.\" The assembled company was just discussing Rudolf Steiner's lecture when Rilke entered. There was a general desire to Know what he thought about it. After some hesitation I was persuaded to go over to him, as he had done to me not long since. Such a return visit, I felt, might be ventured. Without expressing any opinion on Rudolf Steiner's exposition, Rilke began to develop his own ideas on our connection with the supersensible. \"We receive impressions through the senses,\" he said, \"through eye, ear, taste. Between these senses are 'voids,* which are still lled out in the case of primitive peoples, but with us have died.\" And on a paper serviette he drew a circle, which he divided into separate sectors, shading these alternately, so that nally a sort of disc with black cuneiform characters arose. \"It is necessary to render these parts capable of cultivation,** he continued. \"That gives us enough to do.** And he began to speak of Huysman's Symphony of Smells. I rejoined that the new life which needed to be brought to withered faculties should arise at a higher stage\u2014out of the sphere of cognition, not of sentiency\u2014^by means whidh were open to all, and no longer the privilege of a favoured few. Heye I became sensible of that inner opposition once more, and held my peace. Translated hy Rex Racd). PAUL CEZANNE. At the Summer Exhibition of 1936 where, thirty years after C6zanne*s death, more than 180 of Ms pictures were assembled in the Orangery of the Tuileries Gardens in Paris, several mementos were to be seen just inside the entrance: Cezanne*s last palette; 80his rucksack; some illustrated letters to Emile Zola and, in addition, a human skull and a Cupid which he had often drawn or painted. These intimate relics one contemplates with reverent absorption. They are natures mortes, witnessing to the living spirit. The palette had been used by him only two days before his death, when a thimderstorm took him by surprise at his work and brought on the illness which caused his death. The white paint, squeezed from the tube, has the appearance of a butterfly chrysalis, but has become hard and grey; the orange resembles crumbling clay from the wayside; the brightness has faded out of the red; the blue has gone dark; all is lifeless lava-like earth. The visitor's gaze then roves down the vista of picture-hxmg rooms to the most distant room of all, its rear wall lled by Cezanne*s chef d*ceuvre, the giant picture, Les grandes haigneuses. Although unnished, it yet bears the character of completion. The oils are handled like watercolour, so that the predominant hues in this cloud of effulgence\u2014the blues and greens\u2014appear as if created out of their own element, out of water itself. \"Everything is bom out of Water,'* says Thales. \"Everything is bom out of Air,** says Anaximines. But then to the pre-Socratic philosophers of Miletus the elements were still endowed with soul. Beauty, which sprang from Divine Nature, no longer expressed itself architecturally with Cezanne in the same way as it did among the Greeks, but with rhythmic movement; his forms have become at the same time sounds. The picture is rather composed than built, yet conforms none the less strictly to law. The triangular form, characteristic of the marble pediment in the Greek temple, is here, thrust aloft by arboreal power, curved outward and opened toward the top. In the fourteen female gures who, slim like the tree-trunks, are grouped among them, it is more the harmony pf growth than the proportion of limb which is ren dered. Thus we may imagine the sacred grove of an ancient people with its life-cult. Through the trees there gleams a flowing stream, arousing in us a longing to journey to Arcady , for over its liquid surface hangs, in spite of the banks plain to present vision, the sense of a dream of long ago. A painter who is able to set such a picture into an epoch like ours, which looks at things so differently, carries in his eye not merdy the outer picture which is projected upon the retina, but a power of illumination coming out of his inmost nature and reaching back to a remote past. This picture is not thought out by the 81intellect, but is achieved with a degree of profundity which has unfolded only through tireless practice and by slow degrees. It is the same capacity which can be detected in the great dramatists when with imexpected suddenness they lead up to the critical turning point in their tragedies. One senses in this work Mystery elements of pre-Christian times^ and is led back thousands of years. And one feels moved at the thought of that storm which over whelmed Cezanne at his last work. To him, the same elements out of which he created his life's greatest composition, brought death. Next to the palette, with its vestiges of colour, lies the yellowish brown rucksack which accompanied him on his country walks. So eloquent is it that one instinctively visualises the shoulders which bore it. There, too, is the death's head, and one looks for evidence of the use to which Cezanne put it. Its painted replica is to be found \u2014^with two others {Trois tetes de mort)\u2014set upon an oriental rug shewing a pattern of flowers in purple-brown colours of the same size as the sombre eye-sockets. These hollows next to the darkly luminous blossoms, r^e one think of dark whirlpools, sucking in. It is a post-mortem still-life. Against the richness of the fabric the death's heads produce an effect not merely of death but of deathliness, like potentized death, the \"second death\" of which St. Paul speaks, which the risen Christ was able to behold after the Crucixion. Cezanne always returns to this subject. It reaches back into his \"dark period\" when he showed a preference for brown, white and black in his pictures. In 1876 he had already painted une nature morte avec une tete de mort. Even in old age he could not escape from this model. It is related that for v^eeks on end he worked at it for several hours daily from 6 to 10 o'clock in the morning\u2014^as if making his will\u2014changing the colour and the form almost every day. The fact that C6zanne was inclined to paint the same theme for long periods at a stretch was by no means due to a lack of imagin ation, but rather to the inexhaustible depths of his soul. He in dulged in such exercises in no naive sense, like a child which can never have enough of a fairy tale, nor in pious manner, like a saint who immerses himself more and more deeply in prayer, but as an artist seeking for knowledge, who makes of himself and his subject a study. He meditates upon the pictorM motive. Through a strengthening of the soul which he thereby achieved, that inner 82eye was sharpened which is nourished by the blood (and in the case of passionate people undergoes a dimming), whilst the outer eye\u2014^the physical mechanism which gives only lifeless mirror- images\u2014^was vitalized. Cdzanne was thus able, as one of the first, to bring about the transition from the dark epoch of the 19th century to new illumination, a tjrpical process with the foremost painters of that period. In his \"Still-life with the black marble clock\" the darkness of Cezanne's rst epoch nds symptomatic expression. Time seems to stand still, Signicantly, this motive is taken from Zola's room. It was in their early youth that Zola and Cezanne met, and it seemed like fate that the famous painter should depict the famous writer with the look which the latter turned on his time\u2014^with an eye not as yet illuminated from within but radiating an unflinching will for truth. Zola, as portrayed by Cezanne, is the keenly observing investigator and free spirit, the publicist who ghts fanatically for justice. The picture I mean (\"The poet Alexis reading to Zola\") is of the same epoch as the \"StiU-life with the black marble clock,\" painted about 1868. Zola is sitting on a white cushion, himself clad in white. His garments, in spite of their ordinary cut, have a stiange charm. His pose, which sugg^ts collectedness rather than repose, in voluntarily gives rise to the thought: this might have been an Arab. It certainly is of more than artistic signicance that Cezanne paints Zola not upon a stool\u2014like Alexis, who is seen in profile on the left of fhe picture, crouching rather than sitting, with the manuscript in his hand\u2014^but almost at floor level, as if ih a mosque, where neither stools nor benches are to be found. In this room all is bare. Zola, with a concentrated yet open expression, holds his head forward and slightly bent. One hand hangs carelessly down, one knee is tucked under. Thus he appears like a Kadi who has emancipated himself from Allah but has now transferred the will to ght, which formerly employed the sword, to the pen; he appears as the father of naturalism. His head reaches above a threshold at his back, into a very dark and narrow elongated space, cut off at the top. In spite of the abstract effect of the geometrically divided dark and light surfaces, the picture is uncanny, its austerity oppressive. But C6zanne has succeeded in bringing light into the gloom which later on suffocated Zola. It is as if his eye had derived vitality from those senses not yet bereft of their own life, the senses of taste and touch; as if it had converteditself into an organ of life. The geranium blossom with its dull p i n k c a n a l m o s t b e f e l t u p o n t h e l i p s , w h i l s t t h e r o u g h g r e e n s u r f a c e of the leaves almost Myites a caress by the ngertips.

He postulates that the tree of evolution, Darwm's famous tree, is, the great bulk of it, m the super-sensible world, and composed of a material more plastic than any material which our senses can perceive. From time to time, and from place to place, this material mcamates; archetypes are formed. They are the mcamated twigs on the ends of the branches of the unknown Tree of Life. From these, processes of devolution may or may not develop? For example: Man is an archetype, and from him the a p e s h a v e b e e n d e v o l v e d . T h e r e i s v e r y c o n s i d e r a b l e s u p p o r t f o r such an idea from many modem biologists.\" (E. L. Grant Watson: But to What Purpose). \u00a7i O F d r e a m s m d a y s g o n e b y w e h a v e a b u n d a n t r e c o r d . A l l t h eevidence goes to show that they were regarded as havmg signicance. It is unmistakable also that they were naively accepted. Here is a passage from the Crito Socrates : Well, Crito, may it end fortunately. Be it so, if so the gods will. But I do not think that the ship will be here to-day. Crito : Why do you suppose not ? Socrates : I will tell you. I am to die on the day after the ship arrives, am I not? 85Crito : That is what the authorities say. Socrates : Then I do not think that it will come to-day, but to-morrow. I judge from a certain dream which I saw a little while ago in the night: so it seems to be fortunate that you did not wake me. Crito : And what was this dream ? Socrates : A fair and comely woman, clad in white garments, seemed to come to me, and call me and say, \"O Socrates\u2014 'The third day hence shalt thou Crito : What a strange dream, Socrates! Socrates : But its meaning is clear, at least to me, Crito. Crito : Yes, too clear, it seems. In the 37th Chapter of Genesis we are told of Joseph's dream of the sheaves and also of his dream of the sun and moon and stars. In the 40th Chapter, we are told of the butler's dream and the baker's dream. In the 41st Chapter we are told of Pharaoh's dre^ of the kine and of the dream of the ears of corn. If the reader will read these chapters again, he will note not only that the dreams are immensely important facts in the narrative but that they are unquestioningly accepted as authentic and important and com pelling in a way we should never think of accepting them nowadays. In Matthew's Gospel we are told of the dreams of another Joseph:\u2014 \"But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel> of the Lord appeareth in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, saying. Arise and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel: for they are dead that sought the young child's life. And he arose and took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel. But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in the room of his father Herod, he was afraid to go thither; and being warned of God in a dream, he withdrew into the parts of Galilee, and caine and dwelt in a dty called Nazareth: that it might be fullled which was spoken by the prophets, that he should be called a Nazarene.\" In earlier days the objectivity and importance of the dream was not questioned; if there were any questions at all about it, they were exclusively in reference to the interpretation. Decius asks Caesar why he is refusing to go to the senate with him. Caesar replies:\u2014 86\"The cause is in my will: I will not come; That is enough to satisfy the senate. But, for your private satisfaction. Because I love you, I will let you know. Calpumia here, my wife, stays me at home; , She dreamt to-night she saw my statua. Which, like a fountain with an hundred spouts. Did run pure blood; and many lusty Romans Came smiling, and did bathe their hands in it. And these does she apply for warning and portents. And evils imminent; and on her knee Hath begg'd that I will stay at home to-day.\" Decius rejoins:\u2014 \"This dream is aU amiss interpreted; it was a vision fair aqd fortunate: Your statue spouting blood in many pipes. In which so many smiling Romans bathed. Signies that from you great Rome shall suck Reviving blood; and that great men shall press For tinctures, stains, relics, and cognizance. This by Calpumia's dream is signied.\" Our dream world to-day is an extraordinary medley of every thing and nothing; profundity and triviality; past, present and future; order and confusion. Sometimes dreams are evidently a dramatisation of what our senses convey to us while we sleep or of other aspects of our physical life. As a rule they seem to be as irrelevant to the realities of life as the dust is to the hurrying coach. But it is not always like this. Sometimes we dream dreams of staggering signicance. Sometimes we dream dreams of un surpassable greatness and beauty. Kubla Khan was one of Coleridge's \"In Khan A stately Alph, the sacred river, ran Through caverns measureless to man Down to a sunless sea.\" Robert Louis Stevenson tells us that his Brownies gave him the plot of Jekyll and Hyde while he slept. Here is Eckermann telling Goethe a precognitive dream of the kind, we are now sden- tificaUy investigating:\u2014 \"I related a wonderful dream of my boyish years, which was literally illled Ae next mpming. 87'I had/ said I, 'brought up three young linnets, which flew about my chamber and came and settled on my hand as soon as I entered. One day at noon, on my entrance into the chamber , one of the birds flew over me, out of the house. I sought it the whole afternoon, on all the roofs, and was inconsolable when evening came and I had discovered no traces of it. I went to sleep with sad thoughts in my heart, and towards morning I dreamt I was roaming about the neighbouring houses in search of my lost bird. All at once I heard the sound of its voice, and saw it behind the garden of our cottage, upon the roof of a neighbour's house. I called to it, and it approached, moved its wings as if asking for food, but still it could not venture to fly down. I ran through our garden into my chamber , and returned with a. cup of soaked rape-seed. I held the favourite food towards it, and it perched upon my hand. Full of joy , I earned it back into my chamber to the other two. 'I awoke; and, as it was then broad daylight, I quickly put on my clothes, and with the utmost haste ran down t h r o u g h o u r l i t t l e g a r d e n t o t h e h o u s e w h e r e I h a d s e e n t h e bird. The bird was really there ! Everything happened as I had seen it in the dream. I called, it approached, but it hesitated to fly to my hand. I ran back and brought the food, when it flew upon my hand, and I took it back to the o t h e r s ' . \" , On this dream of Eckermann's Goethe makes one of his usual massive comments:\u2014 \"This boyish adventure of yours is certainly very remark able. But there are many such things in nature, though we have not the right key to them. We all walk in mysteries. We do not know what is stirring in the atmosphere ^t surroimds us, nor how it is connected with our own spirit. So much is certain\u2014that at times we can put out the feelers of our soul beyond its bodily limits\"; and a presentiment, an a c t u a l i n s i g h t i n t o t h e i m m e d i a t e f u t u r e , i s a c c o r d e d t o i t . \" A s w e c o n t e m p l a t e t h i s u n e x p l o r e d a n d u n e x p l a i n e d w o r l d o f d r e a m s , t w o s e t s o f q u e s t i o n s c l a m o u r t o b e r e s o l v e d (i) Why do we dream at all ?

H o w h a s i t c o m eabout that we are miraculously able out of ourselves to conjure up 88a make-believe world which is yet so vivid, so detailed, so real that the cleverest biologist may wake up from out of it sweating with fear? What super-Shakespeare is this, lurking somewhere in our depths ? But to-day we have also begun to be aware of another and even more inexplicable quasi-dream phenomenon. Withiu the next few \u00bb years it will no doubt have its Dunne coming forward to investi gate it:\u2014 In \"The Confessions of an Opium Eater,\" De Quincey relates :\u2014 \"I was once told by a near relative of mine, that having in her childhood fallen ^into a river, and being on the very verge of death, but for the assistance which reached her at the last critical moment, she saw in an instant her whole life, clothed in its forgotten incidents, arrayed before her as in a mirror, not successively, but simultaneously; and she had a faculty developed as suddenly for comprehending the whole and every part.\" In his book \"The Marvellous Country; or Three Years in Arizona and New Mexico,\" S. W. Cozzens tells us how in climbing a moimtain in Arizona he stumbled, fell, felt death to be inevitable, but was saved by a projection of rock. He states :\u2014 \"Convinced that death was inevitable I became perfectly reconciled to the thought. My mind comprehended in a moment the acts of a lifetime. Transactions of the most trivial character, circumstances, the remembrance of which had been buried deep in memory's vault for years, stood before me in bold relief; my mind recalled with the rapidity of lightning, and yet retained a distinct impression of every thought.\" Father John Gerard, quoting from his personal diary in \"The Month,\"^ relates how:\u2014 \"Three of us Seminarians, Henry Edwards, John Hamilton * I acknowledge here my indebtedness for accoimts of ^eriences of the life-tableau to an article by Father Herbert Thurston in \"The Month\" (1935)' Since the article here published was written, \"The Observer*'and other papers have printed a letter of mine asking readers who have come very near death to let me know if they have had any such ex perience. Many of those who have kindly written to me deny having seen any panorama of their past life. On the other hand a large number of quite obviously sincere correspondents assert that they have experienced it; what the Rev. G. Kellett Grice says is an example of those which came to me in this way. I should be grateful to any readers of this Annual, who have come near death through drownit^, etc., if they would give me an account of what they experienced in their consciousness.\u2014(A. F.). 89and myself, went skating on Gore's Pond, near Stonyhurst, known to be very deep. . . . Edwards went through the ice in the middle and I, tr3dng to help him, lay down flat and gave him my hand. He pulled me into the hole and I even went under the ice beyond. I well remember the dark grey roof above me with a bright patch a little way off, to which I somehow managed to struggle. I was not then a swimmer. At the moment of leaving the ice for the water there flashed across me, along with the realisation that death was, appar ently, immediately ihevitable, a perfect picture of my past life in every minutest detail. It was not a chronicle of successive events but a picture, or rather a map, which thought instead of sight .perceived\u2014everything was seen simultaneously and everjrthing with equal clearness, yet without any confusion, as an insect may be supposed to see through its compound eyes.\" Harriet Martineau, in her Biographical Sketches,** records the gimilar experience of Admiral Sir Francis Beaufort when he was in imminent danger of being drowned:\u2014 \"My sensations were now of a rather pleasurable cast, partaking of that dull but contented sort of feeling which precedes the sleep produced by fatigue. Though the senses were thus deadened, not so the mind; its activity seemed to be invigorated, in a ratio which dees all description, for thought rose above thought with a rapidity of succession that is not only indescribable, but probably inconceivable by anyone who has not himself been in a similar situation. . . . Thus travelling backwards, every past incident of my life seemed to glance across my recollection in retrograde suc cession; not, however , in^ mere outline, as here stated, but the picture Ued up with every minute and collateral feature. In short, the whole period of my existence seemed to be placed before me in a sort of panoramic review , and each act of it seemed to be accompanied by a consciousness of right or wrong, or by some reflection on its cause or its c o n s e q u e n c e s ; i n d e e d , m a n y t r i fl i n g e v e n t s w h i c h h a d b e e n long forgotten then crowded into my imagination, and with the character of recent familiarity.\" A n e q u a l l y i n t e r e s t i n g s t a t e m e n t w a s m a d e t o t h e P s y c h o l o g i c ^ Society by Stainton Moses, the well-known Editor of \"Light.\" He was at the time of the incident an undergraduate at Oxford\"Many stories are on record as to a phenomenon which precedes death in many cases; I mean the unfolding of the whole panorama of life at the moment of the severance of soul from body. It has chanced me to pass through that experience, and I will endeavour to describe what I felt. I was upset out of a little boat on the Isis ... I recognised fully that I was drowning, but no sort of fear was present to my mind. I did not even regret the feet. By degrees, as it seemed\u2014^though the process must have been instantaneous \u2014I recollected my life. The link was\u2014^Well, I am drowning and this life is done with. It has not been a very long one. . . .' And so the events of it came before my mind, and seemed to shape themselves in outline and move before me. It was not that I thought, but that objective pictures of events seemed to float before me, a moving tableau, as though depicted on the mass of water that weighed upon my eyes.\" The Rev. G. Kellett Grice (Superintendent Minister in the Otley Circuit of the Methodist Church) has kindly allowed me to publish the following account of a personal experience:\u2014 \"Before I entered the Methodist Ministry I was an elementary -school teacher at Sacriston, County Durham. The school was about four miles from my home at Framwell- gate Moor, which is a village on the north road from Durham to Newcastle, about a mile from the former city. I cycled to and from school each day . There are cross-roads near' the Black Boy Inn. Coming from Sacriston to the inn there is a long declivity and normally I put on my cycle brake to take the right-angled turn safely. One evening I was in a hurry and resolved to use gravitation more, and I ran a great risk at that comer. As I roimded the comer at a great pace I saw a speeding motor-car approaching on the wrong side of the road. To save myself I switched left into the hedge, expecting to fall in that direction. For some unaccountable reason I was catapulted into the road, right under the car. Motor bodies in those days were higher from the ground than they are now. (The year was 1904). The car passed over me without hurting me. My only injiuy was on the palm of the right hand which was a bleeding p ^ p . T h e r o a d w a s w e t , a n d I g o t u p b e t w e e n t h e t w o l i n e s made by the motor-tyres, in time enough to read the number of the car, whose occupants were peering backwards at me. 90but with no intention of stopping to see whether I was hurt. Between the saddle and the ground was only a matter of seconds, but in the little fragment of time I saw all my twenty years of life in detail, its ups and downs, its lights and shades, its rights and wrongs, important things and trivial things. It seemed to start from a broken toy in early infancy, and the nal thought was of the grief my mother would feel when my death was reported to her ! \"I cannot now remember all the wealth of detail, but it was marvellous and I have always been ready to believe the psychologists who say that everything we have ever experienced is recorded in the cells of the brain.\" These records come exclusively from some of the very few mortals who have undergone what amounts to a temporary death persons who have been for a moment virtually dead^but then come back to life. The number of such persons who thus come within a hair's breadth of total death must be exceedingly few. Possibly not all of these had any such strange experience as those here re corded ; possibly not all of them were able to recall it if they had it. But there would seem to be in general currency sufcient stories of this experience of a life-tableau to make the fact that it can and does occur incontrovertible. At least it would be worth somebody's while to collect evidence widely. What is the signicance of dreams ? Why were dreams taken in the World of Antiquity in a quite different way from that in which they are taken to-day? What sort of a dream is this life- p a n o r a m a o f w h i c h t h e r e w o u l d s e e m t o b e m a n y a u t h e n t i c a t e drecords ? . . . Let us pass rom the world of dreams into the world of realities ! Let us seek the verdict of science upon these sleep dreams and death-dreams. Do Darwinistic theories of evolution account for them ? If not, is there any alternative theory of evo l u t i o n i n w h i c h t h e y b e c o m e e l u c i d a t e d ? P r e s e n t - d a y p s y c h o l o g i s t s treat dreams in all seriousness, but their attitude towards Aem is a l t o g e t h e r d i f f e r e n t f r o m t h a t o f t h e m e n o f a n t i q u i t y ; w h y i s t h i s ? \u00a72 We used to believe that a Being of Immeasurable Power and Wisdom and Love decreed our creation with the words: \"Let us make man in our image.\" W e once felt we were at the centre of 92things. We thought of ourselves as known by the Cosmos and loved by it. We called the Universe \"Our Father.\" We held up our hands to it in prayer. Modem Science requires us to think otherwise. It indicates a world-whole which is not only indifferent to us but is altogether unaware of us. It insists that neither at the outset nor anywhere along the line was there any prevision of what has actually taken place in evolution nor any intention to bring about the results with which we are familiar. That we exist at all is explained as merely the latest result of a series of \"accidents.\" Astro-physicists are still in debate about the origins of our earth. A hypothesis imtil recently much in favour was that somewhere about 2,000 million years ago another star in our galaxy happened to pass near enough to what was then \"the sun\" to attract out of it the blazing substances which became in due course the planets of our solar system\u2014^among them a planet on which'by a chance the physical conditions were such as to make life as we know it practicable. After some 1,000 million years : at a certain place or at certain places : at a certain moment or at certain moments: conditions occurred which resulted in the formation of special chemical compounds having the property of livingness. Living matter, having been brought forth, somehow maintained itself. It not only maintained itself. It reproduced itself and it evolved. It evolved blindly into many blmd-alleys. It evolved with equal blindness along what the unscientic regard as a uniquely important and specically intended lemur some sort of monkey\u2014some sort of ape\u2014^and finally man. The ftill title of Darwin's great rst book on evolution was : \"The Origin of Species by means of Natural Selection or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life.\" Here in the title are indicated the essentials of Darwin's doctrine. He asked his readers to look at facts on every hand observable in nature : that organisms vary; that features are transmitted tty heredity; that in every environment and at every level of life there is among living organisms competition for survival. He argued convincingly that in the Struggle for Life in any given environment those that survive will be those that possess characteristics giving them in that payticuJar situation some biological advantage over their ^ com- 93petitors; he argued further that those surviving would tend to hand on their helpful qualities to their oFspring. Thinking along these lines he saw every environment mechanically eliminating organisms ill-adapted to it and mechanically bringing into existence organisms that could adapt themselves. This materialistic, mechan istic mode of accounting for what has taken place in evolution was applied more and more comprehensively. Darwin himself brought man into his evolutionary scheme in his \"Descent of Man.\" Dar win's followers out-Darwined Darwin. In the period from 1859 to the present-day we have witnessed the rise of an ofcial biology^ almost universally accepted in universities and schools, which purports to explain man as originating exclusively from blind physical and chemical events. Those who think on these Hnes feel themselves compelled to regard the human being pretty much as they regard an ape or a blade of grass or an atom. Their scientic knowledge makes it unthink able to them that a human being is anything more than a haphazard and temporary assemblage of molecules. That man is uniquely an object of interest to the Cosmos ; that he has' spiritual-moral reahty (apart from his private feelings of self-importance); is not a line of thought that Science, as generally cultivated, is ready to entertain. What Julian Huxley writes in his Foreword to Eileen Mayo's \"Story of Living Things\" (1947) \u00ab typical \"The discoveries of the nineteenth century concerning life rank with those of the seventeenth concerning lifeless matter as the two achievements of science which have had the greatest influence on general thought. \"Galileo and Newton, following on Copernicus and Kepler, nally robbed our earth of its claim to a central position in the universe. At the same time, they introduced us to the idea of universal scientic law, by demonstrating that the behaviour of the moon, the earth and the other planets was due to the same force of gravity that makes a raindrop or a stone fall to the ground. \"So, two centuries later , Darwin, following on Lamarckand fe other great naturalists, comparative anatomists and p h y s i o l o g i s t s w h o p r e c e d e d h i m , n a l l y d e t h r o n e d m a n r o mhis flaim to a unique position as Lord of Creation. At the same time he introduced us to the idea of universal law in biology , by demonstrating that all plants and animals, in cluding tngn himself, share many basic Similarities, and thatthe origin of human species is due to the same general type of agency which is involved in producing a local variety of snail or a new breed of poultry: evolution operates as automatically as gravity.\" Great as were Darwin's discoveries; great as the work of Darwin's disciples have been;\u2014do they account for man? Is man as we actudly know him really explained^ or is he jammed into a theory and made to t it as best he can ? Does Darwinism explain any of man's dreams his irresponsible dreams at night; his rational dreams by day ? . . . I will even dare to ask the audacious question whether the adherents of Darwinism really do themselves believe that their theories account for the sort of thing they inwardly know themselves to be. My own impression is that the Darwinistic account of man is accepted not at all because it is really believed in, but because no alternative to it has emerged. Alfred Russel Wallace came forward with the notion of Natural Selection at the same time as Darwin himself. It is arguable that if Darwin was the greater of the two as an observer, Wallace was the greater as a thinker. However that may be, it is a matter of the deepest interest and importance that W allace never allotted to the principle of Natural Selection more than an exceedingly circum scribed scope in evolution. That evolution in general can be explained along Darwinian lines; that man himself can be accountedfor materiahstically and mechanically , W allace flatly denied. Here are quotations from the last chapter of his book on \"Darwimsm\" : \"The special faculties we have been discussing clearly point to the existence in man of something which he has not derived from his animal progenitors\u2014something which we may best refer to as being of a spiritual essence or nature, capable of progressive development imder favourable con ditions. On the hypothesis of this spiritual nature, super added to the animal nature of man, we are able to understand much that is otherwise mysterious or unintelligible in regard to him, especially the enormous influence of ideas, principles, and beliefs over his whole life and actions. ... These three distinct stages of progress from the inorganic world of matter and motion up to man, point clearly to an unseen universe\u2014 to a world of spirit, to which the world of matter is altogether subordinate. . . . And still more surely can we refer to it those progressive manifestations of Life in the vegetable, the animal, and man\u2014which we may classify as unconscious.conscious, and intellectual life,\u2014and which probably depend upon different degrees of spiritual influx. ... As contrasted wi\u00b1 this hopeful and soul-deadening belief, we, who accept the existence of a spiritual world, can look upon the universe as a grand consistent whole adapted in all its parts to the development of spiritual beings capable of indenite life and perfectibility. \"To us, the whole purpose, the only raison d'etre of the world\u2014^with all its complexities of physical structure, with\" its grand geological progress, the slow evolution of the vegetable and animal l^gdoms, and the ultimate appearance of man\u2014was the development of the human spirit in associa tion with the human body. . . . We thus nd that the Darwinian theory, even when carried out to its extreme logical conclusion, not only does not oppose, but lends a decided support to, a belief in the spiritual nature of man. It shows us how man's body may have been developed from that of ^ lower animal form under the law of natural selection; but it also teaches us that we possess intellectual and moral faculties which could not have been so developed, but must have had another origin; and for this origin we can only nd an adequate cause in the unseen universe of Spirit.\" Wallace saw the possibility of a Greater Darwinism. His suggestion of \"spiritual influxes\" wiU one day be recogmsed as the apercu of a great thinker. Evolutionary theory has in the rst post-Darwinian phase succumbed to the materialistic mood of modern science; it is almost a department of physics. In the next phase there is every reason to believe it will shake off materialism and mechanism and take up these altogether iliore hopeful sug gestions of Darwin's great fellow-worker. \u00a73 Dr. Steiner was from the rst to last an evolutionist. He knew Haeckel personally; he differed from him radically; but he saw how much greater Haeckel was than most of his critics; and he wrote a book in defence of Haeckel where the reader will nd fully recognised everjrthing that is great and true in Darwinism. In two several standard editions of the Natural Scientic works of Goethe which he edited. Dr. Steiner had occasion to comment multitu- dinuously upon the views of the great pre-Darwinian apostle of evolution. In a 200-page chapter called \"Man and the Evolution 96of the World\" in his \"Outline of Occult Science,\". Steiner sums up his views. In a hundred various lecture-courses and books, in relation'to different branches of science and culture, he elaborates them. The enquiring reader will in all probability have heard that Steiner claims to base his views of evolution upon clairvoyant vision. But. perhaps he will be well-advised\u2014^at first, at any rate to ignore this question of the sources of Steiner's account and give his attention exclusively to what Steiner actually states. Let him be content to ask himself whether what Steiner has to say explains the known facts more satisfactorily than they are explained by Darwin and the Darwinians. What I bring forward for the purposes of this article is only a hint of Steiner's account of things. The reader must say to himself that in numberless connexions and contexts he can look for conrmations in Steiner's published works. \"And God said, *Let us make man in our image and in our likeness'.\" Steiner postulates Man Himself, as a supersensible being, brooding (as it were) over the entire evolutionary process. Man Potential stands at its beginning; Man as We know him to-day struggles amid material conditions for self-realisation; one day there will be Man Actualised. ^ The Fiat of God is for the making of a free being. Man origin ates in the supersensible. That he may become self-dependent and morally responsible, he is thrust down into the darkness of matter. His evolution is carried forward to a certain point\u2014^from without, as it were\u2014by Spiritual Beings. From that point he is required to take increasing responsibility for his own evolution. The disciples of Darwin see animals brought forward mech- ^ ahically,\u2014specialised to this or that form by the requirements of a particular environment,\u2014some of them in the same sort of meaning less way mechanised up to that improved ape called a \"human being.\" Steiner sees an evolutionary process pregnant with Man. The Cosmos, with man in mind, set itself to the perfecting upon earth of a physical mechanism suitable for the needs of self-con sciousness and freedom of will. The animals are the di^ecta mewhra of the advance to the human form. When he had prepared the necessary apparatus for existence under physical conditions, mgn took possession of it. Evolution became henceforward man's own responsibility. The great myths of mankind represent poetically man's wide spread ancient knowledge of his cosmic origins. Adam and Eve 97are driven out of Paradise. Persephone is snatched from Demeter into the Lower World. The Gods vanish in the twilight The Divine Spiritual World remains always in the background:\u2014 man is required to live for threescore years and ten under material conditions, is then drawn back for a long interval into the super sensible, then thrust once more into the outer darkness; for seven , or eight hours out of every twenty-four, he is drawn back into his true environment for spiritual rejuvenation. Keeping its hold upon man by means of death and sleep, the Spiritual World thrusts him more and more forcibly as ages pass into the sense-perceptible. jIt progressively withdraws its control and superwsion. Man upon ^ earth increasingly loses consciousness of his spiritual origins and connexions. i Pre-historic man \"clairvoyantly\" knew himself to be a member of a Spiritual Universe. He was aware within and without himself of the working and weaving of Spiritual Beings. His consciousness was rich with colour-lled images of their activity. Awake and asleep, he dreamed. But by night he had a thicker sort of dream than he had by day. Ancient History represents to us a man who is losing connexion with the Spiritual World. He retains vivid memories of that Higher World to which he knows still he belongs ; but it is now only imder special conditions that he can directly experience it. Greek for ever met Greek in battle, but all Greeks alike consulted the oracle at Delphi. Through the prophets God still spoke to the people of Israel. In the mystery-centres in all the early civilisations, highly- developed human beings underwent special training that they might become spiritually receptive. And in what was in those days still a quite natural manner\u2014during the time in^each day when they were shut off from the newly-dawning sense-world\u2014human beings were still able to receive revelations from the Higher World in their dreams. How does Tng\" stand in the world to-day ? In the hght of what Steiner has to say about evolution, how shall we see oiuselves ? What is our present-day thinking ? What are our dreams ? What is that strange life-panorama to which witness is borne by an occasional traveller back from the undiscovered country ? Into what are we evolving ? What are our possibilities ? How can we m a k e t h e m o s t o f t h e m ? . / We were once altogether dream-stuff; we were lled with the working and weaving of spiritual reality;\u2014but from within our- 98selves we were inactive. We were not yet an \"1.\" To-day the Higher World no longer pours into us its imaginative, creative dream-revelations. Our consciousness nowadays consists only of lifeless reflections of the dream-self activity in the dead matter of the brain. But these abstract thoughts exercise no compulsion upon us. We can pick and choose among them. We are enabled to be morally free. No longer ht up by Cosmic Light from without, we are granted the evolutionary possibility of lighting up a Light Within. In the background of our being lurks the ancient dream-self. It awaits resurrection. It awaits an evolutionary transmutation; here and there aie persons under sentence of death who have caught a glimpse of it in its entirety, freed from its physical prison in the body. For the most part our dreams in sleep are merely a pathetic remnant of this ancient self; but sometimes they become magical with divination of the pr^ent and promise of the future. The genius is a person who has already discovered how to. dream by day. If we consider persistently what conscious memory signies; if we learn to look upon ourselves not as a momentary embodiment in matter and space but as a continuing, developing entity; we can begin to know ourselves as that time-dream self which we funda mentally are. What does evolution now require of us ? What is morality at this jimcture in the history of mankind ? T o all such questions the anthroposophical account of things offers a dear and positive answer . In times gone by we were the dream of Spiritual Beings; to-day we are required to dream dreams of our own. We are such stuff as dreams are made on; our sub-consdous self is a sea of imaginative, creative forces; our task is to effectualise these forces into consdous willed activity. . We were once unfree and clairvoyant; these times represent a moment in which, in order to gain our freedom, we have become undairvoyant; the demand is made upon us out .of our freedom to become clairvoyant again. \" \u00a74 Steiner is not particularly concerned to offer mankind a new Weltanschauung. What he aims at is to bring each one of us to the point where we can generate our own views of things. As we study Anthroposophy, we nd, for indubitable fact, that we bear dormant within us a second Dreaming Self. And we come 99to ask ourselves insistently how we can let these imaginatiye creative forces become effectual in our lives. The problem of problems for every fully awakened human being is : \"How can I enable this Dreamer within me to dream his dreams upon the stage of my everyday existence ?\" Negatively stated^ the problem is how to cease being so in terested in our present self\u2014so excited about it, so satisfied with it. Unless we can overthrow the existing regime, how can we place a new ruler upon the throne ? It is extraordinarily difcult. It calls for the utmost exertion of one's forces. We are so completely identied with our present notions, ways, interests, aims, that it is at rst virtually impossible for us to catch even a fleeting glance of what we look like in the eyes of the Cosmos. We will not even dare to attempt to look. We are lled with fear that if we be^ to see ourselves as we truly are, we shall not be able to avoid taking u p t h a t f u r t h e r f e a r f u l t a s k o f c e a s i n g t o b e w h a t i s n o w o u r s e l v e s . . . ' . Steiner urges us to spend every morning at least ve heroic minutes in the effort to know ourselves. 'He urges us to undertake every night a retrospect of the course of the previous day's activities, going through them, item by item, in reverse. He tells us that \"the occultist has no preference for his own opinion,\" and urges us to cultivate the habit of listening without any comment, conscious or u n c o n s c i o u s , w h e t h e r o f a s s e n t o r d i s s e n t , u p o n w h a t i s s a i d t o u s b yother people Such exercises may seem simple, even trivial, to the reader. He will not regard them as simple or trivial if he tries to do them. Done heroically and done persistently\u2014if necessary , over many years\u2014^they will have their effect.Let us now go further . Let us make the supposition that we a r e w i l l i n g t o e f f a c e o u r p r e s e n t s e l v e s . H o w s h a l l w e e n a b l e t h e Dreamer to dream his dreams within us?

Then let us imagine a human being placed beside this plant. Let us now say to ourselves that he has qualities which make him higher than the plant. We dwell on the fact that he is able to move here and there according to his desires, while the plant is forced to remain stationary. 'But now let us also say:\u2014\"Yes, the man certainly seems to be greater than the plant. Y et I nd in him imperfections which force me to think of him as lower. He is lled with desires and passions. Whereas the plant follows the pure laws of growth from leaf to leaf and the blossom opens passionless to the rays of the sun. I can see that man possesses a certain perfection beyond that of the plant; but I see also that he has paid for this perfection by admitting into his being lower inclinations and desires.\" Let us then call to mind the green sap flowing through the plant and think of it as an ex pression of the pure and passionless law of growth to which the plant adheres. Let us also call to mind the red blood coursing through the veins of the man, recognising in it an expression of man's instincts, passions and desires. Let us call up vivid pictures of the pure green sap on the one hand and of the impure red blood on the other hand; not only thinking these things but feeling them deeply. 'Let us now go on to say to ourselves that man is able to purify his inclinations and passions by means of higher soul faculties. Let us think and feel how thereby these inclinations and passions may be bom again on a higher plane. We can now think of a blood t h a t e x p r e s s e s t h e s e p u r i fl e d p a s s i o n s a n d d e s i r e s . 'We gaze in spirit upon the rose and say to ourselves\"In the r e d s a p o f t h e r o s e i s t h e e r s t w h i l e g r e e n s a p o f t h e p l a n t . T h e r e d rose follows the same pure passionless law of growth,as did the g r e e n l e a f .

We can experience a sensation of liberating bhss if we think of the red rose as the symbol of the puried red blood which has become the carrier of pure inner experiences. 'Let us nally transmute these thoughts and feelings into a symbolical concept. Let us picture a black cross. Let this be the s y m b o l o f t h e l o w e r d e s i r e s a n d p a s s i o n s w h i c h h a v e b e e n p u t d o w n . Let us imaginej at the point where the arms of the cross intersect, seven red roses in a circle. Let these roses be the symbol of a blood which expresses cleansed passions and desires. Let us call up- this symbolical concept in our soul-r-excluding all else con centrating mind and heart upon the life-lled image.* T o undertake such a meditation is to encourage the conscious, willed activity of one's sleeping inner forces of imagination and creativeness. Whoever does it day after day , year after year, .with heroic intensity and persistence, will nd himself entering into -that new kind of dreaming which will characterise the new sort of human being.

One of Rudolf Steiner's great gifts to our time is a description of Inspiration as a distinct, comprehensible process. The human j 102 Iconsciousness is capable of intensifying its delicacy of perception, its clarity and orderliness, and its impregnation by conscience, until it rises beyond its ordinary limits and shares in experiences which can be so clothed in earthly language that they nourish whole civilisations. The development of Inspiration in this sense is part of a way of Initiation described in great detail by Rudolf Steiner as having been followed during almost all periods of our history\u2014 with certain signicant variations. Many objections are brought against this view. Here we can consider\u2014very briefly\u2014only those brought from a traditional Christian standpoint. There has been much discussion of the relation of the Gospels to the Mystery rehgions of their time; and , on the whole, critics have come to emphasise how very different the religion of the Gospels is from that of the Mysteries. Has, then, the idea of Initiation\u2014in the Mystery sense\u2014any place in Chris tianity at all? It should be remembered that the critics are discussing the Mysteries from outside; while the ancient writers who defend the Mysteries constantly emphasise that the impression of them gained by those who have not passed through the essential experiences is misleading. Only in oiu: time have we a description of Mystery experiences/row mthin in terms completely intelligible to the healthy human understanding in ordinary consciousness\u2014^through the work of Rudolf Steiner; and on the relation of these experiences to Christianity his witness should be heard. We nd that on the one hand his description of the Mysteries throws a flood of light upon the origin, the form, and the right reading of the Gospels; and on the* other , that he regards the coniing of Christ as bringing about an entire change in the human situation, which transforms fundamentally at the same time the place of the Mysteries in man's life. A crucial example of this view is to be found in his treatment of the story of Lazarus in St. John's Gospel. For the historical critics, this story is surrounded by many difculties. T o begin with, it appears as a miracle particularly inaccessible for our ordinary understanding: the raising to life of a man' more than three days dead. If it occurred\u2014as a con s p i c u o u s p u b l i c e v e n t , h a s t e n i n g o n t h e e n m i t y a g a i n s t J e s u s w h i c h led to His trial and crucifixion\u2014^why is it recorded only in the Fourth Gospel ? And in the detads of the story are many hard 103things : the apparent heartlessness of the delay in going to Bethany \u2014in order, it seems, that the miracle should be more astonishing; the long conversations with Martha and Mary; and Jesus' tears. Often commentators have been driven to the conclusion that the whole story is allegorical. Such a conclusion ts easily into that view of the Fourth Gospel which regarded it as a late mystical writing without much pretension to historical value. But in recent years external evidence has brought the date of the Fourth Gospel back with reasonable' certainty to about icq a.d., and has shown how widely it was accepted within a short time. And that school of criticism\u2014always relatively strong in England\u2014which takes the Fourth Gospel seriously as a source of knowledge about historic fact, has grown in condence and influence. Dr. William Temple pointed to the chronological framework for the ministry, given only in the Fourth Gospel, and to grounds for preferring its account, where this appears to contradict the rst three Gospels; and to the fact that the writer's whole theology implies that he is describing real earthly happenings. \"It is no doubt true,\" Dr. Temple writes, \"that St.''John selects his chosen events for record because of their signicance; but it is essential for his purpose that the signicant occasion should also be an event. If the whole story is a myth, its quality as revelation is destroyed. The Gospel is that *the Word was made flesh' and being incarnate so spoke, so acted, so died and so rose from death. , It is not the mere occurrence of its several episodes that constitutes the Gospel; it is their spiritual and eternal signicance; but part of their spiritual and eternal signicance is their physical and tem poral occurrence. For it is\" the whole world, inclusive of matter\u2014 of flesh and blood\u2014which God so loved that He gave His only begotten Son. It is then vital to St. John's purpose that the events which he records should be actual events. We can be quite sure that he never consciously wrote what he did not believe to be fact; he is not a constructor of allegories.\" (Readings in St. JohrCs Gospel, page xiii). ,f It appears then to be in flagrant contradiction with the intention of the Gospel, if we do not take the raising of Lazarus as an actual event. And we have evidence that the Gospel came from a res- r peered source at a time when many were living who had had long and intimate contact with the Apostles\u2014^whether any of the Apostles themselves survived or not. It was a time when a critical faculty towards facts and documents was very much alive\u2014^much more 104alive than later, during the early Middle Ages. (Most of the 19th century criticisms of the Gospels can be foimd already either in the Primitive Fathers themselves, or in their quotations from opponents of Christianity). Thus, as in many other matters, research brings us back to the original, ftmdamental difculties. It is the same with New Testament study as a whole. The gentle Teacher found by 19th century students in the Gospels did at least have a place in their whole world picture. But the Christ Jesus with mighty cosmic claims about His own being, whom we now know to be the only Jesus of whom we have any evidence at all\u2014how can He be seen within the pictures of the nature of our world that the man in the street tries to make\u2014or gives up trying to make\u2014^to-day ? In the single example of the Lazarus story we can see\u2014and try to interpret in detail\u2014^the kind of answer Rudolf Steiner gives. He says\u2014^in one of his earlier ftmdamental writings, \"Christianity as Mystical Fact,\"\u2014that the raising of Lazarus is an account of an Initiation which stands at the transition between the pre-Christian Mysteries and the Mysteries as they were to become through the effects of the deed of Christ. Others have suggested that the raising of Lazarus involves an Initiation, or the acquisition by Lazarus of a special consciousness,\u2014Browning, for example, in his poem \"An Episde.\" But Rudolf Steiner is tmique, I believe, in pointing to the raising of Lazarus as evidence of this great historic change. In Initiation it is necessary to transform a part of man's being that can be influenced by his ordinary consciousness only with great difculty. T o one aspect of this we refer when we speak of a person's \"temperament\"\u2014to another, when we speak of his \"vitality.\" The sum of those forces, through which the physical body of man is immediately shaped and enlivened, up to the moment of death, Rudolf Steiner called the \"Life-Body,\" or \"Body of Formative Forces\" or \"Etheric Body.\" All these terms he re garded as more or less misleading in themselves; only through approaching such an idea from many different sides can it live in us with adequate richness and clarity . This \"etheric body\" is largely given up during ordinary life to the work of bearing the memories, the abilities, and the habits that t us for the external world. In Initiation it is necessary that it receive a deep impress from the forces of a soul given up to the spiritual world; and in ancient times this was achieved by a tem porary , but far-reaching, detachment of the etheric body from the k 1 0 5physical\u2014a. \"death\" from which the pupil was called back by his Imtiator. Through this detaching of his life-organism, he had then become a citizen of the spiritual world, as we t ourselves to become citizens of earth through our childhood and education. In accordance with a native rhjrlhm of the life-body, this death-like condition had to last about three days. By its composition, the Fourth Gospel prepares us to see that the' raising of Lazarus is a deed of Initiation by Christ Himself. The preceding \"Sign\", the sixth, is the healing of the man bom blind. Through his healing, this man is able to stand before the hostile council of priests, and bear witness about his Healer. Then Lazarus is raised\u2014\"for the glory of the Son of God.\" Jesus waits for the Initiation process to be completed, in order that the one called back from the grave may be capable of a witness grounded on citizenship in the spiritual world. Why, then, is so much said about Martha and Mary? Here Rudolf Steiner does not give, in his published work, a direct answer. But materials for an answer can be found from many sources. In an ancient Initiation, the elements out of which man's being is composed were represented by those who served the Mysteries\u2014so that the pupil could be surrounded, as it were, by the actors in the drama of his own soul. Martha and Mary are intimate feUow- disdples, with Lazaras, of Christ Jesus. They are also bearers of contrasted qualities of soul. In St. Luke's Gospel this contrast is shown very drastically, between Martha's concern with external tasks and Mary's quiet will to listen. Now in the story of Lazarus the difference between them is indicated more subtly; but again, Martha lives in observation and action, Mary in personal feeling. Lazarus, looking on these two, could see in them elements of his own self. And now, at the crisis of Initiation, how will they support what has to be fullled ? We see here something of the great transition between the ancient and the new Mysteries. In the new Mysteries the whole earth becomes T emple; the hidden tragedy and triumph of the pupil begin to become external fact. A man's own friends begin tobecome for him, though they may know little of it, the terrible and wonderful actors in the ceremony of his Initiation. How much can Martha and Mary realise, what bridge of ages it is, across which they are being led ? Martha comes rst to Jesus, can receive the word of Resurrection, and can speak of her own faith and know- zedledge. ^ Mary, when she comes followed by the mourners, seems more deeply sunk in personal sorrow. There is a difference, difcult to render in English, between Mary's rst words and those of Martha; Mary's words could be rendered, slightly over-em- K phasising this difference, \"Lord if Thou hadst been here, I would not have lost my brother\"\u2014and no compensating word of faith, as with Martha, only lamentation. But at the tomb itself it is Martha who is overwhelmed by the consciousness of the process of physical death: \"Lord, by this time he stinketh, for he has been dead four days.\" At this point, I we nd in the Greek text an extraordinary example of \"Johannine irony.\" Why do we read, before these words, in the English versions: \"Martha, the sister of him that was dead, saith imto Him. . . \"? Does the writer of the Fourth Gospel, who weighs every syllable, think^ that at this point we might have forgotten who Martha is ? The word used here, and here only, for \"of him that was dead\" means literally, \"of him that had run his course\" or \"had ! reached the goal.\" The writer of the Fourth Gospel never elsewhere uses this word in the sense of dying, and it is very rare in the whole New Testament. The passage can mean, quite faithfully to the original, \"there saith to him the sister of the per fected one, Martha, 'Lord, already he stinketh. . . The ! earthly consciousness fails so utterly to penetrate through the veil of ruin and corruption to the process of perfecting man's living being. (It is as if later Mary brings redress for her sister's word when she pours the ointment upon the feet of Jesus; \"and the house was lled with the fragrance of, the ointment.\") The disciples, too, have received a preparation, that they might Share with understanding in the deed that is coming; and fey too fail, at the time, to grasp the iU sense of this preparation. They had listened to the words of Jesus, in which he spoke of Himself as both Door and Shepherd\u2014both standing where the earthly world m^ets the spiritual, and leading men across this threshold. But they cannot take in this sovereign power of His; and when the news comes of Lazarhs's sickness, they are very puzzled. Jesus tells them that this sickness is for the revelation of the Son of God; and then, in great enigmatic words, that it is for the ^ enkindling of an inner light. \"Are there not twelve hours in the day ? If any man walk in the day , he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world; but if any man walk in the night, 107he stumbleth, because the light is not in him.\" We would ordinarily saybecause he has no light with him. But here it is a question of awakening the Sun-power within man. For the time of greatest spiritual darkness, of the betrayial of Jesus by Judas, and the Crucixion, one disciple is to be prepared, that he may not stumble.Lazarus is to bring into the night, the clarity and condence of ^y; into the day , the healing power of sleep. Jesus tells the disciples now that Lazarus is sleeping, in order that they may understand that this \"death\" has the power of refreshment, only in much greater degree, that sleep ordinarily has for us. But the disciples cantT iinIr only of the negative aspect of death : Thomas says, ' Let us also go, that we may die with him.\" T o that act, at which Initiation is brought from the secrecy of the T emples into everyday life, the sisters and the disciples bring minds clouded by sorrow and anxiety . There are also present the mourners rom Jerusalem, who seem to be quite trivial spectators. F r o m t h i s s i d e w e c a n p e r h a p s a p p r o a c h t h e s t r a n g e , t r a g i c w o r d s of the Gospel about the emotion of Jesus. The word translated in the Authorised Version \"He groaned in the spirit,\" in the origind stem warning. (Moffatt: He chafein spirit\"). Trivially expressed\u2014the task of the made immeasurably more difcult, because those who smround t h e g r a v e b r i n g t h e i r u n c o n t r o l l e d e m o t i o n a n d t h e i r c o n j e c t u r e s to this most holy act. The word used of Mary and the mourners is really \"wailing,\" but.of Jesus, \"weeping.\" T ears can mean a strengthening of the \"I\" at a turning point of its destmy , not a weakening of our power over the soul, as when we cry oirt. nHis Manhood Jesus gives the example of calling upon fe Father w h e n H e f u l l s a g r e a t t a s k ; a n d i t i i s e x p U d t l y s a i d t h a t H e f a n k s the Father in order that those who stand by may understand. For what then is Lazarus called forth from the grave, loosed f r o m t h e g r a v e c l o t h e s , a n d l e t g o h i s w a y ? I t i s a n o t h e r o f f e m y s t e r i e s o f t h e N e w T e s t a m e n t \u2014 w h a t b e c a m e o f L a z a r u s ?

It is a great deal because of these misunderstandings that the concept of an Initiate seems to have no place in Christian thought\u2014for neither attitude is consistent with Christian social relationships. Is there any third possibility? Only that the Initiate should exercise on his environment an influence which leaves his fellow- men free\u2014which does not depend for its effect on his Initiate claims, but has the kind of authority which any wise and loving advice may have; that those who receive it recognise in it the speech of their own truest being. Exercising this influence, he need not, and ordinarily will not, refer directly to his own Initiation. But what he says can be tested by the healthy judgment of his hearers ; some will reject it, because it contradicts a prejudice to which they are attached; but some will feel that it springs from a realm in which they also share, though less consciously\u2014their real home in the spirit. We should expect such an influence, in a very high degree, from one who received Initiation from Christ Jesus Himself. And Rudolf Steiner's account fulls this expectation; for he says that \"Lazarus\" was in fact the writer of the Fourth Gospel, known to tradition as \"John.\" The Fourth Gospel itself never names any other John than the Baptist\u2014while the first three Gospels give lists of the T welve which include John the son of Zebedee, and refer to him on other occasions as well. The Fourth Gospel, after the raising of Lazarus, speaks several times of \"the disciple whom Jesus loves\"\u2014and at the end of chapter 21 it is said \"this is the disciple which testieth of these things, and wrote these things; and we know that his testimony is true.\" Of no named person, except Martha, Mary , and Lazarus, is it said that Jesus loved them; that it is said, must indicate a very s p e c i a l r e l a t i o n s h i p o f J e s u s t o t h e o n e c o n c e r n e d \u2014 s i n c e H i s l o v e streamed out to all who truly came to Him. If we identify \"the d i s c i p l e w h o m J e s u s l o v e d \" w i t h \" L a z a r u s , \" e n d l e s s l i g h t i s t h r o w n on the relationship of the Fourth Gospel to the other Gospels. And as a rst result we gain an answer to the question \"Why do theo t h e r G o s p e l s n o t m e n t i o n t h e r a i s i n g o f L a z a r u s ? \" D r T e m p l e c o m e s n e a r t o t h i s w h e n h e c o n j e c t u r e s \u2014 w i t h o u t being entirely satisfied with the suggestion\u2014that Peter , as the in structor of Mark, may have had a reason for omitting the story: 109\"For if Lazarus was still alive, to tell his story in public preaching might cause him grave inconvenience, if not ridicule and per secution.\" .There was a much stronger reason to hold back the description of a Mystery act, of which the one concerned alone knew the full significance\u2014and which, bluntly related, would give him an authority that might render others unfree, against his will. From the scattered traditions, it does seem as if John, for many years, remained very much in the 'background, while James \"the brother of the Lord,\" Peter, and Paul, were the principal architects of the Church in Judaea and beyond. But though Peter ^d Paul certainly , and perhaps also James, influenced the one or other of the rst three Evangelists, it is not at all impossible that they also had a certain guidance from John himself. For he is in a very special sense the witness about Christ Jesus. The other Gospels really imply his witness in order that what they describe may be intelligible, as Dr. Temple and others have pointed out. They are preparations for the most intimate record, given from the con sciousness of the one'whose head rests against the heart of Christ. Rudolf Sterner has described in the most illuminating way the difference in consciousness between the rst three Evangelists and the Fourth. \"What meets us in St. John*s Gospel, could depend only upon the research of the Initiate, who could rise to Inspired and Intuitive knowledge. What we nd in the other Gospels could depend on the reports of Imaginative, clairvoyant men, who could not yet themselves reach the Inspired and Intuitive world.\" These three terms\u2014Imagination, Inspiration and Intuition\u2014are of course used in the exact sense, which has already been touched on here in the case of Inspiration. Imagination is described by Rudolf Steiner as a means of knowledge through living pictures, inwardly experienced when our powers of thinking, and of observing o u r o w n t h o u g h t p r o c e s s , a r e s o i n t e n s i e d t h a t t h e y a r e f r e e d f r o m dependence upon the physical brain. This condition is as much abovT our ordinary state of consciousness as the life of dream is below it. But Imagination is akin to dream in its symbolic character. And with the help of Imagination alone, man cannot nd his way within the spiritual world. He has indeed manifold spiritud experiences; but he cannot determine their relative value and their place in the whole world-order. \"Without, knowledge through Tnspiration the Imaginative world would remain likeawri^g atwtu^ one gazes being able to . . Imaginationleads the pupil of spirit-knowledge to feel perceived impressions no longer as external qualities of Beings, but to recognise them as the manifestations of soul and spirit. Inspiration leads him further into the inner nature of Beings. Through it he imderstands what these Beings are to one another; while in Intuition he penetrates into their very selves\" (Rudolf Steiner, The Outline of Occult Science). We may perhaps compare Imagination to the kind of knowledge of human beings an artist could obtain by watching a group of people attentively, with their characteristic choice of clothes, their movements and the play of expression on their faces i Inspiration with that gained by long and intimate conversations with them, in which each described his life and his intentions ; and Intuition with the comprehension won through selfless love, in a shared work. The Imaginative character, in this sense, ot the rst three Gospels is shown by their richness in parables. The content of these parables\u2014^for example those which deal with judgment in Matthew, or those of forgiveness in Luke\u2014are not exhausted by any in tellectual interpretation. They are, as it were, dream-experiences of human history, but in the intensied wakefulness of the artist's consciousness. The Prodigal Son is not simply an anecdote with a moral\u2014^it is a vision of the destiny of man, squandering upon earth his heavenly heritage. Luke can relate it, because his Imagin ative capacity is sufcient for him to receive and imderstand this part of the teaching of Christ. As he says of himself, he is \"aut- optes\" an eye-witness, or better, \"self-seer,\" possessed oT inde pendent inner sight\u2014^and the servant, not the possessor, of the Word, which comes through Inspiration. The transition from Imagination to Inspiration is one from abxmdance and bliss to poverty and pain. For the Imaginative riches must be blotted out, must be sacriced, before the greater and more delicate faculty of soul can develop. It is, of course, a vital distinction whether the soul empties itself of content after having achieved the strength and intensity of imaginative vision\u2014or whether it does so in the ordinary consciousness, as in some methods of seeking \"Guidance,\" or as may be done by mediums. Without a far-reaching training of mind and character, the soul may be helpless before powers that seek to invade and misuse the instrument they find at their disposal, disguising their real nature\u2014the \"devils\" that nd the \"house swept and garnished.\" Only through a disdple- ahip, in which his devotion to the good powers of the world has no IIIbeen thoroughly tested, does the pupil come in a right way to the threshold of Inspiration\u2014offering there all that he has so far gained. In the Gospels, a real, historic example of this way of poverty is given\u2014^the way from Galilee to Judaea. \"Go to Galilee to become rich, to Judaea to become wise\" was the advice of ancient Jewish tradition. The wealth of Galilee was not only physical; the grace of nature, the mixture of peoples, the less austere interpretation of the Law, all supported a consciousness more favourable to the Imaginative power than the bleak earnestness of Judaea. Thus we nH that the Gospels which contain many parables, are those that deal particularly with the- events in Galilee. But in the Fourth Gospel, there are really no parables in this sense at all, no \"dream- stories\" ; where a kind of picture language is used, it is used in quite a different way. And St. John is more concerned with the events in Judaea, than those in Galilee, though he gives of these certain great examples. This tremendous difference of emphasis has led many critics to doubt the truth of St. John's account altogether. The long, harsh-seeming controversies of Jesus with the Jews, which occupy the greater part of chapters V-X, have repelled many. The Gospels themselves make clear how unwilling the disciples were themselves to go this way, and how puzzling their Master became for them. The \"disciple whom Jesus loved\" must have made the greatest efforts to go with Him the way of impoverishment and sacrice. For the Christ, this was the sacrice of cosmic majesty and power, the emptying of Himself unto the experience of human need and death; for the disciple, the sacrice of the whole Imaginative wealth of ancient times, to sit as spiritual beggar covered with sores, at . the threshold. Thus Luke could Imaginatively describe the con dition of the true disciple; and for this reason perhaps John could use the name Lazarus for himself at that point of his disdpleship. And as Lazarus in the parable dies\u2014^the beloved disciple has also to experience how humanity appears, seen from beyond the \"great gulf\"; and to return to be^ witness before a world that rejects again and again the messengers of the Spirit\u2014^as Dives asks Lazarus to return. But there is still the question\u2014why, if Initiation is essentially a Christian reality , and one that is taken by the Christ Jesus out of the privacy of the Mysteries on to the open stage of history , does Johnveil the story at all\u2014enough, in fact, for much of its meaning to be seen hardly at all through two thousand years ? It belongs to the destiny of mankind that the Gospels were originally given much more to the dreaming heart, than to the conscious tmderstanding of mankind. How deeply the heart imder- stood, the works of artists right from the Catacombs to the Re naissance\u2014most perfectly, scenes from the Gospel of St. Luke \u2014bear witness. Certain events from St. John's Gospel, too, have been wonder fully represented in pictures\u2014among them the raising of Lazarus itself; this appears in the Catacombs, in connections which show howits signicance was felt. But men's experience of St. John's Gospel was continually leading them, though they could often not apprehend this dearly; b^ond pictures. Again and again it was felt as the Gospel of the future of mankind, which also helped the individual to lift up his heart towards his own future destiny. In our time, it was necessary that the intellect of mgn should tear the Gospels to fragments. But the living Imagination of man, beholding the sickness of our dvilisation, must leam in poverty and need to honour the greater powers of knowledge, through which alone Resurrection, which is the heart of Christianity , can be won for our consdous understanding. %W H AT I S A H E A LT H Y SOCIETY? C H A R L E S W AT E R M A N I F s e v e r a l d o c t o r s e x a m i n e t h e s a m e m a n , t h e y w i l l a g r e e r o u g h l yon his general state of health. They recognise certain conditions which the human body must full in order to be healthy. The political doctors who take the pulse of societies have no such agreed standard. In Western Europe, for example, freedom of thought is regarded as a sign of social health; in Eastern Europe it calls for a p u r g e . Is it possible, perhaps, to nd some more objective standard of social health ? Can we say of a typical modem society (more or less industrialised, fairly well educated, not Far Eastem) that it must have certain features\u2014conform broadly to a certain pattern \u2014^if it is to be healthy ? I believe we can; but of course it will all depend on what we mean by \"healthy\" in this social sense. And before we can talk about that we must know what we mean by ordinary human health. The doctor denes health in terms of function and perform ance. The body must function harmoniously and be capable of normal exertions. But this criterion applies equally to animals: for human health it is not quite enough. Human health must meet also the demands of human consciousness, the activities of the spirit; and between them and the. animal health of the body there is a certain antagonism. Obviously not a complete antagonism; a body which is un healthy in the medical sense may cloud or obstmct the spirit. A better word than antagonism is polarity\u20142i balance, a tension\u2014and to understand this polarity we must turn to Rudolf Steiner's con ception of the threefold structure of the human organism.He perceived in the human organism (for him it was not theorising) three interwoven systems i he called them the nerves-and-senses system, the blood-and-breathing (or rhythmic) system.and the metabolic-limb system, concerned with nutrition and\u00abthe movement of the limbs. The nerves-and-senses system is the basis of consciousness; we perceive the outer world through the senses and are most conscious in the head, the centre of the \"upper man.\" At the metabolic pole, in the realm of the \"lower man,\" we are unconscious. Normally, the metabolic processes of the body go on without our being aware of them; we are unconscious also of the processes which set our limbs in motion. The rhythmic system\u2014in which we are dimly conscious, half-aware of our breathing and the beating of our hearts \u2014^mediates between the upper and the lower man. So the three systems are associated with three degrees of con sciousness, from the clear through the dim to the unconscious dark. And also with three soul-powers: the nerves-and-senses system is the basis of thinking, or cognition; the rhythmic system of the ebb and flow of feeling; the metabolic system, of conation, the action of the will. Now, if clear human consciousness\u2014conscious thinking and the distinctively human ego-consciousness, or consciousness of self\u2014is to nd room in the organism, the life-promoting activities of the lower man have to be held back, kept to their own sphere. Not absolutely: the head has to be nourished with blood. But the head consists chiefly of bone and nerve substance : not very much metabolism goes on there. The brain is relatively lifeless; it has no power of regeneration after injury. The head is like a cave, washed but not invaded by the surging sea of life; and it is just because the head is thus withdrawn, a bony cavity where life is weak, that consciousness can light up within it. If the life-forces of the lower man were to invade the head, we should be as unconscious there as Ve are in the- metabolic system. If the head-forces were to invade and master the metabolic system, its life-sustaining activities would be petried. The rhythmic system prevents these invasions. It is a regulating system (Rudolf Steiner always said the heart was not a pump, in the crude, mechanical sense, but a regulator of the circulation), designed to check any tendency bf the head-forces or of the metabolic forces towards excess. For both tendencies are always active, and both are essential for human living; but if one or other gains temporary dominance, illness results. So the rhythmic system may be regarded as a source of healing; it is constantly correcting a constant tendency/ towards illness. And health consists precisely in this regulation: this tension between the form-giving forces of the head system, which press back the life-forces and so clear a space for conscious ness, and the life-giving forces of the metaboUc system, which noiuish the body but would extinguish consciousness if they were allowed. The true picture is not of health at one pole and disease at the other, but of death-forces and life-forces radiating from the two poles, and in the midst the healing rhythm of blood and breathing which maintains human health. Usually, health is pictured as an idyllic condition of which one might have more and more, with illness and dea^ thrust away as aUen, unnatural intruders. This is a false picture; to wish to have nothing to do with illness, and as little as possible to do with death, is really a wish to escape from an essential element in human hving. It is Uke wanting to live only in spring and summer, and rejecting the fall of the leaf. The true picture is of health arising from the healing process which holds in balance the two extremes. Those to whom Rudolf Steiner's conception of the threefold human organism seems strange, perhaps fantostic, may yet discern some psychological truth, perhaps, in this picture of human health. For human living, in all its aspects, has this came characteristic : it is a perpetual adventure between precipices,. a constant wrestle with those \"pairs of opposites\" whose dynamic interplay makes up the context.of our life. And it is no use looking for some haven where the struggle will cease. Unless man constantly wins back lost ground he will be swept over one precipice or the other . But without the struggle he could not hve at all* for its rival energies are his own. His holding of the balance is a constantly repeated healing of the illness from which his flesh is never wholly free. So much for human health. Now we must gain some idea of what social health is to mean. We could apply , as before, a sort of medical test and say that a society will not be healthy unless it functions with a certain efciency; it must be a going concent, reasonably prosperous, orderly and secure. But that, again, is not enough. For the raison d'etre of a society is human hving; a h e a l t h y s o c i e t y m u s t b e o n e i n w h i c h h u m a n n e e d s , p h y s i c a l , s o c i a land spiritual, are not starved or crushed. Hence we might expect t h e p a t t e r n o f a h e a l t h y s o c i e t y t o h a v e s o m e r e l a t i o n t o t h e p a t t e r n of a healthy human organism; for without some such correspondence, some element in human nature will nd no social outlet.Some relation\u2014^but I am not going to- draw close parallels between the human organism and the social organism; these can be sometimes illuminating, but they are often confusing and easily deceptive. Nevertheless, it was not far-fetched fancy but quite ordinary observation that rst led Rudolf Steiner to speak of society, as well as of human beings, in three-fold terms. One has only to look aroimd to see that every modem society falls broadly into three realms\u2014a spiritual or cultural reahn, concemed with the activities which derive from man's inner life; a pohtical realm, concemed with government, law and social relations ; and an economic reahn, concemed with the production and con sumption of commodities.^ Moreover, there is a relation\u2014^not an exact correspondence but a relation\u2014between the three realms of society and the three systems of the human organism, for the activities of the three realms spring from the desires and needs and capacities of human beings. Threefold man creates threefold society out of himself. And he carries into society his own tensions and conflicts\u2014^the tensions and conflicts which are part of his life, and inescapable; part, indeed, of his health. A fundamental tension in society is between anarchy and order. This reflects the tension between man as individual and man as social being. As individual he seeks freedom\u2014^freedom to thinir his own thoughts, obey his own conscience, pursue his own desires. As a social being he seeks companionship, co-operation. On ths practical level, he seeks co-operation in order to ease his daily toile and to improve his conditions of life. But also he seeks a refuge from loneliness; he craves freedom and yet fears it. He chafes against the discipline of law and order; yet he accepts it because it makes social life possible. The tension between anarchy and order is also a tension between adventure and home. The activities of the spiritual realm\u2014rehgion, science, art, education, medicine, human culture in all its aspects\u2014spring from man as individual. Of course they often involve also a great deal of co-operation, but the essential achievements in this realm require always the presence of a person with the necessary gifts. Any thr^. men of average strength can carry a log, but they will be useless in a school unless they have some gift for teaching; useless in a \\ * It is perhaps worth noting that the Congress of Europe (unofcial but in fluential), when it met at The Hague in May, 1948, distributed itswork among three commissions: cultural, political and economic.laboratory unless at least one has a scientic gift (the others might then be useful assistants). And in some activities of the spiritual realm\u2014^religious searchings, philosophy, most forms of art\u2014^the three men would have to separate and go their ways alone. No-one can share with another his inner life. Hence we can say that activities of the spiritual realm will not contribute to social health imless they are given freedom; otherwise an essential human need will be denied. But to give them freedom is to invoke danger. From out of the individualism of the spiritual realm arise the rebels, the exploiters, the tyrants. Give all these free rein and they will either disrupt society or bend it to the pattern of their private desires. The activities of the economic sphere depend very largely on co-operation\u2014^the division of labour, the exchange of commodities, / the combined exertions of men working in teams. Of course they call also, and constantly, for individual talent and initiative; but in this realm the individual cannot get far alone. If society is to be kept going, nourished and enriched, the individual has to accept the discipline of processes and orderings outside himself. But economic co-operation is not merely a response to these practical demands. It does much to meet the hiunan need for fellowship; one of the most satisfying forms of fellowship is partnership in work. It meets also that human need which is the opposite of self-assertion\u2014 the need for self-giving. The more co-operative in character is the economic life of a society, the more readily will it meet the need of the individual to give himself to a common enterprise. Hence we can say that the activities of the economic sphere will not contribute to social health, either practically or humanly, unless their keynote, is co-operation. A corrective to egoism should come from economic ilife. But here, too, there are dangers. |, The more closely men co-operate in the economic sphere and the j more interdependent are their activities, the more intricate becomes !the system in which they nd themselves' immersed. The system |i has to be managed; the control of it gives power to the managers; they may come to resent any independence within the system which , disturbs their authority. They can always nd reasons why, for the sake of the efciency and smooth running of the system, this independence must be curbed. ^ So arises the danger that the free co-operation of men who choose to work together may sink towards the forced co-operation of the slave gang. The faceless anonymity of the ant-heap lies at the far end of this road. ii8A further virtue of economic life, which again has its dangerous side, is that it brings men into partnership not only with one another but with the earth. In working with the raw materials of nature they learn patience, the patience of the farmer, and the engineier*s respect for stubborn facts. They learn the importance of accurate measurement and calculation, the need to put speculation to experi mental test. By learning these lessons men are able to bring water into the wilderness and make it flower. The danger is that the world they shape with their tools and calculations may become the only world they recognise. In the spiritual realm, then, they will ' be blind, like moles above ground. Such men, to-day, may gain great influence; they niay use it to impose mechanical conceptions and economic valuations on realms of life and spirit, which are blighted by this frost. Or they may recklessly employ their tools to exploit the earth, turning fertility to dust, or to release from nature energies which they cannot control. At the end of this road lies a machine-society, threatened by subterranean res, with men as the frightened servants of machines. It is no use trying to banish these dangerous potentialities from the spiritual and economic spheres. The individualism of the spiritual sphere, the co-operation and the technical science of the economic sphere, are essential sources of social nourishment. And each sphere must be left tree to develop its own characteristics, or its distinctive contribution will fail. The rst step in dealing with the dangers is to recognise them\u2014to recognise how , if either danger gets out of control, a distortion of the human image occurs : the lives of men are pressed into unnatural shapes. The next step is to provide correctives : to establish in the midst of society an influence which will check either danger before it runs to extremes. This regulating influence should flow from the political realm. So far in history govemirients have always had a class bias; they have mainly represented the interests of a dominant or rising social class. Yet the practice of democracy bears witness to another purpose of government, never fully reahsed but always pursued. Men assent to governments, even rather bad ones, because they want at the centre of affairs an authority which will give them order and justice; which will enforce rules of social conduct and protect the weak from exploitation by the strong. The ultimate source of justice in a democratic society is the law-making authority\u2014 Parliament; one of its prime tasks should be to safeguard the human 119person (or, one might say, the human image expressed in the human person) against the oppressive and distorting influences which spring from the individualism of the spiritual sphere and the im personal collectivism and mechanisation of the economic sphere. In the spiritual sphere, for example, it should see that freedom is not denied to persons who work outside the orthodox establish ments, whether religious, scientic, medical or educational. And that spiritual-cultural activities are not starved, or reserved for the wealthy by the application to them of rigid or grasping economic standards. In the economic sphere it 2hould see that conditions of work and wages are equitable and hot ini^cal to health, and that men are not reduced to the level of tools either by despotic authority or by inhuman processes. And in order to fulfil these tasks\u2014 which I can only briefly indicate here\u2014^it must stand on its own independent ground and apply its own distinctively human standards and judgments. If the political, law-making authority assumes heavy and detailed economic responsibilities, it will become confused in piurpose, and will be under constant inducement to subordinate its care of the human image to the demands of economic efldency. If it takes over the administration of spiritual-cultural activities it will be under constant inducement to limit the freedom of individuals in these elds, for the pioneers, the experimenters, and the eccentrics wiU rank as its opponents and critics. It may tolerate them, but it will not actively support them, for the authority they question will be its own. In a democracy, political authority is exercised by governments which come and go. Political assemblies, from Parliament down wards, follow a time-rhythm; they have periods of activity and periods of recess ; after a certain time they must dissolve and submit to election for a further span. Their activities are usually based on the interplay of parties; one party takes oflSce and rules, while another \"goes into opposition.\" It* is no accident that there should be this analogy between the functioning of the political element in society and the functioning of the rhythmic, regulating, healing system in man. For in any realm of life, where active processes are at work, it must be through rhythm that regulation acts. The holding of a balance between living extremes does not consist in nding a null point and establishing a balance once for all; that would reduce the organism to stasis and death. The correction I20of excess has to be achieved by a mobile influence which is free to exert itself rst in one direction, then in another. In this way the state of balance is never perfect; but neither is it overthrown. Herein lies the value of the party system, which repels many p e o p l e b y i t s n o i s y c o n fl i c t s , i t s f a c U e o r a t o r y , t h e a p p a r e n t l y w a s t e f u lf r i c t i o n i t e n g e n d e r s b y m a k i n g r i v a l s o u t o f m e n w h o s h o u l d s u r e l y be co-operating for the national good. Certainly , the party system as we know it has obvious defects ; but more important than these is the means it gives for one party to correct the mistakes and ex cesses of another . So it becomes possible for change in one direction, a c c o r d i n g t o o n e s e t o f i d e a s , ^ o b e c h e c k e d b e f o r e i t h a s g o n e t o extremes; and this organ of regulation is something that the health of society imperatively requires. The party system, in fact, impHes a realistic and salutary recognition that political policies and actions are always imperfect, that even the best-intentioned and most u r g e n t l y n e e d e d r e f o r m s c a r r y o p p r e s s i v e o r d e s t r u c t i v e p o t e n - tiaHties\u2014seeds of social ill-health\u2014and should therefore submit to correction at regular intervals. The party system is always abolished by totahtanan regimes. Sure of their own righmess, they cannot admit any need for a healing influence to redeem them from social sin. In practice, these pharasaic pretensions to perfect health bring on chronic disease. Thetotalitarian flesh is ulcered with concentration camps or forcedl a b o u r c a m p s ; h e r e a r e c o n n e d t h o s e o p p o n e n t s a n d c r i t i c s w h i c h e v e r y h u m a n s o c i e t y r e q u i r e s .

And in our moderh times the healthy social pattern must be threefold, for only then will it bea b l e t o p r o v i d e , f r o m o u t o f i t s o w n r h y t h m i c h e a r t a n d c e n t r e , a h e a l i n g i n fl u e n c e t o c o r r e c t i t s o w n e x c e s s e s a n d m i s t a k e s .

S o w e g e t t h e b e g i n n i n g s o f a distinrt political realm. Later on\u2014towards the end of the Middle Ages in Western Europe\u2014^we find emerging a distinct economic realm, marked by the growing independence of the traders in the towns. So, gradually (I cannot go into details here), the three social realms are bom i we see them struggling painiUy into existence, confused and distorted, as they are to-day . They are there, around us; but in no society have they yet been harmonised, or even consciously recognised; and the prospect now is that unless they are harmonised the three will merge convulsively back\u2014^as in some countries they have done already\u2014into the atavistic, totalitarian one. In this country, what are the signs ? We have left behind the middle-class heyday j a new ruling class, based on the support of the workers and the Trade Unions, is rising to power. Of course, ite power is not unchallenged; its rise may be checked and for a time may seem to recede. But many of the far-reaching social changes which are following from its rise will not be reversed, for no party which sought to reverse them could hope to gain ofce. And they are particularly important changes, because this rise of the \"working class\" is the last revolution of its kind. No other sub merged class is left to rise in due course. W\u00a9 are in the midst now of this social revolution : might it lead towards a healthy, threefold order of society , or is it leading away ? A few words on the origins of the Labour movement are necessary here. Fifty years ago the economic sphere had an air of independence which it is now losing. The spiritual sphere also, in that age of liberalism, had a wide measure of imquestioned freedom which is now in decline. But in spite of these appearances our society was fer from the threefold pattern. The :eedom of the economic sphere was accompanied by oppression and exploitation; the \"working dass\" was shut out from the sun. And the political sphere was not independent; it was dominated by the economic interests of the men of property and wealth. Hence it was not free to discharge its natural function as the source of justice and the protector of human rights. Against this dominance rose the voice of the Labour movement. At rst it was a voice calling simply for justice and fraternity; the 122State Sodalism of our own day has a different origin. Its chief inspirers were middle-dass intellectuals who wanted to take over poUtical power in order to run economic life with planned efdency. They had a most genuine concern for sodal justice, but their deter mining motive was impatience with the disorders of capitalism, its tendency to create unemployment, its chronic booms and slumps. Even without their influence a Labour Party would no doubt have sprung from the Labour movement; the opportunity to form a Labour Government, as the surest way of overcoming the dominance of property interests, would still have been sought. But it was not inevitable that a Labour Government should pin its faith to State Sodalism; the economic sphere could have been socialised\u2014HaiaX is, turned from a field of exploitation into a co-operative enterprise\u2014 by other means.^ There is no room here for a critique of State Sodalism, but two of its unhealthy features call for remark\u2014^its distortion of the idea of'justice, and its concentration of power in one sodal spheie. ^ Justice should have always an element of freedom playing through it; otherwise it becomes an enforced mechanical equality, one of the most dehumanising forms of tyranny. This means that, so long as exploitation is prevented and rules of fair dealing and open opportunity are enforced, human beings should be left free to nd their own levels; and competition, within the rules, must be allowed. If, however, the political State, which should be the guardian of justice, becomes also the great plaimer and manager of economic life, making itself the arbiter of priorities in most elds \u2014then the element of freedom is driven out of justice, and \"what I deserve\" comes to mean, \"what the State thinks I am worth as its servant.\" That is the essence of totalitarianism; and State Sodalism, if it is to discharge its self-appointed tasks, must always have the tendency to move towards this inhuman extreme. Now as to the concentration of power. The modem world has been plagued by no worse evil than that of irresponsible power , whether exerdsed by nations, corporate bodies or individuals. And power nowadays tends always to be irresponsible, for those who wield it seldom recognise any moral order transcending human affairs; and the wielding of it is increasingly divorced from the sobering influence of tradition. The poisons of power are thus ^ Guild Sodalism believed^ This true child of the Labour movement died in infancy, supplanted by State Sodalism, a bastard of mixed and pardy alien parentage. 123t gaming in virulence; less than ever, to-day, can a social order be healthy if it is ruled from one centre of unchallengeable strength. Social power needs to be distributed among various centres which check one another\u2014as in the human organism. In this coxmtry we have not reached the stage of making the political State the sole and unchallengeable centre of power, but the trend is in that direction. In pursuit of its faith in political- economic planning, the Socialist State is bringing economic activities increasingly under its ownership and control; in pursuit of its- somewhat mechanical idea of social justice it is reaching out to extend its influence over the spiritual-cultural sphere. The result is a curious distortion of the social picture : I must explain briefly what I mean. If we form a rough picture of the structure of a threefold social order, we shall nd it has some afl&nity with the picture of threefold man. A threefold society is foimded, through its economic realm, on the earth; its spiritual realm stands free and open, as it were, to the heavens; and in the midst, mediating between the poles, is its political realm. It is a picture of organic harmony; of tension and balance;, a picture of health. The picture of a society moulded by State Socialism is not like that; it is more like the picture of an inhumanly Fat Man, his political centre in process of absorbing his extremities. He is losing the free use of his limbs ; his head is sinking into his bulging middle. What can be done to remedy this creeping disease\u2014^without reverting to the equally distorted social picture of the capitalist past ? A slimming regime, to reduce the Fat Man's gluttonous centre, is clearly required. This would relieve the State by degrees of its economic burdens (but not of currency control or the Budget), and would entrust them to responsible associations and groups of persons (including representatives of consumer interests) who are directly engaged in the life of the economic sphere. How exactly this might be done is a complicated question which I must pass over here; one essential is that the economic sphere should be seen not merely as a great machme for producing goods, but as a place where a great deal of human living goes on. Economic activities draw human beings into intimate relation ships with one another and with their work. Unless the human relationships are equitable and fairly harmonious, and unless the work gives some opportunities for responsible initiative, the economics p h e r e w i l l b e u n a b l e \u2014 e v e n t h o u g h i t m a y s u p p l y t h e g o o d s \u2014 t o full its human function in society. From a human point of view it will wither; and then the only way to run it will be to plan and bribe it from outside. Democracy, moreover, will become a political ction, for it needs responsible citizens, and it will not get them if their work gives them no training in responsibility .This training need not be conned to managerial levels; it can and should be- carried in simpler forms right down to the site of the . j o b , s o t h a t w o r k i n g t e a m s a r e e n t r u s t e d w i t h i n t e l l i g i b l e t a s k s a n d left free to organise them in their own way. This kind of socialisation is harder than State Socialism to introduce-it is always easier and quicker to centralise than to d e c e n t r a l i s e \u2014 b u t i t i s t h e o n l y w a y t o h u m a n i s e t h e e c o n o m i c s p h e r e ; and also the only way to disperse those power-toxins which are bound to accumulate if political and economic power are concen trated in one swollen organ. A s r e g a r d s t h e F a t M a n ' s o t h e r t r o u b l e , t h e d e c l i n i n g i n d e p e n d e n c e of his spiritual-cultural life, the practical needs are rather simpler .

Challenging this outlook is another, its opposite; this holds that j fallen man can do nothing to redeem himself, or to redeem fallen nature, by his works on earth. Those who take this view are conned ' to the pulpit; their voice rings out in the darkening cathedral, summoning to judgment whoever listens; but the men of violence are free to seize the town. j The right view of man is that he is sick, but not imto death. He 1 is well enough to work, and he has work to do. He should pursue his work, a work of learning as well as acting, with hope and patience and humility; there are helpers with him in the eld. And this is the view he should take also of his society. His need is for a society which can learn rom its mistakes; not an ideal society, proud of its nality and perfection, but a society which recognises its weakness and dependence and yet has faith in its capacity to sow and reap. At one pole this society will recognise its dependence on the heavens; it will cherish spiritual freedom in order that its mind may be open to the winds. From this pole it will receive the un predictable, disturbing impulses which kindle human genius and create the social future. At the other pole it will recognise its dependence on the earth; it wiU seek here for co-operative ways which give the work a social purpose and enable its fruits to be fairly 127 126 /N O T E S O N C O N T R I B U T O R S GEORGE ADAMS, M.A. (Cantab).
