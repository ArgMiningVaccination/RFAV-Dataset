The Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention is a component of the Office of Justice Programs, which also includes the Bureau of Justice Assistance; the Bureau of Justice Statistics; the Community Capacity Development Office; the National Institute of Justice; the Office for Victims of Crime; and the Office of Sex Offender Sentencing, Monitoring, Apprehending, Registering, and Tracking (SMART). f O r e W O r d Since its founding in 1974, the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP) has provided national leadership to federal, state, tribal, and local efforts to prevent delin-quency, strengthen the juvenile justice system, and protect children from violence, abuse, and exploitation. OJJDP is the only federal agency with a specific mission to develop and disseminate knowl- edge about \"what works\" in the juvenile justice field. Drawing on this knowledge, we are working with communities across the country to replicate proven, evidence-based programs and improve existing programs. OJJDP helps communities match program models to their specific needs and supports interventions that respond to the specific developmental, cultural, and gender needs of the youth and families they serve. To ensure the most efficient use of taxpayer dollars, we have established mandatory perfor - mance measures for all of our programs and we report on those measures to the Office of Management and Budget. OJJDP requires its grantees to report on their performance, set up systems to gather the data necessary to monitor performance, and use this information to continuously assess progress and fine-tune their programs. In fiscal year (FY) 2009, OJJDP posted a record number of solicitations and awarded an unprecedented number of grants. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) provided a major supplement to the OJJDP appropriation for local and national mentoring initiatives and the Internet Crimes Against Children program. ARRA enabled the Office to launch a broad array of new initiatives and expand existing efforts in both of these critical areas. Supporting mentoring programs and fighting Internet crime are just two examples of the many ways OJJDP is making a difference every day in the lives of children, families, and communities. During FY 2009, the Office continued to be a national leader in the study of and development of programs to address girls' delinquency, children's exposure to violence, gang activity, the problems of at-risk tribal youth, underage drinking, and missing and abducted children, among a host of other issues. In these and many other areas, OJJDP collaborates closely with federal, state, local, and non-profit partners. Through research and demonstration programs, training and technical assis-tance, and information resources, OJJDP is working vigorously with all of its partners in the juvenile justice field to build a better future for America's youth. Jeff Slowikowski Acting Administrator Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention abOut OJJdP the Office of Juvenile Justice and delinquency Prevention (OJJdP) was established by congress through the Juvenile Justice and delinquency Prevention (JJdP) act of 1974, Public law 93-415, as amended. a component of the Office of Justice Programs within the u.s. department of Justice, OJJdP works to prevent and control juvenile delinquency, improve the juvenile justice system, and protect children. Mission Statement OJJdP provides national leadership, coordination, and the resources to prevent and respond to juvenile delinquency and victimization. OJJdP supports states and communities in their efforts to develop and implement effective and coordinated prevention and intervention programs and to improve the juvenile justice system so that it protects public safety, holds offenders accountable, and provides treatment and rehabilitative services tailored to the needs of juveniles and their families. Organization OJJdP is composed of the Office of the administrator, three program divisions (child Protection, demonstration Programs, and state relations and assistance), the Office of Policy development (including the communications unit), and the Grants Management unit. appendix a summarizes each component's role. t a b l e O f c O n t e n t s c H a P t e r 1 : OJJDP Is Building a Better Future for America's Youth: Major a P t e r 2 : OJJDP Is Forming Partnerships To Prevent and Intervene a P t e r 3 : OJJDP Is Strengthening the Juvenile Justice System Through a P t e r 4 : OJJDP Is Defending Children a P t e r 5 : OJJDP Is Providing Resources and Information to the Juvenile . . . n d i x e s H A P T E R 1 C H A P T E R 1 2 Building a Better Future for America's Youth: Major Accomplishments The nation's young people face many obstacles on their journey to adulthood. At the same time, they have many opportunities not available to earlier generations. One of the prin-cipal responsibilities of the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP) is to help ensure that those opportunities remain available and continue to grow to meet the ever-changing needs of America's young people. During fiscal year (FY) 2009, the guiding philosophy behind OJJDP's programs was to fund activities and programs that improve outcomes for the nation's youth. This meant supporting evidence-based programs that reduce juvenile delinquency and crime, protect children from sexual exploitation and abuse, and improve the juvenile justice system so that it protects public safety, holds offenders accountable, and provides services\u2014tailored to individual and commu-nity needs\u2014to juvenile victims and offenders and to their families. The Office's many accomplishments in FY 2009 included helping the field understand and address pressing issues such as the prevalence of Internet crimes against youth, the rising arrest rates for girls, and the long-term negative consequences of children's exposure to violence. OJJDP recognizes that much remains to be done to prevent, intervene in, and treat O F F I C E O F J U V E N I L E J U S T I C E A N D D E L I N Q U E N C Y P R E V E N T I O N 3 OJJDP's mission is to provide national leadership, coordination, and resources to prevent and respond to juvenile delinquency and child victimization. The Office supports states, tribal jurisdictions, communities, and local governments in their efforts to develop and implement prevention and intervention programs that hold offenders accountable and provide treatment and rehabilitation services tailored to the needs of individuals and their families. delinquent behavior. The activities highlighted throughout this report illustrate OJJDP's ongoing commitment to strive to improve outcomes for the nation's children, particularly those at risk, by supporting programs that have the greatest potential for improving the juvenile justice system and keeping communities safe. Recovery Act On February 17, 2009, President Obama signed into law the landmark American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA). The Act provided the Depart-ment of Justice (DOJ) with funding for grants to assist state, local, and tribal law enforcement in combating violence against women, fighting Internet crimes against children, improving the criminal justice system, assisting victims of crime, and supporting youth mentoring. The grants included support for hiring new personnel, an essential step in enhancing programs and services. 2 0 0 9 A N N U A L R E P O R T O F F I C E O F J U V E N I L E J U S T I C E A N D D E L I N Q U E N C Y P R E V E N T I O N OJJDP awarded grants totaling more than $147 million under ARRA. These grants were included in the more than $2.76 billion of ARRA funding awarded by the Office of Justice Programs (OJP). The OJJDP grants included $97.5 mil-lion for local and national mentoring initiatives and $50 million to support the Internet Crimes Against Children (ICAC) program. (See chapter 2 for more information on ARRA grants that support mentoring initiatives, and chapter 4 for information on ARRA funds awarded to the ICAC program.) Girls' Delinquency In the 1990s, a surge of girls' arrests brought female juve- nile delinquency to the country's attention. Girls' rates of arrest for some crimes increased faster than boys' rates of arrest. By 2004, girls accounted for 30 percent of all juvenile arrests, but delinquency experts did not know whether these trends reflected changes in girls' behavior or changes in arrest patterns. The juvenile justice field struggled to understand how best to respond to the needs of girls who were entering the system. In 2004, OJJDP convened the Girls Study Group (GSG) to establish a research-based foundation to guide the develop- ment, testing, and dissemination of strategies to reduce or prevent girls' involve-ment in delinquency and violence. To disseminate the GSG's findings, OJJDP maintains a Girls' Delinquency Web page and is producing a series of bulletins that present the study group's find-ings on issues such as patterns of offending among adolescents and how they differ for girls and boys; risk and protective factors associated with delinquency, including gender differences; and the causes and correlates of girls' delinquency. Detailed information about the new GSG bulletins released in FY 2009 and the Girls' Delinquency Web page can be found in chapter 5. In addition to research, OJJDP funds numerous programs focused on interven- ing in and preventing girls' delinquency. These programs include Girl Scouting in Detention Centers, which provides girls with opportunities to participate in activities that promote positive social development; Friendly PEERsuasion, an interactive program that helps middle school girls gain knowledge and skills and access support systems to avoid substance abuse; and the PACE Center for Girls, which provides delinquency prevention programs for teenage girls. Many states have used funding under OJJDP's Formula Grants program to promote gender-specific programming. 4 5 C H A P T E R 1 In April 2009, a pilot program cosponsored by OJJDP and OJP trained law enforcement personnel on the best ways to approach and interact with adoles-cent girls during police calls. This program, called Law Enforcement Responses to Adolescent Girls, was conducted in Philadelphia, PA, by the International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP). The course is expected to be offered regularly through IACP, once the results of the pilot course have been evaluated and the training has been modified accordingly. OJJDP's National Training and Technical Assistance Center has developed a training course (Gender Responsive Programming for Girls) to address the needs of girls. It focuses on the unique experiences of young women as they relate to race, culture, development, economic status, and physical appearance; it may be used to enhance services in a range of settings, from community-based prevention programs for at-risk girls to intensive residential programs and detention. Online Resources The Girls' Delinquency Web page can be accessed on the OJJDP Web site at ojjdp.gov/ programs/girlsdelinquency.html. Detailed information about the GSG can be found on the Girls Study Group Web site, girlsstudygroup.rti.org. Children's Exposure to Violence Exposure to violence\u2014whether as a victim or as a witness\u2014is associated with long-term physical, psychological, and emotional harm. Children who have been exposed to violence are at higher risk of mental health problems such as anxiety and depression. They are also more likely to use drugs and alcohol, and even to engage in violent behavior themselves. In June 1999, OJJDP launched the Safe Start initiative to develop evidence-based strategies for reducing the impact of children's exposure to violence. OJJDP con-tinues to work across the areas of practice innovation, research and evaluation, training, and national resource development. OJJDP received more than $1 mil-lion in federal interagency support to advance this work in FY 2009. During FY 2009, OJJDP completed the National Survey of Children's Exposure to Violence (NatSCEV), the first comprehensive attempt to measure children's exposure to violence in the home, school, and community across age groups from birth to age 17. The University of New Hampshire conducted the survey and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention supported additional analysis. 2 0 0 9 A N N U A L R E P O R T 6 O F F I C E O F J U V E N I L E J U S T I C E A N D D E L I N Q U E N C Y P R E V E N T I O N In remarks addressing the 2009 conference of the American Academy of Pediat- rics, the Attorney General commended the Academy for addressing the problem of children and violence, which he characterized as a long-term \"personal and professional concern.\" Noting progress made since DOJ began working with researchers examining children's exposure to violence a decade ago, Attorney General Holder stated that researchers now have the information needed to assess its cumulative effects. Citing recently published findings from NatSCEV, the Attorney General described them as \"a wake-up call\" that we cannot afford to ignore and \"one that I will not ignore.\" In FY 2009, OJJDP worked with the Rand Corporation and 15 communities to collect child and family outcome data on interventions for children exposed to violence. Evaluation reports are slated for release in FY 2011. OJJDP also funded practice innovations in these same 15 communities in 2009 to demon-strate new methods to lead the field in addressing children and families living with violence. For more information on NatSCEV and other OJJDP efforts to prevent and reduce children's exposure to violence, see chapter 4. Project Safe Childhood OJJDP is proud to play a major role in DOJ's Project Safe Childhood (PSC) ini-tiative, which combats the exploitation of children by Internet predators. The project's goal is to investigate and prosecute crimes against children committed through the Internet or other electronic media and communications devices. The initiative's key partners include U.S. Attorneys; the ICAC program, which OJJDP manages; the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children; the Federal Bureau of Investigation; and state and local law enforcement agencies. In FY 2009, OJJDP awarded approximately $75 million in grants (including ARRA awards) to state and local law enforcement agencies under its ICAC program to support joint federal, state, and local efforts to investigate and prosecute cybercrimes against children and keep children safe from Internet predators. Also in FY 2009, OJJDP launched a national media campaign as part of the PSC initiative to combat the online exploitation of children. The $2.5 million campaign used a combination of public service announcements in English and Spanish on national cable television channels, in print ads, and in Internet promotions such as banner ads, popup ads, and Webisodes. 7 C H A P T E R 1 For more information on how OJJDP is working to protect children by fighting cybercrime and conducting many other activities, see chapter 4. Comprehensive Anti-Gang Initiative OJJDP helped launch and continues to support DOJ's comprehensive initiative to combat gang violence. The initiative prioritizes prevention programs to pro-vide America's youth and offenders returning to the community with oppor - tunities that help them resist gang involvement and ensure robust enforcement policies when gang-related violence occurs. The initiative stresses the importance of federal and state agencies working with local partners to coordinate anti-gang strategies. Coordinated through the U.S. Attorneys' Offices, the initiative provides substantial resources to support com-munitywide responses to gangs across the country. In June 2008, OJJDP released a publication that describes best practices learned from practitioners experienced in planning and implementing OJJDP's Com-prehensive Gang Model. The document, Best Practices To Address Community Gang Problems: OJJDP's Comprehensive Gang Model, presents findings from evaluations of programs that demonstrate the model. The publication was included in Florida's most recent statewide grand jury report on gangs. An update of the Best Practices report is in process. OJJDP's many anti-gang activities are described in more detail in chapter 2. Mentoring Research indicates that mentoring can be a useful strategy in working with youth who experience multiple risk factors for delinquency, school failure, and other negative outcomes. OJJDP's juvenile mentoring grants support national and community organizations that directly serve youth through mentoring, target specific populations of youth, and enhance the capacity of other organiza-tions to recruit, train, and supervise mentors. In addition to the $97.5 million in mentoring funds provided under ARRA, the Office received $80 million in FY 2009 funding to help develop and enhance the capacity of communities to provide mentoring services to at-risk youth nation-wide. The mentoring grants will focus on the needs of underserved populations, including at-risk youth in American Indian/Alaska Native communities and Latino communities that have gang problems. OJJDP's mentoring initiatives are described in detail in chapter 2. 2 0 0 9 A N N U A L R E P O R T 8 ELECTRONIC MAPPING\u2014THE SMART SYSTEM Available to the public since 2006, OJJDP's Socioeconomic Mapping and Resource Topography (SMART) system is a free, Web-accessible application that communities can use to position local resources to help prevent crime and delinquency. Users can connect SMART maps of crime locations with maps of local intervention programs and community resources. In addition, SMART creates tables and graphs to illustrate a wide variety of data on socioeconomic factors such as housing, population, crime, health, and mortality. FY 2009 updates to the SMART system include an enhanced capability to view multiple Census Bureau demographics at the same time on one map; the addition of the most current data from the Uniform Crime Reports for 1994 to 2007; and information on all FY 2009 OJJDP grants, including awards made through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. In addition, OJJDP released a new InFocus fact sheet, Get SMART\u2014Mapping Resources for Crime and Delinquency Prevention, which provides detailed information about the uses and applications of the system. Online Resources SMART is available at http://smart.gismapping.info. To access Get SMART\u2014Mapping Resources for Crime and Delinquency Prevention, go to www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/ ojjdp/222504.pdf. Listening Sessions OJJDP is communicating with the juvenile justice field on challenges and solu- tions through regularly scheduled listening sessions held in its Washington, DC, office. These interactive sessions, launched in May 2009, foster an ongoing dialog with policymakers and practitioners on the current trends and issues fac-ing the juvenile justice field. OJJDP will use information from these sessions to enhance its collective knowledge base, guide decisionmaking and planning, and promote open and transparent governing. O F F I C E O F ington, DC, meetings. OJJDP has also held sessions on trends in the juvenile justice system, reducing disproportionate minority contact, research and evaluation, and child protec-tion. Participants from around the country were invited to represent a variety of viewpoints and disciplines. Listening sessions also will be held at various con-ferences throughout the country for those who cannot participate in the Wash- J U V E N I L E J U S T I C E A N D D E L I N Q U E N C Y P R E V E N T I O N 9 C H A P T E R 1 Training and Technical Assistance OJJDP provides national leadership, coordination, and resources to those who are working to prevent and respond to juvenile delinquency and victimization. A major component of these efforts is the provision of training and technical assistance (TTA) resources that address the needs of juvenile justice prac-titioners and support state and local efforts to build capacity and expand the use of evidence-based practices. The Office's National Training and Technical Assistance Center (NTTAC) provides the majority of TTA to the field, covering a compre-hensive range of topics that include prevention, graduated sanctions, intervention, and reentry. During FY 2009, NTTAC responded to a total of 122 TTA requests and pro- vided TTA to 1,798 participants. Of those requests, NTTAC supplied technical assistance to 61 requesters and 1,722 participants from 33 states, the District of Columbia, and the Virgin Islands. NTTAC provided training to 76 participants from 26 states. Training and technical assistance covered a variety of topics, including compliance monitoring, disproportionate minority contact, strategic planning, gender-specific services, juvenile justice system improvement, alter - natives to detention, aftercare/reentry, mental health, gangs, mentoring, delin-quency prevention, deinstitutionalization of status offenders, tribal youth courts, and Native American issues. Also in FY 2009, OJJDP developed a new needs assessment tool that promises to provide the most comprehensive and detailed picture to date of the TTA needs of agencies and organizations serving the juvenile justice field. OJJDP will use the information to better provide the juvenile justice community with tools and resources to enhance their organizational capacity and to develop new curricu-lums and training programs that are timely and responsive. The needs assess-ment tool is an online self-guided survey that gathers detailed information about the background of respondents, the type of organization they work for, the type of population they serve, their TTA history, their perspectives on emerging issues in juvenile justice, and the types of TTA they would find most helpful. Information about specific OJJDP training and technical assistance activities is provided throughout this report.

Therefore, in developing pre- vention and intervention programs, policymakers are increasingly adopting multidisciplinary approaches that combine the resources of many different youth-serving agencies and organiza-tions. These partnerships allow for critical information sharing across disciplines, more effective problem solving, and the efficient use of community resources. One example of such a partnership is the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention's (OJJDP's) Gang Reduction Program (GRP), which is designed to reduce gang activity in targeted neighborhoods by incorporating a broad spectrum of research-based interventions to address the range of personal, family, and community factors that contribute to juvenile delinquency and gang activity. The program integrates federal, state, and local resources to incorporate state-of-the-art practices in prevention, intervention, and suppression. O F F I C E O F J U V E N I L E J U S T I C E A N D D E L I N Q U E N C Y P R E V E N T I O N 1 3 OJJDP's approach to preventing and intervening in juvenile delinquency takes into account the family, school, peers, law enforcement, and the larger community. The Office has been working closely with federal, state, local, and nonprofit partners to provide comprehensive and effective strategies to help youth avoid crime and build a productive, successful future. Another example is the Coordinating Council on Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Preven- tion, which is administered by OJJDP. The Council\u2014whose member agencies include the U.S. Departments of Justice (DOJ), Education, Health and Human Services, and Housing and Urban Development, among other agencies\u2014is dedicated to fostering broad-based and multisector col-laborations to improve the policies and practices of federal, state, and local programs for youth. In addition, OJJDP's National Juvenile Information Sharing Initiative brings together juvenile justice, youth services, and community leaders to effectively coordinate multiple services and to foster informed decisionmaking regarding juveniles, whether in the justice, education, health, or social services contexts. These and many of the other activities discussed in this chapter illustrate how OJJDP is helping community leaders reach out to partners and work alongside other sectors to help build a better future for America's youth. 2 0 0 9 A N N U A L R E P O R T 1 4 O F F I C E O F J U V E N I L E J U S T I C E A N D D E L I N Q U E N C Y P R E V E N T I O N Anti-Gang Initiatives OJJDP has long supported the use of data-driven, strategic anti-gang initiatives that combine prevention, intervention, enforcement, and reentry strategies. Such initiatives require the collaboration of multiple community partners, including law enforcement, schools, social services, community organizations, key com-munity leaders, citizens, and others. Coordinating multiple anti-gang strategies offers the highest potential for long-term success in reducing and eliminating gang activity. During fiscal year (FY) 2009, OJJDP provided support to federal, state, and local parties seeking information and guidance on gang prevention. The Office's major anti-gang efforts are described below. DOJ's Comprehensive Anti-Gang Initiative During FY 2009, OJJDP continued to play a major role in DOJ's Com- prehensive Anti-Gang Initiative, launched in 2006. The initiative, coordinated through the U.S. Attorneys' Offices, emphasizes the importance of working with local partners to coordinate anti-gang strategies. As a result of this emphasis, U.S. Attorneys' Offices have moved beyond focusing on enforcement-only anti-gang strategies and have begun developing comprehensive communitywide strate- gies geared toward prevention. The project initially began with six sites in Los Angeles, CA; Dallas/Fort Worth, TX; Tampa, FL; Cleveland, OH; Milwaukee, WI; and the 222 corridor, an area north of Philadelphia, PA. The initiative was expanded in 2007 to include Rochester, NY; Oklahoma City, OK; Indianapolis, IN; and Raleigh-Durham, NC. It was further expanded in FY 2008 to 12 sites that include Detroit, MI; and Chicago, IL. OJJDP helped develop this initiative and, in FY 2009, continued to provide comprehensive training and technical assistance in the areas of prevention and intervention to all of the sites. The Office has also played a significant role in the delivery of several anti-gang trainings to support DOJ's Project Safe Neighborhoods. The goal of these train-ings is to improve the level of knowledge, communication, and collaboration involved in addressing criminal gang issues that affect communities throughout the nation. The curriculum is based on current policies and proven practices and strategies in the criminal justice field. The trainings combine the gang expertise of DOJ law enforcement and criminal justice professionals in a unified DOJ anti-gang curriculum. Separate tracks provide training for local law enforcement executives, line personnel, investigators, and prosecutors. In FY 2009, OJJDP further developed the curriculum for these trainings by adding material in the areas of prevention and intervention, based on feedback from the training par-ticipants in the previous year. 1 5 C H A P T E R 2 Online Resource For more information on the Comprehensive Anti-Gang Initiative, visit OJJDP's Web site at ojjdp.gov/programs/antigang/index.html. Gang Prevention Coordination Assistance Program OJJDP initiated the Gang Prevention Coordination Assistance Program in FY 2007 to improve the coordination of resources that support community partner - ships implementing two or more of the strategies of OJJDP's Comprehensive Gang Model: prevention, intervention, and suppression. Twenty-four communi-ties currently receive Gang Prevention Coordination Assistance grants. Coordi-nators in the communities identify and leverage a variety of resources to help reduce youth gang crime and violence in targeted neighborhoods. The approach emphasizes a balance of gang prevention with enforcement and uses community organizations and faith-based groups to sustain the work. Gang Reduction Program OJJDP launched the Gang Reduction Program (GRP) in 2003 to reduce youth gang activity in disadvantaged neighborhoods; the program combines federal, state, and local resources in four cities across the country. The program contin-ues today in Los Angeles, CA; North Miami Beach, FL; and Richmond, VA. GRP incorporates three new ingredients in OJJDP's Comprehensive Gang Model, the product of a national gang research and development program ini-tiated in the mid-1980s. First, GRP makes the recruitment of individuals from small community organizations a priority. These local entities often are very effi-cient, raise their own funds, have existing personal relationships with those in need, and understand the culture and language of the local community. Second, GRP emphasizes multiagency collaboration, not only locally in neighborhoods and communities but across federal agencies as well. Third, GRP stresses the importance of partnering with the private sector. At the outset of this effort, OJJDP recognized that success would benefit not only those children who did not become members of gangs, but the community at large, including businesses. When crime and violence are reduced, the business community (especially small businesses that suffer most from theft and vandal-ism) experiences significant benefits. For example, the GRP effort in Richmond, VA, has led to large-scale improvements and investments in the physical condi-tion of public housing. As a result of GRP, there has been increased safety, more stable tenants, and better tenant care of property. The private-sector operator of those units saw an economic reason to contribute to the Richmond GRP effort. 2 0 0 9 A N N U A L R E P O R T 1 6 O F F I C E O F J U V E N I L E J U S T I C E A N D D E L I N Q U E N C Y P R E V E N T I O N The accomplishments of the Richmond program were recognized by the Interna- tional Association of Chiefs of Police, which awarded the program the 2009 Web-ber Seavey Award for Quality in Law Enforcement. (For more information, see the sidebar, \"OJJDP-Sponsored Gang-Reduction Program Wins Top Award.\") Unlike many previous efforts where communities chose to address either enforcement, prevention, or intervention, the GRP initiative is bringing all major sectors together and using the strengths of each to address community needs. The Urban Institute conducted a multiyear evaluation (2003-2008) of the GRP initiative in all of the original program sites to assess program implementation and outcomes. Following are some of the evaluation's preliminary findings, which were submitted to OJJDP during FY 2009: Most of the sites realized successful outcomes related to crime reduction, although results varied. Much of the progress that each site achieved can be attributed to the leader-ship of its coordinator. In addition, OJJDP maintained close oversight during the strategic planning and implementation processes and made available extensive technical assistance to each site, which also contributed to the suc-cess of the GRP. In contrast to many previous crime prevention and reduction efforts, all sites successfully implemented the GRP model. The three current sites implemented plans to sustain elements of the program as federal funding expired. The fourth original site (Milwaukee, WI) was discontinued in 2007, in part because of difficulty in implementing a sustain-ability plan. Sites independently developed similar organizations led by steering commit-tees; however, collaboration and communication among partners varied by site. The short amount of time OJJDP allowed for initial planning (6 months) was a major challenge for all sites. It meant that GRP programs represented only some initiatives that were already in place; sites did not have time to seek out new programs for the target areas. During FY 2009, OJJDP prepared to release a bulletin summarizing the results of the evaluation. The bulletin, Findings From the Evaluation of OJJDP's Gang Reduc- tion Program, is slated for publication in 2010.

Richmond is one of OJJDP's demonstration program sites and has received extensive resources and assistance from the Office in developing its approach to address youth gang issues. This year's winners were honored in ceremonies held in conjunction with IACP's annual conference in Denver, CO, in October 2009. GRIP is one of three programs worldwide to receive this year's award. Administered by the Richmond, VA, police department, GRIP is a collaborative effort between the city of Richmond and federal, state, and local partners to significantly reduce gang activity in targeted neighborhoods. Its goals are to reduce youth and young adult gang crime in an area on the city's South Side through the application of proven practices that provide youth and young adults with healthy alternatives to joining gangs. GRIP helped decrease violent crime in the targeted area between 2005 and 2008\u2014a 17-percent reduction in rape and an 89-percent reduction in homicides. GRIP's 400 volunteers work with about 4,000 at-risk youth per week. The implementation of the program at the Richmond, VA, site involved the mobilization and cooperation of more than 50 faith-based and community-based organizations. GRIP encompasses more than 40 programs that include health care, afterschool care, English as a Second Language and Spanish as a Second Language classes, job development, community revitalization, and a host of other programs that provide the community, and specifically youth, a positive alternative to gangs. Recognized by the U.S. Department of Justice as a \"Best Practices\" program, GRIP is being expanded within the city to include the North Side. National Gang Center In October 2009, OJJDP's National Youth Gang Center (NYGC) merged with the National Gang Center (NGC), funded by the Office of Justice Programs' Bureau of Justice Assistance. The functions performed by NYGC continue, but its incorporation into an expanded National Gang Center leverages resources more efficiently while enhancing OJJDP's response to the needs of researchers, practitioners, and other concerned citizens. NGC's mission is to expand 2 0 0 9 A N N U A L R E P O R T 1 8 critical knowledge about youth gangs and effective strategies to address them. In addition, NGC provides training and technical assistance on community- based responses to youth gangs and is playing a significant role in DOJ's Com-prehensive Anti-Gang Initiative. NGC also conducts the annual National Youth Gang Survey of police and sheriffs' departments to determine the extent and nature of the nation's gang problem. OJJDP publishes fact sheets each year summarizing the survey results. Released in FY 2009, the fact sheet Highlights of the 2007 National Youth Gang Survey reported that more than one-third of the 45 jurisdictions in the National Youth Gang Survey study population experienced gang problems in 2007. NGC also maintains a Web site with full-text publications on gang programs and research, a bibliography of gang publications that are not available electronically, lists of gang-related legislation broken down by state and subject, and GANG- INFO, a forum for professionals to exchange information about youth gangs. The Web site also maintains a database of gang-related news coverage, to which several thousand new articles were posted during FY 2009. Online Resource More information about the National Gang Center is available at www.nationalgangcenter.gov/. Other Accomplishments In addition to the programs highlighted above, OJJDP supported and partici- pated in several other important anti-gang activities during FY 2009: In FY 2009, OJJDP launched the Gang Prevention Youth Mentoring Program, which offers a comprehensive array of core services for youth who are at risk of gang activity. In FY 2009, OJJDP provided more than $9 million to support this initiative in 20 sites across the country. (For more information on this program, see the section \"Mentoring Activities\" later in this chapter.) An OJJDP-funded study (Norms and Networks of Latino Gang Youth) by the Urban Institute is using a social network framework to understand the patterns of relationships among Latino gang members and the nature of the links that bind these groups to their social contexts. The study will fill an important gap in the growing body of gang literature about how interper - sonal relationships and networks shape social interaction and group-based criminal behavior. O F F I C E O F J U V E N I L E J U S T I C E A N D D E L I N Q U E N C Y P R E V E N T I O N 1 9 C H A P T E R 2 BOYS & GIRLS CLUBS IN UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES Grants administered by OJJDP are helping the Boys & Girls Clubs of America (BGCA) make a positive difference in the lives of children who live in public housing and American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) communities. These children are especially vulnerable to the negative impact of poverty and social neglect. Through the provision of $40 million in FY 2009 National Mentoring Programs funding through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, OJJDP partnered with BGCA to strengthen, expand, and enhance its nationally recognized programs and mentoring experiences. The award included approximately $36.8 million in subgrant funding to local Boys & Girls Clubs throughout the United States and Puerto Rico. This funding has enabled existing clubs to expand and enhance mentoring experiences for approximately 267,929 youth residing in distressed areas. Areas of focus in FY 2009 included the implementation of mentoring programs; the establishment and sustainability of new clubs in public housing communities, AI/AN communities, and other existing or emerging areas of distress; implementation and continuation of BGCA-targeted outreach initiatives; and sustainability support for existing clubs in public housing and Indian country as they continue ongoing mentoring programs. In FY 2009, BGCA opened 112 new clubs in distressed areas (including 9 in public housing and 7 in Indian country), provided sustainability support for 183 existing clubs in tribal areas and 76 existing clubs in public housing, and offered BGCA-targeted outreach gang initiatives in 39 communities. Also in FY 2009, OJJDP awarded a grant of $2 million to BGCA through the Office's Mentoring for At-Risk Tribal Youth program. The grant included approximately $1.83 million in subgrant funding to Boys & Girls Clubs in AI/AN communities. It also provided funded clubs with the resources necessary to deliver programs, services, and mentoring experiences to approximately 28,000 club members, vastly exceeding the original proposed goal of 3,600 members. Currently, more than 220 BGCA clubs in AI/AN communities serve approximately 150,000 tribal youth in 25 states. OJJDP funding has served as an impetus to significantly expand outreach and to more profoundly impact the majority of these distressed and disadvantaged AI/AN communities and the lives of thousands of deserving children. FY 2009 achievements included technical assistance and sustainability support for 151 existing clubs in Indian country, furthering the impact of the grant funds. 2 0 0 9 A N N U A L R E P O R T 2 0 O F F I C E O F J U V E N I L E J U S T I C E A N D D E L I N Q U E N C Y P R E V E N T I O N Mentoring Activities Mentoring is an effective way to prevent at-risk youth from becoming involved in delinquency and to help already delinquent youth change their lives for the better. Mentoring relationships have been shown to improve youth's self-esteem, behavior, and academic performance. OJJDP has long supported mentoring programs; in FY 2009 alone, the Office awarded a total of approximately $174 million to help develop and enhance the capacity of communities to provide mentoring services to at-risk youth nationwide. Recovery Act Mentoring Initiatives The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) made possible an unprecedented expansion in OJJDP's mentoring programs in FY 2009. Under ARRA, OJJDP provided support totaling $97.5 million for the following initiatives: Recovery Act Local Youth Mentoring Initiative provided support to local organizations to develop, implement, or expand local mentoring programs that lead to measurable, positive outcomes for at-risk youth. Under this ini-tiative, OJJDP made 26 awards totaling $12.5 million to local organizations across the nation. Recovery Act National Mentoring Programs provided support for projects that have a national scope and national impact on combating juvenile delin-quency, reducing the victimization of children, and improving the juvenile justice system through mentoring activities. Under this initiative, OJJDP provided a total of $85 million in funding to four national organizations. Other FY 2009 Mentoring Initiatives In addition, OJJDP awarded $76.5 million in FY 2009 funding to support its men- toring programs. The funding enabled OJJDP to expand its support for mentor-ing by launching the following programs: Second Chance Juvenile Mentoring Initiative provides funding for non- profit organizations and AI/AN tribes to develop, implement, and expand mentoring programs and transitional services for juvenile offenders who are reentering their communities after serving a sentence in a correctional facility. Strategic Enhancement to Mentoring Program supports research- and evidence-based enhancements to mentoring programs that involve parents and family in activities and services, deliver structured activities and pro-grams for the mentoring matches, and develop training and support for mentors. Every day, mentors in communities across our nation provide crucial support and guidance to young people. Whether a day is spent helping with homework, playing catch, or just listening, these moments can have an enormous, lasting effect on a child's life. \u2014President Barack Obama 2 1 2 0 0 9 A N N U A L R E P O R T C H A P T E R 2 Gang Prevention Youth Mentoring Program supports the establish- ment or expansion of mentoring initiatives with core services that promote healthy behaviors in youth at risk of gang activity, delin-quency, and violence. Grantees participate in communitywide strat-egies to create prosocial peer groups for youth and to combat gang activity. OJJDP also has dedicated training and technical assistance resources to assist these sites in coordinating these strategies. Mentoring Initiative for Foster Care Youth supports the develop- ment and enhancement of mentoring programs and services for at-risk youth in the foster care system to prevent their involve-ment in the juvenile justice system and for youth in foster care who are currently involved in the system. National Mentoring Programs support the efforts of national organizations to enhance or expand mentoring initiatives. The goal is to assist in the development and continued growth of community programs. These programs provide mentoring services to high-risk populations that are underserved because of location, a shortage of mentors, physical or mental challenges, or other related issues identified by the community. National Youth Mentoring Training and Technical Assistance Initiative provides training and technical assistance to build the competency, perfor-mance, and capacity of mentoring grantees. Mentoring Research Program will evaluate the impact that adding a paid component to a volunteer mentoring program has on its effectiveness. The evaluator will conduct process and outcome evaluations to measure the suc-cess of the program's paid and volunteer mentors. The evaluation will also measure changes in recruitment, retention, length of matches, and delin-quency prevention. Juvenile and Family Drug Court Initiatives Juvenile drug courts are intensive treatment programs established within and supervised by juvenile courts to provide specialized services for eligible drug-involved youth and their families. Juvenile drug courts provide continuous judicial supervision over delinquency and status offense cases that involve substance-abusing juveniles and deliver a range of support services, includ-ing substance abuse and mental health treatment, primary care, and education. The goal of these services is to improve juveniles' level of functioning in their environment, address problems that may be contributing to their drug use, and develop/strengthen their ability to lead crime- and drug-free lives. Family drug court programs strengthen the families of drug-involved youth by improving the capacity of families to provide structure and guidance to their children. 2 2 O F F I C E O F J U V E N I L E J U S T I C E A N D D E L I N Q U E N C Y P R E V E N T I O N Juvenile Drug Courts In 2007, OJJDP began a partnership with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Center for Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT) and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation to implement the Juvenile Drug Courts/Reclaiming Futures Program. This program offers best practices and specific steps to build the capacity of states, state courts, local courts, units of local government, and tribal governments to help court-involved youth break the destructive cycle of drugs and alcohol and build a better future through education and skills development. OJJDP awarded a total of $1.275 million over 4 years to three jurisdictions in Greene County, MO; Hocking County, OH; and the New York State Unified Court System to implement a juvenile drug court program that integrates the Reclaiming Futures program model. The three sites are receiving technical assis-tance from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation during this 4-year period. In addition, CSAT is awarding each site $300,000 in supplemental funding in FYs 2008, 2009, and 2010 to support treatment services. The partnership expanded in FY 2009 in the form of a joint solicita- tion between OJJDP and CSAT, again to integrate the Reclaiming Futures model into the juvenile drug court and to implement best practices in treatment for juveniles. The funding solicitation for the program was published by CSAT. OJJDP and CSAT awarded grants to three jurisdictions in California, Colorado, and Oklahoma. OJJDP has entered into an agreement with the Federal Research Division of the Library of Congress to conduct an evaluation of the 2009 and 2010 juvenile drug court awardees. Family Drug Courts OJJDP's FY 2009 Family Drug Courts program supports the implementation of sustainable drug courts for substance-abusing adults who are involved in the family dependency court system due to child abuse or neglect. Applicants were required to propose services both to the parents in the program and their children. OJJDP issued a solicitation to fund family drug courts for up to $500,000 per award for a period of 3 years. Fifteen family drug courts were selected for these awards in California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Maine, Michigan, Min-nesota, and New Jersey. Through a competitive process, the Center for Children and Family Futures in California was selected to provide training and technical assistance to family drug courts. 2 3 C H A P T E R 2 Online Resources To learn more about the Juvenile Drug Courts/Reclaiming Futures program, visit the OJJDP Web site, ojjdp.gov (select the \"Programs\" section). Information about the Family Drug Courts program is also available at the OJJDP Web site (select \"FY 2009 Awards\" in the \"Funding\" section). Enforcing Underage Drinking Laws Program OJJDP has administered the Enforcing Underage Drinking Laws (EUDL) program since Congress created the initiative in 1998. The program has four components: Block grants awarded to each state and territory and the District of Columbia to improve the enforcement of underage drinking laws. Discretionary grants awarded to competitively selected states to support the demonstration of best or promising practices at the local level. Training and technical assistance. Evaluation. This section focuses on EUDL's FY 2009 discretionary grants and evaluation activities. For more information on EUDL's block grants and training and techni-cal assistance, see chapter 3. For more than a decade, OJJDP has been supporting and enhancing efforts by states and local jurisdictions to prohibit the sale of alcoholic beverages to minors and the purchase and consumption of alcoholic beverages by minors. EUDL dis-cretionary grants support several initiatives, all aimed at helping communities use a comprehensive approach to address underage drinking as well as to docu-ment the strategies that are most effective. Highlights of recent EUDL discretionary programs include partnerships with university/college campuses and adjacent communities to implement research-based and promising practices; a Rural Communities Initiative designed to reduce access, change social norms, and increase enforcement in geographically isolated areas; a collaboration with the U.S. Air Force to prevent access to and consumption of alcohol by underage military personnel; and a Community Trials Initiative to implement and rigorously evaluate the impact of best prac-tices and most promising practices tested in the context of the EUDL program. FY 2009 funding supported the expansion of OJJDP's partnership with the Air Force: programs in Missouri and Wyoming were added to those already oper - ating in Arizona, California, Hawaii, and Montana. The National Institute on 2 0 0 9 A N N U A L R E P O R T 2 4 O F F I C E O F J U V E N I L E J U S T I C E A N D D E L I N Q U E N C Y P R E V E N T I O N Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism is supporting the program's evaluation, which is being conducted by the Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation. Other FY 2009 developments include the release of preliminary findings from the Wake Forest University School of Medicine's evaluation of the Community Trials Initiative. Thirty-four sites in five states (California, Connecticut, Florida, Missouri, and New York) received funding, intensive technical assistance and training, and program oversight to support the implementation of best and most promising practices for reducing underage drinking. All of the sites met the requirement for enforcement actions to reduce the social availability of alcohol; 33 (97 percent) met the requirement for enforcing laws against driving while intoxicated, 29 met the requirement for activities that relate to or have the goal of changing local policy to enforce underage drinking laws and prevent and reduce underage drinking, and 24 met the requirement for conducting com-pliance checks. Overall, 18 of the sites, or 53 percent, met all 4 requirements of the Community Trials Initiative. The evaluation found statistically significant improvements in the funded com- munities compared with control communities in the percentage of law enforce-ment agencies that reported conducting compliance checks and party patrol operations. Overall, 28 of the sites (83 percent) reported sustaining some type of activity related to the Community Trials model.

Juvenile Integrated Information Sharing Agencies responsible for the health and well-being of youth face daily chal- lenges to improve their information-sharing capabilities, reduce replication of data and services, and close service gaps. Furthermore, many agencies do not have\u2014and urgently need\u2014access to accurate and timely information to assist in determining appropriate supervision, services, and sanctions for youth. Youth-serving agencies also face the complex tasks of addressing confidentiality issues and implementing strategies for collaboration. OJJDP was the first agency to sponsor a national effort to improve information sharing among community agencies involved with youth. Since 2000, OJJDP has supported the National Juvenile Information Sharing (JIS) Initiative, a training and technical assistance project that helps community leaders collaborate in pro-viding effective services and making informed decisions regarding juveniles in a range of contexts, including the justice system, education, and social services. 2 5 C H A P T E R 2 Under the direction of the Center for Network Development (CND), the JIS Ini- tiative has created a framework for information sharing that includes guidelines for successful interagency partnerships and protocols that comply with state and federal privacy and confidentiality requirements and with national standards for exchange of information between agencies. The Initiative also has developed a JIS data model that uses precise information- exchange standards and processes to help ensure the most effective sharing of critical information about youth across multiple agencies. The Missouri Juvenile Justice Information System and the Missouri Office of State Courts Adminis-trator provided initial feedback on the data model. In FY 2009, testing of the updated versions of the JIS guidelines and data model began at two pilot sites in Colorado. As of FY 2009, jurisdictions in 16 states had adopted JIS guidelines as the basis for developing JIS plans and crafting juvenile information-sharing legislation. Additional states are reviewing the guidelines and the JIS data model for implementation and are working with CND to determine their level of readi-ness to take on these efforts. The JIS Web site serves as a national clearinghouse for information on training and technical assistance opportunities, juvenile information-sharing project updates, profiles of promising information-sharing efforts, and advances in technology. OJJDP sponsors an ongoing JIS Webinar series that provides free online training events for juvenile justice and other youth-serving professionals on a wide range of topics. In FY 2009, OJJDP conducted a two-part series of Webinars that explored information privacy protections provided in federal and state laws and model state legislation.

Tribal Youth Initiatives Many American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) communities lack compre- hensive programs to address substance abuse, juvenile delinquency, and high truancy and dropout rates. In FY 2009, OJJDP entered its 11th consecutive year of congressional appropriations to address these pressing issues. OJJDP carries out its tribal youth initiatives largely through two programs that award grants to federally recognized tribes for activities that prevent and control delinquency and improve the effectiveness of tribal juvenile justice systems: the 2 0 0 9 A N N U A L R E P O R T 2 6 O F F I C E O F J U V E N I L E J U S T I C E A N D D E L I N Q U E N C Y P R E V E N T I O N Tribal Youth Program (TYP) and the Tribal Juvenile Accountability Discretionary Grants Program (T-JADG). Funding In FY 2009, Congress appropriated $25 million to support TYP. This significant funding increase\u2014two and a half times the FY 2008 appropriation\u2014enabled OJJDP to launch the following new programs: The Tribal Juvenile Detention and Reentry Green Demonstration Pro- gram seeks to implement green technologies and environmentally sustain- able activities for tribal youth residing in, or soon to be released from, tribal detention facilities. The program is designed to provide youth with opportu-nities for acquiring new skills in culturally relevant ways. It also will enable tribes to develop financial partnerships with universities and/or green orga-nizations for long-term environmental as well as economic benefits. For more information, see the sidebar, \"OJJDP's Reentry Programs for Tribal Youth Incorporate Green Technologies.\" The Training and Technical Assistance for Tribal Juvenile Detention and Reentry Green Program, to be carried out by Educational Development Center, Inc. (EDC), will help Tribal Green Demonstration Program grantees develop partnerships with organizations to incorporate green technologies and environmentally sustainable activities into their reentry program. EDC has expertise in providing programming and support in Indian country for incarcerated youth, reentry, and community-based programs. The Tribal Youth Field Initiated Research and Evaluation Program sup- ports field-initiated studies to further understanding of the experiences, strengths, and needs of tribal youth, their families, and communities along with what works to reduce their risks for delinquency and victimization. OJJDP awarded an FY 2009 grant to the University of Montana to document the link between the treatment of trauma and the reduction of violence and substance abuse to better understand why violence proliferates in tribal com-munities. The university will gather extensive data from Fort Peck Reserva-tion in Montana and from courts, tribal police, tribal leaders, schools, focus groups, and other sources. In addition, 37 TYP grants totaling approximately $12 million were awarded in FY 2009 to tribes in 16 states. OJJDP also provided extensive training to FY 2009 grant recipients, including training that focused on successful comprehensive juvenile justice planning. The T-JADG grants provide funds for programs that hold AI/AN youth accountable for their offenses while providing the necessary resources and support for positive outcomes and reduced recidivism. In FY 2009, OJJDP 2 7 C H A P T E R 2 OJJDP'S REENTRY PROGRAMS FOR TRIBAL YOUTH INCORPORATE GREEN TECHNOLOGIES Three tribes are partnering with local universities to incorporate environmentally sustainable activities as part of reentry programs for youth in detention. Funded through a 4-year FY 2009 grant under OJJDP's Tribal Juvenile Detention and Reentry Green Program, the initiative is designed to prevent delinquency and reduce recidivism by using agricultural and green technologies as a platform to meet the following goals: strengthening families, deepening pride in traditional tribal culture, and replacing alcohol and other drug use with specific health and wellness activity. Important components of the program include tutoring and online educational opportunities as well as substance abuse and mental health counseling. The Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians will create a community garden at its Youth Justice Center in Pearl River, MS. In consultation with tribal elders, teenagers will plant corn, beans, and squash, which are known as \"the three sisters\" because of the central role these foods played in providing sustenance to early Native Americans. Youth will also learn about the cycle of planting, nurturing, and harvesting as taught in tribal culture. Mississippi State University, long known for its expertise in agriculture, is assisting with the project. The eventual goal is to establish community gardens in each of the Choctaw Indians' eight officially recognized tribal communities, which extend over 35,000 acres of land in rural Mississippi. Tribal elders will teach youth how to make traditional crafts that can be sold. Profits from the sales will be returned to the detention facility to fund the creation of future traditional arts and crafts products. The Rosebud Sioux Tribe of Rosebud, SD, will team up with Sinte Gleska University, a tribally chartered institution of higher education on the Rosebud Reservation, to develop a 12-month reentry program for adjudicated youth that includes learning about and implementing green technologies at the facility and in tribal communities. The program will serve adjudicated youth ages 12 to 17 in the Wanbli Wiconi Tipi, a 47-bed-capacity juvenile detention facility owned and operated by the tribe. The project will include organic farming, beekeeping, and the growing of soybeans for biodiesel fuel. The goods produced (honey, vegetables, herbs, and biodiesel fuel) can be sold. The university will provide courses on wind energy, solar energy, and alternate fuels, and will also offer training in packaging, marketing, and sales. At the same time, youth will deliver the agricultural products they have grown to tribal elders as part of the youth's community service project. Community service will include other forms of assistance such as landscaping and woodcutting. The program's goal is to reduce the rate of recidivism of adjudicated youth\u2014currently at an alarming 90 percent\u2014by promoting the value of service to others, cultural connectedness, education, job opportunities, and small business development in emerging green industries. The Hualapai Indian Tribe of Peach Springs, AZ, is providing youth ages 14 to 17 with opportunities to design and build an onsite greenhouse and gardens, which will incorporate organic traditional Hualapai agricultural species and other vegetables and herbs. Recycling will be part of the daily routine, with both organic and nonorganic materials collected and sorted. Meals cooked in the detention facility will include the foods grown by the youth. A strong emphasis on cultural and environmental education is intended to foster pride in the community and a commitment to natural preservation. The program's primary partners include the local University of Arizona extension office; the Tribal Housing Department, which will oversee youth internship opportunities upon reentry; and the local Boys & Girls Club, which will designate a staff person to work at the juvenile facility to mentor reentering youth and promote leadership opportunities. 2 0 0 9 A N N U A L R E P O R T 2 8 O F F I C E O F J U V E N I L E J U S T I C E A N D D E L I N Q U E N C Y P R E V E N T I O N awarded seven T-JADG grants totaling more than $2 million to the following tribes: the White Earth Reservation (MN), the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indi-ans, the Northern Cheyenne Tribe (MT), the Omaha Tribe of Nebraska, the Reno-Sparks Indian Colony (NV), the Menominee Indian Tribe of Wisconsin, and the Red Cliff Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians (WI). This represents the largest number of T-JADG grants ever awarded by OJJDP. Also in FY 2009, OJJDP provided more than $5 million in funding for mentor- ing programs to the Boys & Girls Clubs of America, Big Brothers Big Sisters of America, and EDC's 7th Generation Mentoring Program for Court-Involved Tribal Youth. Training and Technical Assistance In FY 2009, OJJDP continued its cooperative agreement with EDC to fund a Tribal Youth Training and Technical Assistance Center to provide culturally sensitive training and technical assistance to TYP grantees and all federally recognized tribes in Indian country. The technical assistance includes access to AI/AN professional staff with expertise in the development of culturally based approaches to prevention and intervention, capacity building, strategic plan-ning, program implementation, program evaluation, and program sustainability. OJJDP also provided its annual regional TYP trainings for grantees. The training focuses on helping tribes apply their strengths and experiences to develop and maintain programs that are valuable to their communities. In FY 2009, TYP continued to participate in the Tribal Justice Safety and Wellness Training and Technical Assistance initiative launched by the Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Justice Programs (OJP). This initiative provides training and information to tribal leaders, administrators, program managers, and grant writers on overall resources available from OJP. Also in FY 2009, OJP held con-sultations with tribes to identify priority areas in Indian country. In May 2009, OJJDP sponsored a Webinar entitled \"Stimulate Your Grant Writing Skills.\" This Webinar was developed in response to the high volume of fund-ing opportunities made available to AI/AN communities through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and through OJP, OJJDP, and other federal agencies. In April 2009, another Webinar, \"Introduction to Motivational Interviewing,\" explained the advantages of training staff in special interviewing techniques that have proven to be successful in fostering healthy decisionmak-ing by youth and enhancing program success. OJJDP hosted a 3-day orientation session for new TYP and T-JADG program grantees in Bethesda, MD, in November 2008. The training was designed to C H A P T E R 2 2 9 strengthen relationships between OJJDP and TYP and T-JADG grantees. Grant- ees learned about program and financial management; program planning, implementation, evaluation, and sustainability strategies; and training and tech-nical assistance resources available from OJJDP and other federal agencies. The meeting also provided grantees networking opportunities to meet with OJJDP leadership and program managers to discuss their new TYP and T-JADG pro-grams and to meet with other grantees. Approximately 42 participants attended, representing 21 AI/AN communities from 12 states. OJJDP's Acting Administra-tor and other senior staff provided opening remarks. ATTORNEY GENERAL PLACES HIGH PRIORITY ON ADDRESSING PUBLIC SAFETY NEEDS OF INDIAN COUNTRY In June 2009, the U.S. Department of Justice launched a major initiative to improve coordination of efforts to address issues of public safety in Indian country. This announcement was followed by numerous regional meetings and planning sessions with tribal leaders to discuss critical issues such as law enforcement policy and personnel, grants and technical assistance, federal prosecution in Indian country, tribal court development, domestic abuse, and drug courts and substance abuse. In October 2009, officials from the Department of Justice (DOJ) and 382 representatives of federally recognized American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) tribes convened in St. Paul, MN, to participate in a DOJ-sponsored Tribal Nations Listening Session. The goal of the session was to allow tribal leaders and senior DOJ officials to discuss the serious crime and public safety challenges in Indian country and collaborate on long-term solutions to these problems. In his address to the session, Attorney General Eric Holder stressed the importance of improving dialog and partnerships between the federal government and tribal governments. He announced the creation of a Tribal Nations Leadership Council that will meet biannually to coordinate efforts between DOJ and AI/AN governments. The Attorney General also stated that to further facilitate dialog and establish enduring relationships between his office and tribal leaders, he would personally visit several AI/AN communities over \"the next year and beyond.\" Topics discussed with tribal representatives included seeking support for tribal justice programs, ending violence against women, and implementing and/or sustaining specific programs for tribal youth. We must act now to protect youth in Indian country. Violence against children doesn't just impact the child, or the child's family. It devastates entire communities, because it leads to so many other forms of violence. \u2014Attorney General Eric Holder 2 0 0 9 A N N U A L R E P O R T 3 0 O F F I C E O F J U V E N I L E J U S T I C E A N D D E L I N Q U E N C Y P R E V E N T I O N Research Activities In its ongoing effort to gain a deeper understanding about the needs of tribal youth and communities, and about the strategies that work most effectively to address those needs, OJJDP sponsored the following research and evaluation activities during FY 2009: CSR, Inc., is conducting a 2-year process evaluation of OJJDP's administra- tion of the Tribal Youth Program. OJJDP will use the information from this study to better understand how federally recognized tribes use the grant funds they are awarded, and how OJJDP can better support program imple-mentation and sustainability. The lessons learned from this evaluation will also be useful for other federal and state grantmaking agencies that seek to improve their grant programs and training and technical assistance to tribal communities. The National Indian Youth Leadership Development Project is examining Project Venture, a nationally recognized substance abuse and delinquency prevention program that is being replicated in more than 50 AI/AN and other communities around the nation. Although the program, which origi-nated in New Mexico, has been implemented nationally, little is known about its implementation in areas outside of New Mexico. Preliminary results indicate the program is having positive effects in many communities around the country. The American Youth Policy Forum documented ongoing TYP activities in five tribal communities and in FY 2009 produced a report that provides pre-liminary findings based on site visits in 2007 and 2008. The report, Strength- ening Indian Country Through Tribal Youth Programs, suggests that, as a result of participation in these five programs, fewer children engage in risky behav-iors, life skills are learned as youth engage in and lead projects that make a difference in the community, and youth break the cycle of abuse in their lives as they receive guidance from caring adults who help them make healthy and informed decisions. Prevent Child Abuse America, in partnership with the National Indian Child Welfare Association and other partners\u2014Purdue University, Macro Interna-tional, and key AI/AN researchers\u2014is studying tribal youth victimization and delinquency. The research is designed to increase knowledge about the severity and extent of tribal youth victimization, tribal adult caregivers' per-ceptions of youth victimization, and intervention and treatment resources available to tribal youth. TYP staff are also working with the National Center for Juvenile Justice on a report that summarizes national-level data on AI/AN youth. Modeled on OJJDP's Juvenile Offenders and Victims: National Report, the document will focus specifically on AI/AN youth. The report will be available in FY 2011. 3 1 C H A P T E R 2 Online Resources For more information about the Tribal Youth Program and the Tribal Juvenile Accountability Discretionary Grants Program, go to the OJJDP Web site, ojjdp.gov (select the \"Programs\" sec-tion).

Coordinating Council on Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention The Coordinating Council on Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention is an independent body within the executive branch of the federal government and it operates under the Federal Advisory Committee Act of 1972. The Council's primary functions are to coor - dinate federal juvenile delinquency prevention programs, federal programs and activities that detain or care for unaccompanied juveniles, and federal programs relating to missing and exploited children. The Council meets quarterly. In FY 2009, the Council continued its efforts to improve the coordination of federally funded youth programs. The Council has nine members representing eight federal agencies and up to nine practitioner members. The Attorney General is the ex-officio chairperson and the OJJDP Administrator is the vice chairperson. Funds previously awarded through four interagency agreements supported numerous important initiatives in juvenile justice and delinquency preven-tion during FY 2009. Funds were provided to the U.S. Department of Labor to support enhanced coordination of federal resources for disadvantaged youth, primarily through the Shared Youth Vision program; to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for activities aimed at preventing child and ado-lescent injuries and deaths; to the Corporation for National and Community Service to create a Web presence for the Federal Mentoring Council; and to the National Endowment for the Arts to expand model theater programming for at-risk youth. Council staff and partner agencies spent considerable time collaborating on cross-agency work, including mentoring and state and local planning processes. Notably, staff have created a set of Web-based tools and resources to assist fed-eral staff in developing, implementing, and supporting comprehensive commu-nity initiatives (see sidebar, \"Coordinating Council Launches Web Site To Help Federal Staff Support CCIs\"). Work in 2009 centered on updating and refining this new Web resource. 2 0 0 9 A N N U A L R E P O R T 3 2 \"The Web site is intuitive\u2014 well designed and easy to navigate.\" \"This is the most comprehensive resource available for those of us working with CCIs.\" \"A terrific source to support community change.\" \u2014Comments from federal managers and senior officials on the new CCI Web site Online Resources More information is available on the Coordinating Council's Web site, juvenilecouncil.gov.

COORDINATING COUNCIL LAUNCHES WEB SITE TO HELP FEDERAL STAFF SUPPORT CCIs In FY 2009, the Coordinating Council on Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention established a new Web site, cciToolsforFeds.org, that offers a wealth of tools and resources to help federal staff plan, support, and help sustain comprehensive community initiatives (CCIs)\u2014local community interventions that seek to improve outcomes for youth and families through systems change. CCIs foster broad-based and multisector collaborations to improve the governance, policies, practices, and values of organizations and systems involved in promoting the health and well-being of youth. Issues addressed by CCIs include readiness for school, high school graduation rates, the disproportionate representation of minority youth in the justice system, child abuse and neglect, suicide, substance abuse, and delinquency and violence. Although the emphasis on systems change is what sets a CCI apart from a conventional service-delivery program, it is also what makes a CCI challenging to plan and implement. Even when funding provides for the time to build collaborative relationships and structures, grantees\u2014under pressure to meet day-to-day client demands\u2014understandably tend to divert energy and focus from the long-term, systems change work to the immediacy of service delivery. The Coordinating Council's new Web site helps federal staff align the funding, management, evaluation, and technical assistance necessary to maintain the focus on systems change in partnership with community organizations and agencies serving children, youth, and families. Every day, professionals involved with CCIs are learning more about what makes a CCI effective and how the federal government can best support community change efforts. The goal of cciToolsforFeds.org is to serve as a living resource that reflects the most up-to-date knowledge in the field. The site will be updated regularly as new information becomes available.

The original goals of the Act were to help state and local governments prevent and control juvenile delin- quency and to improve the juvenile justice system. These goals were reaffirmed in the reauthori-zation of the Act in 2002. States 1 participating in the Formula Grants program must comply with the four core protections of the JJDP Act to receive full funding: Deinstitutionalize status offenders (DSO). Separate juveniles from adults in secure facilities (separation). Remove juveniles from adult jails and lockups (jail removal). Reduce disproportionate minority contact (DMC) within the juvenile justice system.2 1 In this chapter, the term \"states\" also encompasses U.S. territories and the District of Columbia. Wyoming does not participate in the Formula Grants program. 2 In 1988, Congress first required states participating in the Formula Grants program to reduce the disproportionate number of minor - ity youth confined in secure facilities. The issue was elevated to a core requirement in 1992, and then broadened in 2002 to encompass disproportionate representation of minorities at any point in the juvenile justice system. 3 5 As one of the four core protections of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974, as amended, reducing disproportionate minority contact is a requirement for all states that participate in the Formula Grants program. In FY 2009, OJJDP continued to increase the scope and number of its resources\u2014 including training, technical assistance, publications, and research activities\u2014 to help states address this critical issue. Meeting the core protections is essential to creating a fair, consistent, and effective juvenile justice system that advances the important goals of the JJDP Act. 3 During FY 2009, the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP) worked with the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the 5 U.S. territories to provide financial and techni-cal assistance to support the implementation of the JJDP Act's requirements. The Office assisted states in developing strategies to reduce the disproportionate number of minority youth who come into contact with the justice system. The Office also worked with states to help them implement accountability-based reforms; develop collaborative, community-based delinquency prevention programs; and prevent the purchase and consumption of alcohol by minors. These activities are helping states realize the importance of forming partnerships and leveraging a variety of resources to help make a differ - ence for youth by strengthening the juvenile justice system. 3 On December 17, 2009, the Senate Judiciary Committee passed S. 678, the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Reauthoriza- tion Act of 2009. This bill was introduced on March 24, 2009, by Senator Patrick Leahy. In addition, H.R. 6029, the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Reauthorization Act of 2010, was introduced by Representative Keith Ellison with cosponsor Representative Robert C. \"Bobby\" Scott on July 30, 2010. This bill was referred to the House Committee on Education and Labor and the House Com-mittee on the Judiciary.

A state's level of compliance with each of the core protections determines eligibility for its continued participation in the Formula Grants program. OJJDP awarded approximately $63 million in Formula Grant funds to desig- nated state agencies in FY 2009. During that same period, OJJDP made program-matic site visits to more than 30 states, completed 11 compliance monitoring audits, provided technical assistance, and sponsored numerous training confer - ences to assist states in implementing comprehensive juvenile justice plans and programs to prevent delinquency and improve their juvenile justice systems. In FY 2009, OJJDP's National Training and Technical Assistance Center (NTTAC) provided 27 training and technical assistance projects to more than 400 par - ticipants in 16 states for the Formula Grants program. The top five topic areas were disproportionate minority contact, juvenile justice system improvement, compliance monitoring, delinquency prevention, and deinstitutionalization of status offenders. Participants included representatives of tribal communities, the court system, and law enforcement; facility staff; and service providers. OJJDP provided an additional 23 trainings to State Advisory Groups (SAGs), including new- and advanced-member training and strategic planning. OJJDP RELEASES FACT SHEETS ON FORmULA AND BLOCk GRANTS PROGRAmS During FY 2009, OJJDP prepared fact sheets on the Office's Formula Grants, Community Prevention Grants, Enforcing Underage Drinking Laws, and Juvenile Accountability Block Grants programs. The fact sheets provide information on authorizing legislation, eligibility, activities, training and technical assistance, and performance measures. They also feature success stories showing how program funds make a positive difference in the lives of youth and communities across the nation. O F F I C E O F J U V E N I L E J U S T I C E A N D D E L I N Q U E N C Y P R E V E N T I O N 3 7 C H A P T E R 3 OJJDP's national conference was held in Austin, TX, in October 2009. The confer - ence, entitled \"Ensuring Safe and Equal Treatment in the Juvenile Justice Sys- tem,\" addressed the four core requirements of the JJDP Act. The first part of the conference focused on deinstitutionalization of status offenders, sight and sound separation of juvenile and adult offenders in secure facilities, and the removal of juvenile offenders from adult jails and lockups. The remainder of the conference focused on systems improvement strategies and activities to reduce DMC. Performance Measures In 2009, states and territories reported data for a total of 1,431 subgrants across more than 960 separate organizations. This represents more than $81 million in funded activities. Funds were allocated to activities across many program areas; activities with the largest funding allocations included: Disproportionate minority contact (22 percent). Delinquency prevention (18 percent). School programs (9 percent). The following program areas show the types of activities that most states selected: Delinquency prevention (29 percent). Disproportionate minority contact (19 percent). School programs (10 percent). Formula Grant-funded programs served more than 244,000 youth during the reporting period. Of these youth: Sixty-seven percent completed program requirements. Fifty-seven percent exhibited a desired change in the targeted behavior.4 Eight percent offended or reoffended during the program period. Of the Formula Grant-funded programs, about 34 percent reported implement-ing at least one evidence-based program. 4 Targeted behaviors differed, depending on the youth's specific program goals. In the majority of cases, Formula Grant-funded programs targeted a reduction in antisocial behavior, improved school attendance, or increased social competence. 2 0 0 9 A N N U A L R E P O R T 3 8 OJJDP's PERFORmANCE mEASURES OJJDP's Performance measures Web page facilitates the collection and reporting of data that measure the results of OJJDP-funded programs. The page features training resources, performance-measure guidelines tailored to every solicitation, and centralized easy-to-access information. It provides an overview of performance measurement, OJJDP's performance reporting requirements and resources, and access to important federal performance measurement resources. In FY 2009, OJJDP enhanced the Web page through a new format that features more user-friendly summary data and charts. In addition, OJJDP continues to provide leadership within the Office of Justice Programs in its work to establish a stronger performance measures system throughout the agency. Online Resource For more information, visit the OJJDP Web site, ojjdp.gov (select the \"Funding\" section, then \"Performance measures\"). Compliance Progress In FY 2009, OJJDP continued its work with the states to help them achieve com- pliance with the core requirements and provide state agencies with training to meet these requirements. To this end, OJJDP held a Training of the Trainers event at the start of FY 2009; it was designed to increase the pool of state com-pliance monitors qualified to provide onsite peer-to-peer training in the area of compliance monitoring. In addition, in May 2009 OJJDP held the first of its semi-annual classroom trainings for new compliance monitors at the Office of Justice Programs in Washington, DC. OJJDP's extensive training and technical assistance continues to make a differ - ence: since the initial passage of the JJDP Act, all participating states have made significant progress in achieving compliance with its four core requirements. For example, a comparison between baseline violations (based on data submitted when a state first begins participating in the Formula Grants program) and cur - rent violations (based on data used to determine funding eligibility for FY 2009) illustrates the progress states have made: DSO violations have decreased by 97.2 percent, from 171,076 to 4,950. O F F I C E O F Separation violations have decreased 96.9 percent, from 81,810 to 2,568. Jail removal violations have decreased 96.5 percent, from 154,618 to 5,488. J U V E N I L E J U S T I C E A N D D E L I N Q U E N C Y P R E V E N T I O N 3 9 C H A P T E R 3 FEDERAL ADVISORY COmmITTEE ON JUVENILE JUSTICE OJJDP obtains advice and guidance from the states, the territories, and the District of Columbia through the Federal Advisory Committee on Juvenile Justice (FACJJ). FACJJ is an advisory body established by the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974, as amended (Section 223), and is supported by OJJDP . Its role is to advise the President and Congress on matters related to juvenile justice and delinquency prevention, to advise the OJJDP Administrator on the work of OJJDP , and to evaluate the progress and accomplishments of juvenile justice activities and projects. FACJJ comprises appointed representatives from the State Advisory Groups (SAGs) of each of the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the 5 U.S. territories. (SAGs are appointed by the Governors and assist their states in developing and implementing the juvenile justice plans their states are required to submit to OJJDP every 3 years in order to receive Formula Grant funds.) FACJJ's mandated responsibilities include preparing two annual recommendation reports\u2014one to the President and Congress, and one to the Office. Federal Advisory Committee on Juvenile Justice The majority of states continue to report minimal or no violations of the DSO, separation, and jail removal requirements. Although DMC compliance cannot be measured in terms of violations, states must show OJJDP that they are working to reduce the disproportionate number of minority youth who come into contact with the juvenile justice system, and some states are making significant progress in this area. OJJDP's DMC accomplishments are discussed below. In FY 2009, most states were qualified to receive the maximum amount of For - mula Grant funds on the basis of compliance status. (For more compliance infor - mation, see appendix B.) State progress toward achieving the goals of the JJDP Act has been significant. However, the hard work of sustaining that progress remains. OJJDP continues to provide an intensive program of training and technical assistance to help states address compliance issues.

For example, 90 percent of states currently collect and analyze data by race and ethnicity for at least half of the juvenile justice system contact points. In addition, more than 80 state and local delinquency prevention and systems improvement activities have been designated as best practices. Despite this progress, minorities remain overrepresented in the juvenile justice system. Long a leader in the nation's efforts to reduce DMC, OJJDP continues to increase the scope and number of its resources\u2014including training, technical assistance, publications, and research activities\u2014to help states address this issue. FY 2009 was a productive year for the DMC initiative and included many accomplishments. In June 2009, the Office facilitated a DMC Listening Session, which included an overview of current trends in the effort to address DMC and the implementation of best practices for delinquency prevention and system improvement. Participants were asked to discuss, among other topics, how states and territories are measuring disproportionality via the Relative Rate Index (RRI), 5 the use of objective risk assessment instruments at the various contact points, and specific examples of states and communities that have reduced or mitigated disproportionality based on process, outcome, and impact evaluations. In response to state DMC coordinators' concerns about disproportional repre- sentation youth, in FY 2009 OJJDP convened an interagency workgroup with representation from the Bureau of Justice Statistics, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and the Justice Research and Sta-tistics Association. The workgroup's primary goals are to determine the extent of DMC (particularly in states with significant AI/AN populations), to further examine how AI/AN youth are processed compared with other minority youth, to ascertain how cultural needs are addressed, to identify existing promising delinquency prevention and systems improvement strategies, and to update the Formula Grants program passthrough allocation. OJJDP conducted new DMC coordinator trainings in Washington, DC, in Janu- ary and April 2009, for coordinators from the District of Columbia, Indiana, 5 OJJDP has selected the RRI as the method for identifying disproportionate minority contact. This method involves comparing the relative volume (rate) of activity for each major stage of the juvenile justice system for minority youth with the volume of that activity for white (majority) youth. The RRI provides a single-index number that indicates the extent to which the volume of that form of contact or activity differs for minority youth and white youth. In its simplest form, the RRI is the rate of activity involving minority youth divided by the rate of activity involving majority youth. 4 1 2 0 0 9 A N N U A L R E P O R T C H A P T E R 3 Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Missouri, New York, Texas, West Virginia, and Vermont. The trainers provided information on the DMC Reduction Model and offered step-by-step assistance in implementing all five phases based on each state's specific circumstances. The Office will continue to offer these trainings as requested. OJJDP also conducted presentations and train-ings for juvenile justice and child welfare stakeholders and SAGs in Nebraska, Oregon, Virginia, and Washington. Continuing the goal of training and technical assistance, OJJDP conducted topi- cal Webinars on the RRI in March and April 2009. The purpose of the training was to provide state and local DMC coordinators, SAG members, and local DMC coalitions with the tools to successfully measure the extent of dispropor-tionality. Many states reported the Webinar format as one of the best methods to train their juvenile justice system stakeholders at no cost. In addition, the information helped states better interpret and analyze their data. OJJDP also conducted bimonthly conference calls in FY 2009 with state and local coor-dinators to discuss current and upcoming activities and provide networking and information-sharing opportunities. Also in FY 2009, OJJDP's online DMC Technical Assistance Manual was updated and expanded to address topics of importance to DMC coordinators. The chap- ter on identification of DMC was expanded to include more detailed informa-tion on how to determine the extent of disproportionality. One new chapter describes the roles and responsibilities of state DMC coordinators and another new chapter addresses efforts to provide delinquency prevention and systems improvement activities for Hispanic youth in Washoe County, NV, and Travis County, TX. In addition, OJJDP launched a new series of bulletins designed to help the juvenile justice field reduce DMC. The first bulletin in the series, Reducing Disproportionate Minority Contact: Preparation at the Local Level, describes practical and proven methods for initiating an effort to reduce DMC in local communities. More information on the bulletin series is available in chapter 5. Juvenile Accountability Block Grants Program The Juvenile Accountability Block Grants (JABG) program helps states and units of local government improve their juvenile justice systems by implement-ing accountability-based programs that focus on both juvenile offenders and the juvenile justice system. Accountability means holding a juvenile who has 4 2 O F F I C E O F J U V E N I L E J U S T I C E A N D D E L I N Q U E N C Y P R E V E N T I O N violated the law responsible for the behavior by imposing consequences commensurate with the seriousness of the offense and the youth's previous criminal history. These sanctions can include restitution, community service, victim-offender mediation, probation, electronic monitoring, incarceration, and reentry services. JABG monies also fund training and technical assistance to enhance the ability of the state and local juvenile justice systems to maintain and enhance intervention and treatment programs, track offend-ers, and process cases in a timely manner. OJJDP distributed approximately $48 million in JABG funds in FY 2009 to the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the 5 U.S. territories. In addition, OJJDP distributed approximately $1.1 million to select AI/AN tribal entities through its Tribal Juvenile Accountability Discretion-ary Grant program. Recipients must use their JABG funds to support activities in 1 of 17 program areas centered on 4 types of activities: hiring staff, building infrastructure, implementing programs, and training staff. OJJDP also provides training and technical assistance through a number of providers: The National Training and Technical Assistance Center (NTTAC) provides telephone or onsite training and technical assistance. The requests for JABG training that NTTAC received in FY 2009 were concentrated in the following areas: restorative justice, juvenile courts and probation, corrections/detention facilities and personnel, law enforcement and court personnel, information sharing, and risk and needs assessment. Approximately 324 participants received training and technical assistance in 16 states. Participants included probation officers, substance abuse treatment providers, family advocates, judges, clerks and court staff, law enforcement personnel, juvenile justice residential and detention staff, representatives of community organizations, and juvenile justice coalition members. CSR, Inc., manages the data collection and technical assistance tool, known as DCTAT, that states use when submitting JABG performance measurement data. CSR staff also provide training and support on the use of the JABG per-formance measures. The JABG Technical Support Center, established by OJJDP with assistance from the Bureau of Justice Statistics and a grant to the Justice Research and Statistics Association, provides states the data they need to calculate JABG allocations for local jurisdictions. 4 3 C H A P T E R 3 Performance Measures To assess the effectiveness of the JABG program, OJJDP developed a set of performance measures that have helped the Office, Congress, and the juvenile justice field see the progress made by, and the challenges facing, the program. During FY 2009, OJJDP continued to work with the states to collect quantitative performance measurement data. Data received are for the reporting period of April 1, 2008, to March 31, 2009. States and territories reported data for a total of 1,462 subgrants, which ac- counted for approximately $80 million in funded activities. Funds were allocated to activities across all 17 JABG program areas; the activities with the largest funding allocations included: Accountability-based programs (25 percent). Court/probation programming (16 percent). Restorative justice (9 percent). The following performance measurement data are just a few examples that illus-trate the JABG program's ongoing effectiveness: Seventy-three percent (142,101 of 195,257) of program youth exhibited a desired change in targeted behavior.6 Seventy-seven percent (99,109 of 128,827) of program youth who exited the program successfully completed program requirements. Twenty-one percent (309 of 1,462) of programs reported using an evidence-based program or practice. Twenty percent of youth reoffended during the program period. l ll SucceSS StorieS: JABG PROGRAm Public Defender Placement/Education Assistance Program Assists Young Ex-Offenders in Reentering the Community (California) The California Corrections Standards Authority used JABG funds in FY 2009 to support the Public Defender Placement/Education Assistance Program, a unique project that addresses the backlog of public defender cases in the city and county of San Francisco and also works to identify community-based alternatives and out-of-home placements for youth who would otherwise remain in custody 6 Targeted behaviors differed depending on the youth's specific program goals. In the majority of cases, JABG programs targeted a reduction in antisocial behavior, improved school attendance, or increased social competence. 2 0 0 9 A N N U A L R E P O R T 4 4 O F F I C E O F J U V E N I L E J U S T I C E A N D D E L I N Q U E N C Y P R E V E N T I O N unnecessarily. The public defender represents clients in juvenile court matters, obtains appropriate assessments of clients (including educational and mental health assessments), and builds partnerships with community-based alternatives to detention and other community services. The placement attorney works with a public defender specializing in youth advocacy to develop comprehensive reentry plans for juveniles before they return to their families or the community. This attorney also works in partnership with the courts and probation to expedite youth from detention to out-of-home placement, monitoring the progress and needs of the youth in placement. This grant has made a significant difference in the lives of youth reentering the community. Detention delays for clients in custody awaiting out-of-home placement have been reduced substantially\u2014from 3 months to 2 weeks for first-time placements. In addition, the increased attention and emphasis on developing strong reentry plans in partnership with the courts and probation before juveniles are released from placements has led to a reduction in recidivism and successful termination from juvenile court jurisdiction. TeamChild Partnerships Address Complex Needs of At-Risk Youth (Florida) JABG funds help support TeamChild, a collaborative effort between Legal Services of North Florida and the Second Circuit Public Defender's Office. The partnership provides comprehensive advocacy for youth involved in the juvenile justice system. While the public defender provides representation for the delinquency charges, Legal Services tackles underlying issues that influence children's behavior and often lead them into the juvenile justice system. The youth served have multiple needs for legal advocacy on a variety of issues, including special education, school discipline, health care, access to public benefits, housing, and dependency law. Social service support, coordinated by a social worker at the public defender's office, is an integral part of successful service delivery. The project also helps parents obtain services to assist their children, enabling the parents to keep their children at home rather than having them placed in foster care, residential treatment, or juvenile justice facilities. TeamChild reduces recidivism rates of juvenile offenders and costs for institutional care, saves the juvenile justice system and local law enforcement money, and helps children turn their lives around. The stories are as varied as the children served, but the one consistent factor that interferes with the youth's opportunity for long-term success is a failure of some support system in their lives. Following is just one example of the many success stories made possible by JABG funds: Justin is an 11-year-old boy who was arrested after he accidentally started a fire in the boys' restroom at school. Justin is borderline developmentally disabled, is language impaired, and has autistic characteristics. He was trying to unclog a soap dispenser with a lighter he found at the bus stop so he could wash his hands. According to his mother, Justin washed his hands often because of an obsessive-compulsive disorder. The school, which had never experienced major problems with Justin, had him 4 5 C H A P T E R 3 arrested and attempted to expel him by sending him to an alternative \"second-chance\" school. The TeamChild legal advocate assisted in getting the delinquency case dismissed and filed a complaint against the school board because Justin's actions were related to his disabilities. TeamChild also had a psychologist testify on Justin's behalf, and the school board agreed to reinstate Justin and provide extra therapy to address his needs. Community Prevention Grants Program OJJDP's Community Prevention Grants (CPG) program, funded through Title V Incentive Grants for Local Delinquency Prevention, has helped communities develop a comprehensive, research-based approach to delinquency prevention since 1994. The program's goal is to improve outcomes for youth by reducing risk factors and enhancing protective factors in schools, communities, and families. Extensive research has shown that risk factors increase the likelihood that a youth will engage in delinquent behavior, and protective factors help pre-vent or reduce that likelihood. For example, studies have shown that a lack of engagement in school and persistent family conflicts are highly correlated with adolescent delinquency and violence, among other serious problems. In devel-oping a program to prevent juvenile delinquency, communities often adopt a collaborative approach that includes working with schools and families to help these at-risk youth. The CPG program encourages local leaders to initiate multidisciplinary needs assessments of the risks and resources in their communities and develop locally relevant prevention plans that simultaneously draw on community resources, address local gaps in services or risks, and employ evidence-based or theory-driven strategies. In FY 2009, OJJDP awarded a total of approximately $1.8 million in grants for the CPG program, with $33,486 to most states. The JJDP Act requires grantees to garner a 50-percent funding match from the state and/or localities, thereby maximizing the chance of success for Community Prevention Grant-funded programs. Training and Technical Assistance OJJDP offers a three-part training series to help grantees write successful 3-year delinquency prevention plans. The training includes: Community team orientation, which brings together key local leaders and provides an overview of the CPG model. 2 0 0 9 A N N U A L R E P O R T 4 6 O F F I C E O F J U V E N I L E J U S T I C E A N D D E L I N Q U E N C Y P R E V E N T I O N Community data collection and analysis training, which helps participants review, analyze, prioritize, and present the data they have collected. Community planning and program development training, which shows par-ticipants how to use data to develop delinquency prevention plans and how to select appropriate strategies using the Model Programs Guide (for more information, see sidebar, \"Model Programs Guide\"). During FY 2009, more than 125 juvenile justice staff and participants received 1 or more of 5 trainings in 1 of the following locations\u2014Alaska, the District of Columbia, Michigan, New Jersey, and Vermont. Because membership in a com-munity coalition is a prerequisite for funding, training participants included community leaders, program developers, researchers, and others who are involved in mobilizing the community or in governing or serving children. The Office also provides specialized training in performance measurement and evaluation, evidence-based practices, and sustainability. The training is available to CPG subgrantees, juvenile justice specialists, and state CPG coordinators. Performance Measures During FY 2009, states and territories reported data for a total of 196 CPG sub-grants across more than 130 separate organizations, representing more than $5.7 million in subgrant and statewide awards. During this period, there were a total of 78 evidence-based programs (40 percent of the total subgrants). Of the 18 CPG purpose areas, the activities with the largest funding allocations included: Delinquency prevention (49 percent). School programs (18 percent). Disproportionate minority contact (15 percent). The following performance measurement data are indicators of the CPG program's success: Sixty-six percent (14,767 of 22,436) of program youth exhibited a desired change in targeted behavior.7 Eighty-five percent (13,571 of 16,021) of youth who exited programming successfully completed program requirements. 7 Targeted behaviors differed depending on the youth's specific program goals. In the majority of cases, CPG programs targeted a reduction in antisocial behavior, improved school attendance, or increased social competence. 4 7 C H A P T E R 3 Eight percent (211 of 2,786) of program youth reoffended during the program period.

The mPG profiles more than 200 prevention and intervention programs and helps communities identify those that best suit their needs. Users can search the database by program category, target population, risk and protective factors, effectiveness rating, program type, and other parameters. The mPG was originally developed as a tool to support OJJDP's Community Prevention Grants program; at first it concentrated on the problems of delinquency, violence, and alcohol and other drug abuse. In 2005, as part of its commitment to encourage collaboration, OJJDP expanded the mPG to incorporate evidence-based programs that target other concerns affecting at-risk and delinquent youth. To identify these programs, OJJDP partnered with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Substance Abuse and mental Health Services Administration; the National Institute on Drug Abuse; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; the U.S. Departments of Education, Housing and Urban Development, and Labor; and other agencies. As a result of this collaboration, the mPG now includes proven programs that address youth problems such as academic failure, poor interpersonal skills, tobacco use, sexual activity/ exploitation, exposure to trauma, family dysfunction, and social and community disorganization. In October 2007 , OJJDP further expanded the mPG to add strategies and programs that show promise in helping jurisdictions reduce disproportionate minority contact (DmC). The searchable DmC-reduction best practices database contains profiles of counties and states that have implemented a variety of promising strategies used to reduce DmC, such as legislative reforms, policy and procedural changes, cultural competency training programs, and risk assessment instruments. In addition, the database contains more than 70 profiles of early intervention programs, diversion programs, alternatives to secure detention and corrections, and advocacy programs. In 2009, OJJDP completed another expansion of the mPG to include strategies and programs that help jurisdictions identify and implement evidence-based initiatives leading to the removal of status offenders from secure detention or correctional facilities. The central feature of the deinstitutionalization of status offenders (DSO) best practices Web site is a searchable database containing profiles of programs and strategies in each of five major status offense categories: truancy, running away, ungovernability/incorrigibility, violating curfew laws, and violating underage drinking laws. Within these categories, programs and practices are organized into two groups: direct services that target status offenders and their families as well as system-involved youth, their families, and communities; and system change strategies that seek to modify aspects of the juvenile justice system (e.g., laws and ordinances, policies, practices) that may contribute to DSO violations. In addition to profiles of programs and strategies, the database provides useful resources, statistics, answers to frequently asked questions, and topical literature reviews.

They seek to improve outcomes for youth by collaborating with families and community agencies to address the risk factors. An afterschool prevention program in Warren County, GA, is making a significant difference in the lives of young people in that community. The program, Structured Alternative for Education (SAFE), serves 125 youth through a comprehensive array of afterschool and weekend programs focusing on academics, cultural development, recreation, and the development of life skills necessary for healthy lifestyles. The programming specifically targets at-risk youth in an effort to improve school attendance and reduce violence, drug use, teen pregnancy, juvenile delinquency, and bullying. The parents of these youth can participate in family days and parent workshops that offer detailed and current information about the risks youth face. The goal of the workshops is to help parents talk with their children about risky behaviors such as alcohol, drug, and tobacco use. In addition, SAFE helps youth understand the inappropriateness of violence and offers specific skills for engaging in disagreements without the use of violence. The program also promotes strategies for adopting a more assertive attitude in the face of peer pressure, demonstrating that youth do not need to be tolerant of their friends' behavior when those behaviors include unhealthy choices. Nine of ten youth participated in SAFE activities at least 10 hours a week for 50 weeks. Over the course of 1 year, the percentage of parents who discussed issues of drug, alcohol, and tobacco use with their children increased from 53 to 71 percent. The percentage of youth exposed to announcements, ad campaigns, or other information about this topic increased from 67 to 90 percent after 1 year in the program. Eighty-two percent of SAFE participants were absent from school fewer days than in the previous school year. The average number of missed school days decreased by more than 30 percent\u2014from approximately 6 days to approximately 4.

This chapter focuses on EUDL's block grants and training and technical assistance activities. For information about EUDL's discretionary grant activities, see chapter 2. Under the EUDL block grants program, each state, the District of Columbia, and the five U.S. territories received $360,000 in FY 2009, totaling more than $20 million. These funds are allocated to enforce state laws prohibiting the sale of alcoholic beverages to minors and to prevent the purchase or consumption of alcoholic beverages by minors. Activities funded under the EUDL program may include: Forming statewide task forces of state and local law enforcement and prose- cutorial agencies to target establishments suspected of a pattern of violations of state laws governing the sale and consumption of alcohol by minors. Creating public advertising programs to educate establishments about statu-tory prohibitions and sanctions. Developing innovative programs to prevent and combat underage drinking. EUDL funds support a wide range of activities. Many states focus on enforce- ment, emphasizing compliance checks of retail alcohol outlets. Other enforce-ment activities include crackdowns on false identification, programs to deter older youth or adults from providing alcohol to minors, party patrols to pre-vent drinking at large gatherings, \"cops in shops\" to keep minors from pur - chasing alcohol, youth-focused campaigns to enforce impaired driving laws, and investigations to determine the source of alcohol and hold the responsible party accountable for their role in an alcohol-related incident. The funds also support public education programs and innovative methods for reaching youth. The training and technical assistance component of the EUDL program has been instrumental in helping communities and states enforce underage drinking laws around the country. OJJDP's Underage Drinking Enforcement and Training Cen-ter (UDETC), managed by the Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation, pro-vides training workshops, curriculums, regional meetings, national conferences, onsite strategic technical assistance, and other resources. In FY 2009, UDETC conducted a total of 46 trainings, reaching more than 3,928 individuals in 22 states. One of the highlights of the EUDL program in FY 2009 was the 11th Annual National Leadership Conference, held in Dallas, TX, in August. The conference Underage drinking is not a harmless \"rite of passage,\" but instead an unhealthy, unsafe, and illegal act that endangers the health and safety of our nation's youth and the communities in which they live. \u2014Jeff Slowikowski Acting Administrator, OJJDP 2 0 0 9 A N N U A L R E P O R T 5 0 O F F I C E O F J U V E N I L E J U S T I C E A N D D E L I N Q U E N C Y P R E V E N T I O N included plenary sessions along with presentations by law enforcement, judi- cial members, youth, researchers, and community leaders. Speakers included OJJDP's Acting Administrator and representatives of federal, state, and local programs. The conference provided critical information about new tools, research, and technology that are available to further efforts to enforce underage drinking laws nationwide. Approximately 1,400 participants attended the conference. In addition, UDETC enhanced its outreach to the youth community in FY 2009 through the Youth Council, whose 17 members represent various rural, urban, and suburban communities. A total of 330 youth, representing 32 states, attended the national leadership conference. The Youth Council played a major role in the planning and implementation of the conference's youth track, serving as presenters, facilitators, and hosts. Performance Measures During the activity period January 1 to December 31, 2009, states and territories reported data for a total of 1,097 EUDL subgrants across 680 separate organiza-tions. In this period, states and territories reported data for approximately $50 million in subgrant and statewide awards. Nationally, funds were allocated to three program categories: coalitions, media, and enforcement. Twenty-five per-cent of subgrants focused on coalitions, 22 percent on media, and 53 percent on enforcement. Performance data for this reporting period indicate some positive trends: Seventy-five percent of funded projects are using an evidence-based model. Forty-seven percent of task forces and coalitions addressing underage drink- ing in states were created as a result of EUDL funding. Eighty-one percent of off-premise alcohol establishments checked during this reporting period were in compliance (51,879 of 63,906 establishments). Eighty-four percent of on-premise alcohol establishments checked were in compliance (30,910 of 36,741). A total of 23,074 adult citations were issued during enforcement operations conducted during this reporting period. A total of 474,186 youth were involved in task force and coalition leadership activities.

Michael was 1 of 13 South Dakota youth who died in an alcohol-related crash in the spring of 2006. That year, stories like Michael's moved South Dakota's Department of Public Safety, Department of Human Services, and Attorney General's Office to convene an action group in late 2006 to respond to the problem of underage drinking. A multifaceted, interagency strategy was implemented to develop a teen court diversion program, a school-based education program, trained prevention specialists, and community partnerships linking law enforcement, schools, and communities toward a common goal. One example of South Dakota's successful effort to intervene in and prevent underage drinking is its Teen Court Association. As an alternative to traditional court, youth are sentenced by a jury of their peers. In South Dakota, nearly 2,000 underage alcohol cases have been heard in the Teen Court Association over the past 3 years, reducing recidivism rates to less than 15 percent within 6 months of when youth complete their sentences. South Dakota's placement of trained prevention specialists in schools and communities has also proven effective; nearly 80 percent of all school districts in South Dakota and six colleges and universities are taking a stand against underage drinking and driving in support of the laws. Working together across agencies and organizations, South Dakota has reduced alcohol-related deaths by nearly 70 percent since 2006. \"Shoulder Tap\" Decoy Operation Reduces Underage Drinking (California) A recent survey conducted by the Los Angeles Police Department indicated that 46 percent of all minors who attempt to acquire alcohol use the \"shoulder tap\" method: youth stand outside a liquor store or market and ask adults to buy them alcohol. In response to that information, investigators from the California Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC) joined forces with more than 30 other law enforcement agencies on March 14, 2009, in what is considered to be the largest shoulder tap decoy operation ever conducted in California. In addition to the ABC investigators, the task force consisted of approximately 180 police officers representing more than 35 agencies. The task force operation resulted in approximately 170 citations and bookings. A total of 126 individuals were cited for furnishing alcoholic beverages to minors and another 24 were arrested for other violations, including driving under the influence, possession of illegal narcotics, probation violations, and stolen vehicle charges. 2 0 0 9 A N N U A L R E P O R T 5 2 O F F I C E O F J U V E N I L E J U S T I C E A N D D E L I N Q U E N C Y P R E V E N T I O N Those who break the law and knowingly buy beer for minors are arrested and cited with a misde- meanor, which carries a $500 fine for first-time offenders. As many as 40 hours of community service may be added to the penalty. The fine can increase to $1,500 for those with criminal records or warrants or those who commit additional crimes during the operation. A followup operation in May 2009 was equally successful. Working with local enforcement agen-cies throughout the state, ABC reported that 272 minors were cited for possession or consumption of alcohol, 128 persons were cited for selling alcohol to minors, and 142 adults were cited for pur - chasing alcohol for individuals younger than age 21. The program's success can also be measured quantitatively by the reduction in alcohol-related arrests, crimes, and calls for services. Further qualitative measures include statements of satisfaction from local officers and community mem-bers, and visible improvements in the physical condition of communities. C H A P T E R 4 C H A P T E R 4 5 4 Defending Children Against Victimization Few things are more difficult to understand than the victimization of a child. Crimes against children are committed by both family members and strangers and range from physical and sexual abuse to abduction and sometimes murder. In addition, many chil- dren witness violence in their families and communities. Two decades of research have shown that children who are victims of or witnesses to violence run a higher risk of becoming violent themselves and of being further victimized as children and as adults. The growing number of children and teenagers using the Internet and communications devices; the increase in adolescent risk-taking behavior involving technology, including the production and dissemination of sexually explicit images; the proliferation of child pornography; and the sophistication of predators who are searching for unsupervised contact with underage victims present a significant threat to the health and safety of young people and a formidable challenge for law enforcement. O F F I C E O F J U V E N I L E J U S T I C E A N D D E L I N Q U E N C Y P R E V E N T I O N 5 5 OJJDP strives to protect America's children from abuse, exploitation, and victimization. Although physical and sexual abuse of children is not a new problem, access to the Internet and the proliferation of communications technology have changed the way predators access children and changed the kinds of risks children face. Through initiatives such as the Internet Crimes Against Children program and Project Safe Childhood, OJJDP is improving the prosecution of computer-facilitated child exploitation and engaging in community outreach to educate families about risks to children who use the Internet. The Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP) took the lead early on in addressing this growing problem. More than a decade ago, the Office established the Internet Crimes Against Children (ICAC) program, which helps state and local law enforcement agencies effectively prevent, interdict, and investigate technology-facilitated child sexual exploitation and Internet crimes against children. Since its inception, OJJDP has consistently worked to safeguard children from victimization by supporting research, training, and community programs that emphasize prevention and early intervention. OJJDP activities highlighted in this chapter provide an overview of how the Office is improving the responses of the justice system and related systems, increasing public aware-ness, and promoting model programs for addressing child victimization in states and communi-ties across the country. 2 0 0 9 A N N U A L R E P O R T 5 6 O F F I C E O F J U V E N I L E J U S T I C E A N D D E L I N Q U E N C Y P R E V E N T I O N Do you know what your kids do online? One in seven kids receives sexual messages online. Those messages can come from anyone. . .Protect your kids by talking to them regularly and monitoring their online activity. \u2014Project Safe Childhood public service announcement Project Safe Childhood The Department of Justice (DOJ) established the Project Safe Childhood initiative in May 2006 to improve the prosecution of computer-facilitated child exploita-tion and to enhance community outreach to educate families about risks to chil-dren over the Internet. The initiative coordinates the efforts of U.S. Attorneys; ICAC task forces; federal partners, including the Federal Bureau of Investiga-tion, U.S. Postal Inspection Service, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and the U.S. Marshals Service; national organizations such as the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC); and state and local law enforcement officials in each U.S. Attorney's district. As part of the Project Safe Childhood initiative, OJJDP launched a national media campaign in FY 2009 to combat the online exploitation of children. OJJDP's media campaign used a combination of public service announcements (PSAs) in English and Spanish on national cable television channels, in print ads, and in Internet promotions. Regional promotions\u2014radio spots, movie theater PSAs, and media events\u2014were held in four cities: Miami, FL; St. Louis, MO; Seattle, WA; and San Diego, CA. The PSAs promoted two themes: one reminded parents that the Internet can be an unsafe place for children and that children should be supervised when online. A second set of ads was aimed at men ages 18 to 40 to deter would-be sexual predators from using the Internet to entice minors into engaging in illegal sexual behavior. OJJDP supported numerous other efforts in FY 2009 to raise public awareness about the potential dangers of the Internet. OJJDP sponsored the conference, \"Possibilities: Creating a Safer Future for Our Children,\" in Springfield, MA, in June 2009. The conference, hosted by Western New England College, offered training and information on Internet safety and other topics such as family abduction, bullying, human trafficking, and gangs. In April, OJJDP staff partici-pated in a Webcast hosted by the Department of Health and Human Services' Maternal and Child Health Bureau, \"Preventing Exploitation of Children and Adolescents on the Internet.\" Online Resource To learn more about Project Safe Childhood, go to projectsafechildhood.gov. Internet Crimes Against Children Program Since 1998, the ICAC program has been helping state and local law enforcement agencies develop an effective response to cyberenticement and child pornogra-phy cases. This program encompasses investigative and forensic components, training and technical assistance, victim services, and community education through public awareness and prevention programs. 5 7 2 0 0 9 A N N U A L R E P O R T C H A P T E R 4 The ICAC program includes a national network of 61 coordi- nated task forces representing more than 2,000 federal, state, and local law enforcement and prosecutorial agencies. These agencies conduct proactive investigations, forensic exami-nations, and prosecutions. By helping state and local law enforcement agencies develop effective and sustainable responses to online child victimization and child pornogra-phy, OJJDP and the ICAC program have built capacity at the local level to address related offenses. In FY 2009, ICAC task forces received 27,890 reports of technology-facilitated child sexual exploitation from the public and from electronic service providers. Investigations initiated from these reports led to 3,783 arrests, forensics examinations of more than 19,260 computers, and 6,100 case referrals to other law enforcement agencies. A major source of reports reviewed by ICAC task forces is NCMEC's CyberTipline, which handles phone calls and online reports of sexual exploitation of children. The CyberTipline has received more than 868,290 reports since the system was activated in 1998. In FY 2009, OJJDP awarded approximately $75 million under the ICAC program; $50 million of those funds were allocated through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The funds have supported the activities of the exist-ing ICAC task forces, the establishment of two new task forces in the high-need areas of New York and Houston, training and technical assistance for the task forces, and research on the scope and consequences of technology-facilitated child exploitation. The ICAC Training and Technical Assistance Program, funded through a coop- erative agreement with Fox Valley Technical College, provides training and technical assistance to the task force agencies. Training is designed for ICAC task force members as well as affiliated law enforcement agencies, prosecutors, and parole/probation officers. Courses include the ICAC Investigative Techniques Program, ICAC Undercover Chat Investigations Training Program, ICAC Unit Supervisor Training Program, ICAC Trial Advocacy Program for Prosecutors, ICAC Child Sex Offender Accountability Training Program, and ICAC CyberTip Management Program. Nearly 100,000 law enforcement officers, prosecutors, and other professionals have been trained throughout the United States and in 17 countries around the world on techniques to investigate and effectively pros-ecute ICAC-related cases. In FY 2009, the ICAC program trained approximately 31,800 law enforcement personnel and 2,000 prosecutors. One highlight of 2009 was the ICAC training event, \"Silicon Valley Internet Crimes Against Children Conference,\" held in May in San Jose, CA. The event 5 8 O F F I C E O F J U V E N I L E J U S T I C E A N D D E L I N Q U E N C Y P R E V E N T I O N included information sessions on the latest ICAC investigation methods, pros- ecution strategies, case studies, and the latest practices used by online offenders. The event was cosponsored by OJJDP; more than 600 law enforcement and pros-ecution staff from across the United States attended.

Safe Start Initiative Children who witness or are the victims of violence are more likely to eventu- ally abuse drugs and alcohol. They are at greater risk for depression, anxiety, and other posttraumatic disorders and they are more likely to commit acts of violence themselves. Through its Safe Start initiative, OJJDP has played a central role in calling national attention to this issue and raising awareness of the social costs of children's exposure to violence. As noted in chapter 1, OJJDP launched the Safe Start initiative in 1999 to broaden knowledge about and promote community investment in evidence-based strategies for reducing the impact of children's exposure to violence. The initiative's Safe Start Center serves as a national resource for information and training to communities that are implementing these strategies. The Safe Start initiative is expanding partnerships among family- and youth- serving agencies that are responsible for addressing early childhood education and development, health, mental health, child welfare, family support, substance abuse prevention and intervention, and domestic violence and crisis interven-tion. These partnerships include law enforcement, the courts, and legal services. Each component of the Safe Start initiative is designed with a specific goal: Practice and Innovation has expanded the system of care to children exposed to violence. Research and Evaluation is identifying what works and what does not work in lessening and preventing the harmful effects of exposure. Training and Technical Assistance is building a base of effective strategies to address children's exposure to violence. Resource Development and Outreach is promoting the adoption and use of these strategies across the nation. 5 9 C H A P T E R 4 In 2009, through interagency agreements with the National Institute of Justice and the Department of Health and Human Services' Children's Bureau, respec-tively, OJJDP awarded $300,000 to the Rand Corporation and $300,000 to the Safe Start Center for training and technical assistance, resource development, and outreach. Also in FY 2009, OJJDP completed its National Survey of Children's Exposure to Violence (NatSCEV) with assistance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. NatSCEV is the first comprehensive attempt to measure children's exposure to all types of violence in the home, school, and community across age groups from birth to age 17 and the first attempt to measure the cumula-tive exposure to violence over a child's lifetime. The reports of lifetime exposure indicate how certain types of exposure change and accumulate as a child grows up. In interviews conducted by the University of New Hampshire's Crimes Against Children Research Center from January to May 2008, NatSCEV gathered data on both past-year and lifetime exposure to violence across a number of categories, including physical assault, bullying, sexual victimization, child maltreatment, dating violence, and witnessed and indirect victimization. Researchers found that 60 percent of children were exposed to violence, crime, or abuse in the past year, either directly or indirectly. Almost half that number were assaulted at least once in that period. One in ten had suffered some form of child maltreatment\u2014abuse or neglect\u2014and 1 in 16 was victimized sexually. Almost 40 percent of all children experienced two or more direct victimizations in the previous year. The results of the study were published in October 2009 in the OJJDP bulletin, Children's Exposure to Violence: A Comprehensive National Study. For more information on the bulletin, see chapter 5. With support from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, OJJDP awarded approximately $441,000 to the University of New Hampshire for NatSCEV in FY 2009.

Additional information is available on the Safe Start Center Web site, safestartcenter.org. Promoting Child and Youth Safety In FY 2009, OJJDP funded a new discretionary program, Promoting Child and Youth Safety: Community Initiatives and Public Awareness. The program will support field-initiated local child and youth safety demonstration projects in 2 0 0 9 A N N U A L R E P O R T 6 0 O F F I C E O F J U V E N I L E J U S T I C E A N D D E L I N Q U E N C Y P R E V E N T I O N multiple communities and leverage investment in those communities by devel- oping public awareness campaigns that disseminate safety messages to the broadest possible audience. OJJDP awarded a total of $3.29 million in grants to support these goals. The Office provided $1.74 million to support community initiatives aimed at promot-ing child and youth safety. Outreach efforts and programming will target youth homelessness, children's exposure to violence, the prevention of sexual abuse, teen dating violence, the reduction of risk factors for children in underserved or nonserved populations, and technology safety. These projects provide compre-hensive training, curriculums, educational programming, and direct services. OJJDP also awarded $1.55 million to fund a public awareness campaign tailored to local community initiatives. The public awareness campaign is designed to be replicated in many jurisdictions. Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children The commercial sexual exploitation of children (CSEC) involves crimes of a sexual nature committed against juvenile victims for financial or other economic reasons. These crimes include trafficking for sexual purposes, prostitution, sex tourism, mail-order-bride trade and early marriage, pornography, stripping, and performing in sexual venues such as peep shows or clubs. CSEC is not only illegal, it brings about significant and, at times, life-threatening physical, mental, and emotional harm to the victimized youth. In FY 2009, OJJDP supported new initiatives, expanded training and technical assistance efforts, and funded new research projects to address CSEC. OJJDP awarded the Fund for the City of New York more than $1.27 million to support a national study of the incidence of CSEC. This is the first national-scale data col-lection effort on CSEC since 2003. The study will estimate the size and scope of CSEC, describe the characteristics and needs of CSEC victims, identify available services, and analyze prosecution outcomes for victims and exploiters. Another new initiative\u2014Improving Community Response to CSEC\u2014will provide $500,000 to three communities to strengthen effective collaborations between stakeholder organizations and, ultimately, enhance the effectiveness of community response. The expanded training and technical assistance effort will provide training to the three communities as well as to the ICAC program. Fol-lowing are brief descriptions of the communities receiving OJJDP awards: The Interagency Children's Policy Council of Alameda County, CA, will support the work of the Sexually Exploited Minor's Network, a collabora-tion between the county's public and private providers. The program aims 6 1 C H A P T E R 4 to offer comprehensive training and education to increase awareness about and promote effective responses to CSEC in the community, street outreach to identify and connect high-risk youth to shelter and essential services, expanded case management and other specialized services, and a collabora-tive case-conferencing model to strengthen and improve the investigation and prosecution of CSEC cases. Specific objectives include increasing the number of collaborative cases and convictions against adults who exploit children, reenrolling youth in school or preparing them for employment, and decreasing substance use. Case management files, collaborative case logs, training logs, and surveys will be used to document and measure outcomes. Kristi House, Inc., a Children's Advocacy Center (CAC), received a grant to address the problem of CSEC in Miami-Dade County, FL, and to expand this project to other Florida cities in partnership with the Florida Department of Children and Families and other CACs in the state. The project will work through the Kristi House-led CSEC Working Group, which consists of 35 agencies. Once trained by OJJDP, Working Group members will develop a systemwide protocol, disseminate training, adopt best practices for address-ing CSEC, and improve capacity to effectively investigate and prosecute cases against adults who exploit youth. The project also seeks to strengthen the capacity of Kristi House's CSEC program, Project GOLD (Girls Owning their Lives and Dreams). The goal is to identify and serve an increasing num-ber of exploited and at-risk girls. Project GOLD provides best-practice mental health counseling and coordinates other essential services through compas-sionate and culturally sensitive case management and advocacy. Multnomah County, OR, will use its OJJDP grant to improve local capacity to address CSEC and build on current collaborative efforts. Project staff will provide training to 250 individuals from at least 50 local agencies using a training framework supplied by OJJDP; increase the identification of CSEC victims by community partners; increase the availability of essential services for at least 70 CSEC victims, including advocacy, emergency housing, mental and physical health services, and the investigation and prosecution of per - petrators of CSEC; and promote collaboration between Multnomah County partners to assess local need and provide interventions. National Center for Missing & Exploited Children OJJDP funds the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children, which provides 24-hour services and support to families, children, law enforcement agencies, and federal agencies dealing with missing and exploited children. In FY 2009, the Center received 89,359 calls and assisted in the recovery of 13,348 children. 2 0 0 9 A N N U A L R E P O R T 6 2 O F F I C E O F J U V E N I L E J U S T I C E A N D D E L I N Q U E N C Y P R E V E N T I O NAs noted earlier in this chapter, NCMEC also manages the CyberTipline, which allows computer users and service providers to report Internet-based child pornography and exploitation. During FY 2009, the CyberTipline handled more than 108,000 reports regarding potential child exploitation or online harm to children. The Child Victim Identification Program (CVIP), a mechanism to identify vic- tims of child pornography, was used to identify more than 890 children in por-nographic images and videos during FY 2009. To date, there are a total of 2,598 identified child victims in the CVIP system. NCMEC also is a key participant in the annual National Missing Children's Day commemoration and the AMBER Alert program, both described below. Online Resource To learn more about NC mEC , visit its Web site at missingkids.com. Missing Children's Day In May 2009, DOJ held its annual commemoration of National Missing Chil- dren's Day with a ceremony at DOJ's Great Hall in Washington, DC. The cer-emony honors the memory of missing children and recognizes the extraordinary efforts made by law enforcement personnel and citizens to protect children from harm. The Deputy Attorney General provided the keynote address and the Act-ing Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Justice Programs (OJP) presided over the ceremony. Awards were presented to law enforcement officers and citizens who were instrumental in the recovery of missing children during the previous year. In 1983, President Ronald Reagan proclaimed May 25 as National Missing Chil- dren's Day in memory of Etan Patz, a 6-year-old boy who disappeared from a New York City street corner on that day in 1979. Missing Children's Day honors his memory and the memory of children who are still missing, celebrates the sto-ries of recovery, and pays tribute to the exemplary efforts of agencies, organiza-tions, and individuals engaged in protecting children. AMBER Alert The AMBER Alert program, which marked its 13th anniversary in 2009, had helped recover approximately 490 abducted children nationwide by the end of FY 2009. AMBER Alerts are media notices that are broadcast on radio, television, highway signs, and wireless devices such as mobile phones, and over the Inter-net when a law enforcement agency determines that a child has been abducted 6 3 C H A P T E R 4 OJJDP PROmOTES CHILD ABUSE PREVENTION AT NATIONAL CONFERENCES During FY 2009, OJJDP's Child Protection Division staff participated in national conferences on the topic of child abuse prevention to discuss OJJDP's efforts to protect children and share strategies for reducing children's exposure to violence. The Associate Administrator of the Child Protection Division spoke at the 25th National Symposium on Child Abuse, held by OJJDP's National Children's Advocacy Center in Huntsville, AL, in march 2009. more than 900 child abuse prevention professionals attended the symposium. OJJDP sponsored several workshops during the conference, including Family and Nonfamily Abductions, Human Trafficking, Interview/Interrogation of Child Abuse Suspects, Physical and Neglect Child Abuse Injury Reconstruction Techniques, Rural Child Abuse, and Child Death Investigations. OJJDP funded scholarship awards for 150 participants. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services sponsored the 17th National Conference on Child Abuse and Neglect in Atlanta, GA. During the 6-day conference in late march and early April 2009, OJJDP staff made a presentation on how the Safe Start initiative decreases risk factors and increases protective factors for children exposed to violence in their homes and communities. The presentation was made during the session, Addressing Exposure to Violence as a Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect Strategy. OJJDP staff conducted a workshop at the 10th annual National Conference on Child Sexual Abuse and Exploitation Prevention in August 2009 in New Orleans, LA. The workshop featured an overview of OJJDP programs designed to protect children from online exploitation and abuse. The overview highlighted OJJDP's multimedia public awareness campaign launched in early FY 2009. The campaign's public service announcements, available in both English and Spanish, were presented. The National Conference on Child Sexual Abuse and Exploitation Prevention is the leading conference of its kind in the United States. and is in imminent danger. The broadcasts provide information about the child and the abductor that could lead to the child's recovery, such as a physical description of each and a description of the abductor's vehicle. All 50 states, the District of Columbia, and 2 U.S. territories have AMBER Alert plans. OJP man-ages the program with the support of OJJDP. In FY 2009, $5 million was appro-priated for the program. AMBER Alert activities include annual national training conferences and local and regional training on topics such as Child Abduction Response Teams (CARTs) and investigative techniques. The fifth annual AMBER Alert conference, held in October 2008 in Orange County, CA, brought together CART members; AMBER Alert coordinators; broadcasters; missing-child clearinghouse coordinators; tribal, law enforce-ment, and transportation leaders; and representatives from Canada, Mexico, the United Kingdom, Greece, France, Belgium, and the Netherlands. The conference included training tracks divided by discipline and region. Some sessions were 2 0 0 9 A N N U A L R E P O R T 6 4 devoted to southern- and northern-border states and to participants working to bring AMBER Alerts to Indian country. Family members of child abduction vic-tims also participated in roundtable discussions. Broadcasters and other AMBER Alert partners received training coordinated through Newsplex, the scenario-based training facility in Columbia, SC. AMBER Alert partners also strategized on how to maintain and expand their child abduction response plans during a time when state budgets are shrinking. The sixth annual AMBER Alert conference was held in Tampa, FL, in October 2009. The conference focused on the latest information on human trafficking, CARTs, uses of new technology, border coordination, and the use of AMBER Alerts in tribal communities. Efforts are currently underway to bring the AMBER Alert program into Mexico through the AMBER Alert Southern Border Initiative. NCMEC reports that Mexico accounts for 47 percent of all international child abductions from the United States. Hundreds of federal, state, local, and tribal law enforcement offi-cers from the United States and Mexico met in El Paso, TX; and San Diego, CA, in February and August 2009, respectively, to receive training and to discuss efforts to stop child abductions in both countries. In May 2009, Baja California became the first state in Mexico to have an AMBER Alert plan. A second state, Tamaulipas, appointed an AMBER Alert coordinator immediately after the 2009 AMBER Alert symposium was held. Through a cooperative agreement with Fox Valley Technical College, OJJDP provided 10 CART training and technical assistance programs to 563 partici-pants in 2009. Participating agencies were encouraged to review existing poli-cies and practices and ways in which interagency and regional cooperation could improve casework involving missing and abducted children. Participants received guidance on creating memorandums of understanding, resource inven-tories, and action plans to guide them through the development of a CART, thereby building a foundation for improving response capacity, resource coordi-nation, and child-recovery capabilities in their jurisdictions.

The suspect left the residence with the child and fled in a vehicle. Because he was known to be violent and possibly a drug user, an AMBER Alert was quickly issued. An individual who knew the abductor saw the AMBER Alert and contacted law enforcement. The child was safely rescued. In Flagstaff, AZ, the father of a 6-year-old boy refused to return the child to his mother at the court-appointed time after a visit. Law enforcement officials telephoned the father to follow up. The father issued a threat: \"If you don't hear from me in one hour, my son and I will be dead.\" The father then called the judge involved in his case and made a similar threat. An AMBER Alert was quickly issued. A Mohave County deputy sheriff who lived next door to the father recognized his vehicle, and a SWAT call was initiated on the residence. The suspect later turned himself in. The child was rescued after he was found in the residence unharmed. In Pleasanton, CA, the Alameda County sheriff's department activated a regional AMBER Alert on behalf of the Pleasanton police department for a 2-month-old boy who was taken by force by his father and the child's uncle. The child's grandmother observed the AMBER Alert on the local news and contacted the suspects to arrange for their surrender. The suspects turned themselves in to the Antioch police department, and the child was safely rescued. In Bradenton, FL, an AMBER Alert was issued for a 12-year-old girl who may have been lured from her home by an adult male, possibly through Internet contact. The suspect saw the AMBER Alert, became alarmed, and dropped the victim off close to her home. The suspect was later identified and arrested. AMBER Alert in Indian Country In 2007, OJP launched its AMBER Alert in Indian Country pilot program in 13 tribal communities in Arizona, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Caro-lina, Oklahoma, Washington, and Wyoming. The program supports the recovery of missing and abducted children by providing infrastructure and equipment resources to meet the needs of tribal communities. During FY 2009, OJJDP built on the recent development of AMBER Alert plans in these communities by offer - ing a range of critical training and technical assistance programs. In FY 2009, 12 of the 13 pilot sites had adopted or were in the process of adopt- ing AMBER Alert programs, either alone or in cooperation with state and local authorities, and 12 of the 13 sites had passed tribal resolutions or ordinances adopting the AMBER Alert program. All of the participating tribal communities were developing their own CARTs or participating with local agencies that have CART programs. An additional 10 tribal communities, which were not initial pilot sites, also created their own CART programs. 2 0 0 9 A N N U A L R E P O R T 6 6 O F F I C E O F J U V E N I L E J U S T I C E A N D D E L I N Q U E N C Y P R E V E N T I O N Each of the sites received an allocation to help procure the resources needed to implement an AMBER Alert plan. Allocations were based on several characteristics, including community needs assessments, tribal population, adoption of a tribal resolution to create an AMBER Alert plan, and participation at AMBER Alert in Indian Country train- ings and meetings. The tribes used the allocations to obtain software, canine units, personal alert and messaging systems, digital boards, vehicles, trailers, and cell phones, among other resources. In addition, NCMEC provided printers, scanners, fax machines, and cameras donated from sponsors. In FY 2009, more than 700 tribal community members, government leaders, first responders, child protection officials, and law enforcement officials attended training and technical assistance programs to improve skills and capacity related to a wide range of child protection needs. Interest in the AMBER Alert in Indian Country initiative continues to grow; by the end of FY 2009, tribal communi-ties made approximately 50 requests for technical assistance for FY 2010. OJJDP established a goal of implementing AMBER Alert plans in an additional 25 tribal communities in 2010. Also in FY 2009, OJJDP conducted an assessment of AMBER Alert operations in Indian country and concluded that inadequacies in communications and information-management technology significantly hamper the ability of tribal law enforcement agencies to respond to reports of missing, abducted, and endan-gered children and other life-threatening emergencies. Call-taker training was cited as a significant need throughout tribal communities. OJJDP has responded to this need by developing a program of instruction specially designed for emer-gency call takers in Indian country. The training program was launched in the fall of 2009. Children's Advocacy Centers OJJDP's Children's Advocacy Centers (CACs) help coordinate the investiga-tion, treatment, and prosecution of child abuse cases. Recognizing that child abuse is a multifaceted problem, CACs involve multidisciplinary teams of professionals\u2014child protective and victim advocacy services, medical and men-tal health agencies, and law enforcement and prosecution\u2014to provide a contin-uum of services to victims and nonoffending family members. Working together, these professionals gain a more complete understanding of each case, allowing them to identify the most effective response to instances of child abuse. OJJDP has long recognized the efficacy of the CAC model and has provided program 6 7 C H A P T E R 4 funding to expand access to CACs and their valuable services through the Vic - tims of Child Abuse Act of 1990. In FY 2009, $20 million was appropriated for the program. The National Children's Alliance (NCA) serves as the national accrediting and membership body for CACs and administers federal grants to develop and improve these advocacy centers. In collaboration with NCA, the National Chil - dren's Advocacy Center (NCAC) and four regional CACs\u2014in the Midwest, Northeast, South, and West\u2014work in close partnership to encourage communi - ties to establish local CACs and to provide existing centers with training, techni - cal assistance, and other services. Recent OJJDP-sponsored research has demonstrated that CACs are more cost effective than alternate approaches, shorten the length of time to disposition in child abuse cases, increase the likelihood that abused children will receive medical and mental health services, and improve caregiver satisfaction with the investigative and prosecutorial process. In 2009, more than 700 CACs served 259,000 child victims and treated approximately 400,000 children with preventive measures. The CAC model is gaining international attention as a proven strategy for responding to child abuse. As of the end of FY 2009, CACs (or CAC-like pro - grams) existed in 12 countries, with interest growing rapidly around the world. In addition to training and technical assistance in the field, OJJDP offers a wide range of online resources. NCAC's Child Abuse Library Online, which dissemi - nates new research and recommendations for practitioners, currently has more than 450 registered users. In addition, NCAC offers a total of 19 online trainings, all of which are available at no cost. These trainings were viewed by more than 1,500 professionals in 2009. In March 2009, OJJDP funding helped launch the Telehealth Institute for Child Maltreatment, a Web-based peer review system for medical providers associated with CACs. Participating providers upload nonidentifying (anonymous) case information to a secure server in order to receive peer feedback on diagnostic findings, exam techniques, and photo documentation. More than 100 medical providers from 26 states have registered to participate in the program.

Authorized by the Victims of Child Abuse Act of 1990, as amended, OJJDP administers funding to the National CASA Association, which directs that a \"court- appointed special advocate shall be available to every victim of child abuse or neglect in the United States that needs such an advocate.\" OJJDP partners with National CASA to provide fund- ing for state CASA organizations and new program development as well as expansion of CASA programs and training and techni- cal assistance to volunteer advocates, child welfare professionals, attorneys, judges, and social workers. National CASA also helps state CASA organizations build their capacity to pro-vide services to local programs. The program makes subgrant funds available to local programs to support court-appointed special advocates who provide advocacy for abused and neglected children in the court system. These trained volunteers, also known as guardians ad litem, serve as fact finders, monitors, facilitators, and advocates in cases where there are charges of child abuse and neglect in dependency proceedings. The National CASA Association serves as a resource center, providing support and information dissemination services. FY 2009 OJJDP funding for the CASA program totaled nearly $15 million, of which $11 million supported state and local programs and almost $4 million supported training and technical assistance. More than 70,900 CASA volunteers served more than 237,000 abused and neglected children through 1,055 program offices. CASA volunteers have helped more than 2 million abused children since the first program was established in 1977. In 2009, CASA provided a variety of training and technical assistance activities on topics such as program development, management, volunteer recruitment and supervision, resource development, public relations, child advocacy, court practices, legal and liability issues, case management, and data collection. Also in 2009, the CASA program responded to more than 38,720 requests for technical assistance, including 42 onsite consultations. The CASA Web site recorded more than 2.1 million visitors.

Developed, managed, and guided by the National Council of Juvenile and Family Court Judges (NCJFCJ) with funding from OJJDP, the project provides tailored training and technical assistance to Model Court jurisdictions and engages in cutting-edge national program, policy, and initiative development. Each Model Court leads local system reform by selecting short-term improve- ment goals that are based on proven practices. As a result of the work of the participating courts, programs that have proven to be effective in a single juris-diction have now become nationwide efforts. In addition, some of the nation's largest jurisdictions have experienced significant reductions in foster care case-loads. Following are just a few examples of improvements resulting from the Model Courts project: In Chicago's Cook County juvenile court, the number of children in out-of- home care was reduced from 31,534 to 7,102 between 1998 and 2009. During the same period, the number of children in out-of-home care in New York City's family court was reduced from 40,909 to 14,589. In Los Angeles County juvenile court, the number of children under court jurisdiction decreased from 47,420 to 24,768. OJJDP supports NCJFCJ's Courts Catalyzing Change: Achieving Equity and Fairness in Foster Care initiative (CCC), a national agenda to reduce the dis-proportionate representation of and disparate outcomes for children of color in dependency court systems. The program is identifying and evaluating all deci-sion points in the dependency court system and recommending strategies for court and systems change to reduce racial disproportionality and disparate treatment. The Model Courts program also maintains an active publications program to educate the juvenile justice field on best practices for improving outcomes for children in the dependency court system. The following publications were released in 2009: Better Outcomes for Infants and Toddlers: Judicial Survey on Infants and Toddlers and the Dependency Court System, Summary of Findings Report. This report pres- ents the data gathered from a judicial survey on current knowledge about infant development and identifies barriers and action steps for judges to take in serving very young children. 2 0 0 9 A N N U A L R E P O R T 7 0 Court Reform and American Indian and Alaskan Native Children: Increasing Pro- tections and Improving Outcomes. This publication recommends improvements in data collection and collaboration between courts and public agencies in meeting the unique needs of American Indian/Alaska Native children in dependency court cases. The Model Court Effect: Proven Strategies in Systems' Change. This report high- lights the work of the Victims Act Model Courts and provides data outcomes associated with best practices used in the courts. Model Courts National Agenda Implementation Guide. This handbook offers helpful step-by-step advice on how to successfully put a national CCC agenda into effect. It includes guidance on creating collaborative partner - ships, sharing information, and developing a strategic plan.

The Office dissemi- nates data on juvenile crime and the response of the juvenile justice system, including informa-tion about juvenile arrests, detention and corrections populations, probation caseloads, and court activities. OJJDP's Survey of Youth in Residential Placement (SYRP), Census of Juveniles in Residential Placement (CJRP), and Juvenile Residential Facility Census (JRFC) provide the most comprehensive statistics available on youth in custody. The Office uses a full range of media to reach the widest possible audience. These outlets include comprehensive online data systems; a Web site featuring the latest information about research, programs, and funding; an award-winning online newsletter; a listserv that alerts subscribers to important funding opportunities, publications, and events; and a broad array of online and print publications. O F F I C E O F J U V E N I L E J U S T I C E A N D D E L I N Q U E N C Y P R E V E N T I O N 7 3 OJJDP is a leading and authoritative source of information on juvenile justice issues. The Office disseminates information about research findings, juvenile justice statistics, and promising programs through comprehensive online databases, Web sites, Webinars, and a wide range of print and online publications. Sharing Research Findings OJJDP's research activities provide valuable information about many critical issues facing prac- titioners and policymakers. The Office recognizes that these findings need to be widely dissemi-nated if they are to be used to improve outcomes for the nation's children. During fiscal year (FY) 2009, the Office shared research findings with the field through a number of online and print publications as well as conferences. Girls Study Group Bulletin Series As noted in chapter 1, OJJDP convened the Girls Study Group (GSG) in response to the ris-ing arrest rates for girls. Through its research, GSG aims to gain a better understanding of the dynamics of girls' delinquency and guide policy development regarding female juvenile offend-ers. OJJDP works closely with the GSG to broadly disseminate the major findings from the study group's activities. The Office is currently publishing a series of bulletins highlighting the major findings of the GSG research. 2 0 0 9 A N N U A L R E P O R T 7 4 O F F I C E O F J U V E N I L E J U S T I C E A N D D E L I N Q U E N C Y P R E V E N T I O N The first two bulletins in the series received significant media coverage: Charting the Way to Delinquency Prevention for Girls, which provides an overview of the GSG research, was featured in an article in USA Today. The findings of Violence by Teenage Girls: Trends and Contexts, an examination of recent trends in girls' vio- lent offending and the settings in which girls commit violent crimes, were dis- cussed in an article in The Atlantic Monthly magazine and other media outlets. In FY 2009, OJJDP released the third bulletin in the series, Resilient Girls\u2014 Factors That Protect Against Delinquency. This publication describes how four factors\u2014the presence of a caring adult, school connectedness, school success, and religiosity\u2014affect girls' propensity for delinquency. The bulletin draws on data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, which was inspired in part by efforts to understand more clearly the unique needs and experiences of girls. Although many of the factors that place boys and girls at risk for delinquency are the same, current literature suggests that each gen- der may respond differently to protective factors. Following are brief descriptions of other upcoming bulletins in the GSG series: Suitability of Assessment Instruments for Delinquent Girls determines the extent to which assessment instruments used with at-risk and justice-involved youth are equally appropriate and effective in assessing girls and boys. Causes and Correlates of Girls' Delinquency reviews the personal, family, peer, school, and community factors that can lead to delinquency among girls. Developmental Sequences of Girls' Delinquent Behavior investigates the different patterns of delinquent behaviors in which girls become involved and pro-vides insight into the life pathways that lead to girls' delinquent behavior. Girls' Delinquency Programs: An Evidence-Based Review examines delinquency prevention programs for girls and determines whether these programs effec-tively intervene in girls' delinquency.

Survey of Youth in Residential Placement Bulletin Series OJJDP sponsors the nation's most comprehensive data collection program on juvenile offenders in custody and the facilities that hold them. Through a con-stellation of surveys\u2014which include SYRP, CJRP, and JRFC\u2014the agency pro-vides critical information to state and national researchers and policymakers 7 4 7 5 2 0 0 9 A N N U A L R E P O R T C H A P T E R 5 who are investigating and seeking answers to major policy and practice ques- tions affecting youth in residential placement, and disseminating those findings to the field. While CJRP and JRFC gather critical data from residential facility administrators, SYRP interviews juveniles directly, providing an unprecedented view of their experiences in custody. By interviewing the youth directly, SYRP is able to address issues that no other information source covers. Using computer-assisted self-interviews, SYRP asks youth about their current offenses and also about their previous involvement in the juvenile justice sys-tem, providing a comprehensive picture of the types of juvenile offenders and the direction of any recent changes in the severity of their offense categories. The survey includes questions about the youth's family backgrounds (their principal caregiver(s) when they were growing up and who they lived with before their most recent entry into custody) and about their educational status and experi-ences. The responses reveal the youth's achievements, whether they are on track academically (i.e., at an age-appropriate grade level), have special needs, or have received sanctions. In addition, the survey obtains information about the facility environment and youth's experiences in the facility. By eliciting the perspectives of youth on a spectrum of issues, the SYRP findings offer a richly detailed view of the population of juveniles in residential placement. To help practitioners, policymakers, and the public better understand SYRP, OJJDP has launched a bulletin series that describes the study and its findings in detail. In October 2008, OJJDP released the first bulletin in the series, Intro- duction to the Survey of Youth in Residential Placement, which reviews SYRP's background and history, describes its design and methodology, discusses its strengths and limitations, and summarizes the questions it answers about the population of youth in custody. The remaining bulletins in the series, planned for release in FY 2010 and FY 2011, will describe research in each of the survey's topic areas: Youth's Needs and Services presents key findings on the emotional and psychological problems, substance abuse issues, medical needs, and edu- cational background of youth in residential placement, as well as the services provided by residential facilities to address these issues. Conditions of Confinement describes the physical features of juvenile facili- ties, rates the quality of available programs, and reports on access to various social, emotional, and legal supports at the facilities. Youth's Characteristics and Backgrounds summarizes current offenses and youth's previous involvement in the juvenile justice system, and provides data on offenders' family backgrounds. 7 6 O F F I C E O F J U V E N I L E J U S T I C E A N D D E L I N Q U E N C Y P R E V E N T I O N Nature and Risk of Victimization provides information on the percentages of youth who report victimization experiences while in custody, including theft, robbery, physical assault or threat, and sexual assault, and how these prob-lems were addressed. Online Resource Introduction to the Survey of Youth in Residential Placement may be viewed and downloaded on the OJJDP Web site, ojjdp.gov (select the \"Publications\" section). Disproportionate Minority Contact Bulletin Series As noted in chapter 3, OJJDP has long been a leader in efforts to reduce dispro- portionate minority contact (DMC) with the juvenile justice system. As part of its goal to ensure that states comply with the DMC core requirement of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974, as amended, OJJDP has com-mitted to technical assistance, national and regional training conferences, and publications that disseminate strategies that states can use to reduce DMC. In FY 2009, OJJDP launched a new series of bulletins focusing on DMC. The first bulletin in the series, Reducing Disproportionate Minority Contact: Preparation at the Local Level, presents important information about the context in which local preparation takes place\u2014media coverage and public attitudes about crime, race, and youth. Preparation at the local level is critical to understanding the roles, values, priorities, and joint missions of local stakeholders as they begin to reduce DMC. Included among the topics planned for future bulletins are how DMC affects American Indian/Alaska Native, Asian/Pacific Islander, and Hispanic/ Latino youth and an update on OJJDP's DMC activities. National Survey of Children's Exposure to Violence Bulletin Series As described in detail in chapter 4, OJJDP maintains an active program of research, training, and technical assistance designed to improve the effective-ness of community programs that address the issue of children's exposure to violence. The Attorney General has set this issue as a top priority for the U.S. Department of Justice. A key component of OJJDP's outreach effort is the publi-cation of information based on its research. In FY 2009, OJJDP initiated a new National Survey of Children's Exposure to Violence (NatSCEV) bulletin series, the first of which, Children's Exposure to Violence: A Comprehensive National Survey, was published in October 2009. It sum- marizes the results of the most comprehensive study to date on the impact of children's exposure to violence. The study was sponsored by OJJDP with the support of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. We simply cannot stand for an epidemic of violence that robs our youth of their childhood and perpetuates a cycle in which today's victims become tomorrow's criminals. \u2014Attorney General Eric Holder 7 7 C H A P T E R 5 The study's findings, first released in the journal Pediatrics, were widely covered in the national print and broadcast media, including the Chicago Sun-Times; The Christian Science Monitor; the New York Post; USA TODAY; The Wall Street Journal; National Public Radio; CBS Evening News; CNN Newsroom; and NBC Nightly News. OJJDP's bulletin series will examine a broad range of issues from the survey data, including co-occurrence of family violence, risk factors for exposure to violence in the community, multiple victimizations, and correlates of victim-ization and mental health. Bulletins will highlight key findings from these various analyses for practitioners, researchers, and policymakers working on behalf of youth and families experiencing or at risk of violence. Also in FY 2009, OJJDP's Safe Start Center published Healing the Invisible Wounds: Children's Exposure to Violence. The guide, available in English and Spanish, offers tips on how to recognize the signs of children's exposure to violence and gives advice on assisting children who have been exposed. Exposure to violence is a pervasive problem that crosses all ages; the guide provides specific information pertaining to children of various ages as well as a list of resources.

ASC Annual Meeting During the 60th annual American Society of Criminology (ASC) conference in St. Louis, MO, in early FY 2009, OJJDP announced the public release of more than a decade of data from the agency's juvenile corrections data collections. The data\u2014available for the first time to the general research community\u2014are providing critical information to state and national researchers who are inves-tigating and seeking answers to major policy and practice questions in juvenile justice and disseminating those findings to the field. The data collection released includes CJRP data from 1997 to 2006 and JRFC data from 2000 to 2004. CJRP provides detailed information on all juveniles in resi-dential facilities in the United States, including gender, date of birth, race, most serious offense charged, court adjudication date, admission date, and security status. JRFC collects information on how facilities operate and the services they provide, including detailed information on facility security, crowding, injuries and deaths in custody, facility ownership, operation, and services. 2 0 0 9 A N N U A L R E P O R T 7 8 O F F I C E O F J U V E N I L E J U S T I C E A N D D E L I N Q U E N C Y P R E V E N T I O N National Juvenile Corrections Data Workshop As a followup to OJJDP's release of data from the agency's juvenile correc- tions data collections at the ASC conference (see \"ASC Annual Meeting\" above), OJJDP and the National Archive of Criminal Justice Data at the University of Michigan held a workshop, Using National Juvenile Corrections Data Files: 1997-2006, as part of the Inter-University Consortium for Politi-cal and Social Research's Summer Program in Quantitative Methods of Social Research. Held in Ann Arbor, MI, this inaugural workshop made a wealth of national data from OJJDP's data collections available to researchers and practi-tioners and provided participants with the tools necessary to understand and use the data appropriately. Statistical Briefing Book OJJDP has primary responsibility for developing and disseminating statistical information on the juvenile justice system and does so through several mecha- nisms. OJJDP funds the National Juvenile Court Data Archive, which provides information about cases handled by courts with juvenile jurisdiction. OJJDP established the Archive at the National Center for Juvenile Justice (NCJJ) to provide automated juvenile court data sets. NCJJ produces several annual sta- tistical reports for OJJDP based on Archive data and manages the content for the Statistical Briefing Book (SBB) on OJJDP's Web site. SBB provides a wealth of information for practitioners, policymakers, the media, and the public. This online tool has current statistics about juvenile crime and victimization and about youth involved in the juvenile justice system. SBB is especially reliable because data are continually updated, ensuring that users receive timely information. The site includes a \"Frequently Asked Questions\" section, publications, data analysis tools, and national data sets. SBB has become a primary source of information on juvenile crime and juvenile justice for indi-viduals in the United States and throughout the world. During FY 2009, there were more than 618,000 visits to the SBB site and more than 4.5 million page views. SBB uses Easy Access, a family of Web-based data analysis tools that NCJJ developed for OJJDP to expand access to recent, detailed information on juve-nile crime and the juvenile justice system. The Easy Access applications provide information on national, state, and county population counts, as well as infor-mation on homicide victims and offenders, juvenile court case processing, and juvenile offenders in residential placement facilities. The Statistical Briefing Book is a great tool for faculty and students. The site is easy to navigate, and the information is timely and important. Also, the site provides us with the opportunity to examine data, develop our own tables, and try to determine what the trends are. \u2014Alida V. Merlo, Ph.D. Professor, Department of Criminology Indiana University of Pennsylvania Indiana, PA 7 9 C H A P T E R 5 OJJDP recently added the application, Easy Access to NIBRS: Victims of Domestic Violence, which allows users to analyze state-level data on victims of domestic violence based on information collected by the Federal Bureau of Investigation's (FBI's) National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS). With this application, users can explore the characteristics of domestic violence victims, including demographic information on the victim (age, sex, and race), victim injury, and the victim-offender relationship. Data are based on incidents reported in 2005 from law enforcement agencies in 26 states. In FY 2009, SBB was enhanced to provide easier, faster access to information. Direct links to several popular data analysis tools have been added. A new \"Did You Know?\" section offers current facts and information every time users visit the home page. The \"What's New\" section is now featured at the top of the page to facilitate user access to the most up-to-date information. Finally, the site has a new design and color scheme that coordinate with other components of OJJDP's Web resources. Following are a few examples of other FY 2009 SBB updates that are ensuring users have quick access to the most comprehensive, accurate, and up-to-date juvenile justice data available: The \"Easy Access to FBI Arrest Statistics\" section has been updated to include data for 2006. This section presents juvenile arrest statistics for 29 offense categories at the national, state, and county level. Users can select displays based on counts or rates for juveniles, adults, or all ages combined. The \"Frequently Asked Questions\" section has been updated for the topical areas of Law Enforcement and Juvenile Crime, Juvenile Population Charac-teristics, and Juveniles in Corrections. Juvenile Arrests 2007 summarizes 2007 juvenile crime and arrest data reported by local law enforcement agencies across the country and cited in the FBI report, Crime in the United States, 2007. This annual OJJDP bulletin character - izes the extent and nature of juvenile crime that comes to the attention of the justice system and allows readers to compare trends over time. The Juvenile Court Statistics 2005 report was also added to SBB in FY 2009. Devel- oped and produced by NCJJ, the report is one of the nation's oldest justice statis- tical publications, dating back to 1929. This edition describes delinquency cases handled between 1985 and 2005 and petitioned status offense cases handled between 1995 and 2005 by U.S. courts with juvenile jurisdiction. Courts with juvenile jurisdiction may handle a variety of matters, including child abuse and neglect, traffic violations, child support, and adoptions.

As noted earlier in this chapter, the Census of Juveniles in Residential Placement (CJRP) and the Juvenile Residential Facility Census (JRFC), administered by OJJDP in alternate years, provide comprehensive data on juveniles in custody and the facilities that house them. In addition, the Survey of Youth in Residential Placement asks youth about their background and experiences in custody. Facilities included in these data collections represent a wide range of facility types: secure and nonsecure, as well as publicly operated (state and local) and privately operated (including long-term and short-term holding). Juvenile facilities go by many different names across the country: detention centers, juvenile halls, shelters, reception and diagnostic centers, group homes, wilderness camps, ranches, farms, youth development centers, residential treatment centers, training or reform schools, and juvenile correctional institutions. Some look like adult prisons or jails, some look like campuses, and others look like houses. This section highlights key findings from the 2007 CJRP and 2008 JRFC and briefly summarizes information on deaths of juveniles in custody from the 2008 JRFC. Juvenile Residential Facility Census A total of 2,458 facilities reported holding juvenile offenders on the 2008 census date. Facilities could identify themselves in more than one category: 734 were detention centers, 210 were training schools, 64 were reception/diagnostic centers, 661 were group homes, 847 were residential treatment centers, 85 were ranch/wilderness camps, 167 were shelters, and 31 were boot camps. The number of juvenile offenders in residential placement in publicly and privately operated juvenile facilities has declined steadily since 2000. In 2008, there were fewer than 81,000 juvenile offenders housed (263 per 100,000 youth age 10 through states' upper age of juvenile court jurisdiction in the general population). The last time that so few juvenile offenders were counted in the national census of juvenile facilities was in 1993, when the tally was slightly less than 79,000. The 2000 JRFC registered the largest population of juvenile offenders in residential placement\u2014108,802\u2014since the data collection expanded in 1974 to include private facilities. The number of juvenile offenders in residential placement in publicly and privately operated facilities dropped 26 percent in 2008 from its peak in 2000. Characteristics of Juveniles in Residential Placement The biennial CJRP provides a 1-day \"snapshot\" of youth held in public and private juvenile detention and correctional facilities; it includes offense, gender, race, age, and other data. The following highlights are primarily from the census conducted on October 24, 2007. Overview Near ly 87,000 youth\u2014279 per 100,000 juveniles in the general population\u2014were held in public and private juvenile residential facilities on the 2007 census date. Of this number, 83,150 were held for delinquency offenses and 3,664 were held for status offenses. Tribal facilities reported an additional 113 youth held. O F F I C E O F J U V E N I L E J U S T I C E A N D D E L I N Q U E N C Y P R E V E N T I O N 8 7 C H A P T E R 5 Nearly 7 of 10 juvenile offenders in residential placement had been adjudicated and committed to the facility by the court. Almost 3 of 10 were detained in a facility waiting for their case to be completed or awaiting placement elsewhere. Slightly more than one-third of youth in residential placement were there because they were charged with or adjudicated for a person offense. About a quarter were held for a property offense, approximately 15 percent for technical violations of probation or parole, 12 percent for public order offenses, 8 percent for drug offenses, and 4 percent for status offenses. The most common delinquent offenses were assault and burglary. The most common status offense was ungo vernability.

Weapons and other public order offenses accounted for about a quarter of tribal youth in residential placement, followed by drug offenses other than trafficking and aggravated assault (about 1 in 10 each). Gender and Age Males dominate the juvenile residential placement population. The ratio of males to fem ales is more than six to one. Nearly 12,000 female juvenile offenders were in residential placement on the 2007 census date\u2014accounting for 14 percent of all offenders held in public and private facilities. The female proportion was 13 percent in public facilities and 15 percent in private facilities. Approximately 36 percent of female offenders in residential placement were housed in facilities that were holding females only\u2014this represents 15 percent of all facilities, and the females they held were about 5 percent of the total offender population in placement. In contrast, 59 percent of males were in male-only facilities, which constituted 52 percent of facilities, and the males they housed were 51 percent of the total offender population. Female juvenile offenders in residential placement tend to be a bit younger than their male counterp arts. In 2007, juveniles age 15 or younger accounted for 39 percent of females in custody, compared to 30 percent of males. The median age for males was 16; for females it was 15. Race More than 57,000 minority youth were in residential placement on the 2007 census date\u2014representing 66 percent of all offenders held, with non-Hispanic black youth accounting for 41 percent of the population. Nationally, the residential placement rate was highest for black youth and lowest for Asian youth. For every 100,000 black juveniles living in the United States, 767 were in a juvenile facility on the 2006 census date; the rate was 540 for American Indians, 326 for Hispanic youth, 170 for Whites, and 85 for Asians. The overall juvenile residential placement population decreased 17 percent between 2001 and 2007. The decline for White youth was 29 percent, more than triple the decline among minority youth, which declined 9 percent.

OPD also provides leadership and direc- tion for OJJDP's research and training and technical assistance efforts and over-sees the agency's communications and planning activities. Communications Unit The Communications Unit (CU) is responsible for OJJDP's information dissemi- nation and outreach. CU develops OJJDP publications, manages its Web site and online services, and performs a range of writing and editing functions to support the Office. CU also serves as a liaison to the Office of Justice Programs on media-related issues. Child Protection Division The Child Protection Division (CPD) develops and administers programs related to crimes against children and children's exposure to violence. It provides lead-ership and funding in the areas of enforcement, intervention, and prevention. CPD's activities include supporting programs that promote effective policies and procedures to respond to the problems of missing and exploited children, Internet crimes against children, abused and neglected children, and children exposed to domestic or community violence. Demonstration Programs Division The Demonstration Programs Division (DPD) provides funds to public and private agencies, organizations, and individuals to develop and support programs and replicate tested approaches to delinquency prevention, treatment, and control in areas such as mentoring, substance abuse, gangs, truancy, chronic juvenile offend-ing, and community-based sanctions. DPD also supports and coordinates efforts with tribal governments to expand and improve tribal juvenile justice systems and develop programs and policies that address problems facing tribal youth. State Relations and Assistance Division The State Relations and Assistance Division (SRAD) provides funds to help state and local governments achieve the system improvement goals of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974, as amended; combat underage drinking; implement delinquency prevention programs; address disproportionate minority contact; and support initiatives to hold juvenile offenders accountable for their actions. SRAD also supports and coordinates community efforts to identify and respond to critical juvenile justice and delinquency prevention needs. Grants Management Unit The Grants Management Unit (GMU) provides grant administration assistance and guidance to OJJDP's program divisions. GMU also provides technical assis-tance and support for grant application and award activities to OJJDP staff and constituents. 9 5 A P P E N D I X B State Compliance With JJDP Act Core Requirements The Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention's (OJJDP's) Formula Grants program supports state and local efforts in planning, operating, and evaluating projects that seek to prevent at-risk youth from entering the juvenile justice system or intervene with first-time and nonserious offenders to provide services that maximize their chances of lead-ing productive, successful lives. The program also provides funds to enhance the effectiveness of the juvenile justice system. To receive funding, states must commit to achieving and maintaining compliance with the four core requirements of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (JJDP) Act of 1974, as amended: deinstitutionalization of status offenders, separation of juveniles from adults in secure facilities, removal of juveniles from adult jails and lockups, and reduction of disproportionate minority contact within the juvenile justice system. If a state, despite its good faith efforts, fails to demonstrate compliance with any of the core requirements in any year, OJJDP will reduce its formula grant for the subsequent fiscal year by 20 percent for each requirement for which the state is noncompliant. The following table indi-cates (in blue) the states that received reduced FY 2009 funding for noncompliance with one or more of the JJDP Act's core requirements. 2 0 0 9 A N N U A L R E P O R T 9 6 FY 2009 Funding Reductions for Noncompliance State1 Deinstitutionalization of status offenders Separation of juveniles from adults in secure facilities Removal of juveniles from adult jails and lockups Reduction of disproportionate minority contact Alabama Alaska Arizona Arkansas X X California Colorado Connecticut Delaware District of Columbia Florida Georgia Hawaii Idaho Illinois Indiana Iowa Kansas Kentucky Louisiana Maine Maryland Massachusetts Michigan Minnesota Mississippi X X Missouri Montana Nebraska Nevada New Hampshire New Jersey New Mexico New York North Carolina X North Dakota Ohio O F F I C E O F J U V E N I L E J U S T I C E A N D D E L I N Q U E N C Y P R E V E N T I O N A P P E N D I X B 9 7 State1 Deinstitutionalization of status offenders Separation of juveniles from adults in secure facilities Removal of juveniles from adult jails and lockups Reduction of disproportionate minority contact Oklahoma Oregon Pennsylvania Rhode Island South Carolina X South Dakota Tennessee Texas Utah Vermont Virginia Washington X West Virginia Wisconsin Wyoming2 - - - - American Samoa X Guam Northern Mariana Islands Puerto Rico3 X X - Virgin Islands X X = reduced FY 2009 funding for noncompliance; = full FY 2009 funding for compliance. 1 The term \"state\" means any state of the United States, the District of Columbia, and the five U.S. territories. 2 Wyoming does not participate in the Formula Grants program. 3 The U.S. Census Bureau has exempted Puerto Rico from reporting racial statistics. 2 0 0 9 A N N U A L R E P O R T UU U.S. .S. .S.
