When done with the right support from an acupuncturist near me, detoxing can help improve your digestion, immune function, fertility, and many other aspects of your health. Store bought colon cleanse products or a juice cleanse won't really do the job, though. A [detox program with acupuncture](https://myartofwellness.com/new-years-cleaning-detox/) and Chinese herbs will do more to optimize your health than just a [detox diet](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/detox-diets-why-to-do-one-what-to-eat) will. When we recommend our Detox Program at Art of Wellness, we are not talking about fasting or detox drinks, like a master cleanse. The goal of our program is to detoxify the organ systems of the body: it's a liver detox, kidney cleanse, lungs, heart, and spleen. This is a [full body cleanse](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/how-to-detox-your-body#1.-Limit-Alcohol) designed to give you a health reset. According to TCM philosophy, your body knows how to repair and renew itself, but it cannot do this job when it is congested and out of balance. In TCM, we have a broad concept of what \"toxins\" are and how they can affect our bodies and our health. Toxic chemicals that come from our [environment](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18075622/), such as food additives, pesticides, cleaning products, and [beauty and hygiene products](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/features/harmful-chemicals-in-personal-care-products/) are certainly part of the problem. Drugs, medicines, alcohol, and unhealthy foods can also be toxic. So can behavioral habits, like sitting and looking at our [screens and devices](https://www.verywellmind.com/why-and-how-to-do-a-digital-detox-4771321) too long. But our own bodies produce toxins, too. The waste products our organs create are \"toxic,\" and if they are held in the body too long without being adequately cleared out, they can negatively impact organ function. Imbalances in the system can cause conditions of excess heat or phlegm, which can lead to all kinds of problems with both your physical and [mental health](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-improve-mental-health-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). [Stress](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-stress-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/), lack of sleep, and extreme emotions can also contribute to toxic conditions in the body and mind. When the organ systems are out of balance, the body is under constant pressure to keep functioning, but we do not feel our best. Signs you need to detox include: [Fatigue](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-fatigue-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), low energy, tired all the time - Foggy head, [memory problems](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-amnesia-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), [trouble concentrating](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-adhd-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) - Constipation - Trouble sleeping, [insomnia](https://myartofwellness.com/what-we-treat/insomnia/) - Weight gain - Hair loss - Hormone imbalances - Signs of rapid aging - Skin rash, [acne](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-acne-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) - Fingernails are brittle, lined symptoms](https://myartofwellness.com/what-we-treat/menopause/) retention, edema, swelling in extremities [Inflammation](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-reduce-and-prevent-inflammation/) is largely created by toxic conditions in the body, and most pain conditions and chronic illnesses stem, at least in part, from inflammation somewhere. Why You Need a Liver Detox In conventional medicine, we think of the liver as being a sort of filter that removes toxins from the blood and helps metabolize fat. In TCM theory, we consider the liver to be the storehouse and distributor of blood; therefore, it also plays a crucial role in the menstrual cycle. The liver is also strongly connected to a person's emotional life. Stress, lack of sleep, too much sugar, alcohol, fatty, fried foods, pharmaceutical medicines, and recreational drugs all tax the liver above and beyond what it needs to do just to keep the blood flowing to nourish the body. When too many demands are placed on the liver, it can cause all kinds of symptoms, including: fatigue, insomnia, and headaches. Feelings of anger, frustration, anxiety, and irritability may arise. Conversely, when a person is feeling bitter and resentful, and isn't able to express it, those unresolved emotions may begin to cause trouble with liver function. Just as the liver governs the blood, in TCM, the kidneys govern the water of the body, controlling elimination through the bladder, and maintaining [blood pressure](https://myartofwellness.com/what-we-treat/hypertension/) by keeping the right amount of water in the bloodstream. Signs that the kidneys are not balanced include: [problems with blood pressure](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-high-blood-pressure-with-acupuncture-tcm/), edema, puffiness in the face or extremities, [UTIs](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-uti-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), chronic fatigue, and [menopause symptoms](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-menopause-symptoms-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), like dryness and hot flashes. Detoxing the organ systems, including the liver and kidneys especially, can help rejuvenate the digestion and allow better nutrition to reach all parts of the body, as the quality and flow of blood and other bodily fluids will be improved. Making sure that your excretory system is in good working order before starting a cleanse is important. If you are already having problems with constipation, for example, we will want to make sure we get things moving before we start cleansing the organs. Our detox also focuses on the body's largest excretory organ: the skin. Top 10 Reasons To Detox It is a good idea for everyone to detox periodically; detoxing every six months is reasonable for most people. Sometimes we will specifically recommend a detox for a patient when they are struggling with a particular health problem, or if they are planning a [pregnancy](https://myartofwellness.com/what-we-treat/pregnancy-support/). Detoxing can help: - Boost Immunity - a cleanse will help get your lymphatic system, which produces and transports immune cells and removes waste from cells, moving, improving the efficacy of your immune system. - Break Free From [Addiction](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-addiction-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/)- if you are ready, a commitment to the detox program and food plan can help you end patterns of [substance abuse](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5153313/), drug use, alcohol addiction, [smoking](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-quit-smoking-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), and other types of dependency. [Infertility](https://myartofwellness.com/infertility-faqs/)- We often advise people who come to Art of Wellness for [fertility treatment](https://myartofwellness.com/fertility-treatment-plans/)to begin with the Detox Program. Not only will this help increase the chances of conception occurring, whether naturally or with the aid of ART, but it will also lay the foundation for your child's health in the future. [Improve sleep](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-sleep-better-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/)- This works both ways. In order for the body to do its routine daily work of removing toxic waste, it needs plenty of sleep. The Liver, in particular, is working hard through the night to clean and deliver fresh blood to the cells. Sleeping on your side enhances your body's ability to do this work, allowing the internal organs to drain properly. When your body is functioning well, your sleep will be of better quality, more restful and refreshing. [Improve skin](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-aging-skin-with-cosmetic-acupuncture/)and hair - Dull eyes and skin, dark circles or bags, puffiness, and thinning hair are signs of stagnant blood and Qi. Nutrients from the right foods and Chinese herbs help to nourish the skin, and clear heat, dampness, and dryness. When old cells are removed, hair and eyes can shine again.

Detoxing the liver and kidneys will help your body metabolize fat better. - Balance hormones - severe [PMS symptoms](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-pms-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), stomach](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-bloated-stomach-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/)and mood [infertility in men (oligospermia)](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-oligospermia-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/)can all be improved when hormone function improves. Acupuncture treatment can also help relieve conditions like [PCOS](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-polycystic-ovarian-syndrome-pcos-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), [fibroids/leiomyoma](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-leiomyoma-of-the-uterus-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), and [endometriosis](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-painful-periods-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/)for women, and [BPH in men](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-bph-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). - Reduce inflammation - many illnesses and pain conditions are inflammatory in nature.

Think of the metaphor of a house that needs to be deep-cleaned; there are dark corners of the body that have been ignored for a while, where dust and cobwebs have gathered. The Detox program reaches into these pockets of stagnation, sweeps them clean, and makes sure they get some fresh air and sunlight shining on them, in the form of invigorated Qi and blood. - Acupuncture Treatments - the primary goal of acupuncture treatments during the detox phase is to get Qi moving freely, remove blockages, and to assist in elimination of toxins from the body. - Cupping Treatment - the TCM modality of cupping creates a vacuum-like suction that moves Qi and blood from the innermost parts of the body outwards.

[ How to Treat Celiac Disease With Acupuncture and TCM ](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-celiac-disease-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) [bloated and abdominal pain? Unintentional weight loss, fatigue, rashes](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-dermatitis-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/)? These can all be signs of [Celiac disease](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/celiac-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20352220). Different from food allergies, [Celiac](https://www.beyondceliac.org/celiac-disease/gut-reaction-video/how-celiac-disease-is-triggered/) is a serious autoimmune disorder that can lead to malnutrition and other debilitating health problems. TCM herbs and acupuncture treatment offer a good alternative way of managing Celiac disease and [gluten intolerance](https://www.acupuncturetoday.com/mpacms/at/article.php?id=32696) symptoms. In recent years, you have probably heard a lot of people saying they are switching to a gluten free diet because they have a gluten allergy or gluten intolerance. Sometimes people may just be trying to see if they feel better when they cut out wheat products, or they are going on a low carb diet to help them lose weight. Other people may be experiencing symptoms like diarrhea and nausea and hope that going on an [IBS diet](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-manage-ibs-diet-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) will help. What is gluten? Gluten is a protein that is present in some grains, including wheat, barley, and rye. When a person has Celiac disease, gluten is perceived by the immune system as a dangerous foreign substance, triggering an immune response. Antibodies (white blood cells) are produced as a reaction to gluten entering the body, and the antibodies end up causing inflammation and damage to the inside of the intestinal tract. This damage to the small intestine is called villous atrophy, and this is what causes inflammation and malabsorption of nutrients, leading to the myriad symptoms of Celiac. Celiac symptoms vary widely, and can include both digestive problems, and other conditions, like anemia, that stem from the lack of proper nourishment to the body. There is such a thing as a true [wheat allergy,](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/wheat-allergy/symptoms-causes/syc-20378897) which for some people causes respiratory problems like [difficulty breathing](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-asthma-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) and nasal congestion, and other [allergy symptoms](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-allergy-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) like swelling and itching around the mouth and throat, [hives](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-hives-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) or other itchy skin rashes, and [headaches](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-headaches-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). Wheat allergies are a response to chemical compounds in wheat, which is found in a wide variety of food products. In some cases, exposure to wheat can cause anaphylaxis, which requires emergency medical attention because it can involve trouble breathing and swallowing, chest tightening, throat swelling, [dizziness](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-dizziness-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), and fainting. Some doctors now recognize [gluten intolerance](https://www.verywellhealth.com/gluten-sensitivity-vs-celiac-disease-562964) or non-celiac gluten sensitivity as a separate condition from Celiac disease. For some people, gluten causes an immune response and symptoms, but not the same kind of damage to the intestines that Celiac does. If gluten intolerance is suspected, then following a gluten free diet for a period of time and noticing if symptoms clear up is usually the recommended course of action. Celiac disease tends to run in families, and so is considered to be passed genetically. People can begin to show signs of Celiac at any age. It is [estimated](https://www.beyondceliac.org/celiac-disease/facts-and-figures/) that at least 1% of the population has Celiac disease, but that number may be significantly higher, as it is still not a very well understood condition. Many people who have Celiac disease are unaware of it, or have been misdiagnosed with other conditions. Researchers believe that the incidence of Celiac disease is increasing worldwide, probably due to some environmental factors. Acupuncture and TCM herbs provide a holistic way to treat Celiac disease, relieving the painful symptoms and providing detailed guidance for lifestyle and dietary changes that can help people manage Celiac and gluten intolerance. Nutrition is considered to be one of the primary branches of TCM, along with acupuncture and herbs. A TCM practitioner will be able to give you dietary recommendations far beyond just telling you to eat gluten free foods. Top 10 Celiac Disease Symptoms People can experience a variety of gluten intolerance symptoms, including digestive problems, allergy symptoms like skin rash, and other symptoms related to nutritional deficiency, like anemia and weight loss. Signs of gluten intolerance may be different in children, who are more susceptible to malnourishment that can lead to a failure to thrive. [Celiac symptoms](https://celiac.org/about-celiac-disease/symptoms-of-celiac-disease/) include: [Fatigue](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-fatigue-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) - Weight loss - Diarrhea, stools, foul-smelling, fatty, greasy stool - Abdominal bloating, bloated stomach, gas, stomach pain, abdominal pain - Nausea, vomiting - Constipation - Headache, headaches, [migraines, migraine headaches](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-migraine-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/) - Skin rash, mouth ulcers, mouth sores, canker sores [Neuropathy, numbness or tingling in hands and feet](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-neuropathy-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), problems with balance, joint pain - Cognitive problems, foggy head, [difficulty concentrating](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-adhd-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) Celiac can lead to [anemia, iron deficiency](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-anemia-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), loss of bone density (osteoporosis), weak bones, soft bones, bone loss (osteopenia), [joint pain, or arthritis](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-arthritis-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). People can also have liver problems, including fatty liver. Dermatitis herpetiformis is a specific type of skin rash that causes itching and blisters to appear, primarily on the knees, elbows, torso, top of the head, and buttocks. Women may find that celiac disease affects their [hormones, menstrual periods](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-pms-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), and can have an impact on [fertility](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-infertility-in-women-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), even causing recurrent [miscarriages](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-prevent-miscarriage-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). Celiac disease can also contribute to [infertility and low sperm count in men](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-oligospermia-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). When a child develops celiac disease, the inability to absorb nutrients from food can cause problems with normal growth, such as short stature, delayed puberty, and damage to tooth enamel. Developmental disorders and behavioral issues can also be related to celiac, like [ADD/ADHD](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-adhd-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) and irritability. In extreme cases, Celiac can cause [seizures](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-seizures-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). Celiac Disease Diagnosis and Treatment Going through the process of being diagnosed with Celiac disease or gluten intolerance is quite complicated and involves multiple tests. From the medical standpoint, it is best that you do not eliminate gluten or change your diet before the testing, so that it can accurately show how gluten is affecting your immune system and your intestines. First, you will probably have a blood test that looks for certain antibodies that would indicate an autoimmune reaction to gluten. Some people may test negative for antibodies, and yet still have Celiac, though, so this blood testing is not enough to be conclusive. Genetic testing may be done, which looks for specific antigens to rule out Celiac. If testing shows that a person has antibodies, and they also have a specific type of skin rash (dermatitis herpetiformis), that is usually enough for a doctor to give an official diagnosis of Celiac disease. Endoscopy is an imaging test which uses a little camera to see if there is damage to the intestinal lining. They will also take some tissue samples from the lining of the intestine to check for inflammation and damage. The results of these tests may lead to a formal Celiac diagnosis. People will often need to have an endoscopy to find out if they have Celiac disease, and then possibly repeated endoscopies to see if the inflammation is getting better or worse. Sometimes people will try figuring out what is going on themselves with a food sensitivity test or food intolerance test kit that you can do [at home](https://www.healthline.com/health/food-sensitivity-test#our-picks) and send in for results. Food allergy testing may give you some information as to whether you have a reaction to a specific allergen (egg allergy, milk allergy, peanut allergy, shellfish allergy) or have a food sensitivity, but they cannot tell you if you really have Celiac disease or gut inflammation. Going through the diagnostic process for autoimmune diseases like Celiac disease can be exhausting in and of itself. Meanwhile, you aren't yet getting [treatment](https://celiac.org/about-celiac-disease/treatment-and-follow-up/) for your symptoms. The only treatment available in conventional medicine for Celiac disease really is to follow a gluten free diet. Most doctors are not able to do much beyond give you a list of foods you shouldn't eat, or refer you to a dietitian. TCM has the ability to provide more comprehensive [care for people with Celiac disease](https://www.acufinder.com/Acupuncture+Information/Detail/Can+Acupuncture+Help+Patients+with+Celiac+Disease+), and many other autoimmune conditions. Acupuncturists are highly trained professionals when it comes to offering patients detailed guidance for following an effective Celiac disease diet. Can Acupuncture Help Celiac Disease and Gluten Intolerance? TCM has more to offer than just acupuncture treatment and herbal medicine. Nutrition is one of core competencies every TCM practitioner must master. Acupuncture treatment can help relieve digestive symptoms like abdominal pain and bloating, and also have a positive impact on the system malfunctioning that leads to autoimmune reactions. With Chinese herbs, we are able to get very potent nutrients into the body that wouldn't normally come from food. For people with Celiac, or other problems like food allergies or sensitivities, malnutrition due to malabsorption is a real problem. A [TCM nutrition](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3315874/) approach can help restore the body's health with foods and herbs better than a simple elimination diet for Celiac disease can. An acupuncturist listens carefully to the particular symptoms and sensations you describe. These provide important clues as to which organ systems are involved, and where yin and yang are out of balance. Then TCM provides a framework for tailoring the treatment and food plan for Celiac disease to each individual's needs. According to TCM theory, the stomach and spleen are responsible for digesting food. Celiac disease symptoms are, according to a typical TCM diagnosis, related to a spleen deficiency. When Qi in the spleen is weak, the body is not getting the nutrients it needs. Building up the strength of the spleen will often be the focus of the acupuncture portion of the treatment. Herbs and specific nourishing foods will be recommended, which will help anemia and soothe the digestive tract. Acupuncture Near Me For Celiac Disease, West Los Angeles Autoimmune diseases like Celiac disease can be especially frustrating because they seem to take over your whole life. Not only physical health, but mental health is compromised. Treatment options are limited. Fortunately, TCM offers a complementary form of medicine that is able to provide multi-faceted care for autoimmune disorders like can help reduce feelings of [anxiety](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-anxiety-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/) and [depression](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-depression-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) as you learn to manage your illness. If you or someone you know has been suffering from digestive issues, and you suspect it may have something to do with gluten intolerance or Celiac disease, be prepared to go through testing, but also give some thought to adding a TCM provider to your health care team. At Art of Wellness, we have over 35 years of providing excellent care through TCM treatments, including expert nutrition services. It is like getting an acupuncturist and dietitian in one. *This article is for education from the perspective of Traditional Chinese Medicine only.

[ How to Treat Addiction With Acupuncture and TCM ](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-addiction-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) By Qineng Tan, L.Ac, Ph.D. & Xiaomei Cai, L.Ac., Ph.D. Are you, or is someone you love, struggling with alcohol addiction or some other substance abuse problem? Alcoholism, drug [addiction](https://www.asam.org/Quality-Science/definition-of-addiction), and other issues like porn addiction problems or food addiction can be helped with TCM treatment. [Acupuncture for addiction](https://myartofwellness.com/acupuncture-for-addiction/) can help people overcome the physical symptoms of alcohol withdrawal, and help them deal with the mental and emotional aspects of substance abuse recovery. Drug use, drinking, and smoking are behaviors that are widely practiced and deeply ingrained in our modern society. If we consider tobacco smoking and alcohol consumption in addition to \"harder\" drugs, then over 60% of the population uses some type of addictive substance on a regular basis. [Substance use disorders (SUDs)](https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/addiction/what-is-addiction) are a major health concern worldwide. It is [estimated](https://drugabusestatistics.org) that over 20 million Americans are currently suffering from some type of addiction to drugs or alcohol. While addiction can happen to people of all ages, young people are especially at risk for substance abuse. When teens and young adults start binge drinking or abusing drugs, it can have a serious effect on their brain development and increase their chances of developing a substance abuse problem. More recently, the surge of opioid use has dramatically increased the number of people who are dangerously dependent on prescription painkillers or deliberately misusing opioid medications like fentanyl or Oxycontin. People can become [addicted to opioid medications](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/drug-addiction/symptoms-causes/syc-20365112) in a short period of time. Accidental overdose is one of the leading causes of death in the U.S., which has contributed to the recent decline in average life expectancy. Even moderate drinking and use of recreational drugs can affect a person's overall health, sleep habits, and [fertility](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-oligospermia-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). There are many benefits to reducing your alcohol consumption, or choosing to go through an alcohol detox or a designated period of sobriety, like \"Sober October\" or \"Dry January.\" A TCM herbal detox with acupuncture treatment can help improve your vitality and get rid of nagging health issues. If you know you have a serious problem with addictive behaviors, though, you will probably need some sort of treatment and support system to help you get sober and recover physically and mentally from substance use disorder. What Causes Addiction? When we talk about [addiction](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/addiction), we are usually referring to the relationship of the body and mind to psychoactive substances such as: alcohol, nicotine, marijuana, heroin, cocaine, amphetamines, methamphetamine, hallucinogens, etc. The chemical composition of these substances causes them to have a profound [effect on the brain chemistry](https://newsinhealth.nih.gov/2015/10/biology-addiction) of human beings. Unfortunately, many [drugs that are prescribed by doctors to help relieve pain](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-help-dependence-on-hydrocodone-and-other-opioid-pain-medication-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) and other symptoms of illness are habit-forming, too. When people try to stop taking the medication they've been using to help with post-surgical pain, for example, or to help them sleep, or to relieve situational depression and anxiety, they find they can't just \"quit.\" Even \"milder\" substances like caffeine and sugar, which many people consider to be a regular part of their daily diet, can be abused to the point that they become detrimental to your health. And, of course, we all know how hard it is for people to [quit smoking](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-quit-smoking-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). Nicotine is one of the most addictive substances out there. Most of these drugs affect the way the brain produces dopamine and other neurochemicals. When you stop drinking or using the drug, the brain is not ready to go back to its old ways of creating and releasing dopamine. There is a period of adjustment, during which symptoms of withdrawal can make a person very uncomfortable, or even violently sick. Certain behaviors, like scrolling through social media websites on your phone, or looking at pornography, or even engaging in sexual activity, can also be addictive because of the way they impact dopamine production and other brain activity. There has been a lot of shame and stigma attached to alcoholism and addiction. Sometimes, people live in denial of the fact that they are too heavily reliant on drinking or using drugs to help them cope with [stress](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-stress-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/). Alcohol abuse or drug abuse are still considered by some people to be personal problems, having to do with a lack of willpower or gratitude. We now understand that addiction is a disease, and that it can be difficult and actually dangerous for people to try to stop using some drugs without some form of treatment. Doctors and mental health professionals are trained to help people safely recover from substance abuse, and treatments exist to provide relief from drug withdrawal symptoms. In addition to the 12 step program Alcoholics Anonymous, which provides emotional support through group interactions, many other clinics and rehab centers provide care for those trying to stop using drugs and alcohol. Still, most people find that recovering from addiction is extremely difficult, probably the hardest thing they have ever tried to do. Many people, no matter what kind of treatment they receive, or how many times they go through a 12 step program, still relapse. First a person needs to decide that they are ready to commit to recovery. Then, finding the right support is crucial to success. TCM methods of acupuncture and herbs offer an alternative or adjunctive treatment for addiction. [Acupuncture treatment](https://www.healthcmi.com/Acupuncture-Continuing-Education-News/1884-acupuncture-for-alcoholism-confirmed) has been shown to help patients suffering from alcoholism and depression, reducing cravings and symptoms of withdrawal and improving mental health. Acupuncture can help people overcome substance abuse, addressing both the physical effects of drug use with an effective alcohol detox or drug detox, and the emotional problems most people face when they begin recovery treatment. Top 10 Symptoms of Withdrawal from Alcohol Dependence and Drug Abuse Withdrawal is the body's reaction when a person stops using drugs or alcohol after having been ingesting them regularly for a significant period of time. When the body and brain have become addicted to a substance, the physical and emotional need for that substance can cause a severe reaction when a person stops abruptly, making it very difficult for a person to resist using again. Withdrawal symptoms can vary, depending on what type of substance you've been using, and how long you've been using it. Symptoms of withdrawal include: [Tremor, hands shaking](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-essential-tremor-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), body shaking, seizures - Anxiety, depression, agitation, feeling jumpy, irritability, delirium, hallucinations - Watery eyes, tearing, runny nose - Hot flashes, chills, hot flushes, hot and cold, sweating, clammy skin - Nausea, vomiting, [diarrhea](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-diarrhea-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) - Muscle cramps, muscle aches, muscle pain, muscle tension - Dehydration [High blood pressure](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-high-blood-pressure-with-acupuncture-tcm/), fast heartbeat, [irregular heartbeat](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-irregular-heartbeat-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), palpitations - Anxiety, depression, overwhelming negative emotions [Insomnia, trouble sleeping,](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-sleep-better-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/)restlessness Other signs of withdrawal can include: trouble concentrating, memory loss, foggy headedness, pupils dilated, loss of appetite. Some medical detox programs are designed to help people gradually taper their use of drugs like amphetamines or sleep medications so as to minimize withdrawal symptoms. Treatment centers, such as a methadone clinic, may use certain approved medications to help relieve cravings when people are coming off of heroin or prescription pain medications. Acupuncture, a [TCM detox program](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-detox-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), and other TCM treatments can serve as an alternative or adjunct treatment to help alleviate withdrawal and help people survive through the toughest parts of recovery. Top 5 Ways Acupuncture Can Help Addiction The relationship between Chinese medicine and alcohol goes back many centuries. As early as 1600 B.C., we have records of alcohol being used in medicinal preparations and for its anesthetic properties. Problems with overuse of alcohol, however, are also a longstanding part of Chinese culture, so TCM has developed treatments to help people reduce their consumption of alcohol. According to [TCM philosophy](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Andrew-Lawrence-6/publication/49735637_Traditional_Chinese_Medicine_for_Treatment_of_Alcoholism_From_Ancient_to_Modern/links/55cd26dd08aebebb8f577e79/Traditional-Chinese-Medicine-for-Treatment-of-Alcoholism-From-Ancient-to-Modern.pdf), too much alcohol creates excessive heat in the body, and disturbs the balance of Yin and Yang. In conventional medicine, the focus tends to be on how alcohol abuse impacts the liver. In TCM, we see that binge drinking also taxes the stomach and spleen, and encourages dampness to take hold. Thus, acupuncture treatment for alcohol addiction will often focus on clearing heat and dampness from the organ systems, while strengthening the stomach and spleen. TCM takes a holistic approach to treating Substance use disorders, meaning we focus not only on the physical symptoms of withdrawal, but also on the emotional, mental, and spiritual problems associated with addiction. Most people become dependent on drugs or alcohol because they are already experiencing some form of emotional struggle or mental health issue. When the substance is taken away, those feelings come up to the surface again, demanding attention. For many people, the anxiety and depression they face when they quit drinking or using drugs is overwhelming. Some people may avoid 12 step programs, an AA meeting, alcohol rehab, drug addiction centers for substance use disorders, or even one-on-one talk therapy because they are not ready to talk about the [trauma](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-ptsd-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) that triggered their [anxiety](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-anxiety-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/) or [depression](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-depression-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). Acupuncture treatment can be very helpful for anxiety and depression, without having to delve into these conversations. TCM treatment for addiction works on multiple levels: - Detox - TCM has a history going back for many centuries of actively seeking to remove toxic substances from the body to improve both physical and mental health. The practice of using Chinese herbs used in combination has been developed to be highly effective as a detox from all kinds of drugs. A TCM detox treatment program uses acupuncture treatment as well as herbs taken internally (as a tea or capsule) and used externally (detox patches) to draw toxins from the body, providing a deep cleansing for the liver and other organ systems. - Reduces cravings - whether the problem is nicotine, alcohol, opiates, food, or some behavior like engaging with porn, the use of auricular acupuncture and applying pressure to [acupressure points on the head](https://myartofwellness.com/ultimate-guide-to-the-acupuncture-point-on-head-for-headaches/)and ears for cravings can be very effective. - Withdrawal Symptoms - Acupuncture has been shown to help people with symptoms of opioid withdrawal, heroin withdrawal, and prevent relapses. - Mental Health - people who were treated with acupuncture for addiction reported that it helped them feel more confidence in their ability to quit. Acupuncture helps relieve anxiety and the negative effects of stress. - Sleep aid - many people start using drugs in the first place because they have trouble sleeping. When people quit drinking and using drugs, they can suffer from [insomnia](https://myartofwellness.com/what-we-treat/insomnia/)and restlessness. Acupuncture is an excellent modality for helping people to relax and experience deeper, higher quality sleep. Acupuncture [has been shown](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ecam/2008/463284/) to have an effect on neurotransmitters like dopamine and serotonin, which are involved in the brain processes that make certain substances so addictive. Several types of Chinese medicines based on herbal formulation have been tested and [approved for treatment of opiate addiction](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17007736/) in China. [Studies have shown](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5871630/) that electro-acupuncture, and auricular acupuncture can reduce cravings, and alleviate anxiety related to drinking cessation.

The education provided by this article is not approved by FDA to diagnose, prevent, treat and cure human diseases. It should not stop you from consulting with your physician for your medical conditions. Traditional Chinese Medicine is based on Qi, which is an invisible force that usually cannot be observed by modern science.

Therefore acupuncture and Chinese herbs are often not supported by double-blind, randomized trials, and they are considered alternative medicine therapies in the United States. [ How to Quit Smoking With Acupuncture and TCM ](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-quit-smoking-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) By Xiaomei Cai, L.Ac., Ph.D. & Qineng Tan, L.Ac., Ph.D. Have you been trying to stop smoking, but are having a hard time quitting? You know that quitting smoking will definitely improve your overall health and [longevity](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1447499/), but that doesn't mean it's easy to do. [Acupuncture treatment can reduce](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6662782/) cravings, [alleviate withdrawal symptoms](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-addiction-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) of nicotine, and help relieve anxiety you feel when you stop smoking. Smoking tobacco causes several million unnecessary deaths every year, and is associated with multiple chronic diseases, including lung disease, cardiovascular disease, [diabetes](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-diabetes-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), lung cancer and other types of [cancer](https://myartofwellness.com/acupuncture-and-tcm-for-cancer-integrative-oncology/). But deaths related to smoking are just the tip of the iceberg. [According to the CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/fast_facts/index.htm), over 16 million Americans are currently living with a chronic disease caused, at least in part, by smoking. Smoking increases the risk of [stroke](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-help-stroke-recovery-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), [erectile dysfunction in men (ED)](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-ed-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), [low sperm count](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-oligospermia-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), and autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid [arthritis](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-arthritis-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). On average, smoking takes ten years off a person's life. Why do we keep doing this to ourselves? Because once you have a smoking habit, quitting smoking is very hard. Tobacco contains a natural chemical called nicotine. [Nicotine](https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/health-information/nicotine-addictive-chemical-tobacco-products) is a highly addictive substance. It acts upon the neurotransmitters in the brain that release dopamine: the \"feel-good\" chemical. When you inhale tobacco smoke, nicotine goes directly to your brain, and you get an immediate \"reward\" in the form of dopamine. Once your brain gets used to this reaction, it wants more of it. Even when you know you should stop smoking, and you want to quit, a part of your brain is signalling you not to stop. Vaping, or smoking from a vape pen, or e-cigarette, is the latest trend. There has been some suggestion that this form of smoking causes less damage than cigarettes do, because Juul pens don't have many of the toxic additives that are in regular cigarettes. So far, researchers don't know how long-term vape use will affect people's overall health. However, it is clear that people who vape can easily become [just as addicted to nicotine](https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/vaping-nicotine-addiction) as smokers of cigarettes, cigars, and pipes do. Once the brain has become attuned to the dopamine reaction [caused by nicotine,](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2928221/) a very powerful social-emotional component is added to the physical, chemical component. Being in a place where you have smoked in the past, seeing a friend who smokes, smelling smoke in the air, and of course, seeing an ad for cigarettes-all these sorts of cues in your daily environment can have a dramatic impact on your desire to smoke. Almost half of all smokers in the U.S. make an attempt to quit smoking each year. But, obviously, people fail in their attempts to stop smoking all the time. Nicotine withdrawal symptoms include intense anxiety. When faced with a powerful combination of physical and emotional stress, most people will return to that quick fix. Even when a person develops serious problems due to smoking, like a constant cough, [emphysema](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-emphysema-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), [sleep apnea/snoring](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-stop-snoring-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), [infertility](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-infertility-in-women-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), [acid reflux/heartburn](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-acid-reflux-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), loss of smell and taste; even when a person knows that second hand smoking can hurt their loved ones, they still may find it impossible to quit. People need help to quit smoking. Typical [smoking cessation aids](https://www.cancer.org/healthy/stay-away-from-tobacco/guide-quitting-smoking/nicotine-replacement-therapy.html) include nicotine gum or patches, medications, and programs designed to educate and support people as they try to overcome smoking addiction. While these methods offer help, they do not work for everybody. Most people have to try to quit smoking many times and try different methods before finding success. Many people gain weight when they quit smoking, because the cravings for a cigarette are replaced by cravings for sweets or other foods and drinks that keep your hands and mouth occupied. It's more than just an oral habit, though; nicotine affects the way your body uses insulin and releases glucose, so when you quit smoking, there is a very real change in blood sugar levels and a subsequent desire to eat more carbohydrates. When it feels like you have to choose between two different risk factors-being a smoker, or being overweight-,it may seem like a hopeless situation. TCM for smoking cessation offers a different, multi-pronged approach. With acupuncture treatment for nicotine addiction, we can work on several of the problems smoking causes at the same time. Using [acupuncture to stimulate](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/want-to-quit-smoking-acupuncture-can-help-you-with-cravings/) specific pressure points for reducing cravings and alleviating symptoms of smoking withdrawal is only one way that TCM can help people quit smoking and regain good health. Our [TCM detox program](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-detox-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) may also be helpful. Top 10 Symptoms of Nicotine Withdrawal When you try quitting smoking \"cold turkey,\" you will probably feel more severe symptoms of withdrawal for the first few days. Withdrawal symptoms can last for several weeks. Nicotine withdrawal symptoms include: - Intense cravings for a cigarette that last for 5-10 minutes - Feelings of [anxiety](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-anxiety-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/)and [stress](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-stress-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/) - Food cravings, weight gain, rise in blood sugar - Sleep problems, insomnia - Persistent cough, \"smoker's cough\" - Flu-like symptoms: fever, fatigue, Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) has been the common [form of help](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/whats-best-way-quit-smoking-201607089935) for nicotine withdrawal for decades. This involves using nicotine patches, nicotine gum, or lozenges, which help people gradually wean themselves off of nicotine by lowering the dose over time. Nicotine patch side effects can include a rapid heart beat, dizziness, [headaches](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-headaches-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), and nausea. Medications such as Zyban and Chantix are also used to help people quit smoking. Zyban (Bupropion) is also known as Welbutrin, which is used to treat [depression](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-depression-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). A prescription medication called [Varenicline (Chantix)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK534846/) is the newest medical treatment available to help people stop smoking. Varenicline works by blocking the receptors in the brain that react to nicotine to stimulate dopamine production. Varenicline is still fairly new, and researchers do not yet know the long-term effects of taking it. Common Chantix side effects include nausea, [insomnia](https://myartofwellness.com/what-we-treat/insomnia/), and headaches; more serious psychiatric reactions, such as depression and suicidal ideation have also been reported. Drug interventions for smoking cessation are more effective when combined with education and counseling. The most effective methods to help people stop smoking treat both the brain chemistry that is causing nicotine addiction and the emotional symptoms that arise when quitting. TCM methods of acupuncture and herbs are naturally able to help address addiction because they work on the whole person-physically, mentally, and spiritually. How Can Acupuncture Help You Quit Smoking? In conventional medical terms, we mostly think of cigarette smoking as being harmful to the lungs, due to smoke inhalation, and the cardiovascular system, due to the well-known fast heartbeat we associate with nicotine use. In TCM, we do consider that smoking weakens the lungs, but this, in turn, causes problems in the other major organ systems of the body. A buildup of heat in the Heart and Stomach can lead to stagnant Liver Qi. These forces are what cause the withdrawal symptoms of anxious feelings, heart palpitations, irritability, food cravings, and poor sleep. [With acupuncture](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-642-10857-0_16) and herbs, we work to clear heat and detoxify the lungs and all of the organs. A [specific set of points](https://myartofwellness.com/ultimate-guide-to-the-acupuncture-point-on-head-for-headaches/) on the outer ear are often used to help combat the cravings associated with overcoming addictions of all kinds, including nicotine dependence. Often we will send a patient home with small ear seeds fixed to these points so that they can be squeezed and stimulated whenever you feel an urge to smoke. This will also help with food cravings and prevent overeating and weight gain when you quit smoking. Acupuncture helps to release endorphins, replacing the familiar dopamine hit with a different sense of relaxation. Endorphins promote a sense of wellbeing and relieve pain. Dopamine works on the reward center of the brain, causing a mental and emotional reaction that leads to addiction. Acupuncture treatment works holistically to help relieve emotional pain-symptoms of anxiety and depression-by positively impacting neurochemical activity. Shifting from dopamine dependence to more abundant endorphins and serotonin will help restore restful sleep. A [controlled trial study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1447300/) compared patients who received acupuncture, patients who received acupuncture and education and counseling, and patients who received sham acupuncture to help them quit smoking over a period of four weeks. The percentage rate of patients who had quit smoking after 18-month follow up was highest among those who received acupuncture, and especially highest among those who had acupuncture and counseling. [A study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5149689/) of almost 3000 people who received acupuncture treatment for smoking over an eight week period showed that the treatment helped many people abstain from cigarettes, and helped many more to cut back on how many cigarettes they smoked. Chinese Medicine Near Me to Stop Smoking in the Great Los Angeles Area The decision to quit smoking for good can be a life-changing one. But for most people, it's also one of the most difficult things they will ever do. Cigarettes are addictive, and to stop smoking, you may need professional help. If you've already tried NRT and not been able to finally quit, you may want to consider trying the TCM approach. Whether you chain smoke or only vape socially, whether you are quitting smoking because you want to increase your chances of getting pregnant, or you have lung cancer stage 4, it is never too early or too late to stop smoking. Acupuncture for smoking cessation can help you get past the cravings for cigarettes that make it so hard to quit. Acupuncture and herbs can not only help you kick the habit, but can also help you get rid of that cough, brighten your skin, and sleep better. Most of all, you will have made an important choice to prioritize your health and prevent chronic illness from taking hold later in life. *This article is for education from the perspective of Traditional Chinese Medicine only.

[ How to Treat Lyme Disease With Acupuncture and TCM ](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-lyme-disease-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) By Xiaomei Cai, L.Ac., Ph.D. & Qineng Tan, Ph.D. Red, circular rash that looks like a \"bulls-eye?\" Joint pain, muscle aches, and fatigue? These are signs that a person may have [Lyme disease](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/lyme-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20374651), an infectious disease that humans can contract when they are bitten by an infected tick. Lyme, a bacterial infection, can take a while to develop, and can cause chronic symptoms if it is not treated effectively. Acupuncture and TCM offer an alternative or adjunct way to help resolve the painful, debilitating symptoms of long-term Lyme disease. Lyme disease is a type of bacterial infection transmitted by ticks. Ticks are parasitic arachnids, small spider-like creatures who bite other animals and feed on blood. If a tick is infected with a disease, it can infect the person or other animal it bites. Lyme disease, which is caused by the Borrelia burgdorferi bacterium, is just one of several infectious diseases that ticks can spread, including [Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever (RMSF)](https://www.sepsis.org/sepsisand/rocky-mountain-spotted-fever/). These critters are sometimes called \"deer ticks\" or \"bear ticks\" because they generally thrive in forest environments where they live symbiotically with these kinds of animals. But being bit by deer tick (tick on deer) doesn't only happen in deeply wooded areas; anywhere that deer, squirrels, lizards, or birds may come into suburban areas, it is possible to be bitten by a tick. Actually, ticks, and therefore the infectious diseases they carry, are growing more prevalent because of humans encroaching into animals' habitats. Tick bites most commonly occur in spring and summer. Ticks do not fly; they can only get onto dogs or humans by crawling on them. This can happen quite easily if a tick is on a bush or other plant, and a person or dog brushes up against it. Ticks attach themselves to a host, and slowly suck their blood. [Lyme disease in dogs](https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/health/lyme-disease-in-dogs/) cannot be transmitted to humans, nor is lyme disease contagious, passing from human to human; you can only get Lyme disease by being bitten yourself. [In order to pass Lyme disease to a person,](https://www.idsociety.org/public-health/lyme-disease/lyme-disease/10-facts-about-lyme/) a tick generally has to have been attached to that person's skin for 36 hours or more. Ticks can be as small as the head of a pin, and they burrow in moist, hairy areas of their host's body, so it is actually quite easy to have a tick on you without knowing it. After the tick drops off, a person may not feel anything at all, or only have a small, red bump that resembles a mild insect bite. In some cases, though, a person may feel right away that the area of the bite is hot, swollen, or causing a burning sensation. If the tick was carrying Lyme disease, it can take several days to a few weeks for the more serious symptoms of Lyme to develop. Even then, the symptoms are not necessarily distinctive. The early [symptoms of Lyme disease](https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/signs_symptoms/index.html) can feel like a flu; fever, fatigue, aches and pains. Not everyone infected with Lyme will have the characteristic tick bullseye rash that develops around the site of the tick bite. When treated promptly with antibiotics, most cases of Lyme disease will resolve within a few weeks. However, many cases of Lyme disease are not diagnosed right away, and if it goes undetected, chronic problems can develop in the ensuing months. Once the bacteria has spread throughout the body, even a long course of antibiotics may not be able to get rid of it. Long-term Lyme symptoms may appear similar to other chronic inflammatory, autoimmune, or neurological conditions, such as [fibromyalgia](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-musculoskeletal-pain-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), [Bell's palsy](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-bells-palsy-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), [MS](https://myartofwellness.com/what-is-ms-how-to-treat-multiple-sclerosis-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), [chronic fatigue](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-fatigue-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) syndrome, cases Lyme disease causes [shoulder pain](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-shoulder-pain-by-acupuncture-and-tcm/), hip pain, knee pain, fatigue, and other symptoms so severe that people can't go about their regular daily routine. Sometimes diagnosis and treatment is further complicated by coinfections: concurrent other infections, that can also have been transmitted via the tick bite, or occur independently of it. Lyme and other tick-borne illnesses like RMSF can also trigger sepsis infections, which can be life-threatening, or lead to chronic pain, and/or PTSD (post-traumatic [stress disorder](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-stress-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/)). An [MRSA skin infection](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/mrsa/symptoms-causes/syc-20375336) (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus), a type of staph infection that enters the skin through a wound, can develop around the infected tick bite; this staph skin infection is particularly resistant to antibiotics. Unfortunately, symptoms of Lyme can become progressively worse over time, leading to disability and even death. Acupuncture and TCM offer an alternative for helping to heal Lyme disease, whether it is still in the early stages, or when it has become a [chronic infectious disease](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23400696/). Top 10 Symptoms of Lyme Disease Signs of Lyme disease develop slowly, in stages, and can vary widely from person to person. Without the presence of the tell-tale bulls' eye rash, both patients and doctors may have difficulty linking the spectrum of symptoms to a Lyme infection. - Joint pain, swollen joins, [arthritis](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-arthritis-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) [Neuropathy](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-neuropathy-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), numbness or tingling, Bell's palsy (face drooping) - Fatigue - Bulls-eye rash, also known as [Sleep problems](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-sleep-better-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), [sleep - Brain fog - Trouble breathing - Vertigo, dizziness - Blurred vision Other possible symptoms of Lyme include: [ringing in the ears (tinnitus)](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-ringing-in-the-ears-with-acupuncture/), [heart palpitations](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-irregular-heartbeat-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), [problems with memory](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-amnesia-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) and [concentration](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-adhd-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), vision problems or inflammation around the eyes, and liver problems, like hepatitis. [Symptoms of lyme disease in dogs](https://www.merckvetmanual.com/dog-owners/disorders-affecting-multiple-body-systems-of-dogs/lyme-disease-lyme-borreliosis-in-dogs) are similar to those in humans, including stiff, swollen joints, tiredness, and loss of appetite. Long-term effects of Lyme disease are sometimes referred to as \" [post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome.](https://www.aldf.com)\" Doctors are not sure why some people, even after being treated with antibiotics, seem to still be affected by long-term effects of Lyme disease. Medical Diagnosis and Treatment of Lyme Disease Getting a clear diagnosis of Lyme disease can be difficult. Currently, there is a [two-step diagnostic process](https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/diagnosistesting/index.html) recommended to determine if a person has contracted Lyme disease. Two main [kinds of tests](https://www.lymedisease.org/lyme-disease-test/) can detect antibodies the body's immune system creates to fight off the infection. However, it takes a while-at least several weeks, usually-for the body to build up enough of the antibodies that they become detectable. Often when people are aware early on that they may have been infected, and they get a test, it turns out to be negative. Usually, doctors try first one type of antibody test, and then the other to see if they get a positive result. Even then, medical science acknowledges that many (perhaps half of) Lyme disease cases are not detected this way. A newer, still somewhat unproven form of testing involves taking a blood culture and trying to grow the bacteria that cause Lyme in a laboratory setting. This testing is more advanced and may be difficult for patients to access. Once physicians have determined that Lyme infection is present, the usual [ treatment](https://www.columbia-lyme.org/treatment-options) is a course of antibiotics that lasts a few to several weeks. In many cases, this seems to clear up the infection. In others, though, the antibiotics do not resolve the myriad symptoms patients are experiencing. Using antibiotics on a long-term basis is often not effective, and carries other risks to a person's health. Ongoing joint pain and inflammation is then usually treated with steroid medications or NSAIDS. Sleep problems and fatigue are often treated with antidepressants. These medications may help relieve symptoms temporarily, but they come with side effects, and do not address the root causes of the chronic symptoms of Lyme disease. 3 Stages of Lyme Disease When early detection occurs, the Western medical approach of using antibiotics can often resolve Lyme disease within a few to several weeks. However, if the infectious disease is not found soon enough, Lyme disease will progress to more advanced stages. TCM methods can be helpful during all three stages of Lyme. - First Stage Lyme disease - Within the first few weeks of the infection, and with early detection, antibiotics can be very helpful, working pretty well to stop the spread of the bacteria. However, because Lyme disease is often misdiagnosed, many people do not receive this treatment soon enough. During this phase, the symptoms are similar to those of the flu: chills, fatigue, heaviness in the limbs. As the infection moves in deeper, it can cause the skin rash, or hives. TCM treatment during the first stage will focus on clearing heat and detoxifying the body to rid it of infection. - Second Stage Lyme disease - If the bacteria causing Lyme disease is not halted in its spread, it begins to affect the organs and the blood. The central nervous system and heart can become infected. These infections can last for months, and if not taken care of, can develop into the third phase. This is when a person may begin to feel joint aches, and arthritis-like symptoms. The body's Qi and blood become deficient. Treatment with acupuncture and herbs at this point will work to help boost the Qi, clear heat and strengthen the whole immune system, and clear inflammation. - Advanced stage Lyme disease - As the infection drags on, it can cause joint, skin, and nerve damage can take hold. Ongoing Qi and blood deficiency and stagnation cause fatigue, dizziness, insomnia, and memory loss. A TCM provider will recognize what stage of Lyme disease a patient is in according to their symptoms, and customize the acupuncture points and herbal formulae used depending on their needs. Acupuncture for Infectious Diseases For millennia, TCM has recognized a type of disease that is caused by infection and can affect all systems of the body. We call this type of illness [Gu zheng](https://www.pacificcollege.edu/news/blog/2019/07/26/lyme-treatment-success-with-chinese-medicine), or \"Gu syndrome.\" This classification covers illnesses caused by \"invisible\" pathogens, like viruses, funguses, and parasites. Along with the toxins from the tick bite, we consider how pathogens like heat, wind, and dampness all play a role in the illness. According to TCM theory, extreme heat in the body is also considered \"toxic.\" This category of condition helps us understand a variety of different systemic inflammatory illnesses, and gives us a framework for addressing each individual's presenting symptoms. One of the key features of Gu syndrome illnesses is how terrible and hopeless they can make people feel. Not only do people suffering from chronic inflammatory or immune-related conditions feel constantly tired and ache-y, but some of the sensations seem to come and go and feel so mysterious that they can't be explained satisfactorily. If this is then compounded with the fact that many doctors don't understand or know how to deal with the illness, it can leave patients feeling very frustrated and helpless. After months or years of this, debilitating physical symptoms may be accompanied by feelings of [depression](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-depression-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) and [anxiety](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-anxiety-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/). A Yale Medical University [study of patients](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4012507/), all in their 40s, suffering from long-term Lyme complications found that they had to reduce their activities, or even give up working, and doubted that they would ever recover. In interviews, patients made it clear that working with doctors who were more holistic was far preferred, and thus many had turned to CAM (complementary and alternative medicine) providers for help with Lyme disease. Making a full recovery from long-term Lyme disease is possible, but it can take a long time to get rid of a bacterial infection that has woven itself deeply into the body's organ systems. The benefit of Chinese herbal medicine for Lyme is that the powerful substances in the herbs can penetrate deep into the body at a cellular level.
