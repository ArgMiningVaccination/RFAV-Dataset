A Successful Earth Day 2016 The event was coordinated by the County Green Team, and provided a fun opportunity to learn more about the County's efforts in waste reduction, renewable energy and energy efficiency, water conservation and local foods and gardening. There was also information on how to create healthy, safe, prosperous, and resilient communities. County Board Supervisor Art Babbott and County Manager Cynthia Seelhammer provided welcoming remarks during the celebration, which took place on the courthouse lawn. One of the best things about the event was that waste was minimized to almost zero! To help with our goal of waste reduction, we used reusable plates and cups from Friends of Flagstaff's Future (F3), from their Zero Waste Events Program. (Anyone can utilize these great resources for their events, contact F3 at 556-8663 to find out how.) The only waste that was created were the napkins from the event. If you happened to accidentally take one of the F3 plates or cups with you, please contact Amanda at [aacheson@coconino.az.gov](mailto:aacheson@coconino.az.gov), or 679-8853 so we can get these utensils to the right place. (Thank you!) The pictures behind the link below show the used reusable utensils and the pizza scraps that County Chief Sarah Douthit re-used by taking them home for her chickens.

The Coconino County Lean Government Committee is looking for new members. The Committee's goal is to save Coconino County money by eliminating wasteful practices. Members are dedicated to identifying inefficient county practices and redesigning them to make them more efficiently. This can often be done at little or no cost, and usually involves small adjustments to what is already occurring. The committee works on a variety of projects involving all county operations. Besides gaining a greater understanding of county operations, Lean Committee members learn Lean and Six Sigma through application of the principles. Lean is the identification and elimination of waste in a process. Six Sigma is a structured tool to create an efficient process that meets customer needs. With this knowledge, they are able to improve their work area (and make their jobs more enjoyable). Meetings are held the second Tuesday of each month from 11 a.m. to noon at the Human Resources Building, 420 North San Francisco Street. Please come to a meeting or talk to one of our members about being a part of this fun group! Lean Committee Co-Chairs: Amy Young and Steve Lonetti. Lean Committee Members: Richard Baron, Dave Mark Crouse, Chyenne Schmidt, and Diana Abele. Examples of wasteful practices that the committee identifies and eliminates: Defects - Data Errors, Missing Information Over-Production - Unneeded Reports Waiting - Approval Cycles Non-Utilized People - Lack of Training Transportation - Report Routing Inventory - Backlog of Work, Excess Materials Motion - Trips to a Remote Printer Excess-Processing - Reentering Information [For more information, click here. ](https://coconino365.sharepoint.com/Intranet/Pages/Lean%20Committee.aspx) | | | | | | | | | | CCPHSD: Keeping Coconino Healthy Help Us Learn More about the Health of Arizona's Children Do you have children under age 18?
