About this Event My passion for exploring natural healing started with a Plant Medicine Ceremony and over time rippled into breathwork. After my first ever Conscious Connected Breathwork session where I knew after 1 90-minute session I HAD to study and share this incredibly POWERFUL medicine that is YOUR BREATH! To teach people the power in manipulating their breath to reap the rewards of RELEASE, EMBODYMENT, CLARITY, ONENESS, STRENGTH AND ALIGNMENT! Connect with me on IG @Beyondbreath111 with any questions/query's :) What the workshop will include: ? Learning and experiencing the Indigenous Plants Rape, Sananga & Cacao ?

Connect to YOUR OWN INNER SHAMAN ? Shamanic Drumming ? Journaling & Sharing Opening sacred space Calling in our hearts and the energies we wish to receive during our time together, which allow us to fully surrender into the experience and trust the process. Cacao Ceremonial Grade Cacao has been used for thousands of years in sacred ceremonies by indigenous people to help us reach euphoric states of bliss, release what no longer serves us, and connect again to nature, ourselves, truth. It is chocolate in the pure raw unprocessed high grade form. Rap\u00e9 Rap\u00e9 brings you to a place of acute attention and awareness. The mind becomes quieter, negativity clears our, and emotional tensions release. People often feel more grounded during the experience, allowing them to clear up confusions or discomfort about an issue they may have been experiencing. Sananga Sananga has spiritual properties to clear our blocked energies, emotionally, spiritually, and physically. It can help clear the mind, open up our third eye and help with meditation, and improve overall eye health. Shamanic Breathwork, Drumming, Reiki Energy Work Breathwork opens the door us to heal all 3 of our energy centers. Our mental body, emotional and psychological body and our physical body. I am Level 1 trained. With this I am able to encourage energy flow/release if I feel a breathers energy is stuck or is having a harder time releasing. When we travel into the deep, subconscious space accessed only by shamanic breathwork, the ego falls away and we are left truly vulnerable. Through this process that we are able to access the deepest, most obscured and hidden parts of our psyche. Back here, all of the memories and traumas are stored, many of which are not accessible through regular counselling or soul-searching. When we open ourselves up in such a vulnerable way, we allow ourselves to start to see the roadmap to our deepest, most fundamental self. In doing so, we begin to find the map allows us to move between these memories and emotions in a completely new and unhindered way, as new connections are drawn and solidified. Some benefits of Breathwork may include: ? Improves sleep cycle ? Recovery from illness or injury ? Boosts immune system ? Heal the wounds of unresolved trauma ? Connects to spirit, guides, power animals, angels, there is no limit! ? Opens up and strengthens your connection to spirit/spirituality ? Experience feelings such as bliss, unity and oneness with nature and life ? Release and reduce stress, anxiety, depression, PTSD ? Opens up creativity ? Releases old negative patterns ? Allows us to heal and rewrite our outdated beliefs and create new ones ? Clarity in life direction and decisions Reverse ageing ? Creates new space in the body for clarity, peace and love ? Strengthens will power and determination Journaling & Sharing circle There will be a chance to share our experiences with the other members of the group if we feel called too. Reflection and sharing is a very powerful integration tool. Closing sacred space Offering gratitude for the safe space that held us, the medicines, our teachings, lessons and vulnerability. ?
