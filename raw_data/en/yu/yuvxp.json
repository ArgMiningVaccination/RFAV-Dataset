Homeopathy (or \"classical homeopathy\", or \"homeopathic medicine\") is a powerful healing system that is uniquely able to restore health and well-being by correcting the spiritual imbalance that lies at the core of all illness. Through homeopathy one can gradually and permanently overcome chronic or life-long physical, psychological ailments as well as spiritual obstacles that have not yielded to any other therapeutic approach. Who can benefit from homeopathic treatment? - Those whose well-being depends on ongoing intake of medications or adherence to a strict diet and a regimented lifestyle: Homeopathic treatment gradually frees people from dependence on external agents for maintaining their inner balance. - Those who have despaired of all other treatment options (whether medical or alternative) for their chronic condition: Homeopathy is capable of stimulating the curative capacities that we all possess, regardless of whether we suffer from a self-limiting illness or from a medically incurable chronic condition. - Those searching for spiritual healing rather than physical or psychological cure per se: Because homeopathy addresses the spiritual level of the individual, it is capable of addressing non-medical issues, acting as a powerful catalyst for long-term character development and the attainment of inner joy and outward creativity. How does homeopathy work? Homeopathy can be likened to surgery for the soul, because healing takes place through the precise action of homeopathic remedies on the spiritual core of the person. By correcting this imbalance, which is always the cause of the physical and psychological ailments that we experience, the balance of body and mind is restored, freeing both to serve the higher purpose of our existence. Once the spiritual cause of disease is removed, it is regularly observed that vast majority of conditions, even ones considered incurable, begin to shift toward health. Homeopathy is far more than an adjunct or substitute for medical intervention. It is, in fact, a powerful tool for spiritual development, and as such it can help overcome many physical ailments and psychological conditions that cannot be addressed by conventional means because they represent spiritual challenges. By accessing and balancing the core of one's being, the freedom from disease which homeopathy brings not only alleviates suffering but also contributes to emotional maturation and to freedom to pursue the highest goals of our existence.
