(Aug. 14, 2014) -- Just about anything you can think of comes with a variety of choices. It should come as no surprise that health care has many different facets as well. Today, many people are eager to know more about ways to help take care of their health themselves. Some gravitate to alternative health care for cost reasons. Some believe there are real benefits to different types of care. And some just are curious. Alternative health care has been around for centuries. Many practices continue to thrive alongside western medicine. With the cost of health care continuing to rise, people are ready to get involved in their wellness. In order to raise awareness and improve education about alternative health care, the FMWR Fitness Department has scheduled its first Alternative Health Fair. The goal is to bring experts together to enlighten the community on their chosen alternative health careers. The FMWR Alternative Health Fair is scheduled from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., Aug. 25 at the Solomon Center. Lectures from experts are set from 10:30 to 11:30a.m. and at 1:30pm. Please visit www.fortjacksonmwr.com/fitness for details on lecturer topics and the designated time slots. This event is free, and all are encouraged to attend and learn more about alternative health care. For more information or to have an exhibit booth, call 751-5768. Do you want to know more about reflexology, acupuncture, becoming a raw foodist, maybe trying Tai Chi for your health? The Alternative Health Fair is designed to answer those questions and more. Experts in these and other areas will be in attendance to deliver lectures on alternative and complementary health. Speakers will overlap, so attendees are encouraged to select topics that are most interesting to them. The fair will also include interactive exhibit booths. Attendees are invited to try some of the remedies featured. Alternative health care also includes exercise and a healthy diet. These lifestyle habits have been a part of my life for many years. I embraced a healthier way to care for my body long before it was popular or fashionable. It is encouraging to see many others now involved with improving their overall health with easy alternative steps such as eating right, exercising, getting proper rest and drinking more water, to name a few.
