T racy Orleans is a senior scientist at the Robert W ood Johnson F oundation. Jeanne Ann Grisso is a senior program officer at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.Pediatricians, parents, and policy- makers alike are concernedabout high and rising rates of overweight and obesity among U.S. children. Over the past three decades, the share of children who areconsidered overweight or obese has doubled,from 15 percent in the 1970s to nearly 30percent today, while the share of childrenwho are considered obese has tripled. Theproblem of childhood obesity has capturedpublic attention and is regularly featured onthe evening news, in school newsletters, andin articles in parenting magazines. Increas - ingly policymakers are recognizing the need for action. In 2004, the Institute of Medicinereleased a report calling the prevention ofchildhood obesity a national priority . 1 Despite all the public attention, no one is sure which policies and programs will mosteffectively combat childhood obesity. Theuncertainty reflects in part a lack of agree-ment about what caused obesity to increasein the first place. Theories abound. The \"epi-demic\" in childhood obesity has been attrib-uted to various factors: increases in television and computer game use that have led to anew generation of \"couch potatoes\"; the ex- plosive proliferation of fast-food restaurants, many of which market their products to chil - dren through media campaigns that tout tie- ins to children's movies and TV shows; in-creases in sugary and fat-laden foodsdisplayed at children's eye level in supermar-kets and advertised on TV; schools that offerchildren junk food and soda while scalingback physical education classes and recess;working parents who are unable to find thetime or energy to cook nutritious meals or su - pervise outdoor playtime; the exodus of gro- cery stores from urban centers, sharply re - ducing access to affordable fresh fruits and vegetables; and suburban sprawl and urbancrime, both of which keep children awayfrom outdoor activities. The problem is notthe lack of explanations for the increase inchildhood obesity, but the abundance ofthem. In such circumstances, deciding whichof the possible causes to address first andwhich policies and programs will be most ef-fective is not easy.01 5562 intro.qxp 1/22/2006 12:52 PM Page 3This issue of The Future of Children lays out the evidence on the multiple causes, conse-quences, and methods of dealing with child-hood obesity. Now is an opportune time toassess what is and is not known. Many policy- makers, having become convinced that child- hood obesity is indeed a problem, are search-ing for effective ways to combat it. The Child Nutrition and WIC (Women, Infants, and Children) Reauthorization Act of 2004, forexample, responding in large measure to the rise in childhood obesity, requires school dis- tricts that participate in the National SchoolLunch Program or School Breakfast Programto develop a local wellness policy by the be- ginning of the 2006-07 school year. Many states are developing broader programsaimed at curbing obesity and improvinghealth among their citizens. The \"HealthyArkansas\" initiative, launched in 2004,aims\u2014ambitiously\u2014to reduce the state's rateof childhood obesity from 11 percent to 5percent. Other states are taking similar steps,many with the support of the Centers forDisease Control and Prevention (CDC),which in 2005-06 gave funds to twenty-onestates to build capacity in the area of obesityand to seven more to implement programs.But while the policymakers' desire to reduceobesity is clear , state and federal budgets are stretched thin. It is crucial to develop pro-grams and policies that are effective and canbe implemented at reasonable cost. Why Should We Care about Childhood Obesity? Although there may not be universal agree- ment on what caused the increase in child-hood obesity , there is fairly widespread con - sensus on several important points. The first is that obesity in general, and childhood obe-sity in particular , has serious adverse health consequences. Obesity causes many health problems, as Stephen Daniels documents inhis article in this volume. Heart disease, high blood pressure, hardening of the arteries, type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, high cholesterol, asthma, sleep disorders, liver dis-ease, orthopedic complications, and mental health problems are just some of the health complications of carrying excess weight. Thedifficulty for children is twofold. First, many obese children today are developing health problems that once afflicted only adults.These children thus have to cope with chronic illnesses for an unusually extended period of time. Living with type 2 diabetesbeginning around age fifty is one thing; livingwith it from age sixteen is quite another. Sec- ond, in obese children, such health problems as heart disease begin, almost invisibly , ear - lier in life than they do in normal-weight chil- dren. Even if the disease is not diagnoseduntil adulthood, it begins taking its physicaltoll sooner, perhaps resulting in more compli-cations and a less healthy life. The possibilityhas even been raised that given the increas - ing prevalence of severe childhood obesity, children today may live less healthy andshorter lives than their parents. 2Although this claim is controversial, it is dramaticenough to give us pause and reinforce theidea that childhood obesity is far more than acosmetic concern. The increase in obesity is an economic issue as well. Estimates of the costs of treatingobese children are relatively small but risingrapidly. For example, Guijing Wang andWilliam Dietz estimate that hospital costs of treating children for obesity-associated con- ditions rose from $35 million to $127 million(in 2001 constant dollar values) from1979-81 to 1997-99. 3Costs of treating adult obesity and its attendant health problems arefar more substantial. Roland Sturm estimatesthat health care costs (including inpatientcosts and costs of ambulatory care) of non-Christina Paxson, Elisabeth Donahue, C. T racy Orleans, and Jeanne Grisso 4THE FUTURE 4elderly obese adults are 36 percent greater than those of the non-obese, while costs for medicines are 77 percent greater.4The cost differences between obese and non-obeseadults are even greater than those between smokers and nonsmokers. Eric Finkelstein and several colleagues conclude that in 1998the nation spent between $51.5 and $78.5 billion on health care related to overweight and obesity among adults. The upper boundon these estimates, based on what the au- thors judge the better of their two data sources, corresponds to 9.1 percent of totalannual medical spending in the UnitedStates. 5Roughly half of this spending was publicly funded\u2014paid for by all Americans through Medicaid and Medicare, the govern - ment's health programs for the poor and eld- erly. And ever higher rates of obesity willburden society with other costs. Obese adultsmay be more likely than their normal-weightcounterparts to become disabled before re-tirement, lowering their earnings and raisingthe costs of the federal disability insurancesystem, and may require more nursing homecare as they move into retirement. 6 If the heaviest health and economic burdens of obesity are borne by adults instead of chil-dren, why should the focus be on childhoodobesity rather than adult obesity? There aretwo key reasons to focus on children. First,those who are overweight and obese as ado - lescents are much more likely than others to become obese as adults. 7Second, it is quite difficult for obese adults and children to shedexcess weight. Although the health profes-sions have developed new drugs and medicalprocedures for treating obesity-related healthproblems, these procedures are expensiveand do not counter all such problems. Pre-venting obesity in childhood must be the cen - terpiece of plans to reduce both the health- related and economic costs of obesity.A final point of broad consensus is that child- hood obesity is best viewed as a societal prob-lem reflecting the interactive influences ofenvironment, biology, and behavior, ratherthan as an individual medical illness. Most agree that the nation has seen dramatic changes in the past thirty years in the waysAmericans work, live, and eat. Broad societal and environmental trends have engineered routine physical activity out of everyday lifefor most Americans and made low-nutrition, energy-dense foods and beverages more ac- cessible, affordable, and appealing than morehealthful foods. Although reducing obesity re-quires changes in behaviors surrounding eat - ing and physical activity, strategies that relyonly on individual \"self-control\" are unlikelyto be effective in environments that are con - ducive to poor eating habits and sedentary ac- tivity. This is especially true for children, whodon't control the environments in which they live, learn, and play. In addition, children have a more limited capacity to make in-formed choices about what is healthful andwhat is not. For this reason, there is a clear ra-tionale for modifying children's environmentsto make it easier for them to be physically ac - tive and to make healthful food choices, thus reducing their chances of becoming obese.Introducing the Issue VOL. 16 / NO. 1 / SPRING 2006 5A final point of broad consensus is that childhoodobesity is best viewed as asocietal problem reflecting theinteractive influences ofenvironment, biology, andbehavior , 5562 intro.qxp 1/22/2006 12:52 PM Page 5Defining obesity as a societal issue does not imply that all children are at equal risk of gaining too much weight. The articles in this volume indicate that some groups of chil-dren\u2014in particular, children from low- income families and from ethnic minority groups\u2014are at a higher risk of becomingobese. Evidence presented in this volume in- dicates that the obesity crisis is also a result of the interplay between people's genes and en-vironments. While humans may be hard- wired to overeat in times of plenty, those with a greater genetic propensity for weight gainmay be more likely to gain weight in an envi-ronment that promotes or encourages un- healthful eating and minimal physical activity. The idea that susceptibility to obesity is ge - netic has led some to speculate that it will one day be possible to tailor interventions to-ward those with predispositions to obesity . For now, however, broader policies that alter children's environments are the only realisticoptions. What Does This V olume Do? This volume is a collection of articles that present up-to-date literature reviews andanalyses written by leading researchers andexperts from many disciplines. The goal ofthe issue is to promote effective policies andprograms targeting childhood obesity by pro-viding timely, objective information based onthe best available research on this topic. The development of effective strategies to prevent childhood obesity must be informedby an understanding of why obesity has risenso fast and so much in the past thirty years.Thus, we asked one pair of researchers todocument the trends in childhood obesity,paying careful attention to the timing of theincrease in obesity trends compared with thetiming of changes in the environment thatmay have aided the increase in weight. Weasked another researcher to document the ef- fects that these trends have had on the health of those who become obese as children. To identify effective strategies for reducing rates of overweight and obesity among chil- dren, we focused on several broad domainsof children's environments\u2014the market- place, the built environment, schools, child care providers, and homes\u2014that might bemodified to reduce obesity. We, therefore, asked researchers to present the best evi- dence on the role of each of these domains inthe development of overweight and obesityand to assess strategies for keeping children at healthy weights. Finally, we asked a pair of researchers to consider issues that are uniqueto ethnic minority and low-income children,and another researcher to document howthose in the medical community\u2014particu - larly pediatricians\u2014are handling the health problems that come with childhood obesitywhen prevention efforts fail. Common Issues: Definitions and Standards of Evidence Because childhood overweight and obesity are not always defined uniformly across stud - ies, a note about definitions is warranted. Un- less otherwise noted, all articles in this vol - ume follow the common convention ofdefining overweight and obesity in terms of\"body mass index,\" a measure of how much aperson weighs relative to how tall that personis. Specifically, the body mass index (BMI) isequal to weight (in kilograms) divided byheight (in meters) squared. 8For adults, the CDC identifies those with BMI values at orabove 25 but less than 30 as overweight butnot obese and those with BMIs at or above30 as obese. For example, an adult who is5feet and 9 inches tall would be considered overweight at between 169 and 202 pounds and obese at 203 pounds or more.Christina Paxson, Elisabeth Donahue, C. T racy Orleans, and Jeanne Grisso 6THE FUTURE OF CHILDREN01 5562 intro.qxp 1/22/2006 12:52 PM Page 6As Patricia Anderson and Kristin Butcher note in their article, however, the conven-tional definitions for children and adolescentsare somewhat different, because normal BMIvalues change throughout childhood. Instead, children's levels of adiposity, or fatness, are as- sessed by comparing their BMI values withthose of a fixed reference group of U.S. chil- dren of the same age and sex. Children at or above the 85th percentile of the BMI distri-bution\u2014meaning that at least 85 percent of children of the same age and sex in the refer- ence group had lower values of BMI\u2014areoften defined as being overweight, and thoseat or above the 95th percentile of the distribu- tion for the reference group are often de- fined to be obese. Although researchers com - monly agree that the 85th and 95th percentiles are appropriate cutoffs, not all usethe same sets of labels to define children whoexceed these cutoffs. The CDC and some re-searchers refer to children at or above the85th percentile as being \"at risk for over - weight\" and those at or above the 95th per- centile as being \"overweight.\" 9Most of the ar - ticles in this volume, however , use the labels \"overweight\" and \"obese\" for parsimony and to be consistent with the adult definitions. Fi - nally, in speaking generally, our authors often use the term \"childhood obesity\" to refer toboth overweight and obesity as seen in bothchildren and adolescents. The distinctions be-tween overweight and obesity are made clearwhen it is important to do so. Many of the articles in this volume review ev - idence on how various features of the envi- ronment are related to overweight and obe-sity. Assessing the quality of that evidence is important in developing effective programs and policies. For example, we may want toknow whether children who are breast-fedare less likely to become obese. If so, \"pre-venting obesity\" can be added to the long listof benefits of breast-feeding. Similarly, we may want to establish whether children who live in neighborhoods with more fast-food restaurants or who attend schools with vend-ing machines stocked with low-nutrient, high-calorie foods and beverages are more likely to become obese. For most of the top-ics discussed in this volume, we do not yet have evidence that firmly establishes cause- and-effect relationships. For example, intheir article on the built environment, James Sallis and Karen Glanz note that evidence that people who live near parks are more physically active could suggest that easy ac - cess to parks is a cause of that physical activ- ity. But it could also be that more physically active people choose to live near parks. Sofar, research has not conclusively establishedthat proximity to parks reduces obesity . Evidence on other topics is less equivocal, al- though often not definitive. Some studiescarefully account for the factors that could belinked with obesity but that do not reflectcausal relationships. Others rely on compar - isons of individuals' behaviors and body weights before and after policy changes orprograms are put into place. Finally , in a small but growing body of evidence based on experimental studies, children are randomlyIntroducing the Issue VOL. 16 / NO. 1 / SPRING 2006 7The idea that susceptibility to obesity is genetic has ledsome to speculate that it will one day be possible to tailor interventions towardthose with predispositions to obesity.01 5562 intro.qxp 1/22/2006 12:52 PM Page 7assigned to interventions, such as programs designed to reduce TV viewing or to improve nutrition, which may or may not be effective. Comparing the weights of children assignedto the intervention with the weights of those in a control group provides conclusive evi- dence of the specific intervention's effective-ness among the children being studied. Of course, as Sallis and Glanz point out, ran- domized interventions are rarely feasible forlarge-scale programs such as park construc- tion or changes in a city's zoning laws. The quality of available evidence necessarilyvaries from topic to topic. For the articles inthis volume, we have asked the authors to re- view the best evidence available on their top- ics and to make it clear how firmly the evi - dence establishes causal relationships. What W e Have Learned Each article in the volume contains a detailed discussion of recent evidence on childhoodobesity . We briefly summarize each article's chief findings below. Documenting the T rends Patricia Anderson and Kristin Butcher docu- ment trends in childhood obesity and exam - ine the possible underlying causes of the obe- sity epidemic. They note that the increase inchildhood obesity rates began between 1980and 1988, and then they assess whether thetiming of various changes in the children' s en- vironment coincides with the observed in- crease in obesity. Among the changes thathave affected children' s energy intake during the critical time period are increases in the availability of energy-dense, high-caloriefoods at school; in the consumption of sodaand other in of andin dual-career or single-parent working fami - lies that may have also increased demand for food away from home or for prepreparedfoods. Changes that have reduced energy ex- penditure over the critical time period in-clude less walking to school and more travelin cars; changes in the built environment andin parents' work lives that make it more diffi- cult for children to engage in safe, unsuper- vised (or lightly supervised) physical activity;and possibly more time spent in sedentary ac- tivities, such as viewing television, using com- puters, and playing video games. Andersonand Butcher find no single critical factor that has led to increases in children's obesity. Rather, many complementary changes havesimultaneously increased children's energy in-take and decreased their energy expenditure. How Obesity Harms Children' s Health Stephen Daniels documents the heavy toll that the obesity epidemic is taking on thehealth of the nation' s children. He notes that many obesity-related health conditions, such as type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure,that were once seen almost exclusively inadults are now being seen in children andwith increasing frequency . Obesity affects many systems of the body\u2014cardiovascular , pulmonary, gastrointestinal, orthopedic\u2014and although adult obesity damages each, child - hood obesity often exacerbates the damage. For example, the processes that lead to aheart attack or stroke often take decades todevelop into overt disease. Obese childrenmay thus suffer the adverse effects of cardio - vascular disease at a younger age than their parents would despite the advent of newdrugs to treat some of these problems. Theyalso suffer from higher rates of depression,greater difficulty in peer relationships, andpoorer quality of life than their normal-weight counterparts. The Role of Markets In the first of five articles that survey in detail the environments that may have contributedChristina Paxson, Elisabeth Donahue, C. T racy Orleans, and Jeanne Grisso 8THE FUTURE OF CHILDREN01 5562 intro.qxp 8to increasing childhood obesity, John Cawley focuses on the role of markets. He first docu-ments important market changes, such as in-creases in the costs of preparing foods athome relative to eating out, that may have contributed to the increase in obesity. He then lays out three economic rationales tojustify government intervention in markets to reduce obesity. First, because free markets generally underprovide information, the gov-ernment may intervene to provide consumers with information they need to make healthy choices. Second, because society bears thesoaring costs of obesity, the government mayintervene to lower the costs to taxpayers. Third, because children are not what econo- mists call \"rational consumers\"\u2014that is, theycannot evaluate information critically andweigh the future consequences of their ac-tions\u2014the government may intervene to ed - ucate them and help them make better choices. Cawley assesses an array of market-based policy interventions and concludes thatthe most promising policies are those that re-duce advertising targeted to children, in - crease the incentives for food manufacturers and restaurants to provide more nutritiouschoices, and improve the quality of foods thatschools provide to children, although furtherevidence on their cost-effectiveness isrequired. Changes in the Built Environment Over the past forty years, the built environ- ment in the United States has changed inways that have promoted sedentary lifestylesand less andKaren Glanz although re-searchers have found many links between thebuilt environment and children's physical ac-tivity, they have yet to find definitive evi-dence that aspects of the built environmentpromote obesity. For example, children andadolescents with easy access to recreationalfacilities are more active than those without such access, and few of these facilities exist in low-income neighborhoods. Likewise, safe and short routes to school make it easier forchildren to walk and cycle to school. But, given the paucity of research, researchers cannot yet establish conclusively that moreaccess to recreation or more active commut- ing would reduce rates of obesity or even identify which kinds of environmentalchanges are most likely to promote greater physical activity. Recent changes in the nutri- tion environment, including greater relianceon convenience foods and fast foods, a lack ofaccess to fresh fruits and vegetables, and ex- panding portion sizes, are also believed to contribute to the epidemic of childhood obe - sity. But, again, conclusive evidence that changes in the nutrition environment will re-duce rates of obesity does not yet exist. Changes in Schools Mary Story , Karen Kaphingst, and Simone French demonstrate that U.S. schools offer many opportunities for developing obesity-prevention strategies. They explain thatmeals at school are available both throughthe U.S. Department of Agriculture' s school breakfast and lunch programs and through \"competitive foods\" sold \u00e0 la carte in cafete- rias, vending machines, and snack bars.School breakfasts and school lunches mustmeet federal nutrition standards, but com - petitive foods are exempt from such require- ments. While schools argue that budget pres-sures force them to sell popular butnutritionally poor foods \u00e0 la carte, limited ev-idence shows that schools can offer studentsmore healthful \u00e0 la carte choices and not losemoney. In fact, some states are limiting salesof nonnutritious foods, and many of the na-tion's largest school districts restrict competi- tive foods. Other pressures can compromise schools' efforts to provide comprehensiveIntroducing the Issue VOL. 16 / NO. 1 / SPRING 2006 901 5562 intro.qxp 1/22/2006 12:52 PM Page 9physical activity programs. As states use stan- dardized tests to hold schools and students academically accountable, schools view phys- ical education and recess as lower priorities.Yet some states are promoting more physical activity in schools. In addition, randomized evaluations of a small number of school-based interventions have shown success at re- ducing weight gain among children. These interventions typically involve componentsthat teach children about nutrition, promote reductions in television viewing, and engage children in physical activity. Many also in-volve parents to promote more healthful eat-ing and greater physical activity when chil- dren are not in school. These studies indicate that school-based programs, policies, and en - vironments can make a difference in child- hood obesity. Changes in Child Care Mary Story, Simone French, and Karen Kaphingst also acknowledge that researchersknow relatively little about either the nutri-tion or the physical activity environments inthe nation' s child care facilities, though exist- ing research suggests that the nutritional quality of meals and snacks may be poor andactivity levels may be inadequate. Part of theproblem is that no uniform standards applyto nutritional or physical activity offerings inchild care centers. With the exception of thefederal Head Start program, which has fed - eral performance standards for nutrition and physical activity, child care facilities are regu-lated by states, and state rules vary widely . One federal program\u2014the Department of Agriculture's Child and Adult Care Food Pro-gram\u2014provides funding for meals and snacksfor almost 3 million children in child careeach day. Providers who receive these fundsmust serve meals and snacks that meet cer - tain minimal standards but not specific nutri- ent-based standards. With a large share ofyoung children attending child care and pre- school programs, policymakers should place a high priority on understanding what policies and practices in these settings can preventchildhood obesity. Changes in Parenting Ana Lindsay, Katarina Sussner, Juhee Kim, and Steven Gortmaker review evidence on how parents can help their children developand maintain healthful eating and physical activity habits\u2014and thereby ultimately help prevent childhood obesity. They show howimportant it is for parents to understand howtheir roles in preventing obesity change as their children move through critical develop- mental periods, from before birth throughadolescence. They point out that researchers,policymakers, and practitioners should alsomake use of such information to developmore effective interventions and educationalprograms that address childhood obesityright where it starts\u2014at home. Although agreat deal of research has been done on howparents shape their children' s eating and physical activity habits, surprisingly few high- quality data exist on the effectiveness of obe-sity-prevention programs that center onparental involvement. The authors also re-view research evaluating school-based inter - ventions that include components targeted atparents. The authors acknowledge thatachieving the ultimate goal of preventing andcontrolling the growing childhood obesityepidemic will require programs and policiesthat are multifaceted and community-wide,but they emphasize that parents are centralto these wider efforts. Research shows thatsuccessful intervention must involve andwork directly with parents from the veryearly stages of child development and growthto make healthful changes in the home and toreinforce and support healthful eating andregular physical activity.Christina Paxson, Elisabeth Donahue, C. T racy Orleans, and Jeanne Ann Grisso 10 THE FUTURE OF CHILDREN01 5562 intro.qxp 1/22/2006 12:52 PM Page 10Targeting Interventions for Minority and Low-Income Children Although rates of childhood obesity among the general population are alarmingly high,they are higher still in ethnic minority and low-income communities. Shiriki Kumanyika and Sonya Grier summarize differences inchildhood obesity prevalence by race and ethnicity and by socioeconomic status. They then discuss how various environmental fac-tors may have contributed to the higher obe- sity rates among disadvantaged and minority children. The authors show that low-incomeand minority children watch more televisionthan white, non-poor children and thus are exposed to many more commercials for high- fat and high-sugar foods. They note thatneighborhoods where low-income and mi-nority children live typically have more fast-food restaurants and fewer vendors of health - ful foods than do wealthier neighborhoods. Children in these neighborhoods often facemany obstacles to physical activity , such as unsafe streets, dilapidated parks, and a lack of facilities. The authors see some promise inthe schools that low-income and minoritychildren attend. The national school lunchand breakfast programs, for example, provideimportant nutritional safety nets for many ofthe nation' s poorer children. Also, state ef- forts to limit sales of sugar- and fat-ladenfoods at school could lead the way to effec-tive obesity prevention\u2014although the au - thors caution that these policies may impose a financial burden on poorer school districts. When Prevention Fails: The Medical Community's Response Sonia Caprio notes that although pediatri - cians are concerned about the problem of obesity, most are not equipped to treat obesechildren. The most effective treatment pro - grams have been carried out in academic centers through an approach that combines adietary component, behavioral modification, physical activity, and parental involvement.Such programs, however, have yet to betranslated to primary care settings. Success-fully treating obesity will require a major shift in pediatric care that makes use of the find- ings of these academic centers regardingstructured intervention programs. To ensure that pediatricians are well trained in treating obesity, the American Medical Association isworking with federal agencies, medical spe- cialty societies, and public health organiza- tions to educate physicians about how to pre-vent and manage obesity in both children andadults, incorporating evidence from new re- search as it is developed. The goal is to in- clude such training as part of undergraduate,graduate, and continuing medical educationprograms. Effective treatment will also re-quire changes in how obesity treatment andprevention services are financed. Currently,because insurance often does not cover obe-sity treatment, long-term weight-manage - ment programs are beyond the reach of most patients. Implications The research in this volume firmly estab - lishes that increases in childhood overweight and obesity pose a real health threat for thenation's children. As the articles demonstrate,researchers have proposed many environ-mental and policy solutions\u2014from buildingmore sidewalks, to limiting soda sales inschools, to building more grocery stores inpoor neighborhoods\u2014to fix the problem. Butevidence on the effectiveness of many ofthese proposed solutions will take time todevelop. In the short run, it makes sense to focus attention on programs and policies that have a good chance of being effective and forwhich there are policy \"levers\" to producechange. A review of the evidence in this vol-ume suggests four promising strategies. TheIntroducing the Issue VOL. 16 / NO. 1 / SPRING 2006 1101 5562 intro.qxp 1/22/2006 obesity-prevention ini- tiatives that involve and benefit both children and their parents. The second is to improve nutrition and physical activity environmentswithin schools. The third is to limit children's exposure to advertising. And the fourth is to improve the way pediatricians deliver pre-ventive care and treatment for obesity and related conditions. Several articles in this volume discuss obe - sity-prevention programs that have been shown to work. These interventions, dis-cussed in the two articles by Mary Story , Karen Kaphingst, and Simone French and in the article by Ana Lindsay , Katarina Sussner, Juhee Kim, and Stephen Gortmaker, havebeen children of varyingages, from preschoolers to adolescents. Theyare typically conducted within schools andchild care centers and involve componentsthat teach children and their parents aboutdiet and television viewing and that engagechildren in physical activity. In some pro-grams, such as \"Planet Health\"\u2014which MaryStory and her colleagues discuss in their arti-cle on schools\u2014parents and children areasked to work collaboratively to make suchchanges in the home environment as reduc-ing TV time. Others combine in-school activ-ities with informational materials sent home to parents. Although more work is required to tailor these interventions to children of various ages and demographic groups, the ev-idence indicates that obesity-prevention in- terventions can be effective at changing the behaviors of both children and their parents. It makes sense to locate obesity-prevention programs in schools and child care centers,where instructors can reach both children and their parents, but many schools and child care centers lack the resources or skills to im-plement new programs. In addition, schoolsare under increasing pressure to devote time to academics rather than to health-oriented programs. These problems can be counteredin part by providing schools and child carecenters with the funds and training requiredto implement obesity-prevention programs.Another possible venue for obesity preven-tion is after-school programs. These programsserve a growing number of children, espe - cially low-income and minority children who are at the highest risk of becoming obese. Im - plementing obesity-prevention strategies in after-school programs presents an attractiveoption for many schools, because it may pre - sent fewer conflicts with the schools' academic mandates. Another promising strategy is to improve the foods that children eat at school. Because it iseasier for policymakers to regulate what isserved in the school cafeteria than to affectwhat is offered on the kitchen table, schoolsare a logical place to focus efforts to improvechildren's diets. Local, state, and federal poli-cies affect what foods are now served inschools. The Department of Agriculture(USDA) enforces standards for the nutri-tional content of food sold in the nationalschool lunch program, and schools that par-ticipate in this program are prohibited fromChristina Paxson, Elisabeth Donahue, C. T racy Orleans, and Jeanne Ann Grisso 12 THE FUTURE OF CHILDRENImplementing obesity- prevention strategies in after-school programspresents an attractive option for many schools,because it may with the nutritional value\" in school cafeterias during lunchtime. But, as Mary Story and her coauthors point out, the definition of \"minimal nutritional value\" in-cludes only a small class of foods (such as soda and chewing gum) and excludes such foods as candy bars, cookies, and potatochips. Barring additional state or local regula- tions, schools that follow the USDA's regula- tions are free to sell these foods in their cafe-terias and can sell food of minimal nutritional value outside of cafeterias, often in vending machines or student stores. Many states and local school districts have chosen to impose requirements that are stronger than those the USDA enforces. ByApril 2005, twenty-eight states had takensteps to limit competitive foods sold in schoolcafeterias. 10The National Conference of State Legislatures reported in May 2005 thata few states had enacted laws regulatingvending machine sales in schools, and othershad introduced legislation that would, if en-acted, restrict vending machine sales. 11The popularity of these initiatives is heightenedby evidence, discussed by Mary Story and hercoauthors, that schools that have shifted tomore healthful foods in cafeterias and vend-ing machines have been able to do so withoutlosing revenue. An important question iswhether these state efforts are sufficient, orwhether it is time for the USDA to play alarger role in regulating sales of competitivefoods. A strong case could be made forchanges in federal policy if the states that areexperimenting with new school nutritionpolicies show success in promoting morehealthful eating and in preventing childhoodobesity. Although less is known about the re-lationship between the nutritional quality offoods provided in child care centers and thedevelopment of obesity, the Child and AdultCare Food Program, which serves these set-tings, provides similar opportunities for fed- eral policy to influence children's diets. Schools may also take steps to increase chil- dren's physical activity. However, the evi- dence on the best way to do so is mixed. A recent study by John Cawley, Chad Meyer-hoefer, and David Newhouse indicates that states that increased the time that students were required to spend in physical educationclasses did not show reductions in the share of children who were overweight. 12Yet some interventions aimed at increasing physical ac-tivity in schools have been proven effective.The key to this puzzle may be that many physical education classes do not provide stu- dents with enough vigorous exercise to be ef - fective. The study by Cawley, Meyerhoefer, and Newhouse found that increases in the re-quired hours of physical education translatedinto much smaller increases in students' re-ports of time spent exercising. Researchersshould place a high priority on identifyingand implementing programs that effectivelyincrease physical activity at school. Another area that deserves immediate atten- tion is commercial advertising aimed at chil - dren. Regulated at the federal level by Con- gress and the Federal CommunicationsCommission, advertising aimed at children,particularly advertising that promotes un-healthful behavior , has traditionally been subject to limits that courts have found con- stitutionally permissible. 13As John Cawley notes in his article in this volume, childrenview an average of 40,000 television ads ayear. A child watching Saturday morning tel-evision may see one food commercial everyfive minutes, with most featuring such en-ergy-dense, minimally nutritious foods ascandy , sugared cereal, and fast food. 14Al- though studies have not found a conclusive link between the content of advertising andIntroducing the Issue VOL. 16 / NO. 1 / SPRING 2006 1301 5562 intro.qxp 1/22/2006 12:52 PM Page 13obesity, they have shown that children find advertisements very persuasive and that, in turn, children successfully influence their parents' food purchases.15The evidence that Shiriki Kumanyika and Sonya Grier present in this volume indicates that low-income and minority children, who have a higher chancethan other children of becoming obese, are exposed to more advertising than other children. Obviously, one strategy for limiting children's exposure to advertising is to educate parentsabout television and encourage them simplyto turn off the TV . The reality is, however, that even with limited television viewing, children are exposed to a great deal of adver - tising. Thus another strategy is to reduce ad- vertising time for energy-dense foods aimedat children or to mandate that ads for junkfood be balanced with advertising for healthyfoods such as fresh fruits and vegetables. Themost aggressive strategy would be to institutean outright ban on advertising for foods thatare high in sugar , fat, and calories during chil - dren' s programming, just as Congress has banned all tobacco advertising on television and radio. 16Although the evidence of a link between obesity and advertising may not yetbe strong enough to justify a ban on food ad - vertisements geared toward children, the evi-dence that children are easily swayed by foodcommercials suggests that some limits areadvisable. A final area that clearly needs reform is the way pediatric medical care is delivered toprevent and treat childhood obesity. As SoniaCaprio documents, pediatricians are notbeing adequately trained to screen for, pre-vent, and treat childhood obesity. To remedythis deficiency , medical schools and pediatric residency programs need to train physicians how to prevent obesity as well as how to man-age its associated health problems. In addi- tion, doctors must be compensated for deliv-ering obesity-related care. Although federallaw does not prevent states from reimbursingproviders for obesity prevention and treat- ment services through Medicaid and the State Child Health Insurance Programs(S-CHIP), neither does it mandate that they do so. Many states now offer little coverage for these services. 17Moreover, some private insurance companies do not recognize obe- sity as a disease or reimburse treatment at low rates.18Thus some providers find them- selves in the position of being able to claimreimbursement for treating specific health problems that stem from obesity, but not being reimbursed fully for treating obesityitself. States could mandate that Medicaidand private insurance cover obesity as a dis-ease, with appropriate reimbursement forevidence-based counseling and biomedicalinterventions. Several states have alreadydone so; according to Sonia Caprio' s article in this volume, of the four bills introduced in states this year to require Medicaid treatmentoptions, two became law . At the federal level, views about whether obesity is or is not a dis- ease are also starting to shift. In July 2004,the Department of Health and Human Ser-vices removed language from the MedicareCoverage Issues Manual stating that obesitywas not an illness. Removing this languagepaved the way for Medicare recipients\u2014primarily elderly Americans\u2014to be coveredfor obesity treatments that are shown to beeffective. Policymakers should take similarsteps for the public and private health insur-ance programs that cover children. These policy recommendations are cautious, based on strategies that promise to yield themost results in the short term. But they aresimply first steps in what is likely to be a longbattle to reverse obesity trends. NumerousChristina Paxson, Elisabeth Donahue, C. T racy Orleans, and Jeanne Ann Grisso 14 THE FUTURE OF CHILDREN01 5562 intro.qxp 1/22/2006 12:52 PM Page 14innovative policies and programs, not now supported by strong evidence, nevertheless hold promise. Among them are improving ac- cess to healthful foods in low-income neigh-borhoods by bringing in farmers' markets and grocery stores; constructing sidewalks so that children can walk or bike to school; buildingor enhancing hiking trails and parks so that children and their families can be more phys- ically active; and requiring restaurants to pro-vide more helpful nutrition information to consumers. The only way to learn whether these strate- gies work is to experiment with them. Manystates and communities are undertaking new programs that incorporate a wide array of obesity-prevention strategies. These initia- tives can teach us about the most effectiveways to reduce child obesity. But to realize their full promise, researchers must carefully and extensively evaluate these initiatives andthen disseminate their findings widely. A pre- requisite for any effective public health cam- paign is a solid base of knowledge about whatcan be done to improve health. Building this knowledge base will take time, attention, and funding, but it is essential to halting the risein childhood obesity.Introducing the Issue VOL. 16 / NO. 1 / SPRING 2006 1501 5562 intro.qxp 1/22/2006 Liverman, and Vivica I.

Anderson and Kristin F. Butcher Summary The increase in childhood obesity over the past several decades, together with the associated health problems and costs, is raising grave concern among health care professionals, policy ex-perts, children's advocates, and parents. Patricia Anderson and Kristin Butcher document trends in children's obesity and examine the possible underlying causes of the obesity epidemic. They begin by reviewing research on energy intake, energy expenditure, and \"energy balance,\" noting that children who eat more \"empty calories\" and expend fewer calories through physicalactivity are more likely to be obese than other children. Next they ask what has changed in chil - dren's environment over the past three decades to upset this energy balance equation. In par- ticular, they examine changes in the food market, in the built environment, in schools and childcare settings, and in the role of parents\u2014paying attention to the timing of these changes. Among the changes that affect children' s energy intake are the increasing availability of energy- dense, high-calorie foods and drinks through schools. Changes in the family , particularly an in- crease in dual-career or single-parent working families, may also have increased demand for food away from home or pre-prepared foods. A host of factors have also contributed to reduc - tions in energy expenditure. In particular, children today seem less likely to walk to school and to be traveling more in cars than they were during the early 1970s, perhaps because of changesin the built environment. Finally, children spend more time viewing television and usingcomputers. Anderson and Butcher find no one factor that has led to increases in children's obesity. Rather, many complementary changes have simultaneously increased children's energy intake and de-creased their energy expenditure. The challenge in formulating policies to address children' s obesity is to learn how best to change the environment that affects children's energy balance.

All are concerned that today's over- weight and obese children will turn into to-morrow's overweight and obese adults, destined to suffer from all the health prob- lems and health care costs associated withobesity. In this essay, we document trends in children's obesity and examine the under- lying causes of the obesity epidemic. We begin by discussing definitions of over- weight and obesity, noting some potential problems. W e document trends in adult and childhood obesity, both worldwide and in the United States, over the past threedecades, paying particular attention to thetiming of the increase in obesity. We pref-ace our analysis of obesity's causes with abrief review of research on children' s en- ergy intake and energy expenditure and on what affects children' s \"energy balance.\" Research findings support the idea that children who eat more \"empty calories\"and expend fewer calories through physi - cal activity are more likely to be obese than other children. Finally we examinehow the environment in which children areraised might have changed over the pastthree decades and how these changesmight have upset the energy balance equa-tion. Have changes in the food market, inthe built environment, in schools and childcare settings, and in the role of parentscontributed to increased obesity? In par-ticular , we examine whether the timing of the changes in children's environments coincides with the timing of the increase inobesity , making it likely that those changes are driving the increase in children's obe- sity rates.Defining Obesity Typically, obesity and overweight in adults are defined in terms of body mass index(BMI), which in turn is defined as weight inkilograms divided by height in meters squared (kg/m 2).1Guidelines issued by the National Institutes of Health consider anadult underweight if his or her BMI is less than 18.5, overweight if BMI is 25 or more, and obese if BMI is 30 or more. 2 Use of BMI to assess overweight and obesity in children is more controversial. Becausechildren are growing, the link between adi-posity, or \"true fatness,\" and the ratio of their weight to their height may be looser than that of adults. However , William Dietz and Mary Bellizzi, reporting on a conference convened by the International Obesity Task Force, notethat BMI offers \"a reasonable measure withwhich to assess fatness in children and adoles-cents.\" 3They also conclude that a BMI above the 85th percentile for a child' s age and sex group is likely to accord with the adult defini- tion of overweight, and a BMI above the 95thpercentile is consistent with the adult defini - tion of obese. 4Children are thus defined as being overweight or obese if they have a BMIabove given age- and sex-specific percentilecutoffs. These cutoffs, which were set for abase population surveyed in the early 1970sbefore obesity began to increase, yield a spe-cific, fixed BMI cutoff used to define over - weight and obesity for boys and girls of each age. 5Later in the article we will use these cut- offs to define obesity using the NationalHealth and Nutrition Examination Surveys(NHANES), a nationally representative sam-ple of U.S. children who were consistentlyweighed and measured between 1971 and2002. 6The data will show an increase in measured obesity over time if more childrenin each of the NHANES surveys have a BMIabove this fixed cutoff number.Patricia M. Anderson and Kristin F . Butcher 20 THE FUTURE OF CHILDREN02 5562 anderson-butcher.qxp 1/22/2006 12:53 PM Page 20Obesity in the United States In the United States obesity rates have in- creased for all age groups over the past thirtyyears. Figure 1 shows the share of the U.S.population, by age group, that is obese basedon the BMI cutoffs described above. 7During1971-74 about 5 percent of children aged two to nineteen years were obese. By 1976-80 theshare obese was slightly higher, 1988-94 share obese nearlydoubled. By 1999-2002 children were considered obese. Al-Childhood Obesity: T rends and Potential Causes VOL. 16 / NO. 1 / SPRING 2006 21International Trends in Obesity Obesity is a problem not just in the United States but worldwide. Comparing international obesity rates and trends using BMI, however, is complicated, as the relationship between \"true fatness\"and height and weight may differ for people in different environments. Some groups, for example,may simply have denser body composition than others. Definitions are particularly complicated ininternational comparisons of obesity in children. If age- and sex-specific growth patterns inBotswana differ from those in the United States, then obesity definitions based on the same BMIcutoffs are unlikely to yield useful comparisons. Nonetheless, a growing body of literature examin-ing specific populations has concluded that obesity is increasing worldwide. Table 1 lists adult obesity rates collected by the World Health Organization for selected countries and time periods. 1Although different countries have different obesity rates, a common pattern across all countries listed, with the exception of Japan, is that adult obesity rates are rising. U.S.adult obesity rates are among the world's highest (compare the rates in table 1 with those in fig-ure 1 on page 23). In 1995, for example, 15 percent of men and 16.5 percent of women in En - gland were obese. In the United States (in the nearest time period for which data are available),the share was more than 20 percent for men and women combined. Only the former German De-mocratic Republic has obesity rates that are similar to those in the United States for similar years.The rates are still quite low in Japan, Finland, Sweden, and the Netherlands. Many studies of individual countries have also noted increases in childhood obesity in recent years. Helen Kalies and two colleagues found that obesity rates rose from 1.8 to 2.8 percentamong preschool children in Germany between 1982 and 1997. 2Among children aged seven to eleven in England, the prevalence of overweight and obesity increased from less than 10 percentfor both boys and girls in the mid-1970s to more than 20 percent for girls and more than 15 per - cent for boys by 1998. 3In urban areas in China, the prevalence of obesity increased among chil - dren aged two to six from 1.5 percent in 1989 to 12.6 percent in 1997. In rural China over thesame period, obesity rates fell. 4Though childhood obesity is on the rise worldwide, the patterns differ, in expected ways, between developing and developed countries. In the former, obesity maycoexist with undernutrition, with children in the relatively affluent urban areas more likely to beobese than their rural counterparts. 1.

Rates for boys and girls were nearly identical. Adult obesity also steadily increased, with the share ofadults defined as obese larger than that ofchildren in any given time period. Obesityrates increased for both men and women,though women had higher rates than men. 8 Logically enough, increasing childhood obe - sity is related to increasing adult obesity. Obese children are much more likely thannormal weight children to become obeseadults. Obesity even in very young children iscorrelated with higher rates of obesity inadulthood. A study from the late 1990s showsthat 52 percent of children who are obese be-tween the ages of three and six are obese atage twenty-five as against only 12 percent ofnormal and underweight three- to six-year-old children. 9Although the obese share of the population is expected to increase with age, obesity todayis increasing with age more quickly than itdid thirty years ago. Researchers in 1971 try - ing to project what share of ten-year-olds that year would be obese by the time they turnedforty in 2001 would have predicted the shareto be between 10 and 15 percent. But in1999-2002 the share was close to 30 percent.This change in the relationship between ageand obesity has important implications forpredicting what share of the population willhave obesity-related health problems as thepopulation ages. The precise timing of the increase in obesity in the United States is also important for re - searchers attempting to identify its causes. As shown in figure 1, the obese share of the U.S.population for both children and adults wasfairly stable between 1971-74 and 1976-80and only began to increase thereafter. Thus, inPatricia M.

Before beginning our analysis of these causes, we want to document a few more importantfeatures of the trend in obesity. As figure 2shows, obesity rates are higher among minor-ity and low-income children than among chil - dren as a whole. 10Although obesity increased for all children, it increased more for childrenin low-income families and increased themost for African American children. In addition to examining changes in obesity rates it is important to examine how the distri - bution of BMI has also changed. Obesity ratesalone may be misleading because smallchanges in BMI may result in large changes inobesity rates. Suppose, for example, that in oneyear a large group of children with BMIs justbelow the obesity cutoff gained a few pounds,thus tipping over into the obese category. Obe-sity rates would increase, even though the un-derlying health of the population did notchange much. Distribution of BMI is also im-portant in comparing obesity rates betweengroups. For example, if obesity rates werehigher among low-income children simply be-cause a slightly higher fraction of children hadBMIs above the obesity cutoff, differences in obesity rates would not be expected to trans- late into differences in health outcomes. An examination of the data indicates that movements of people from just below to justabove the BMI cutoffs cannot explain changesin obesity in the 1990s. By 1999-2002 not onlywas a larger share of children obese, thosewho were obese were also heavier than in thepast. Figure 2 charts changes in the percent-age of children who are obese for all children,for low-income children, and for AfricanAmerican children; it also reports averageBMI among the obese for these groups. A ver- age BMI among all obese children increased little between 1971-74 and 1988-94, implyingthat the increase in obesity rates was mostlydue to a higher fraction of children \"tipping\"over the obesity cutoff. But by 1999-2002 av - erage BMI had increased among obese chil- dren. The increase in average BMI amongobese children between 1971-74 and1999-2002 corresponds to an increase in bodyweight for a 4'6\" tall child from about 113.6pounds to 116.1 pounds. Figures 3 and 4 cast more light on the chang- ing BMI distribution. They show the share ofadults and children, respectively, that is over-weight (but not obese) and the share obese.Figure 1. Percentage of U.S. Population That Is Obese Source: Authors' calculations from National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES).Childhood Obesity: T rends and Potential Causes VOL. 16 / NO. 1 / SPRING 2006 23 35 30 25 20 15 10 5 BMI at the median of the dis- tribution (half of the people are heavier) and at the 95th percentile of the distribution (5 percent of the people are heavier). After1976-80 the share overweight and the shareobese increase for both adults and children,but the share obese increases more rapidly . Similarly, although the median BMI in- creases after 1980, BMI at the 95th per-centile increases more quickly . Two examples illustrate the consequences of these changes in the distribution of BMI. An adult woman who is 5'4\" tall, with a BMI atthe median, would weigh 143.3 pounds in1971-74. By 1999-2002 she would weigh157.3 pounds, a gain of 14 pounds, or 9.8 per - cent. But a 5'4\" tall woman with a BMI at the95th percentile would go from 197.5 to 231.9pounds over the same period\u2014a gain of 34.4pounds, or 17.4 percent. For children, the dif-ference in the median and upper-tail weightgain is even more striking. A 4'6\" child withthe median BMI would gain 4.6 pounds overthis period for a 6.3 percent increase (73.4 to78.0 pounds). But a child at the 95th per - centile would gain about 19 pounds for a 17.5 percent weight gain (108.3 to 127.3 pounds). In short, BMI is becoming more unequally distributed: the heavy have gotten muchheavier. Furthermore, obesity is not evenly distributed across socio-demographic groups. Indeed, given the pattern of changes in the BMI distribution, obesity appears to havemuch in common with other diseases: every-one may be exposed to a given change in theenvironment, but only those with a suscepti - bility to the given disease will come down with it. For those with a susceptibility to obe-sity, the conditions appear to be right for their disease to flourish. A Question of Energy Balance Clearly, overweight and obesity are increasing in children and adults. Less clear are thecauses of this increase, although the basicphysiology of weight change is well under - stood: weight is gained when energy intake ex-ceeds energy expenditure. Although certainendocrinological or overweight\u2014and although these syndromes are often testedfor, especially in cases of childhood obesity\u2014less than 5 percent of obesity cases result fromthese \"endogenous\" factors. 11 Genetics also plays a big role in obesity . Re- cent studies have concluded that about 25 to 40 percent of BMI is heritable.12IdenticalPatricia M. Anderson and Kristin F . Butcher 24 THE FUTURE OF CHILDRENFigure 2.

But it does appear thatcertain people may have a higher genetic sus - ceptibility to weight gain. Thus, when identi- cal twins are subjected to an overfeeding reg-imen, the correlation of the weight gainwithin twin pairs is significantly higher than that between twin pairs. 14But as important as genes are, the primary focus in the search forthe causes of rising obesity must be onchanges in energy balance.Maintaining a stable weight requires a deli - cate balance between energy intake and en- ergy expenditures. V ery young children seem capable of adjusting their intake to matchtheir outflow, but as children grow up, theyseem to lose this apparently innate ability . 15 Their food intake, rather than being based on energy needs, is influenced by external cues,such as the amount of food presented. 16 Much research on childhood obesity focuses on the role of energy intake, with most stud-ies analyzing a particular source. Studies of Energy Intake Fast food is a common subject of such stud - ies. Cross-sectional studies have established that individuals consuming fast-food mealsChildhood Obesity: T rends and Potential Causes VOL. 16 / NO. 1 / SPRING 2006 25Figure 3.

In fact, Cara Ebbeling and several colleagues find that although both overweight and leanadolescents consume more calories when eat- ing fast food, the lean compensate for that en- ergy intake, while the overweight do not. 18A recent long-term study of eight- to twelve- year-old girls did find that those eating fast food two or more times a week at baseline,when 96 percent of study subjects were lean,had larger weight gains at a three-year follow- up. 19But the study covers only middle-class, white females. And although its long-term de - sign makes it more reliable than a cross- sectional study, it still does not conclusivelyprove a causal effect of fast food. Unobservedcharacteristics of the girls that may be corre-lated with both fast-food consumption andweight gain may be the true causal culprit. Another frequently studied source of energy is sweet beverages, mainly soft drinks but alsojuice. As with fast food, studies generally es-tablish that drinking these beverages results inhigher overall energy intake. Several studieshave also found a positive link between over - weight and soft drink consumption. 20Find- ings on juice consumption have been moremixed; cross-sectional studies find a link, butsome long-term studies do not. 21More re- cently, however, a long-term study ofpreschoolers has found a positive link be - tween all sweet beverages (including soda, juice, and other fruit drinks) and over-weight. 22Another recent study looks at re - peated cross-sections of fifth graders in one school and finds a positive, but not significant,relationship between sweetened beverageconsumption and BMI. 23Finally, another study uses a long-term design similar to that ofthe fast-food study just noted. Children aged nine to fourteen in 1996 were followed annu-ally through 1998. For both boys and girls,consumption of sugar-added beverages im-plied small increases in BMI over the years. 24 Another much-studied source of energy in- take is snacks. Although snack foods tend to be energy dense, implying that snacking may increase overall energy intake, snacking doesnot appear to contribute to childhood over- weight. In a simple cross-sectional study com- paring obese and non-obese adolescents,Linda Bandini and several colleagues findthat energy intake from snacks is similar for both groups. 25They conclude that obese ado- lescents eat no more \"junk\" food than non-obese adolescents, and thus the former'ssource of energy imbalance must lie else-where. A recent long-term study by SarahPhillips and colleagues comes to a similarconclusion after collecting information fromeight- to twelve-year -old girls annually for ten years. 26The study finds no relationship be- tween consuming snack foods (such as chips,baked goods, and candy) and BMI, althoughas in the beverage-specific studies just noted,it does find a relationship between BMI andsoda. Studies of Energy Expenditure The other, equally important side of the en- ergy balance equation is energy expendi - tures, both through physical activity and through dietary thermogenesis and the basalmetabolic rate (BMR). Dietary thermogene - sis refers to the energy required to digest meals, and the basal metabolic rate refers tothe energy required to maintain the restingbody's functions. For sedentary adults, physi-cal activity is responsible for 30 percent oftotal energy expenditure, dietary thermogen - esis for 10 percent, and BMR for the remain- ing 60 percent. 27Several studies examinePatricia M. Anderson and Kristin F . Butcher 26 THE FUTURE OF CHILDREN02 5562 anderson-butcher.qxp 1/22/2006 12:53 PM Page 26whether a low BMR is responsible for over- weight in children. For example, in a study of both obese and non-obese adolescents, Ban- dini, Dale Schoeller, and William findthat obese teens do not have lower-than- average BMR, and thus lowered energy ex- penditure through BMR is not the cause ofmaintained obesity in adolescents. 28 The lack of evidence that BMR affects child- hood overweight and obesity argues for a re- search focus on physical activity\u2014or the lack thereof. So far, though, studies of the link be-tween physical activity and BMI have hadmixed results. 29One reason why researchers have difficulty proving that physical activity affects BMI may be that BMI is a potentiallypoor measure of adiposity in the presence ofsignificant lean muscle mass. A study oftwelve-year -old French children bears out this hypothesis. Looking at both BMI and waist circumference, researchers find thatphysical activity is linked with smaller waistcircumference for both boys and girls butwith lower BMI only for girls. 30Although findings from cross-sectional studies havebeen somewhat mixed, long-term studieshave associated increases in activity and de - creases in BMI. 31 Researchers have found much stronger links between sedentary activities, especially tele-vision viewing, and overweight and obesity . That said, at least one study that investigated the effect of television watching on physicalactivity found none. 32Interestingly , it found computer use, reading, and homework time associated with higher levels of physical activ-ity. The relationship, however , is just a cross- sectional correlation among these activities. It may be that the parents who encouragereading and homework and buy their chil - dren computers also encourage more physi- cal activity.William Dietz and Steven Gortmaker pro- duced the canonical study on television's rolein childhood obesity, finding that each addi-tional hour of television per day increased theprevalence of obesity by 2 percent. 33They note that television viewing may affect weight in several ways. First, it may squeeze outphysical activity. Second, television advertis- ing may increase children's desire for, and ul- timately their consumption of, energy-densesnack foods. Third, watching television may go hand in hand with snacking, leading to higher energy intake among children watch - ing television. Robert Klesges, Mary Shelton, and Lisa Klesges even concluded that chil - dren's metabolic rate was lower while watch- ing television than while at rest. 34That find - ing, however, has not been replicated, andlater studies find no effect. 35 Research on the relationship among television viewing and physical activity and overweighthas mixed findings. Although many studiesobserve a positive relationship between tele-vision viewing and childhood obesity, ThomasRobinson and several colleagues find only aweak relationship (but William Dietz pointsout several potential methodological prob-lems with this study), and Elizabeth V andewa- ter and colleagues find none at all. 36These mixed findings, though, tend to come fromChildhood Obesity: T rends and Potential Causes VOL. 16 / NO. 1 / SPRING 2006 27The lack of evidence that BMR affects childhoodoverweight and obesityargues for a research focus on physical activity\u2014or the lack thereof. 02 5562 anderson-butcher.qxp 1/22/2006 12:53 PM Page 27observational or prospective studies. More rigorous experimental studies consistently find that reducing children's television watch- ing lowers their BMI.37Because these experi- mental studies can establish causality while the others do not, it seems reasonable to con- clude that watching television does contributeto childhood obesity, despite the overall mixed findings of past studies. Studies of Other Correlates of Obesity Overall, then, much research on childhood obesity's possible causes focuses on factorsthat are expected to affect either the child'senergy intake or energy expenditure. Another line of research, however, simply documents childhood characteristics that are correlatedwith overweight, but it either does not or can-not determine their effects on the energy bal-ance equation. Many studies, for example,document that children from certain demo-graphic groups are more likely than otherchildren to be overweight. As noted, datafrom the NHANES show that African Ameri-can and lower -income children have a higher incidence of obesity than children overall. Using data from the National LongitudinalSurvey of Y outh, Richard Strauss and Harold Pollack demonstrate that both African Ameri- can and Hispanic children are more likely tobe overweight than white non-Hispanic chil-dren. 38They also find a negative relationship between income and rates of overweightamong whites only; the relationship for His-panics is insignificant; and for African Ameri-cans, slightly positive. The study also docu - ments regional differences, with children in the South and the West most likely to be over-weight. It finds no significant difference be - tween rural and urban children, although a recent study in Pennsylvania found nearly 20percent of seventh graders from rural districtsto be overweight compared to just 16 percentfrom urban districts. 39One other repeatedly analyzed characteris- tic\u2014having been breast-fed as an infant\u2014 does not clearly line up with the energy bal- ance equation. Beginning with Michael S.Kramer's work, many cross-sectional studies have found that older children are more likely to be lean if they were breast-fed. 40But other studies have had somewhat more mixed findings.41More recently, though, Stephan Arenz and colleagues, in a compre-hensive review of past studies, conclude that breast-feeding does seem to have a consistent negative effect on obesity, albeit a smallone. 42As William Dietz makes clear, the mechanism by which infant breast-feeding may affect weight at later ages is not cer- tain.43One possibility is an endocrine re - sponse to breast milk. Another is that moth- ers have greater discretion over how muchthey feed their infants when they bottle-feed.Breast-feeding may even affect future foodpreferences. It is also possible that the rela-tionship is purely an artifact of the cross-sectional study design. That is, the types ofmothers who do and do not breast-feed mayput into practice different nutritional and ac - tivity standards for their children as they grow up. Some evidence for this possibilitycan be found in a study by Melissa Nelson,Penny Gordon-Larsen, and Linda Adair , which confirms the cross-sectional finding ofa link between breast-fed infants and normal-weight older children using long-term datafrom the National Longitudinal Study ofAdolescent Health. 44When using sibling pairs to control for unobserved maternal fac - tors, however, they find no effect of breast- feeding on weight. In other words, a breast-fed child is no more likely to be thin than hisor her sibling who was not breast-fed. Al-though this finding provides compelling evi-dence that breast-feeding does not affectchildren's weights, two considerations temperthis conclusion. First, the sample of familiesPatricia M. Anderson and Kristin F . Butcher 28 THE FUTURE OF CHILDREN02 5562 anderson-butcher.qxp 1/22/2006 12:53 PM Page 28in which one sibling is breast-fed and another is not is small, perhaps making it difficult to identify statistically significant effects of breast-feeding on weight. Second, with sib-ling pairs where only one is breast-fed, the issue is why the mother made different deci- sions. It may be that the decisions were re-lated to factors that ultimately affected the children's weight. Taken together, what do these studies on the energy balance have to say about the causes of increasing childhood overweight and obesity?Most studies do not determine clear causality,but rather they reveal only cross-sectional correlations. In the stronger long-term stud- ies, many of the samples are relatively unrep - resentative (for example, middle-class girls from a specific region), making it unclearwhether the findings are broadly applicable.Even for studies replete with representative,long-term evidence (for example, the role oftelevision), the question is whether the timingof the exposure matches the timing of child-hood obesity trends. Changes in the Determinants of Energy Balance A range of environmental changes may have affected children' s energy balance over the past several decades. Combined with a po-tential genetic susceptibility, these changesmay have contributed to the increase inchildhood overweight and obesity. In thissection we consider four possible changes inthe environment: the food market, the builtenvironment, schools and day care, and par-ents. Subsequent articles in this volume dis-cuss each in more detail. Changes in the Food Market Despite a lack of abundant, clearly causal ev - idence, researchers find many correlations between some types of energy intake andchildhood obesity and overweight. As noted, probably the strongest evidence is for the role of soft drinks, followed by slightly mixed findings on the role of fast food. Very littleevidence exists that snack foods have a spe- cific effect. But even without a \"smoking gun\" in terms of energy intake, it is clear thatmore food, without a concomitant increase in energy expenditure, will result in weight gain. Could changes in the food market in the past several decades have caused the increase in childhood overweight and obesity? JudyPutnam and Shirley Gerrior analyze changesin the U.S. food supply and find a marked in-crease in overall consumption of carbonatedsoft drinks in the past several decades. 45The consumption of regular (non-diet) sodastrended slightly upward in the 1970s, re-mained fairly stable in the early 1980s, andthen exploded starting in 1987, continuing torise steadily through the 1990s. Figure 5 il-lustrates this trend, superimposing children'sobesity rates over the four periods for whichNHANES data are available. On first glance, the timing of the increase in soda consumption, which tracks closely thetrends in increasing childhood obesity, sug-gests that soda consumption may well be acontributor. But the trend is for overall con-sumption and includes that of adults as well asChildhood Obesity: T rends and Potential Causes VOL. 16 / NO. 1 / SPRING 2006 29One other repeatedly analyzed characteristic\u2014having been breast-fed as aninfant\u2014does not clearly lineup with the energy balance equation.02 5562 anderson-butcher.qxp 1/22/2006 12:53 PM Page 29children. Simone Lin, and Joanne Guthrie, however, document that children' s consumption has risen, with the av - erage intake more than doubling from five to twelve ounces a day.46Among those children who drink sodas (a share that increased from37 to 56 percent), average consumption rose50 percent, from 14 to 21 ounces. The twodata points of this study , one from 1977-78 and one from 1994-98, make it impossible to pinpoint whether the increase occurredmainly in the late 1980s, as it did for overallsoft drink consumption. But to the extent thatchildren' s consumption mirrored the overall trends, and given the significant effect on obesity that researchers have found for softdrinks, increased consumption may have con-tributed to the recent trends in obesity. Thequestion then becomes, What led to an in - crease in soft drink consumption? Certainly, spending for advertising soft drinks has beenon the rise\u2014from $541 million in 1995 to$799 million in 1999, an almost 50 percent in-crease. 47By contrast, overall food-related ad- vertising over the period increased less than20 percent, from $9.8 billion to $11.6 billion. Although beverage advertising appears to have been growing disproportionately, the evidenceon whether advertising increases overall con-sumption of a product\u2014or merely affects rela- tive brand consumption\u2014is somewhat mixed. Some evidence shows that advertising affectsfood preferences, even of children as young astwo. 48But Todd Zywicki, Debra Holt, and Maureen Ohlhausen argue that food advertis - ing is not a cause of increasing childhood obe- sity and point out that children's exposure toadvertising has increased little over time. 49 Howard Taras and Miriam Gage, however, note that commercials have grown shorterover time, thus exposing children to more ad - vertisements. And children's programming had 11 percent more commercials per hour in1993 than in 1987. 50Throughout that period, about half of the ads were for foods and bever - ages, though only about 6 percent of the bev-erage advertising was for soft drinks. Thisstudy , however , like most studies on children and advertising, focuses only on children's pro- gramming. Many children are watching adultprogramming on television and are thus beingexposed to the same advertisements as thegeneral population. Another possible source of the increase in soft drink consumption is the increase in foodconsumed away from home. French, Lin, andGuthrie note that the share of soft drinksconsumed in restaurants (including fast-foodPatricia M. Anderson and Kristin F . Butcher 30 THE FUTURE OF CHILDRENFigure 5. Annual Regular (Non-Diet) Soft Drink Consumption Sources: NHANES data; regular soft drink consumption data for the United States overall are from Judy Putnam and Shirley Gerrior, \"Trends in the U.S. Food Supply, 1970-97,\" in America's Eating Habits: Changes and Consequences, edited by Elizabeth Frazao, USDA Agriculture Information Bulletin no. 750 (Washington: USDA, 1999), pp. 133-59 (www.ers.usda.gov/publications/aib750/ [September 26, 2005]). Notes: Shaded areas represent years over which BMI measures are available. The percentage of children overweight in those data is shown. 45 40 35 30 25 201970 1974 1978 1982 1986 1990 Page 30restaurants) rose more than 50 percent while at the same time the share consumed at home fell almost 25 percent.51Consumption of soft drinks from every source has in-creased over this period, but there has been a shift away from consumption at home. This trend in soft drinks mirrors the overall trendin food consumed away from home. Lin and several colleagues document a jump in the share of calories from food consumed awayfrom home from just 18 percent during 1977-78, to 27 percent by 1987-88, and to 34 percent by 1995. 52The increase in food away from home is a major change in the foodmarket. In fact, Shin-Yi Chou and colleagues claim that for adults, up to two-thirds of the increase in obesity since 1980 can be ex - plained by the per capita increase in fast-food restaurants over the period. 53Their method- ology , however, does not rule out the possibil- ity that the growth trends in both series are just coincidentally correlated. Also looking at adults, David Cutler and col- leagues argue that the mushrooming of fast-food restaurants is just part and parcel of anoverall change in technology, with tastiertreats becoming available at lower cost andgreater convenience. 54They point to snack- ing as the key source of increased energy in - take for adults. As noted, though, there is lit-tle evidence for a direct effect of snacking onchildren' s obesity . The change in the food market that remains in play, however, is por- tion size. As noted, all but the youngest chil-dren will eat more when offered larger por - tions. 55Looking at convenience foods (both fast foods and other foods packaged for sin-gle-serving consumption), Lisa Y oung and Marion Nestle document increases in portion sizes. 56For 181 products they can identify the date when portion sizes were increased.Throughout the 1970s portion sizes of thoseproducts increased rarely\u2014fewer than tentimes every five years. That number doubled during the first half of the 1980s to about twenty and doubled again by the first half of the 1990s to more than forty. During the lasthalf of the 1990s portion sizes increased more than sixty times. This timing too fits rel- atively closely with the timing of increases inchildhood obesity. Thus the increase in child- hood overweight may be driven not just by increased consumption of particular foods, such as sodas, but also by the change in thefood market toward larger portion sizes. No discussion of the food market would be complete without considering prices. DariusLakdawalla and T omas Philipson, for exam - ple, argue that declines in the relative price of food have led people to eat more\u2014and henceto increased obesity . 57They calculate that up to 40 percent of the adult increase in BMIsince 1980 can be attributed to growing de-mand for calories resulting from lower prices.Within food groups, the consumer price indexfor food away from home rose only slightlymore slowly than the index for food athome. 58Starting with an index of 100 for 1982-84, the food-at-home index rose toChildhood Obesity: T rends and Potential Causes VOL. 16 / NO. 1 / SPRING 2006 31Consumption of soft drinks from every source hasincreased over this period, butthere has been a shift awayfrom consumption at home.This trend in soft drinksmirrors the overall trend infood consumed away from home.02 5562 anderson-butcher.qxp 1/22/2006 12:53 PM Page 31changes in children's physical activity should nevertheless be investigated. Historically,physical activity was not something one setout to do; it was simply part of life. In fact,Tomas Philipson and Richard Posner argue that the long-run rise in adult obesity can be traced to technological changes that havemade work much more sedentary. 61Rather than being paid to undertake physical activ- ity, modern Americans must pay, either ex-plicitly in gym fees and equipment costs or implicitly in forgone leisure, to be physically active. Although attractive as a theory of his-torical trends and of differences between de-veloping and developed countries, the argu- ment provides little insight into the increase in childhood overweight and obesity over thepast thirty years. Nonetheless, the basic in-sight that technological changes have madedaily living less physically active can be ap - plied to children. To do that, it is necessary to examine changes in the neighborhoods inwhich children are growing up. Urban sprawl increases automobile travel. 62 Thus as sprawl has expanded, vehicle miles per person have increased. Daily vehiclemiles traveled per household were fairly con - stant between 1977 and 1983, at about 33 and 32, respectively , and then jumped up to 41 in 1990. 63Changes in methodology make it impossible to compare the data for thesetwo periods with data for years after 1990,but the 1990 data can be adjusted to allowsuch comparisons. The adjusted data showabout 50 vehicle miles traveled per house - hold for 1990. The increase continued during the early 1990s, before slowing in the latterhalf of the decade. The 1995 measure is 57miles; that for 2001, just 58. An increase inhousehold vehicle miles traveled does notnecessarily mean that children are spendingmore time in the car. But total miles traveledby those under age sixteen follows a patternPatricia M. Anderson and Kristin F . Butcher 32 THE FUTURE OF CHILDREN158.1 in 1997, while the food-away-from- home index rose to 157, making it unlikely that price was a primary cause of this shift in eating patterns. In general, it has been arguedthat energy-dense foods tend to be less costly than such foods as whole grains, fruits, and vegetables. 59But based on scanner data, Jane Reed, Elizabeth Frazao, and Rachel Itskowitz conclude that it is possible to meet the daily recommendations of three servings of fruits and vegetables for just 64 cents.60They also note that although consumers may perceivefresh produce as more expensive thanprocessed versions (such as canned, frozen,dried, or juiced), converted from a per-poundprice to a per-serving price, 63 percent offruits and 57 percent of vegetables werecheapest when purchased fresh. These prices,however, do not take into account the implicittime costs associated with preparing freshfoods. We will consider this idea below whenwe discuss the changing role of parents. Changes in the Built Environment We noted earlier the strong theoretical rela- tionship between physical activity and over - weight. Although the empirical studies estab- lishing this link are comparatively weak,Thus the increase in childhood overweight may be driven not just byincreased consumption ofparticular foods, such assodas, but also by the changein the food market toward larger portion sizes.02 5562 anderson-butcher.qxp 1/22/2006 12:53 PM Page 32fairly similar to that of people of all ages, with the main difference being that the mileage is fairly steady between 1983 and 1990, climb- ing slowly for all ages. Both groups then showlarge increases between 1990 and 1995 and are fairly stable in 2001. Vehicle miles have risen in part because chil- dren are no longer able to walk or bike to school or other activities. In 1977, 15.8 per-cent of trips by children aged five to fifteen were by foot or bicycle. By 1990 the share had fallen to 14.1 percent; by 1995, to 9.9percent. 64A nationally representative survey in 2002 found that 53 percent of parents drove their children to school, with another 38 percent putting their children on a schoolbus. Just 17 percent of parents said their chil-dren walked to school, while 5 percent saidtheir children rode their bikes. 65Of parents with children who did not walk or bike toschool, the overwhelming majority, 66 per-cent, said the reason was that school is too faraway. Almost equally common responses, at17, 16, and 15 percent, respectively , were, \"too much traffic and no safe walking route,\" \"fear of child being abducted,\" and \"not walk.\" and \"your children do notwant to walk\" both tallied a 6 percent re - sponse. Interestingly, 1 percent said thatthere was a \"school policy against childrenwalking to school.\" The 22 percent of children walking or riding bikes to school in 2002 represents a major de - cline from the share walking or biking when their parents were children, presumably abouttwenty to thirty years earlier . Just a little more than 70 percent of the parents reported walk- ing or biking to school as children. Again, theincreasing trend toward urban sprawl is pre - sumably at least part of the explanation, with school being too far away. In fact, a study ofSouth Carolina schools found that children today were much less likely to walk to a school that had been built more recently. More than 20 percent of students in schools built duringthe 1960s walked to school. For schools built in the 1970s the share dropped below 15 per- cent, while for those built in the 1980s and1990s it fell below 5 percent. 66Distance is not the only obstacle, however. In the South Car- olina study, children living within 1.5 miles ofthe school were eligible for bus transportation if the walking route was deemed hazardous. For schools built in the 1990s, more than 25percent of students received such transporta-tion while just a little more than 5 percent did for schools built in the 1960s. The share in- creased consistently by the decade the schoolwas built. Overall, then, trends in the built environment have resulted in more car trips and in fewertrips by foot or by bicycle. Most notably, lessthan a quarter of children walk or bike toschool today compared to more than two-thirds a generation ago. T oday' s lower -density development results in schools being further away from children's homes, and recentgrowth patterns do not provide safe walkingroutes. In addition to depriving children of anopportunity for physical activity , the change may have other effects on overall physical ac-tivity. Ashley Cooper and her colleagues findthat at least for British boys, walking to schoolwas correlated with higher levels of activity inother parts of the day. 67Of course, this rela- tionship may not be causal; it may simply re - flect that boys who are naturally more active prefer to walk to school or that walking toschool indicates that other opportunities for physical activity are also close by. Changes in School and Child Care Not only have children's methods of getting to school changed, but the environment onceChildhood Obesity: T rends and Potential Causes VOL. 16 / NO. 1 / SPRING 2006 3302 5562 anderson-butcher.qxp 1/22/2006 12:53 PM Page 33they get there has evolved as well. In particu- lar, the types of foods and beverages availableat school have changed, as have physical edu-cation requirements. As noted, soft drink con-sumption has risen markedly over the past several decades, with some of the increase due to increased availability at school. Be-tween 1977-78 and 1994-98, the share of overall soft drink consumption that took place in school cafeterias increased 3 percent. 68 Much of the food available at schools is sold not in the cafeteria, however, but in vending machines. Over that same period, the share ofsoft drink consumption from vending ma-chines increased 48 percent. And between 1994 and 2000, student access to vending ma- chines increased from 61 to 67 percent inmiddle schools and from 88 to 96 percent inhigh schools. 69Schools have found it quite lu- crative to enter into exclusive \"pouring rights\"contracts with soft drink companies. In 2000,73 percent of high schools had such a con-tract, as did 58 percent of middle schools, andeven 42 percent of elementary schools. 70 Many schools also allow these companies to advertise on school grounds\u201446 percent ofhigh schools, 29 percent of middle schools,and 13 percent of elementary schools. School vending machines dispense not only soft drinks, but also snacks, while schoolstores and snack bars also sell soft drinks andsnacks. In fact, among elementary schoolswith such student access, more than 50 per-cent sell cookies, crackers, cakes, pastries,and salty snacks. The share grows to morethan 60 percent for middle schools and morethan 80 percent for high schools. 71School cafeterias also sell these products \u00e0 la carte,in competition with the National SchoolLunch Program. Sales of such competingfoods are often an important part of theschool budget, as most school food serviceprograms must be self-supporting. ThesePatricia M. Anderson and Kristin F . Butcher 34 THE FUTURE OF CHILDRENsales often do more than subsidize the food service program, however. Increasingly,schools are using money raised through com-petitive food sales to supplement generalbudgets. One change in budgetary pressure on schools is the increased focus on academic accountability, which has also squeezed outother areas of study, such as nutrition and physical education, and even reduced the time available for lunch. 72 Some observers have speculated that these changes in the school environment may havecontributed to the increase in childhoodoverweight and obesity, though relatively few serious studies have been undertaken. 73In a recent working paper we found that school fi - nancial pressures are linked to the availability of junk food in middle and high schools. Weestimated that a 10 percentage point increasein the availability of junk food increases aver-age BMI by 1 percent. For adolescents withan overweight parent the effect is double. 74 Effects of this size can explain about a quar- ter of the increase in average BMI of adoles - cents over the 1990s. Diane Schanzenbach focuses not on the competing foods inschools but on the National School LunchProgram. 75She finds that for children who enter kindergarten with similar obesity rates,those who eat the school lunch are about 2percentage points more likely to be over-weight at the end of first grade. Changes inthe school lunch program, however, couldnot clearly explain the increase in obesityover time, although between 1991-92 and1998-99 the number of calories in an ele-mentary school lunch increased a little, from715 to 738. For secondary school lunches, onthe other hand, calories have declined overthis same period, from 820 to 798. 76 As noted, it appears that physical activity has been squeezed out of schools to make room02 5562 anderson-butcher.qxp 1/22/2006 12:53 PM Page 34for more academics. The National Associa - tion of Early Childhood Specialists in State Departments of Education recently stressedthe importance of recess and free play , ob- serving that 40 percent of elementary schools have reduced, deleted, or are consideringdeleting recess since 1989, when 90 percentof schools had some form of recess. 77Trends in physical education (PE) in high school area bit less clear , with enrollment moving up and down during the 1990s. The trend for daily PE attendance is downward, though,with about 42 percent of schools reporting itin 1991 and just 29 percent by 2003. 78More generally, Karen MacPherson notes thatsince the late 1970s, children have seen a 25percent drop in play and a 50 percent drop inunstructured outdoor activities. 79One poten- tial culprit is an increase in homework be-tween 1981 and 1997, especially for theyoungest students. Sandra Hofferth and JohnSandberg report that while time spent study-ing was up 20 percent overall, for childrenaged six to eight it rose 146 percent. 80 Another source of a drop in unstructured play is the increase in the number of childrenin child care centers after school. Figure 6 il-lustrates the basic trends in maternal em - ployment for preschool-age and school-age children, again superimposing children's obe-sity rates over the four periods for whichNHANES data are available. Note that thequality of child care used varies, so it is un-clear whether being in child care per se af - fects children's obesity. Nonetheless, clearly the potential for less physical activity , more sedentary activities, more sweet drinks, and more energy-dense snacks exists when chil-dren move from parental care to a child caresetting. It is worth noting, however, that theincrease in labor force participation (LFP)appears fairly continuous from 1970 throughabout 1988 before flattening out in the1990s, with no sudden increase between1980 and 1988. Although the exact timing ofthe change is not entirely consistent with thetiming of the increase in obesity , it remains worthwhile to investigate the changing role of parents more fully. Changes in the Role of Parents One major change over the past thirty years is the number of children with both parents(or their single parent) in the labor force.This change in the home environment mayChildhood Obesity: T rends and Potential Causes VOL. 16 / NO. 1 / SPRING 2006 35Figure 6.

That is, the food market may havechanged because of consumer demand stem- ming from the increase in households with no full-time homemaker. Note, though, thatstudies of the effect of maternal employment on the quality of children's diets tend to find no relationship. 81Nevertheless, a more re- cent study that directly examines how mater- nal employment affects childhood obesity concludes that a ten-hour increase in averagehours worked each week over a child's life-time increases the probability that the child is obese by about 1 percentage point. 82The study finds that it is not the work per se thataffects children's overweight and obesity, butrather the intensity of the mothers' work.This difference may explain why previousstudies found no real effect of work on chil-dren's diets and is in line with the idea thatmore time at work takes away from timespent preparing nutritious meals. With less intensive work hours, mothers may also spend more time supervising active play. Similarly , having two parents working full time may also discourage walking or biking to school, as it may fit parents' schedules betterto drop the children off at school on the wayto work. To the extent that maternal employ-ment affects children' s physical activity , rather than nutrition, both sets of studies may be reconciled. Increasing maternal employment may also affect the incidence or length of breast-feeding. The labor force participation rate ofmarried women with children under age one,about 31 percent in 1975, increased to 54 and55 percent by 1990 and 2003, respectively . 83 Nevertheless, the share of children ever breast-fed has been increasing, as has thefraction breast-fed at older ages. Based on NHANES data, about 25 percent of children aged two to six in 1971-74 were ever breast- fed, compared to 26 percent in 1976-80. By1988-94 almost 54 percent were ever breast- fed, increasing again by 1999-2002 to 62 per- cent. Over this same period the share breast-fed for at least three months rose from 55 percent to 74 percent, and the share breast- fed for at least one year rose from 7 percentto almost 25 percent. The National Survey of Family Growth does not show quite as con- sistent a pattern. It finds that the share of ba-bies who were breast-fed rose from about 30percent in 1972-74 to 58 percent in 1993-94. At the same time, the share breast-fed for three months or longer fell from 62 percentto 56 percent, after having risen to 68 per-cent in 1981-83. 84Overall, though, these trends do not appear to make breast-feedinga good candidate for explaining the increasein childhood overweight. Another area where parental roles may be important in explaining childhood obesity istelevision. For example, school-age childrenof working parents may now increasinglyspend their afternoon hours unsupervised,which may increase their screen time. Moregenerally , parents make decisions about the number and placement of televisions in ahome. In 1970, 35 percent of homes hadmore than one television, 6 percent had threeor more, and just 6 percent of sixth gradershad one in their bedroom. By 1999 fully 88percent of homes had more than one, 60 per - cent had three or more, and a whopping 77 percent of sixth graders had a television intheir bedroom. 85Nonetheless, the Hofferth and Sandberg study finds that for childrenaged three to twelve, weekly television view-ing dropped four hours between 1981 and1997. 86Reliable and representative data on people's television viewing are relatively diffi-Patricia M. Anderson and Kristin F . Butcher 36 THE FUTURE OF CHILDREN02 5562 anderson-butcher.qxp 1/22/2006 12:53 PM Page 36cult to come by because of the need for de- tailed diary keeping. But Nielsen Media Re - search is well known for its measurements of television audiences, which are used to setadvertising rates. Based on Nielsen data, overall daily minutes of television watching have climbed in recentdecades. 87Figure 7 shows the average daily minutes per person from 1970 to 1999, againsuperimposing children's obesity rates overthe four periods for which NHANES data areavailable. The overall daily increase of almostan hour and a half is relatively concentratedin the early 1980s (perhaps because of in - creasing cable penetration), the same time when the increase in obesity began inearnest. And viewing appears to be continu - ing to increase, as is obesity. These data, how- ever, are for all television viewers, not chil-dren specifically . In its annual reports, Nielsen presents weekly viewing for separate age groups. Although these subgroup num-bers are fairly noisy and not consistently de - fined across all years, children's viewing ap- pears to be between 70 and 90 percent ofoverall viewing, but it also seems to have de- clined over time. For example, in 1982 over - all weekly viewing was 28.4 hours, while for children aged six to eleven it was 24 hours.For teens it was about 21 hours for femalesand 24 hours for males. In 1999 overallweekly viewing was still just over 28 hours,but viewing time of both younger childrenand teens had fallen to 19.7 hours. 88 Children may be substituting other forms of media, including videos, video games, andthe Internet, for television watching. Accord-ing to a 1999 study, children spent 19.3 hoursa week watching television, another 2.3 hoursplaying video games, and 2.5 hours in front ofthe computer, implying just over one day(24.1 hours) of \"screen time\" a week. 89Note that the television hours in this report aresimilar to the Nielsen numbers for that year.It may be reasonable to consider the overallNielsen trend to be an approximation of chil-dren's screen time, with the decrease in chil-dren' s television viewing relative to adults' re- sulting from the fact that children sometimes choose video games or play on the computerChildhood Obesity: T rends and Potential Causes VOL. 16 / NO. 1 / SPRING 2006 37Figure 7.

Although pre- cise evidence on children's total screen timeis not easily obtainable, the available datagenerally support the possibility that changesin screen time may be an important contribu- tor to the increase in childhood obesity. Perhaps one of the biggest influences of par- ents on children's overweight and obesity is genetic. As noted, genetics alone cannot ex-plain the increases in obesity in recent decades. But parents may pass along to their children a susceptibility to overweight in thepresence of energy imbalance. Changes inthe environment that affect energy intake or expenditure could then trigger weight gain in this susceptible population. Differentiatingclearly between the extent to which nature ornurture is responsible for the strong correla-tion between parent and child BMI can bedifficult, though. It is known, for example,that parents influence children's food selec-tion. 90Genetics and behavior can thus inter - act as both parents and children gain weight in households where more energy-densefoods are available. Similarly , children's phys- ical activity can be affected by how active their parents are. Again, genes and behaviorwill interact as households engage in moresedentary behaviors, with both parents andchildren gaining weight. Conclusion The increase in childhood obesity seems to have begun between 1980 and 1988 and thencontinued during the 1990s.This period alsosaw children's environments change in multi-ple ways that research suggests might be con-tributing to the obesity epidemic.Over the critical time period, calorie-dense convenience foods and soft drinks were both increasingly available to children at school and increasingly advertised to children. Chil-dren consumed more soda pop. They also consumed more pre-prepared food and con- sumed more food away from home, as in-creases in dual-career or single-parent work- ing families may have driven up demand for convenience. A host of environmentalchanges also contributed to reducing chil- dren's activity levels over the period in ques- tion. In particular, children traveled more incars and were less likely to walk to schoolthan they were in the early 1970s. Changes in the built environment and in their parents' work lives also made it more difficult for chil - dren to engage in safe, unsupervised (or lightly supervised) physical activity. Finally,children spent more time in such sedentaryactivities as watching television, playing videogames, and using computers. Taken together, research on obesity singles out no one critical cause of the increase inchildren' s obesity. Rather, many complemen- tary developments seem to have upset the crucial energy balance by simultaneously in - creasing children's energy intake and de- creasing their energy expenditure. The chal - lenge in formulating policies to addresschildren's obesity is not necessarily to deter-mine what changed to create the current epi - demic, but rather, what is the most effective way to change children's environment and re-store their energy balance going forward.Patricia M.

In the medical literature the nomenclature used to describe children's and adults' weight is somewhat dif- ferent. Adults with BMI above the cutoffs described above \"overweight\" or Childrenwith BMIs above the 85th percentile with BMIs above the 95th percentile are termed \"overweight.\" To avoid confusion in comparisons between adults and children,we will term the former group of children \"overweight\" and the latter group \"obese.\" 5. These percentile cutoffs are available at www.cdc.gov/nchs/about/major/nhanes/growthcharts/ clinical_charts.htm#Clin%201 (September 26, 2005). 6.For more information on the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys, see the Centers for Dis- ease Control website at www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes.htm (September 26, 2005). 7. These authors' calculations are based on the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys. The data include children aged two to nineteen and adults aged twenty to seventy . We exclude individuals with a BMI above 50, which drops a small number (fewer than 100) of individuals in each year. The data areweighted using the examination weight since we use the height and weight that are collected in the med-ical examination module to define BMI. 8. Obesity rates based on BMI cutoffs may understate obesity among adult women. The cutoff to define obese for both adult women and adult men is 30, but men likely have more lean muscle mass for a given BMI. 9. Robert C.

However , it is impossible to consistently define Hispanic across the different NHANES surveys. \"Low income\" roughly corresponds to children in families in the lowest quartile of family income. However , each NHANES survey reports family income in categories, and the categories do not always correspond to thelevel of family income that defines the lowest quartile.

Daniels Summary Researchers are only gradually becoming aware of the gravity of the risk that overweight and obesity pose for children's health. In this article Stephen Daniels documents the heavy toll that the obesity epidemic is taking on the health of the nation' s children. He discusses both the im - mediate risks associated with childhood obesity and the longer-term risk that obese children and adolescents will become obese adults and suffer other health problems as a result. Daniels notes that many obesity-related health conditions once thought applicable only to adults are now being seen in children and with increasing frequency. Examples include highblood pressure, early symptoms of hardening of the arteries, type 2 diabetes, nonalcoholic fattyliver disease, polycystic ovary disorder, and disordered breathing during sleep. He systematically surveys the body' s systems, showing how obesity in adulthood can damage each and how childhood obesity exacerbates the damage. He explains that obesity can harm the cardiovascular system and that being overweight during childhood can accelerate the develop - ment of heart disease. The processes that lead to a heart attack or stroke start in childhood and often take decades to progress to the point of overt disease. Obesity in childhood, adolescence,and young adulthood may accelerate these processes. Daniels shows how much the same gen-eralization applies to other obesity-related disorders\u2014metabolic, digestive, respiratory, skele-tal, and psychosocial\u2014that are appearing in children either for the first time or with greaterseverity or prevalence. Daniels notes that the possibility has even been raised that the increasing prevalence and severity of childhood obesity may reverse the modern era's steady increase in life expectancy,with today's youth on average living less healthy and ultimately shorter lives than their par-ents\u2014the first such reversal in lifespan in modern history . Such a possibility , he concludes, makes obesity in children an issue of utmost public health concern. VOL. 16 / NO. 1 / SPRING 2006 47www.futureofchildren.org Stephen R. Daniels is a professor of pediatrics and environmental health at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine and Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center.03 5562 daniels.qxp 1/22/2006 12:53 PM Page 47Health professionals have long known that being over-weight carries many serioushealth risks for adults. Med-ical researchers have also investigated how obesity affects the health of children and adolescents, but work in thisarea has advanced more slowly. The epi- demic of overweight and obesity in children and adolescents, however, has intensified thepace of research. In the face of this new epi- demic, researchers are raising the question of whether children face the same set ofhealth risks as adults\u2014or whether their risksare unique. The answer, to a certain extent, is both. Many health conditions once thought applicable only to adults are nowbeing seen in children and with increasingfrequency. Even if the conditions do not ap-pear as symptoms until adulthood, they mayappear earlier than usual in a person's life-time if the person had weight problems inchildhood. Further , children are also more vulnerable to a unique set of obesity-related health problems because their bodies aregrowing and developing. In this article, I will discuss both the adverse outcomes associated with childhood obesityand the risk that obese children and adoles - cents will become obese adults and be ex-posed to other health problems. The obesity epidemic is taking a heavy toll on the nation's children. Some obesity-related conditions are having an immediateadverse effect on their health; others willhave more chronic long-term effects. Be-cause of overweight and obesity , today' s young people may, on average, live less healthy and ultimately shorter lives thantheir parents. The epidemic is an issue of ur - gent public health concern.Adverse Health Outcomes in Children As the prevalence and severity of childhood obesity increase, concern about adversehealth outcomes in childhood and adoles- cence is rising. Table 1 shows the prevalence in children and adolescents of various healthproblems associated with obesity. In what follows, I will provide details on how obesity affects various important body systems. Obe-sity can cause great damage to the cardiovas- cular system, for example, and being over- weight or obese during childhood canaccelerate the development of obesity-related cardiovascular disease. Likewise, obesity is linked with many disorders of the metabolic system. Such disorders, hereto - fore seen primarily in adulthood, are now ap- pearing in children. Even when the disor-ders do not present themselves in childhood,childhood obesity or overweight increasesthe risk of their developing in adulthood.Much the same generalization applies to theobesity-related disorders in the other bodilysystems. Cardiovascular Problems In the cardiovascular system, the heart pumps blood, which is carried back and forthbetween the heart and the body by bloodvessels. Arteries, which move blood from theheart to the rest of the body, are not just sim-ple tubes, but a dynamic series of conduitsthat control blood flow. They are vulnerableto many diseases that can ultimately lead, inthe case of coronary arteries, to a heart at - tack or, in the case of cerebral arteries, to a stroke. The heart muscle is also vulnerable toprocesses that thicken it and diminish itsfunction. The critical risk factors for heart at-tack or stroke\u2014diabetes, high blood pres-sure, high blood cholesterol, and cigarettesmoking\u2014are well known.Stephen R. Daniels 48 THE FUTURE OF CHILDREN03 5562 daniels.qxp 1/22/2006 12:53 PM Page 48Until recently, most medical concerns about children' s hearts involved birth defects. But as advances in noninvasive testing have made it possible to evaluate children's hearts andblood vessels, health professionals have dis - covered that some disease processes, such as hardening of the arteries, once thought to bepredominantly adult health concerns can in fact begin in childhood. One major risk factor for heart attack and stroke in adults is hypertension, or high bloodpressure. 1And obesity is an important contrib- utor to developing high blood pressure notThe Consequences of Childhood Overweight and Obesity VOL. 16 / NO. 1 / SPRING 2006 49Table 1.

Rosner and several colleagues have demonstrated that the odds of elevated blood pressure are significantly higher for childrenwhose body mass index (BMI) is at or above the 90th percentile than for those with BMI at or below the 10th percentile. The risk of ele-vated blood pressure ranges from 2.5 to 3.7 times higher for the overweight children, de- pending on their race and sex. 3 Recent national epidemiological studies have suggested that today' s children and adoles - cents have higher blood pressure than did their counterparts in past decades.4P . Munt- ner and several colleagues have also foundthat a portion of this increase in blood pres-sure is due to population trends for increasedoverweight. 5As children on average have be- come more overweight, their blood pressureon average has gone up. BMI during child - hood and, to an even greater extent, the in- crease in BMI from childhood to adulthoodhave been linked significantly with bloodpressure in adulthood. 6Overweight and obese children and those who become evenmore overweight in adulthood are morelikely than others to have high blood pressureas adults. Left ventricular hypertrophy, or increased thickness of the heart's main pumping cham-ber, is an independent risk factor for cardio- vascular disease in adults. Adults with high blood pressure and with a left ventricular mass index greater than 51 g/m have a four-fold increase in adverse cardiovascular out- comes. 7Left ventricular hypertrophy has been associated with obesity and high bloodpressure in adults. As with high blood pressure, left ventricular hypertrophy has also been linked with in- creased BMI in children and adolescents. 8 The most important aspect of body composi- tion that affects left ventricular mass is leanbody mass, probably because the heart's de- velopment matches the development of the body' s muscles to which it must supply blood. 9This appears to be a physiologic\u2014 that is, normal\u2014relationship. But fat massand systolic blood pressure also have a signif - icant relationship with left ventricular mass. 10 These more pathologic, or abnormal, rela- tionships could lead to the increased heartthickness that raises the risk of a heart attack.In addition, among children with essentialhypertension (the most common form of highblood pressure), increased BMI is linkedwith more severe left ventricular hypertro - phy. 11Left ventricular hypertrophy may thus be another important pathway by which obe - sity can increase the future risk of cardiovas-cular disease in children. Ultimately the most important process for developing cardiovascular disease is harden-ing of the arteries, or atherosclerosis, whichbegins as a fatty streak on the artery's innerlining and progresses into a fibrous plaque (araised lesion) that ultimately causes a heartattack or a stroke by blocking blood flow tothe heart or to the brain. The well-knownrisk factors for this progression in adults in - clude cigarette smoking, high blood pres- sure, elevated cholesterol, and diabetes.Stephen R. Daniels 50 THE FUTURE OF CHILDRENRecent national epidemio- logical studies have suggestedthat today's children andadolescents have higher bloodpressure than did their counterparts in past decades.03 5562 daniels.qxp 1/22/2006 12:53 PM Page 50Whether obesity directly influences the pro- gression of atherosclerosis in adults is not clear. Obesity's role in the earliest stages of athero- sclerosis during childhood has been even less clear, in part because researchers lack nonin-vasive tools to evaluate the early atheroscle- rotic lesions. Two pathology studies, however, have helped to clarify these relationships.The Pathobiologic Determinants of Athero- sclerosis in Youth (PDAY) and the Bogalusa studies used autopsy data on adolescents andyoung adults who died of accidental causes. 12 Pathologists working on these autopsies were able to observe directly the fatty streaks and fibrous plaques in these young people' s arter - ies and to evaluate whether the presence of these lesions was related to the known riskfactors for heart attack and stroke. In bothstudies, measures of adiposity (or fat) weresignificantly related to the presence of ather-osclerotic lesions. In the Bogalusa study , an increase in the number of risk factors, includ- ing overweight, high blood pressure, andhigh cholesterol, was associated with a dra - matically increased risk of atherosclerosis. 13 In another study L. T . Mahoney and several colleagues used electron beam computed to- mography (EBCT) to evaluate calcium' arteries of youngadults. 14Calcium deposits provide an impor- tant indication of the progression of the ath - erosclerotic process. Mahoney's team found coronary calcium in approximately 30 per-cent of healthy young adult males and ap - proximately 10 percent of young adult fe- males in a normal sample (that is, the sampledid not consist only of overweight young peo - ple). They also found that increased weight during childhood and a high body mass indexin young adulthood were linked with an in - creased risk of coronary artery calcium de- posits in young adults.All these studies provide important evidence that obesity is detrimental to the heart and blood vessels even in very young children. Doctors know that the processes that lead toa heart attack or stroke often take decades to progress to overt disease. It now appears, however, that these processes may be startingearlier than once thought and that becoming obese in childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood may accelerate them. The currentgeneration of children may thus suffer the adverse effects of cardiovascular disease at a younger age than did previous generations,despite the advent of new drugs to treat suchproblems as high blood pressure and abnor- mal blood cholesterol. Metabolic Disorders The metabolic system is a complex set of in- terrelated processes that control how thebody uses and stores energy. It includes thegastrointestinal tract, which governs absorp-tion of nutrients and energy; the liver , which is the body's major metabolic organ; and a va- riety of hormonal systems that govern theebb and flow of nutrients and energy . The system involves many overlapping compo- nents, each of which can, to some extent,compensate for an abnormality in another.But this compensation may often come at aprice of an increased risk for other adversehealth consequences. Many metabolic disorders\u2014among them in- sulin resistance, the metabolic syndrome, dys-lipidemia (abnormal levels of fat in theblood), and type 2 diabetes mellitus\u2014havebeen linked with obesity in adulthood. 15In fact, many were long considered diseases ofadulthood. Type 2 diabetes had even beencalled adult-onset diabetes. In the past fifteenyears, however , much has changed in this field as the prevalence and severity of over- weight have increased in children and adoles-The Consequences of Childhood Overweight and Obesity VOL. 16 / NO. 1 / SPRING 2006 5103 5562 daniels.qxp 1/22/2006 12:53 PM Page 51cents, with type 2 diabetes now appearing in children as young as eight years old. Insulin resistance, for example, or the process in which the action of insulin is retarded, is a rel-atively new concern in the pediatric age range. The precise mechanism for insulin re- sistance is unknown, but it often occurs in thecontext of obesity and results in increased in- sulin secretion by the pancreas and increased circulating levels of insulin. The increased in-sulin helps keep the blood sugar in the normal range but may cause other problems. J. Stein - berger and several colleagues have shown that obesity in children is associated with de-creased insulin sensitivity and increased cir - culating insulin and that these abnormalities persist into young adulthood. 16Increased cir - culating insulin may in turn raise blood pres-sure and cholesterol levels. The metabolic syndrome is a constellation of risk factors, including increased waist cir-cumference, elevated blood pressure, in - creased triglyceride and decreased HDL- cholesterol concentrations, and raised bloodsugar levels. 17The underlying risk factors for the metabolic syndrome are abdominal obe-sity and insulin resistance. The metabolicsyndrome is an important risk factor for car - diovascular disease and for the development of type 2 diabetes in adults. 18It may also beassociated with other abnormalities, includ- ing fatty liver disease, polycystic ovary dis-ease, and obstructive sleep apnea. Defining the metabolic syndrome has been controversial in adults, so its definition has been even more complicated in pediatricpopulations. S. Cook and several colleagues evaluated the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome in children and adolescents usingan adaptation of one adult definition. They found the metabolic syndrome in only 4 per- cent of all children but in 30 percent of chil-dren who are obese. 19R. Weiss and col- leagues reported that each half-unit increase in the BMI z score (equivalent to an increase of half a standard deviation in BMI) resultedin a roughly 50 percent increase in the risk ofthe metabolic syndrome among overweightchildren and adolescents. 20 The metabolic syndrome is likely associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular dis - ease and diabetes even in young people. The Bogalusa study noted above showed thatyoung victims of accidental death who had anumber of metabolic syndrome factors hadincreased atherosclerotic lesions. Such find - ings suggest that the risk associated with the metabolic syndrome begins early in life. 21 Obesity is associated with cholesterol abnor- malities, often referred to as atherogenic dys - lipidemia, that involve abnormal changes in cholesterol and triglycerides (or fats) in theblood. 22These abnormalities, which appear to accelerate atherosclerosis, also occur inobese children and adolescents. 23 The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus has increased dramatically in adolescents\u2014inparallel with the increasing incidence andseverity of obesity. 24Type 2 diabetes is re- lated to insulin resistance. Although the betaStephen R. Daniels 52 THE FUTURE OF CHILDRENThe metabolic syndrome is likely associated with an increased risk ofcardiovascular disease and diabetes even in young people.03 5562 daniels.qxp 1/22/2006 12:53 PM Page 52cells of the pancreas compensate for insulin resistance by making more insulin, they may not be able to keep up insulin production. When that happens, blood sugar starts to in-crease, first in response to meals and then ul- timately even in the fasting state. At that point diabetes is present. In Cincinnati theprevalence of type 2 diabetes in adolescents increased tenfold between 1982 and 1994. 25 In the Bogalusa study 2.4 percent of over- weight adolescents developed type 2 diabetes by age thirty while none of the lean adoles- cents did.26An American Diabetes Associa- tion review has suggested that as many as 45percent of newly diagnosed cases of diabetes in children and adolescents are now type 2 diabetes. 27 The increased prevalence of type 2 diabetes raises concern about cardiovascular diseaserisk. The National Cholesterol EducationProgram has identified diabetes as a coronaryartery disease risk equivalent, meaning thatpatients with diabetes face a similar risk for afuture adverse cardiovascular event as pa - tients who have already had a heart attack or a stroke caused by an arterial blockage. 28 That finding suggests doctors should aggres - sively manage cardiovascular risk factors, such as high blood pressure and cholesterolin adults with diabetes, to prevent future ill-nesses and deaths from cardiovascular dis-ease. If adolescents with type 2 diabetes havethis same advanced risk, they may be morelikely to have heart attacks, strokes, or heartfailure at a very young age, perhaps even intheir twenties and thirties. More research isneeded to determine the likelihood of thishappening and, if so, how best to prevent it. Pulmonary Complications The pulmonary system includes the lungs and associated blood vessels. The lungs takein air and exchange oxygen for carbon dioxidein the blood. The right side of the heart pumps blood through the pulmonary arteries to small capillaries in the lungs where this ex- change occurs. The oxygenated blood thenreturns to the left side of the heart through the pulmonary veins to be pumped by the left ventricle to the body. Air is brought to thelungs by the trachea, which is connected to smaller and smaller airway branches, ulti- mately ending in the bronchioles where gasexchange occurs. In asthma, one of the most common respira- tory diseases of childhood, the airways in thelungs are constricted, either because inflam- mation causes the airways' lining to swell or because tightening of the smooth musclesthat surround the airways can reduce theirdiameter. Asthma is generally thought to in-volve an allergic reaction, but much remainsto be learned about the specific genetic andenvironmental factors that trigger the reac-tion. The prevalence and severity of child - hood asthma have increased in the past two decades, again in parallel with the increas - ing prevalence and severity of childhood obesity. Cross-sectional studies have demonstrated a link between overweight and asthma in chil - dren, though the link may be complicated bysocioeconomic status, cigarette smoking, orother variables. 29M. A. Rodriguez and col - leagues found that children with a BMI above the 85th percentile had an increasedrisk of asthma independent of age, sex, eth - nicity, socioeconomic status, and exposure to tobacco smoke. Their study also found so-cioeconomic status and cigarette smoking tobe independent predictors of asthma. 30 It is not clear why obesity may increase the risk of asthma. On the one hand, obesity hasbeen associated with increased inflammation,The Consequences of Childhood Overweight and Obesity VOL. 16 / NO. 1 / SPRING 2006 5303 5562 daniels.qxp 1/22/2006 12:53 PM Page 53which could contribute to asthma. On the other hand, children with asthma may have only limited physical activity and may be treated with corticosteroids, which may pro-mote obesity development. Increased adi- pose mass could have a physical effect on lung function. And an excess of abdominal fatcan alter lung function both through increas- ing the weight on the wall of muscle and bone that surrounds the lungs and throughlimiting the motion of the diaphragm. Stud- ies in adults with asthma have shown that weight loss can improve pulmonary function,but such studies have not yet been done inchildren. 31 Obesity and obstructive sleep apnea are clearly related, both in adults and in children.Obstructive sleep apnea, or an abnormal col-lapse of the airway during sleep, results insnoring, irregular breathing, and disruptedsleep patterns. Sleep disruption can lead toexcessive daytime sleepiness, which may it - self decrease physical activity and heighten the risk of further obesity. Daytime sleepi-ness may also harm school performance. Ob - structive sleep apnea has also been associated with learning disabilities and memory de-fects. 32G. B. Mallory and colleagues found that one-third of young severely overweightpatients had symptoms associated with ob-structive sleep apnea and 5 percent had se- vere obstructive sleep apnea. 33 Obstructive sleep apnea can also have long- term adverse cardiovascular consequences. In the short term, episodes of low oxygen lev- els in the blood cause temporary increases inblood pressure in the pulmonary artery and decrease blood flow in areas in the heart. 34 Over the longer term, obstructive sleep apnea can lead to daytime elevated blood pressure, increased left ventricular mass, and diastolic dysfunction (or an inability of theheart to relax and fill with blood appropri-ately) of the left ventricle. 35Treating obstruc- function.36Sleep- disordered breathing may be one of the mostimportant but also most under-recognizedmedical complications in overweight childrenand adolescents. Gastrointestinal Disorders The gastrointestinal (GI) system includes the mouth, esophagus, stomach, small and largeintestines, and the anus. Often the liver isalso considered part of the GI system. Al-though it has always been obvious that the GIsystem is involved in obesity because of itsrole in food intake, it has not always beenclear that obesity can also affect the GI sys-tem. Recent research has verified that obe-sity can contribute to liver disease and gas - troesophageal reflux disease, which causes the stomach's contents to flow back into theesophagus. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (or fat depo- sition in the liver) and nonalcoholic steato - hepatitis (or an inflammation of the liver re- lated to fat deposits) are recognized ascomplications of obesity in adults. As obesitydevelops, fat can be deposited in the liver. Intheir early stages, the fat deposits are thoughtStephen R. Daniels 54 THE FUTURE OF CHILDRENSleep-disordered breathing may be one of the mostimportant but also mostunder-recognized medicalcomplications in overweight children and adolescents.03 daniels.qxp 1/22/2006 12:53 PM Page 54to be relatively innocuous, but the deposits lead to steatohepatitis, which can then progress to fibrosis, cirrhosis, and even to end-stage liver disease and liver failure, ulti-mately requiring a liver transplant. 37No one knows why obesity-related nonalcoholic fatty liver disease progresses more rapidly to itsmore severe form in some people than in others. Researchers now recognize that this same process of fat deposit and inflammation can afflict children and adolescents. The preva-lence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is dif-ficult to determine because it has no symp- toms and requires a liver biopsy for confirmation. Some studies have attemptedto estimate the prevalence, with one calculat-ing that as many as 50 percent of obese chil-dren may have fat deposits in their liverswhile some 3 percent of obese children havethe more advanced nonalcoholic steatohep-atitis. 38Another study has found that nonal - coholic fatty liver disease is the most com- mon form of liver disease in children andadolescents. 39Epidemiologic studies have shown that males and people of Hispanic eth-nicity are at the highest risk for nonalcoholicfatty liver disease. 40Most patients with non- alcoholic fatty liver disease also have insulinresistance. The degree of insulin resistance isassociated with the severity of liver disease. 41 In adults with diabetes, the prevalence of fat deposits in the liver is high; approximately 50percent have steatohepatitis and 19 percenthave cirrhosis. 42In weight loss im - proves obesity-related fatty liver disease.43 This and other potential treatments of nonal- coholic fatty liver disease have not been ex - tensively studied in young patients. Gastroesophageal reflux is a relatively com - mon problem in adults that can cause acute symptoms of heartburn, long-term damage ofThe Consequences of Childhood Overweight and Obesity VOL. 16 / NO. 1 / SPRING 2006 55the esophageal lining, and ultimately esophageal cancer. Several studies in adultshave linked obesity with increased symptomsof gastroesophageal reflux. In a study of morethan 10,000 adults aged twenty to fifty-nine in the United Kingdom, L. Murray and col- leagues found that being above normalweight increased the likelihood of heartburn and acid regurgitation. Obese adults were almost three times as likely to have suchsymptoms as normal-weight individuals. 44M. Nilsson and colleagues found a similar associ- ation, which was stronger among women, es-pecially premenopausal women. 45V . Di Francesco and colleagues reported that a ver- tical banded gastroplasty, an operation to de- crease the stomach' s size to produce weight loss, successfully reduced weight but not gas- troesophageal acid reflux.46The disorder has not been studied extensively in obese chil - dren and adolescents, so researchers do not know whether it is linked with overweight inyoung people. Skeletal Abnormalities The skeletal system includes the bones and joints. In obesity, skeletal abnormalities,often referred to as orthopedic problems, canaffect the lower extremities. Hip problemsand abnormal growth of the tibia, or the mainbone of the lower leg below the knee, aremost common. Some complications of obesity are physical\u2014 the effect of excess body weight\u2014rather thanmetabolic, or the effect of increased adiposetissue. One such complication in adults is os-teoarthritis, where excess weight results inwear and erosion of weight-bearing joints.Orthopedic problems also afflict obese chil-dren. Tibia vara, or disease, is a me-chanical deficiency in the medial tibialgrowth plate in adolescents that results inbowing of the tibia, a bowed appearance of03 5562 daniels.qxp 1/22/2006 12:53 PM Page 55the lower leg, and an abnormal gait. Adoles- cent tibia vara is not common but most often affects boys older than age nine who are overweight.47 Another orthopedic problem related to over- weight in young patients is slipped capitalfemoral epiphysis, a disorder of the hip's growth plate that occurs around the age of skeletal maturity. In this disorder the femur(the bone in the upper leg and hip) is rotated externally from under the growth plate, caus - ing pain, making it impossible to walk, and requiring surgical repair . The pathophysiol - ogy is not completely known, but it seems to involve both mechanical and biological fac-tors. The increased stress, which is mechani - cal, often results from excess weight. The bone' s covering at this age, usually during the growth spurt, is thin and unable to resist theshearing forces. The abnormality is morecommon in overweight males and in AfricanAmericans. In about one-third to one-quarterof afflicted children, both legs are affected.Avoiding abnormal weight gain can prevent such orthopedic problems. 48 Psychosocial Issues Psychosocial issues involve psychological health and the ability to relate to familymembers and peers. Such issues may havemany determinants, some of which are ge-netic and some, socioeconomic. Childhoodobesity is also linked with various psychoso- cial problems, the best studied of which is depression. Depression is a common mental health prob- lem in adolescents. 49Adolescent-onset de- pression is often persistent and may be re-lated to longer-term adverse mental health and health outcomes. 50Although risk factors for depression in adolescents are not wellknown, one that has been studied, particu- larly in girls, is body dissatisfaction. In a long- term study, E. Stice and several colleaguesfound that body dissatisfaction, dietary re-straint, and symptoms of bulimia are linked to depression. 51Weight issues often cause body dissatisfaction, but they may affect girlsof various ethnic groups differently. J. Siegel,for example, found that African Americangirls have a more positive body image thanwhite, Hispanic, and Asian girls and thatweight affects body image and satisfactionless in African American girls than in oth - ers. 52The sample size in this study was small, however , so it is not conclusive. Other studies have documented that obese adolescents seeking treatment for their obe - sity have more depressive symptoms than community-based obese or non-obese con - trol groups.53In general, researchers have been unable to determine whether differ-ences in depressive symptoms are based onthe severity of obesity. Published studies havebeen based on relatively small samples, rais-ing questions about the conclusions' validity . Nevertheless in a study by S. Erermis and several colleagues, more than half of theirsample of obese adolescents had a clinicallyimportant diagnosis, often involving majordepressive disorder. 54 To discern the direction of the relationship between obesity and depression is difficult.Stephen R. Daniels 56 THE FUTURE OF CHILDRENAlthough risk factors for depression in adolescents arenot well known, one that hasbeen studied, particularly in girls, is body dissatisfaction.03 5562 daniels.qxp 1/22/2006 12:53 PM Page 56Depression itself is often associated with ab- normal patterns of eating and physical activ-ity that could result in future obesity; how-ever, obesity may also result in psychosocialproblems that can produce depression. Evi- dence supports both hypotheses. On the one hand, youths with depression are at greaterrisk to develop an increased body mass index. 55E. Goodman and R. C. Whitaker found that increased BMI was associatedwith increased depression at a one-year fol- low-up, with depression scores highest among adolescents who had the greatest in-crease in body mass index. 56On the other hand, in elementary school girls, higher BMI was linked with increasing symptoms of de- pression.57And overweight adolescents who had been teased by peers or family memberswere found to have increased suicidalthoughts and attempts. 58 It appears that obese children and adoles- cents have difficulties with peer relation - ships. Overweight children, for example, tend to have few friends.59Mapping child - hood social networks demonstrates that nor - mal-weight children have more social rela- tionships with a central network of children,while overweight children have more periph-eral and isolated relationships in the network.In a contrary finding, however, a study ofnine-year-old girls in the United Kingdomdid not demonstrate that overweight girlswere less popular and had fewer friends. 60 An important psychosocial issue for over - weight children and adolescents is quality of life. Research on this issue has not been ex-tensive, and existing studies have focused onoverall measures of quality of life rather thanobesity-specific measures. J. S. Schwimmerand colleagues found that obese children andadolescents reported significantly lowerhealth-related quality of life than their nor-mal-weight counterparts, and they were five times more likely to have impaired quality of life. 61In fact, the health-related quality of life for obese children and adolescents was simi-lar to that of children diagnosed with cancer. And obese children and adolescents with ob- structive sleep apnea reported even lowerquality of life than those without it did, per- haps because of their increased daytime sleepiness. Ongoing research seeks to con-firm the findings of Schwimmer's team and to refine the understanding of how, specifically, obesity affects children's quality of life. Other Adverse Health Effects Polycystic ovary syndrome consists of a con- stellation of abnormalities, including abnor - mal menses, such clinical manifestations of androgen excess as acne and excessive hairgrowth, elevated levels of circulatory andro - gens, and polycystic ovaries on ultrasound evaluation. 62Among women with polycystic ovary syndrome, a substantial share is over - weight or obese.63Although obesity is gener- ally not considered the cause of the syn - drome, it can exacerbate the associated metabolic derangements, including insulinresistance. The onset of polycystic ovary syn - drome is often around the time of menarche, but it can occur after puberty , particularly after excess weight gain. The syndrome is oneof the most common female hormonal disor-ders, with a reported prevalence of 5 to 10percent. 64 Women who suffer from polycystic ovary syn - drome are at risk for infertility. Perhaps even more important, they are at substantial riskfor type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular dis - ease, as are those with metabolic syndrome. 65 Obesity is present in at least 35 percent of cases of polycystic ovary syndrome, with theshare sometimes as high as 75 percent. 66 Weight loss or pharmacologic treatment im-The Consequences of Childhood Overweight and Obesity VOL. 16 / NO. 1 / SPRING 2006 5703 5562 daniels.qxp 1/22/2006 12:53 PM Page 57proves insulin resistance and often improves metabolic abnormalities.67 Another important complication of obesity is pseudotumor cerebri, a condition in which increased intracranial pressure often results in headache and sometimes in vomiting orblurred vision. 68Pseudotumor cerebri may have multiple causes, including obesity, though the precise relationship between obe-sity and increased intracranial pressure re- mains unknown. Pseudotumor cerebri may be difficult to treat and can call for aggressiveweight-loss therapy, including bariatric sur-gery. The problem is uncommon in children and adolescents but may be more common in adults. Economic Issues Of all the economic issues related to obesity , perhaps the most important is the cost of its associated health problems. In an analysis ofpeople younger than sixty-five, R. Sturm esti - mated that obese adults' medical expenses are 36 percent higher than those of their non-obese peers. 69In preparing their estimate of obesity's medical costs, A. M. Wolf and G. A.Colditz began with the relative risk of diseasefor obese and non-obese adults for such con-ditions as type 2 diabetes, coronary heart dis - ease, hypertension, and some types ofcancer. 70Based on estimates of disease costs, they projected spending on obesity to beabout 6 percent of national health spending in1995. Because their estimate is somewhatdated and because they used cost estimatesfrom the 1980s, it likely underestimates cur-rent obesity-related health spending. Using a nationally representative data set and complex statistical analysis to evaluate U.S.medical spending on overweight or obesity in1998, E. A. Finkelstein and colleagues foundthat spending on obesity accounted for 5.3percent of national health spending. 71Spend- ing on overweight and obesity together ac-counted for 9.1 percent of total annual U.S.medical spending, a total rivaling even theestimated medical costs attributable to smok- ing. 72Also important, Medicaid and Medi- care cover approximately half of these in-creased costs, so that increases in obesity will place further demands on public health care spending. Evaluating the costs of overweight and obe- sity in childhood and adolescents is difficultbecause of a paucity of data. G. Wang and W.H. Dietz used hospital discharge diagnoses from 1997 through 1999 to estimate the cost of obesity-related disorders in childhood. 73 They used the most frequent principal diag- noses where obesity was listed as a secondarydiagnosis and then compared hospital diag - nosis figures with those in 1979-81 for chil- dren aged six to seventeen. Not surprisingly,they found increases in obesity-related diag - noses. Asthma associated with obesity in- creased from 6 to 8 percent; diabetes associ - ated with obesity , from 1.4 to 2.4 percent. They also found that time spent as an inpa- tient was longer for children with obesity andestimated that obesity-related inpatient costswere about 1.7 percent of total annual U.S.hospital costs. Better understanding of child-hood obesity's costs will help the health caresystem determine the best approach to pre - venting and treating childhood obesity. For example, A. M. Tershakovec and several col-leagues estimated that payers covered onlysome 11 percent of costs in a pediatricweight-management program. 74 Other obesity-related economic issues may begin in childhood and carry over into adult-hood. Overweight people are stigmatized inmany cultures, including the United States,where they are often characterized as lazy,Stephen R. Daniels 58 THE FUTURE OF CHILDREN03 5562 daniels.qxp 1/22/2006 12:53 PM of nega- tive stereotyping increases with age and ap-pears to affect girls more than it does boys. 76 The implications of negative stereotyping in childhood carry into the experience of obese individuals as they enter adulthood. Womenwho are obese as adolescents become adults with less education, lower earning power, a higher likelihood of poverty, and a lower like-lihood of marriage. 77(These issues are sub- stantially less pronounced for overweight ado- lescent males.) Obese individuals have moredifficulty gaining admission to college. 78 Obese adults may also experience discrimina- tion in renting apartments and houses.79 The indirect economic costs of adult obe- sity\u2014reductions in economic opportunity orproductivity\u2014have been estimated at $23billion a year in the United States. 80One study of Swedish adult women estimated that10 percent of all costs of sick leave and dis - ability are obesity related. 81The indirect costs of childhood obesity remain unknown.But if childhood obesity is causing an in - creased burden of disease, those costs may include time lost from work and day carecosts for parents as well as time lost fromschool for the child. Tracking Overweight and Obesity into Adulthood With overweight and obesity such serious health risks for adults, an important questionis whether overweight in children and adoles - cents predicts overweight in adulthood\u2014in other words, whether children retain theirrelative ranking related to their peers as theyage and become adults. That concept isknown as \"tracking.\" Many studies have shown that overweight children are more likely than their normal-weight peers to become overweight adults. S. S. Guo and several colleagues evaluated how well BMI during childhood predicted over- weight or obesity at age thirty-five in the FelsLongitudinal Study. 82They found that for chil- dren and adolescents with BMI above the 95th percentile at any age during childhood,the probability of being obese at age thirty-five years ranged from 15 to 99 percent. The prob- ability rises the older a child is when he or shebecomes obese. Obese children, in other words, are more likely to become obese adults the older they are obese as children. Robert C. Whitaker and several colleagues investigated the relationship between obesityat various times during childhood and obesityin young adults aged twenty-one to twenty-nine. 83Obesity in very young children (aged one to two) was not associated with adultobesity, but for obese children older than twoand for obese adolescents, the odds of be-coming an obese adult were higher . Those odds increased the higher their BMI was, and the older they were when they becameobese as children. Finally , having obese par - ents made it more likely that an obese child would continue to be obese into adulthood.The probability that an obese child agedthree to five would remain obese as a youngadult was 24 percent if neither parent wasThe Consequences of Childhood Overweight and Obesity VOL. 16 / NO. 1 / SPRING 2006 59The link between parental overweight and childhoodobesity is likely to be bothgenetic and environmental,and untangling the two is often difficult. 03 5562 daniels.qxp 1/22/2006 12:53 PM Page 59obese at the time, but it rose to 62 percent if one parent was obese. The link between parental overweight and childhood obesity is likely to be both genetic and environmental,and untangling the two is often difficult. Re- searchers do not know which genes cause obesity to develop in children, though it islikely that many genes act together. And par- ents clearly create important aspects of the child's environment, including which foodsare available and what opportunities the child has for physical activity or sedentary time. All of these factors may contribute to the track-ing that makes it more likely that an obesechild will become an obese adult. Illness and Death Related to Obesity in Adults Obesity in adulthood has long been associ- ated with both increased illness and a greaterchance of death. The Metropolitan Life In-surance Company's relative weight measurehas been used for more than seventy-fiveyears to assess mortality risks. 84The most common adverse effects of adulthood obesityare cardiovascular disease and diabetes.Endometrial, colon, kidney, and post-menopausal breast cancer have also been as - sociated with obesity. The Framingham Heart Study' s consistent finding of a link be- tween obesity and cardiovascular disease ledthe American Heart Association to recognizethe emergence of obesity as one of the mostimportant risk factors for heart disease andstroke in both men and women. 85In the Nurses' Health Study , the heaviest subjects had fatal and nonfatal heart attacks three times more frequently than did the lightestsubjects. 86In addition to overweight and obesity in general, studies of adults have fo-cused on the distribution of fat. For examplein the Honolulu Heart Study , the risk of de- veloping coronary artery disease was higher in men whose fat was concentrated aroundtheir abdomens, even after controlling for other risk factors. 87The Framingham Heart Study found the same relationship for women.88 In adults obesity has been linked with choles- terol abnormalities, in particular lower HDLcholesterol (note that HDL is the \"good\" cholesterol, and higher values are better), el- evation of triglycerides (fats), and high bloodpressure. 89In a review of population-based epidemiologic studies, B. N. Chiang and sev- eral colleagues reported increases in bothsystolic and diastolic blood pressure relatedto increasing weight. 90Although these rela- tionships between obesity and illness and death have long been well known in adults,relatively fewer data exist on the adversehealth consequences of obesity in childrenand adolescents. Understanding these rela - tionships in young people has become more urgent as the prevalence of overweight andobesity has increased in their age group. 91 The cumulative effects of obesity-related dis - eases may be to cut short the lifespan of those affected. The question of how manypeople die because of obesity has been con - troversial. In 2004, A. H. Mokdad, of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention(CDC), published a paper with several of hiscolleagues in the Journal of the American Medical Association that set the annual death toll at 400,000, an estimate that rivaled thetoll of cigarette smoking. 92Subsequent dis- cussion led Mokdad' s team to revise their es - timate downward to 365,000.93A still later publication in the same journal used more re-cent data sets and lowered the estimated an - nual obesity-related death toll much further, to 112,000. 94Part of the difficulty in estimat- ing the obesity death toll is calculating a pre - cise and valid estimate of obesity-related mortality. Each approach includes assump-Stephen R. Daniels 60 THE FUTURE OF CHILDREN03 5562 daniels.qxp 1/22/2006 12:53 PM Page 60tions that are subject to question. For exam- ple, the analyses differed both in how they defined the normal weight used in the com- parative calculations and in how they incor-porated age into the analysis. That the analy- sis including more recent data sets found a lower overall obesity-related mortality is ofinterest. It seems counterintuitive because of obesity's increasing prevalence in recent years. But all heart disease risk factors exceptdiabetes appear less likely to be present in overweight individuals in the more recent data, perhaps because of the medical profes-sion's improved ability to treat these risk fac-tors and heart disease. Unfortunately, the controversy over precisely what the death toll is has overshadowed the fact that both stud - ies find obesity to be a major health threat. The focus on the death rate has also divertedattention from the illness and disability re - lated to obesity. A recent article in the New England Journal of Medicine raised the alarming possibility that the increasing prevalence of severe obe - sity in children may reverse the modern era' s steady increase in life expectancy, with the youth of today on average living less healthyand ultimately shorter lives than their par- ents. 95That claim too has been the subject of criticism. In an accompanying editorial in the same journal, S. H. Preston urged caution inaccepting the claim, because many other fac- tors continue to increase life expectancy in this and coming generations of children. 96 Methodological issues have also arisen re- garding the calculations used to predict fu- ture longevity. Nevertheless, these data raisethe possibility that the current generation of children could suffer greater illness or expe- rience a shorter lifespan than that of theirparents\u2014the first such reversal in lifespan inmodern history. That possibility makes child- hood obesity an issue of utmost public health concern. With the increasing prevalence of overweight and obesity in children and adolescents andthe important tracking of overweight fromchildhood to adulthood, this generation ofchildren could well have an even higherprevalence of obesity and adverse health con-sequences in adulthood than do their par - ents. Preventing childhood obesity is thus of urgent importance.The Consequences of Childhood Overweight and Obesity VOL. 16 / NO. 1 / SPRING 2006 6103 5562 daniels.qxp 1/22/2006 12:53 PM Page 61Notes 1.

The op- eration of markets, says Cawley, has contributed to the recent increase in childhood overweightin three main ways. First, the real price of food fell. In particular, energy-dense foods, such asthose containing fats and sugars, became relatively cheaper than less energy-dense foods, such as fresh fruits and vegetables. Second, rising wages increased the \"opportunity costs\" of food preparation for college graduates, encouraging them to spend less time preparing meals. Third,technological changes created incentives to use prepackaged food rather than to prepare foods. Several economic rationales justify government intervention in markets to address these prob - lems. First, because free markets generally under-provide information, the government may in- tervene to provide consumers with nutrition information they need. Second, because societybears the soaring costs of obesity , the government may intervene to lower the costs to taxpay- ers. Third, because children are not what economists call \"rational consumers\"\u2014they cannot evaluate information critically and weigh the future consequences of their actions\u2014the govern - ment may step in to help them make better choices. The government can easily disseminate information to consumers directly , but formulating policies to address the other two rationales is more difficult. In the absence of ideal policies to combat obesity , the government must turn to \"second-best\" policies. For example, it could pro- tect children from advertisements for \"junk food.\" It could implement taxes and subsidies thatdiscourage the consumption of unhealthful foods or encourage physical activity. It could re-quire schools to remove vending machines for soda and candy . From the economic perspective, policymakers should evaluate these options on the basis of cost-effectiveness studies. Researchers, however , have as yet undertaken few such studies of obesity-related policy options. Such analyses, once available, will help policymakers achieve the greatest benefit from a fixed budget.

The health risks associ-ated with childhood obesity, includingasthma, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, car- diovascular disease, and depression, have led medical authorities to declare the rise inchildhood obesity a public health crisis. 2 The epidemic of childhood obesity has many causes\u2014cultural, economic, and genetic.3In this article, I focus on the causes and possiblepolicy solutions that work through markets. Iuse economics to weigh and assess theevidence. 4 How Markets May Have Contributed to the Rise inChildhood Overweight Several strands of research investigate how markets may contribute to increased calorieconsumption, sedentary lifestyles, or over-weight and how changes in those markets mayhave contributed to the recent rise in child-hood overweight. The problem for re-searchers is not figuring out what could havecaused the rise in childhood obesity; the prob-lem is that too many things could have causedit. James Hill and several colleagues calculatethat the rise in obesity in the United Statescould have been caused by a daily surplus ofjust 15 calories for the median person, with 90percent of the population increasing their in-take by 50 or fewer calories a day. 5To put thisin perspective, the rise in weight for the me- dian person could have been caused by con-suming an extra three tablespoons of skimmilk or walking 120 fewer yards each day. Itwill likely be impossible to determine which changes are responsible for such a small in- crease in daily calorie surplus, but I will con-sider several possible contributors. Changes in the Cost of Food and Food Preparation The most obvious contributor to the increas- ing calorie surplus is falling food prices. Be-tween January 1980 and January 2005, thereal price of food fell 13 percent. 6One study attributes 40 percent of the recent rise in weight to lower food prices.7 Changes in the \"opportunity cost\" of time spent cooking may also have affected eatingpatterns. Strictly speaking, the opportunitycost of a person's time is the value of that timedevoted to the next best available alternative,but in practice it is often measured by thewage rate. All else being equal, if someone' s wage rate rises, he or she will likely spend less time cooking and will instead use prepack-aged foods that require less preparation timeor will eat food prepared by others, such asrestaurant meals or \"takeout.\" It is also possi - ble that he or she would simply consume lessfood as a result of spending less time cooking. How much wages have changed over the past twenty-five to thirty years varies by the wageearners' educational attainment. Real wagesfor high school dropouts have fallen, thosefor high school graduates have remainedroughly constant, and those for college grad - uates have risen considerably. 8These wage dynamics imply that the time cost of cookingrose for college graduates and fell for highschool dropouts. To my knowledge, data ontime spent cooking have not been sorted byJohn Cawley 70 THE FUTURE OF CHILDREN04 5562 cawley.qxp 1/22/2006 12:53 PM Page 70education, but for the U.S. population as a whole, the number of minutes spent each day preparing meals fell from forty-four in 1965 to thirty-two in 1999.9 While changing wage rates affected the op- portunity cost of time spent cooking, techno-logical change may have reduced the time re- quired to prepare some foods. David Cutler, Edward Glaeser, and Jesse Shapiro arguethat innovations in food processing, preserva- tion, and packaging made it possible for food to be mass prepared far from the place ofconsumption and to be consumed with lesstime cost. These innovations contributed to a shift away from home-cooked meals toward processed food, thus increasing obesity . In support of their argument, the researchers show that consumption of mass-producedfoods increased the most, that people mostable to take advantage of these technologicalchanges had the greatest increases in weight,and that obesity is greatest in countrieswhere people have the greatest access toprocessed food. 10 Changes in the share of women who work also affected time spent cooking. Over thepast three decades, the labor force participa-tion rate of women with children youngerthan age eighteen rose from 47 to 72 percent,with the largest increase among mothers withchildren younger than age three. 11The in - creased work time may have resulted in the increased use of prepackaged foods or offood consumed away from home. One studycalculates that during the past three decadesthe increase in mothers' average weeklyhours at work explains 12 to 35 percent of theincrease in childhood obesity in families ofhigh socioeconomic status. 12 During this same period Congress reformed the nation's welfare system, in the processgiving poor single mothers an economic in- centive to spend less time cooking. Withsome exceptions, the 1996 welfare reformlaw required single mothers to work in thelabor force to receive cash welfare benefits. 13 Thus even though falling real wages lowered the opportunity cost of cooking for highschool dropouts, poor single mothers had good reason to spend more time in the labor force and less time in household production. To better establish the link among changing costs of time, time spent cooking, eating out,and childhood obesity , researchers must an- swer several questions. First, they must find out how different groups of people re - sponded to the changing costs of time. For example, do college graduates and welfare-eligible women spend less time cooking andhigh school dropouts spend more time cook-ing? Second, they must determine whetherchanges in cooking time led college gradu-ates and welfare-eligible women to use moreprepackaged foods or restaurant food and ledhigh school dropouts to use less. And, third,they must prove the link between the con-sumption of prepackaged and restaurantfoods and childhood obesity. Another possible contributor to obesity is the price of energy-dense foods, such as thosecontaining fats and sugars, relative to that ofMarkets and Childhood Obesity Policy VOL. 16 / NO. 1 / SPRING 2006 71For the U.S. population as a whole, the number ofminutes spent each daypreparing meals fell cawley.qxp 1/22/2006 12:53 PM Page 71less energy-dense foods, such as fresh fruits and vegetables. Adam Drewnowski and S. E. Specter calculate that, on a per-calorie basis, energy-dense foods are cheap whereas foodslow in energy density are much more expen- sive. 14However, a Department of Agricul- ture (USDA) study suggests that less energy-dense foods can still be quite cheap in absolute terms; it calculates that a person can satisfy the USDA's recommendation of threedaily servings of fruit and four servings ofvegetables for just 64 cents a day. The studyalso concludes that 63 percent of fruits and57 percent of vegetables were cheapest intheir fresh form. 15 Further research must determine whether the relative price of energy-dense foods hasfallen in the past several decades. A quickcomparison of the various consumer price in - dexes indicates that between January 1989 and January 2005, the real price of fruits andvegetables rose 74.6 percent while that of fatsand oils fell 26.5 percent and that of sugarsand sweets fell 33.1 percent. Thus energy-dense foods have become considerably cheaper, relative to less energy-dense foods,in the past fifteen years. 16 Changes in Where Americans Eat Their Meals Perhaps because of the increasing opportu- nity cost of time for college graduates or the movement of women into the labor force, Americans are eating more meals away fromhome today than they did thirty years ago. Between 1977 and 1995, the share of total calories consumed away from home rosefrom 18 to 34 percent, the share of mealsconsumed away from home rose from 16 to 29 percent, and the total share of food dollars spent away from home rose from 26 to 39percent. 17From 1994 through 1996, children consumed 32 percent of all their caloriesaway from home: 10 percent in fast-foodrestaurants, 9 percent in schools, 4 percent inrestaurants, and 9 percent from all othersources, such as vending machines and otherpeople's houses. 18 The move toward food away from home came just as this food itself (not the time costs ofpreparing it) was becoming more expensiverelative to food at home. Between January1980 and January 2005, the real price of foodat home fell 16.2 percent while the real priceof food away from home fell only 5.1 per-cent. 19Eating out became more common even as it was becoming relatively more expensive. The distinction between food at home and food away from home is important becauseconsumers typically have less informationabout the calorie content of foods they eataway from home. Relative to food at home,food away from home has on average lowerfiber and calcium density , similar sodium density, and higher cholesterol density. 20Nu- tritional trends both for food at home and forJohn Cawley 72 THE FUTURE OF CHILDRENBetween 1977 and 1995, the share of total caloriesconsumed away from homerose from 18 to 34 percent,the share of meals consumedaway from home rose from 16 to 29 percent, and thetotal share of food dollarsspent away from home rose from 26 to 39 percent.04 5562 cawley.qxp 1/22/2006 12:53 PM Page 72food away from home are promising: in both, the densities of fat, saturated fat, and choles-terol have declined, and the density of fiberhas increased slightly, though away-from-home foods have improved less than food at home. 21Further research must explore whether the move toward consuming morefood away from home and eating less at home has caused an increase in childhood obesity. Changes in Portion Sizes Portion sizes of certain foods have increased since the 1970s. One study of portion sizeslooks at package labels and manufacturers'information and concludes that the portion sizes of \"virtually all\" the packaged foods and beverages it examines have increased duringthe past three decades. 22Such a finding is important because several experiments havedocumented that when people are servedlarger portions, they consume more calo-ries. 23The portion size effect is first de- tectable in children five years old.24 The increase in portion sizes, combined with people' s tendency to eat more when served larger portions, implies that the amount of food consumed at one sitting has increased.Smiciklas-Wright and her colleagues use theContinuing Survey of Food Intakes by Indi - viduals to study the quantities consumed atone sitting and find significant increases forabout a third of the 107 foods they examine.The study does not specify whether theseitems were ones packed in larger portions bymanufacturers. They find significant decreasesin amounts consumed for six other foods. 25 One limit of the research on portion sizes and calorie intake is that the increases in portionsizes in experiments do not match theincreased portion sizes in the market. Forexample, some studies experimentally in-creased portions of macaroni and cheese, butthe Smiciklas-Wright team found that the portions of macaroni and cheese that people reported consuming fell 17 percent between 1989-91 and 1994-96. Whether people eat more when they are no- tified of the increase in portion size is un-clear. In the market, some food manufactur- ers take pains to emphasize the increased size of their products\u2014for example, the BigGulp, Monster Thickburger, and \"super- sized\" meals. Moreover, the increases in calo- rie consumption documented in these exper-iments (30 to 50 percent) are far larger thanthe small increase in daily calorie surplus that caused the rise in obesity. Because these ex- periments typically last no longer than a fewmeals or days, it is also unclear whether inthe longer run people adapt to the larger por-tion sizes and return to consuming their nor - mal amount. For example, suppose every day were Thanksgiving. You might eat large por-tions the first day , but you probably would not continue to eat \"Thanksgiving-sized\" meals every day . At some point you might re - turn to your previous level of caloric con - sumption. Longer-term research is needed to determine the long-run effect of portion size,as well as what the effect is when consumersare notified of the larger portions. Changes in Farm Policies Agriculture policy may contribute to obesity by promoting lower prices and greater pro-duction of certain commodities. From 1933 to1995, price supports kept the prices of wheat,corn, soybeans, oats, and other commoditiesabove their free-market prices in the UnitedStates; the government purchased excess sup - plies to bolster prices. The 1995 Farm Bill, however, reformed the system. Rather thansubsidizing farmers by keeping prices artifi - cially high, the government now gives farmers a production subsidy, or a payment based onMarkets and Childhood Obesity Policy VOL. 16 / NO. 1 / SPRING 2006 7304 5562 cawley.qxp 1/22/2006 12:53 PM Page 73their historic production. In other words, the new law completely decoupled subsidies to farmers from production, and consumers switched from paying above-market to below-market prices for agricultural commodities. 26 Trade policies still keep some commodities' prices high. A system of quotas and tariffs, for example, keeps the U.S. price of sugar above the world price.27Agriculture policy has lowered the prices of other sweeteners, however . In particular, farm policy has been criticized for subsidizing the production of corn and, thereby , of high-fructose corn syrup, which is now common in soft drinks, fruit juices, jelly, and other foods.28 The USDA estimates that production subsi- dies increased the land under cultivation by 4million acres and lowered the price of wheatby seven cents a bushel, of corn by nine centsa bushel, and of soybeans by forty-nine centsa bushel. 29A second study figures that direct payments to farmers boost agricultural out-put 4.39 percent. 30And a third calculates that policy changes in the 1995 Farm Bill andthereafter increased production of grains andsoybeans 4 percent and lowered prices 5 to 8percent. 31Of course, consumers do not buy and consume bushels of wheat and soybeansdirectly; instead, they eat food manufacturedfrom these crops. One study estimates thatfor every 1 percent decrease in commodityprices, food prices decline 0.25 percent. 32 Another study determines that agricultural subsidies explain about 1 percent of the in- crease in obesity over the past two decades.33 When price supports were still a mainstay of U.S. farm policy, Washington established\"checkoff\" programs to increase demand for covered commodities, thereby lessening the excess supply that it was obliged to purchase.The checkoff programs required producers to contribute a fixed amount per commodity unit sold to a nonprofit organization that usedthe money to increase consumer demand forthat commodity by researching new uses for it and advertising those uses to consumers. Commodity checkoff programs, which havepersisted even after price supports were re-moved, now spend $1 billion a year to in-crease demand for their products. 34 Substantial checkoff resources go for adver- tising, and they have a considerable impact.Checkoff-funded advertising campaigns in-clude \"Ahh, the Power of Cheese,\" White Meat,\" and \"Got Milk?\" Noel Blisard estimates that the generic advertising of milktotaled $29.8 million between October 1995and September 1996, raising milk sales by 1.4billion pounds, or 5.9 percent, while genericadvertising of cheese funded by checkoff pro-grams increased sales of cheese by 62.7 mil - lion pounds, or 2.8 percent. 35Although ad- vertising funded by checkoff dollars increasesconsumer demand, collecting checkoff fundsfrom producers is a form of tax, which raisesproducers' costs and lowers the quantitiessold. On net, however , the checkoff programs increase commodities' sales. 36 Whether checkoff-funded advertising encour - ages consumers to spend more money overall on food or simply redirects their fixed foodJohn Cawley 74 THE FUTURE OF CHILDRENA system of quotas and tariffs keeps the U.S. price of sugarabove the world price, whileagriculture policy has lowered the prices of other sweeteners.04 5562 cawley.qxp 1/22/2006 12:53 PM Page 74budget to the advertised products is unclear. Brenda Boetel and Donald Liu find that beef and pork advertising is \"beggar thy neighbor\" in the sense that beef advertising decreasesthe demand for pork and vice versa. They conclude that beef and pork producers would be better off if they agreed to reduce theirgeneric checkoff-funded advertising cam- paigns. 37Checkoff funds are also used to in- crease commodities' sales by developing newmenu items for fast-food restaurants, such as the McRib pork sandwich for McDonald's and Insider Pizza (which used one pound ofcheese per medium pizza) for Pizza Hut. 38 Although analysts have linked various farm policies to the increased sales of certain cropsand to the development of menu items forfast-food restaurants, documenting the effectthese programs have on obesity itself re - quires more research. Increased Food Advertising to Children The food industry spent $7 billion on adver- tising in 1997, more than any other industryexcept automobiles. T wo-thirds of that adver- tising was by food manufacturers, 28 percent by the food service industry (mostly fast-foodrestaurants), and 8 percent by food stores. 39 It is estimated that the number of television commercials viewed each year by the averageAmerican child doubled from about 20,000in 1970 to 40,000 around the year 2000. 40But although children are viewing more commer-cials, the length of the average commercialhas fallen. 41In addition, Roland Sturm finds that the average time children spent watch-ing TV fell 23 percent, or four hours a week,between 1981 and 1997. 42 One study, which analyzes the food advertise- ments aired during children' s Saturday morn- ing television programming, concludes that if a child consumed only the advertised food,his diet would not be consistent with U.S. di- etary recommendations.43Gerard Hastings and several colleagues conclude that over time advertisements for fruits and vegetableshave disappeared and have been replaced by ads for fast-food restaurants, breakfast cere- als, soft drinks, and snacks. 44 Two broad reviews of the experimental re- search on food advertising and youth dietsconclude that there is very mixed evidence on whether television advertising causally af- fects children's diets. 45 Because of several limitations of this research, including the use of small, nonrepresentative samples, making it difficult to draw inferencesabout larger populations from their findings,the American Academy of Pediatrics and theInstitute of Medicine have called for more re - search on whether food advertising affects the diets of American youth. 46 Differences in Local Availability of Food and Exercise Opportunities The prevalence of childhood obesity shows clear racial disparities. In 1998, 21.5 percentof African American children and 21.8 per - cent of Hispanic children but only 12.3 per- cent of white children were overweight. 47 Whether there are also economic disparities in the prevalence of childhood obesity withinrace and ethnic groups is less clear. R. P . Troi-ano and K. M. Flegal find no significant cor-relation between income and childhood obe - sity for African Americans or Hispanics. They find weak evidence that higher-income whiteadolescents are less likely to be obese, butthey warn this evidence must be interpretedcautiously because of small sample sizes. 48 Some researchers have argued that racial and socioeconomic disparities in weight may beMarkets and Childhood Obesity Policy VOL. 16 / NO. 1 / SPRING 2006 7504 5562 cawley.qxp 1/22/2006 12:53 PM Page 75due in part to differences in the availability of food and exercise opportunities. One study finds that supermarkets are three times more common in census tracts with home values inthe highest quintile than in tracts with homes in the lowest quintile and four times more common in predominantly white than in pre-dominantly black neighborhoods. 49Con- versely, smaller grocery stores and conven- ience stores without gas stations are morecommon in lower-wealth and predominantly black neighborhoods. Another study finds that the probability of at least one supermar-ket located in an urban zip code is higherwhere income is high and the poverty rate is low. But it finds no link between that proba- bility and the share of residents who hadgraduated from high school. 50 Some researchers argue that these disparities are related to obesity because the proximity ofsuch businesses is correlated with diet quality.Kimberly Morland, Steve W ing, and Ana Roux compare food consumption reported in questionnaires to food outlet availability inthe census tract of residence and find thatblacks living in census tracts with supermar-kets are more likely to meet U.S. DietaryGuidelines for fruits and vegetables, total fat,and saturated fat. Findings for whites weregenerally not statistically significant. 51 Joel W aldfogel finds that the population' s edu- cational and racial composition is correlated with restaurant density. Controlling for popu-lation size within a zip code (which may itselfbe correlated with both restaurant density andthe educational and racial composition in anarea), when the share of blacks and Hispanicsis higher, there are fewer sit-down restaurantsbut more of certain fast-food restaurants. 52 Analysts find similar patterns for active recre- ational facilities, such as public beaches,pools, youth centers, parks, YMCAs and YWCAs, dance studios, and athletic clubs. Penny Gordon-Larsen and several colleagues find that all major categories of such facilitiesare inequitably distributed across census block groups by socioeconomic status, minor- ity population, and education. They find thatthe presence of just one such facility per cen- sus block group is associated with a 5 percent lower probability of overweight. 53 These studies are observational, not based on randomized experiments, and thus include anunknown degree of what researchers term\"selection bias.\" Supermarkets and health clubs may open outlets in places where people are most interested in them\u2014where they canearn the highest profits\u2014and not in areas withlow demand. Likewise, when people choosewhere to live, they may consider the retail op - tions available nearby. People who cook meals from scratch may find it more attractive to livenear a full-service supermarket, and exercisebuffs may want to live near parks and gyms.Because of such self-selection, correlationsbetween diet and supermarket proximity andbetween physical activity and proximity to ath-letic facilities may arise even without a causalrelationship. For this reason, these researchfindings cannot be interpreted as causal or ev - idence of discrimination. A related research area claims that new sub - urbs and developments contribute to obesity because they lack sidewalks and places towhich people could walk or because they re - quire long commutes. 54But children's physi- cal activity appears uncorrelated with suchneighborhood characteristics as the availabil - ity of local facilities and safety. 55 Decreased Smoking Over the same period that the prevalence of obesity has been on the rise, the prevalenceJohn Cawley 76 THE FUTURE OF CHILDREN04 5562 cawley.qxp Page 76of adult smoking has fallen\u2014from 33.2 per- cent in 1980 to 21.6 percent in 2003.56The share of high school students who smoke has also declined, from 27.5 percent in 1991 to21.9 percent in 2003. 57The trends in smok- ing and obesity may be related. A surgeon general's report reviewed fifteen medicalstudies and found that between 58 percent and 87 percent of those who quit smoking gained, on average, four pounds. 58One study finds adults' weight is positively correlated with the local price of cigarettes (the higher the price, the higher the weight); the correla-tion with weight is roughly the same as that ofgrocery prices. The study finds no correlation of weight with clean indoor air laws that re- strict smoking. 59A second study , however , faults the first for not taking into account time trends in smoking and for focusing oncigarette prices instead of cigarette taxes;after making the necessary corrections, thatstudy finds that higher cigarette taxes are as-sociated with lower weight. 60 Economic Rationales for Market Intervention If the government is to intervene in a market to reduce obesity , it should have an economic rationale to do so. Several such rationales exist. First, in free markets producers gener - ally under-provide information. Govern-ments can easily disseminate this informationto help consumers make informed choices.The Nutrition Labeling and Education Act(NLEA) of 1990 requires producers to printnutrition labels on packaged foods, but nolaw requires the release of nutritional infor-mation for restaurant food or fountain drinks. The second economic rationale for govern- ment intervention is that the costs of obesityare borne broadly by society . A 2003 study es- timates that through Medicare and Medicaid, the government's medical care programs forthe elderly and the indigent, taxpayers pay half the total costs of treating obesity-related illnesses\u2014costs that in 1998 amounted to $92.6 billion (in 2002 dollars). 61The govern- ment may seek to reduce obesity to lower these costs to taxpayers. The third economic rationale for interven- tion, which applies specifically to childhood obesity, is that children are not what econo- mists call \"rational consumers.\" They cannot evaluate information critically and weigh thefuture consequences of their actions. Formuch the same reason that the governmentbans sales of cigarettes and alcohol to mi - nors\u2014to protect them from making poor de- cisions that adversely affect their health\u2014itmay likewise seek to regulate sales of certainfoods to youth. How to Choose among the Policy Options Given the three different economic ratio - nales for government intervention, what poli- cies are most appropriate? From an eco-nomic perspective, the primary goal is torepair the problem in the market. For exam-ple, the government can directly address thelack of information by requiring companiesto provide it. One simple way to improve thefood markets' efficiency is to expand theMarkets and Childhood Obesity Policy VOL. 16 / NO. 1 / SPRING 2006 77Over the same period that the prevalence of obesity has beenon the rise, the prevalence ofadult smoking has fallen\u2014from 33.2 percent in 1980 to 21.6 percent in 2003.04 5562 cawley.qxp 1/22/2006 12:53 PM Page 77NLEA to require that detailed nutritional in- formation accompany all foods and menus. Adult consumers, at least, appear to respond to such information. One study finds that amedia campaign urging people to shift from whole-fat to low-fat milk changed consumer purchases. 62Another study documents a con- sumer shift from high-fat toward low-fat salad dressing after product labels were re- quired to reveal fat content.63Another finds that the NLEA decreased weight gain for white females who read labels while shop- ping and estimates that the NLEA's benefitstotaled $101 billion a year. 64 It is not clear, however, how to present nutri- tion and calorie information so that con - sumers, especially children and adolescents, can use and understand it. Further researchis needed on how to make nutritional infor - mation comprehensible to children. When the government makes information available, it must be careful to put it in aproper context; failure to do so can lead tounfortunate unintended consequences. Forexample, in 2003, in an effort to inform par-ents, Arkansas passed a law requiring schoolsto weigh children and to notify parents oftheir child' s body mass index. Although the law provides parents with information theymay have lacked, it has had some unforeseennegative consequences. Some muscular chil - dren have been incorrectly classified as over- weight, and concerns have arisen about pri-vacy and self-esteem. 65Failing to put the information into its proper context also raisesa risk that parents may impose ineffective orharmful fad diets. Although the government can correct the problem of incomplete information in a rela - tively straightforward manner, it cannot so easily fix the other two problems\u2014societalcosts of obesity and irrational consumers. The typical economic response to societal costs is to tax whatever imposes the cost or to subsidize behaviors that could decrease thesocietal costs. In this context, that would imply taxing obesity and subsidizing weight loss for the obese, but taxing people based ontheir weight or changes in weight would be difficult to implement and is politically unat- tractive. Subsidizing consumers who loseweight or maintain a healthy body weight would be similarly difficult to implement. It is also hard to imagine how the government could implement a policy to enable children to become entirely rational consumers who take into account the future consequences oftheir actions. In the absence of an ideal policyto reduce societal costs and address children's\"irrational\" behavior , the question becomes whether other, \"second-best\" policies could both decrease obesity and do more good thanharm for society overall. Many possible second-best interventions exist. From the economic perspective, thecorrect way to choose among them is to ana-lyze their cost-effectiveness. The first step insuch analysis is to estimate all the costs andbenefits associated with each intervention;the second is to rank the interventions ac-cording to how cheaply they achieve the pol-icy goal, thus allowing policymakers to use afixed budget most efficiently\u2014to get, inother words, the most bang for the buck. Fewanti-obesity interventions, however , espe - cially those targeted to youth, have as yet been subjected to cost-effectiveness analysis.Nevertheless, I describe several possible sec - ond-best interventions. Protecting Children from Advertising If the government decides to protect children from advertising, one particular venue for in-John Cawley 78 THE FUTURE OF CHILDREN04 5562 cawley.qxp 1/22/2006 12:53 PM Page 78tervention is the public school system, where the government is solely responsible for the advertising environment. Under budgetary pressure, some school districts have signedcontracts with Channel One, which gives them televisions, educational materials, and cash in exchange for allowing Channel One toadvertise products such as candy, food, and soda pop directly to children in the classroom for two minutes each day. 66The risk is that children who are a captive audience for such food advertising may increase both their con- sumption of the advertised foods and theirrisk of obesity. A cost-benefit analysis can de-termine whether the benefits of working with Channel One exceed the costs. Some observers have advocated banning all food advertising to children in all venues. 67 Many developed countries, including Canada, Great Britain, and Australia, havebanned all television advertising to chil-dren. 68In the United States, however , Con- gress has historically tolerated little regula- tion of commercial speech. For example, theUnited States is one of only two industrial - ized countries (the other is New Zealand) to permit direct-to-consumer advertising ofpharmaceuticals. 69In 1979, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) sought to regulate the television advertising of sugary cereals tochildren because of concerns about toothdecay . Congress, however , chose to recognize broad latitude for commercial speech and blocked the FTC from pursuing the case. 70 The U.S. government has shielded children from advertising in some cases. The 1992Telephone Disclosure and Dispute Resolu - tion Act, for example, bans advertising of 1-900 phone numbers to children youngerthan age twelve and requires that advertisingdirected to children younger than age eight-een include the warning that children needtheir parents' permission to use the service. And in the mid-1990s the Food and Drug Administration adopted rules against adver- tising cigarettes near schools or in campaignstargeted to children. Using Taxes and Subsidies to Change Behaviors That Cause Obesity As noted, taxing or subsidizing people based on their weight or changes in weight would be politically unattractive and difficult to im - plement. However , some second-best tax and subsidy policies to alter behaviors may be feasible. For example, policymakers couldimplement taxes and subsidies that eitherdiscourage the consumption of certain foodsor encourage physical activity. To evaluatewhether such policies are worthwhile, policy-makers must weigh their costs and benefits. One could, for example, tax certain foods. Even though consuming food per se does notimpose costs on society, a food tax might suffi-ciently decrease consumption that obesitywould fall, cutting the costs imposed on soci - ety. Such taxes have been shown to affect food choices. A series of recent experiments con-firms that even schoolchildren' s purchases are sensitive to changes in the relative prices of foods. 71Markets and Childhood Obesity Policy VOL. 16 / NO. 1 / SPRING 2006 79It is also hard to imagine how the government couldimplement a policy to enablechildren to become entirelyrational consumers who takeinto account the future consequences of their actions.04 5562 cawley.qxp 1/22/2006 12:53 PM Page 79But taxing food involves several problems. The first is that although proponents often call for a \"junk food\" tax, it is not obvious which foods most contribute to obesity.72Any food, if consumed in sufficient quantity, can contribute to calorie surplus and weight gain. Second, food taxes would be regressive,falling more heavily on poor families who spend a larger share of their income on food than do wealthier families. The other major option is to subsidize behav- ior that decreases obesity-related societalcosts. In essence, local governments alreadydo that when they subsidize public parks, pools, and athletic facilities and when they provide free physical education, nutrition ed - ucation, and sports teams in public schools. Government subsidies for installing side-walks or for full-service supermarkets thatstock fresh fruits and vegetables to operate inlow-income or minority neighborhoods areother possible interventions. Before governments increase funding for these programs, though, they should subjectthem to cost-benefit analyses. So far, subsidiesfor youth physical activity appear to have littleeffect. Children's physical activity, for exam-ple, appears uncorrelated with the availabilityof local facilities or with neighborhood safety.Increased physical education requirementsare associated with small changes in physicalactivity but have no detectable impact onweight or the probability of overweight. 73 Regulating Food Markets in Schools Again, a special venue for intervention is the public school, where the government is re - sponsible for the food environment. For ex- ample, states could require all schools to re-move vending machines for soda and candy . Because children are not generally capable of choosing foods to achieve energy balance,energy-dense foods such as sodas and candy may be the most likely to lead to energy im-balance and subsequent obesity (although, asnoted, any food can cause obesity if con-sumed in sufficient quantity.) Schools could reconfigure meals to consist of low energy- dense foods that facilitate energy balance andserve portions that take into account the por- tion size effect observed in the research liter- ature. A potential cost of removing vendingmachines and no longer selling energy-dense foods, however, is that schools may lose con- siderable revenue from \"pouring rights\" con-tracts with soft drink manufacturers and fromcafeteria sales, revenue that may be used to advance the educational mission of the school. 74 A 2005 Government Accountability Office report found that many schools generate con - siderable revenue by selling foods outside of their school lunch programs. The reportestimates that about 30 percent of all highschools generated more than $125,000 perschool through such sales, and that 30 per - cent of all elementary schools generated more than $5,000 per school. The studyfound that schools typically use these rev - enues to offset losses associated with their other food service programs and to fund stu - dent activities. Cost-benefit analyses shouldtake into account the impact of any decreasein these revenues that would result from aban on energy-dense foods. 75 Mending or Ending Programs That May Inadvertently Contribute to Obesity Government intervention could also take the form of modifying or canceling programs thatcontribute to obesity. For example, cost-benefit analyses could assess the net benefitof agricultural production subsidies and pricesupports. These programs clearly benefitfarmers, and while some observers argue thatJohn Cawley 80 THE FUTURE OF CHILDREN04 5562 cawley.qxp 1/22/2006 PM Page 80uninsurable crop risks and weather uncer- tainty justify this agriculture policy, otherscounter that current policy is designed prima-rily to transfer wealth to farmers and proces-sors. 76Farm policy contributes to obesity by lowering food prices, but its effect on weight may be small.77A cost-benefit analysis could help determine whether society is better off with or without current agriculture policies. Another existing policy that the government can reconsider is the ban on lawsuits against food companies by plaintiffs who allege thatthe company's products made them obese. In2004 twelve states adopted laws that block consumers from filing such lawsuits; so far in 2005 seven more states have followed, andnineteen more states are considering suchlaws. 78But such blanket liability waivers re- move the food industry' s incentives to dis- close information about the food's content, to exercise restraint in advertising to children,and to ensure the food' s safety. Legal scholars are generally skeptical that torts against the food industry will be as successful as recentones against tobacco companies, in part be - cause no subset of foods can be proven to be solely responsible for causing obesity andtherefore no single food or restaurant com-pany can be shown to be liable. 79But to en - courage the food industry to keep its cus-tomers' welfare in mind, consumers need tobe able to pursue such legal cases, which canalways be thrown out if frivolous. Assessing Cost-Effectiveness Although cost-effectiveness analysis of anti- obesity initiatives is in short supply, some evi-dence exists. Studies, for example, have cal - culated the cost of saving a quality-adjusted life year (QALY) associated with specific in-terventions. (A quality-adjusted life year at - tempts to take into account the quality of the extra lifespan; for example, an extra year oflife in a persistent vegetative state receives a QALY score near zero whereas an extra yearof life in perfect health receives a full QALYscore of 1.) The decision rule for cost-effectiveness analysis is generally to imple- ment the policy with the lowest cost per QALY and to continue implementing policiesuntil either the initiative's budget is ex- hausted or the cost per QALY saved rises above some threshold. This threshold, histor-ically $50,000 per QALY, has more recently been raised to $200,000, but other bench- marks are also used. 80For example, Richard Hirth and several colleagues estimate thatunder various sets of circumstances, Ameri- cans are willing to pay from $150,000 per QAL Y to more than $425,000 per QAL Y. The Centers for Disease Control and Preven- tion have conducted a multiyear project to as - sess the cost-effectiveness of seven \"exem- plary\" interventions to increase physicalactivity . (None of the interventions was tar- geted at children and adolescents.) The study concludes that the lowest-cost exemplary in - tervention was Wheeling W alks, an eight- week, intensive community-wide intervention that promoted walking among sedentary fifty-to sixty-five-year-olds using paid media andpublic health activities at work sites, churches,and local organizations. That intervention cost$14,286 per QALY saved. 81The other six in- terventions were estimated to cost between$27,373 and $68,557 per QALY saved. Theseestimates were for a forty-year analytic timehorizon. For shorter time horizons the costsper QALY were considerably higher (morethan $100,000 for a ten-year horizon), becausemany health benefits of weight loss are reapedonly later in life while the intervention's costsare always paid up front. In contrast, estimates show bariatric surgery for the severely obese costs between $5,400Markets and Childhood Obesity Policy VOL. 16 / NO. 1 / SPRING 2006 8104 5562 cawley.qxp 1/22/2006 12:53 PM Page for men.82Pro- viding an anti-obesity to tocost $8,327 per QALY. 83These studies indi- cate that be available a variety of cost-effective anti-obesity interventions,some involving prevention and others involv- ing treatment. Conclusion Researchers have concluded that the market has contributed to overweight in children inprimarily three ways over the past severaldecades. First, the real price of food fell (per- haps in part because of changing agriculture policies). Second, the time cost of foodpreparation rose for college graduates. And,third, technological changes created incen-tives to use packaged food rather than to pre - pare foods. Given the few additional daily calories that caused the rise in obesity overthe past two decades, it will likely be impossi - ble to know which of these changes is most responsible for the increase in obesity .Several economic rationales justify govern- ment intervention in markets to address child-hood obesity: a lack of information, youthfulirrationality, and the societal costs of obesity.The government can address the lack of infor- mation easily and directly, but formulating policies to address the other two rationales ismore difficult. Several second-best policies to reduce obesity exist, but it is as yet impossible to choose among them without cost-effective-ness studies. Once such studies are available, they will help policymakers achieve the great- est benefit from a fixed budget. Americans can be optimistic about policy in- terventions' effectiveness in addressing obe- sity because small changes in flows of caloriescan have enormous impacts on individuals.One calculation implies that if Americans hadconsumed 50 fewer calories per day over thepast twenty years, 90 percent of Americanscould have avoided recent weight gains. 84 Even small changes in behavior today can substantially decrease childhood obesity infuture decades.John Cawley 82 THE FUTURE OF CHILDREN04 5562 cawley.qxp 1/22/2006 12:53 PM Page 82Notes 1.

Sallis and Karen Glanz Summary Over the past forty years various changes in the U.S. \"built environment\" have promoted sedentary lifestyles and less healthful diets. James Sallis and Karen Glanz investigate whetherthese changes have had a direct effect on childhood obesity and whether improvements to encourage more physical activity and more healthful diets are likely to lower rates of childhood obesity . Researchers, say Sallis and Glanz, have found many links between the built environment and children' s physical activity, but they have yet to find conclusive evidence that aspects of the built environment promote obesity. For example, certain development patterns, such as a lack of sidewalks, long distances to schools, and the need to cross busy streets, discourage walkingand biking to school. Eliminating such barriers can increase rates of active commuting. But re - searchers cannot yet prove that more active commuting would reduce rates of obesity. Sallis and Glanz note that recent changes in the nutrition environment, including greater re - liance on convenience foods and fast foods, a lack of access to fruits and vegetables, and ex- panding portion sizes, are also widely believed to contribute to the epidemic of childhood obe - sity. But again, conclusive evidence that changes in the nutrition environment will reduce rates of obesity does not yet exist. Research into the link between the built environment and childhood obesity is still in its in- fancy . Analysts do not know whether changes in the built environment have increased rates of obesity or whether improvements to the built environment will decrease them. Nevertheless, say Sallis and Glanz, the policy implications are clear. People who have access to safe places tobe active, neighborhoods that are walkable, and local markets that offer healthful food arelikely to be more active and to eat more healthful food\u2014two types of behavior that can lead togood health and may help avoid obesity.

The way the built environment is created can affect many daily decisions. Whether people walk to work orschool, eat frequently at fast-food restau- rants, or take their children to parks may de- pend in part on how neighborhoods are built.When one studies the built environment inthe context of the obesity epidemic, it is im- portant to ask three questions. First, how does the built environment affect importantlifestyle decisions? Second, would changingthe infrastructure alter decisionmaking? And,third, would these changes affect Americans'weight and overall health? For example, al-though much of America's built environmenthas changed over the past forty years in waysthat have promoted sedentary lifestyles, it isnot known whether these changes have had adirect effect on obesity rates or whetherchanges in the built environment will lowerthese rates. In this paper , we attempt to shed some light on these issues. Built environments affect children's weight by shaping both their eating habits and theirphysical activity . Research into the links be - tween the physical places where children live and children's activity levels and eatinghabits, it must be said, is less conclusive thanresearch in other areas covered in this vol-ume. In the first place, research on youth islimited, though studies of adults can providesome insights for youth. A second importantlimitation of virtually all existing studies is thepossibility of self-selection. A study may findthat people who live near parks are more ac-tive than people who do not, but it cannotconfidently conclude that proximity to parks is the cause of that activity. Perhaps, instead,active people choose to live near parks. Abetter study design would focus on the effectof environmental changes in a neighborhood on the people living there, but so far such studies have been limited to small changessuch as building trails. 1Tracking major envi- ronmental changes is extremely difficult be- cause the changes are not under the controlof investigators, and most such changes take far longer to be completed than the typical research study does. The \"ideal\" study, therandomized trial, is simply not possible be-cause people cannot be randomly assigned to live in particular neighborhoods. Despite the limits of research in this area, leaders in public health have stressed theneed for changes in the built environment toimprove health. 2New reports by two author- itative panels recognize that consistent linksbetween environmental factors and physicalactivity provide valuable evidence that shouldinform policy change. 3Both available evi - dence and common sense support four obe - sity-related goals: ensuring that all children have access to safe and convenient places tobe physically active, ensuring that the bulk offood available to children in most settingsmeets nutritional guidelines, reducing pro-motion of unhealthful food and sedentary be-haviors, and making it easy to identify and af - fordable to buy healthful foods. The Built Environment and Physical Activity Children themselves know that characteris- tics of the built environment affect how ac - tive they can be: physical activity is welcome in certain places and is difficult, discouraged,or even prohibited in others. Buildings,transportation infrastructure, elements ofland use and community design, and recre-James F . Sallis and Karen Glanz 90 THE CHILDREN05 5562 sallis-glanz.qxp 1/22/2006 12:54 PM Page 90ational facilities, such as parks and trails, all affect citizens' physical activity. Active Recreation Health and recreation researchers have focused on the link between access to recre- ation facilities and children's recreationalphysical activity. A handful of studies have shown what common sense would also suggest: children and adolescents with ac-cess to recreational facilities and programs, usually near their homes, are more active than those without such access. 4Adolescent girls' physical activity is related to the prox-imity of recreational facilities. 5The more often young adolescents use recreational fa- cilities, the greater their total physical activ - ity, with parks and the neighborhood most important for boys and with commercial fa-cilities and the neighborhood most impor - tant for girls. 6Preschool children are more active when there are more places nearbywhere vigorous play is welcome and whenthey spend more time in those places. 7 Three studies of preschool children using di - rect observation report that being outdoors is the strongest correlate of the children'sphysical activity . 8 There are some contrary findings. T wo stud- ies, for example, reported no significant linksbetween physical activity and such variablesas environmental barriers, access to super - vised programs, and distance to parks. 9Both studies, however, were based on parental re-ports rather than direct observation. Anotherstudy of young children found no relation be-tween their proximity to playgrounds andbeing overweight. 10 To sum up, the broad conclusions of existing studies are consonant with a review of re - search on adults, which consistently linked physical activity with both access to and theattractiveness of recreational facilities and programs.11 If further research confirms the associations between access to facilities and youth physical activity, the policy implication is clear: all chil- dren need places where they can be physicallyactive on a regular basis. The most important such places appear to be outdoors and in the neighborhood and include both public parksand commercial facilities. Because children engage in such a variety of activities and be- cause their recreational needs vary widely byage, providing many different types of facili-ties is a promising policy objective. How accessible facilities are depends on how close they are to children' s homes or schools, how costly they are to use, and how easily they can be reached. At least two U.S. studiesfound fewer parks, sports fields, fitness clubs,and trails in low-income neighborhoods thanin more affluent ones, suggesting that low-income youth may face barriers to physicalactivity. 12Interestingly, low-income neigh- borhoods had relatively fewer free than pay-for-use facilities, suggesting the possible in- fluence of community tax bases and related spending policies. Because the distribution ofThe Role of Built Environments in Physical Activity , Eating, and Obesity in Childhood VOL. 16 / NO. 1 / SPRING 2006 91If further research confirms the associations betweenaccess to facilities and youthphysical activity , the policy implication is clear: allchildren need places wherethey can be physically active on a regular basis.05 5562 sallis-glanz.qxp 1/22/2006 12:54 PM Page 91lic-private partnerships in metropolitan At- lanta have accelerated the pace of building a regional network of mixed-use walking and cycling paths.15 Active Transportation Transportation and urban planning re- searchers have for several decades been ex- amining how a community's design encour- ages (or discourages) its citizens to walk andcycle for transportation (rather than for recre- ation), though until recently health profes- sionals were unfamiliar with the reseachers'work. 16Though the original research focus was directed toward reducing traffic conges- tion and improving air quality, the findings have direct implications for physical activity . Before the middle of the twentieth century, communities were designed to support con - venient pedestrian travel for common activi- ties, such as shopping and going to school.Indeed, many U.S. towns and cities devel - oped before automobile use became wide- spread and were pedestrian oriented by ne - cessity . These \"traditional\" neighborhoods are characterized by mixed land use, con- nected streets, and moderate to high density . Homes, stores, employment centers, and government services are located near one an - other, often with multiple uses in the samemultistory building. Streets are laid out in agrid pattern that creates high levels of con - nectivity and offers pedestrians direct routes from place to place. High residential density,with a preponderance of multifamily dwell - ings, makes local stores financially viable. For obvious reasons, these traditional designs aretermed \"walkable.\" As the twentieth century progressed and America' s suburbs began to grow, however, a variety of policies were set in place to opti- mize automobile travel. Different forms ofJames F . Sallis and Karen Glanz 92 THE FUTURE OF CHILDRENfacilities is likely to vary across cities, re- searchers should examine more locations, focusing on the quality of facilities as well as access. Although market forces primarily govern the distribution of private recreational facilities,cities and states could enact tax-based incen- tives, similar to those often used to spur eco- nomic and business development, to locateprivate facilities in low-income neighbor- hoods. Publicly funded parks and trails gen - erally garner strong support. 13Some 90 per- cent of a national sample of U.S. adultssupported using local government funds forwalking and jogging trails, recreation centers,and bicycle paths. People may supportspending for recreational facilities becausethey believe public open space improvestheir quality of life, but building more andbetter public recreational facilities could alsopromote youth physical activity . 14Also health care savings could conceivably offset the gov-ernment's costs of building such facilities.Several cities have recently taken steps to im - prove their parks. Voters in Los Angeles have approved major bond issues in recent yearsto upgrade urban parks. Denver' s public schools have approved converting school playgrounds to community parks.

The street network within residential areas was disconnected, and longblocks and many cul-de-sacs made pedestrian travel all but impossible. Low-traffic residen- tial streets fed into multilane, high-speed ar-terial streets that presented serious barriers and dangers to pedestrians. Because the de- sign of suburbs essentially requires the use ofautomobiles for all trips, such communities are often described as \"unwalkable,\" espe- cially for transportation. Many studies have examined components of walkability or compared walking and cycling for transportation in high- and low-walkableneighborhoods. They consistently show morewalking and cycling for transportation inwalkable neighborhoods. 17Recent studies using objective measures of total physical ac-tivity have found that residents of high-walka-ble neighborhoods get one hour more ofphysical activity each week and are 2.4 timesmore likely to meet physical activity recom - mendations than residents of low-walkable neighborhoods. 18Recent reports from the Transportation Research Board and Institute of Medicine and the Centers for Disease Control' s \"Guide to Community Preventive Services\" conclude that the design of commu-nities is linked with physical activity, thoughcausality cannot be established because of theself-selection problem already noted. 19 Though most such research has not focused on children, several studies suggest thatyoung people would be more likely to walk tonearby destinations in traditional neighbor - hoods. Kevin Krizek, Amanda Birnbaum, and David Levinson have argued that communitydesign is relevant to youth physical activityand have recommended that researchers ex-amine the specific destinations, activities atthose destinations, and travel modes that are most common for children. 20An Australian study found that the way people perceive a neighborhood environment can affect the ex-tent to which children in that neighborhood walk and cycle to destinations. 21Perceptions of heavy traffic, a lack of public transit, a lackof street-crossing aids, the need to cross sev- eral roads, and a lack of nearby recreational facilities were all linked to lower rates of ac-tive transportation. One study of adolescents found that boys were more active when they lived near pedestrian-oriented shoppingareas. 22In an unexpected finding, girls were more active when streets were less con- nected, suggesting that low-traffic residential streets and cul-de-sacs may be play areas forsome young people. 23Researchers should also look into how community design vari-ables may operate differently for children,adolescents, and adults. Several investigators have examined how community design relates to the weight sta-tus of adults. Four studies have documentedlower body mass index (BMI) or reduced riskof overweight and obesity in people living inmore walkable areas. 24The one study focus - ing on adolescents, however, found no link between neighborhood environment andBMI, so it would be premature to draw anyfinal conclusions. 25 Walking and cycling to school are of particular interest because both require substantial en-ergy expenditures on a daily basis. 26And, in - deed, studies have found that children who walk to school are more physically active thanthose who travel to school by car , though we could locate none linking walking with weight status. 27However, active commuting rates are low, ranging from only 5 to 14 percent.28 Low-walkable suburban development pat- terns, such as the lack of sidewalks, long dis-The Role of Built Environments in Physical Activity , Eating, and Obesity in Childhood VOL. 16 / NO. 1 / SPRING 2006 9305 5562 sallis-glanz.qxp 1/22/2006 12:54 PM Page 93tances to schools, and the need to cross busy streets with fast-moving traffic, appear to cre-ate barriers to active commuting to school. 29 The simple fact is that more children walk to school in neighborhoods with sidewalks.30An evaluation of the Marin County, California,Safe Routes to Schools program that com- bined promotional activities with built envi- ronment changes\u2014more sidewalks and im-proved street crossings\u2014found a 64 percent increase in walking and a 114 percent in- crease in cycling to school. 31And an evalua- tion of statewide investments in sidewalks,crosswalks, and bike lanes in ten California schools found that 15 percent of parents of children who passed the improvements ontheir way to school reported their childrenwalked or cycled more. 32The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation' s Active Living Leader- ship program has documented initiatives across the United States at the city, county,and state levels that are designed to createbuilt environments that make it easy for peo-ple to be physically active for transportationand recreation purposes. 33 With pedestrian injuries a major cause of childhood injuries and deaths, parents are understandably concerned about trafficsafety. 34Priority should thus be placed on de- signing roads, sidewalks, and crosswalks thatmake it safe for children to walk and cycle.The need for greater investment is clear.Rates of pedestrian death and injury arevastly higher in the United States than inWestern European countries such as Ger-many and the Netherlands, where extensivenetworks of protected cycling and pedestrianlanes, along with laws that make driversrather than pedestrians or cyclists liable inaccidents, have dramatically improved pedes - trian safety. 35It is true that the development of safe sidewalks, crosswalks, and bike laneswill not increase active commuting among children whose homes are too distant from their schools or who are driven to school to suit their parents' work schedules. However,the evidence suggests that rates of active commuting can be modified through envi- ronmental interventions. Sedentary Behavior Sedentary recreational behaviors, such as watching television and videos, using com- puters, and playing video games, are impor- tant parts of young people's daily lives. Theyare also risk factors for obesity in youth, andreducing such behaviors is another strategy for preventing childhood obesity. 36Research is beginning to document connections be - tween the built environment and sedentary behaviors. Without safe places to play nearhome, for example, children may spendmore time being inactive indoors. Likewise,heavy traffic reduces the likelihood of chil-dren' s walking and may thus keep children indoors, where they remain sedentary. 37 Time spent riding in a car is associated with a risk of overweight in adults, and residents of low-walkable neighborhoods spend moretime driving, so community design is likely tohave a similar effect on children. 38These and other hypothesized associations betweenchildren's sedentary behavior and com-munity design need to be more closelyexamined. Strategies for Change Making the multiple environmental changes supported most consistently by the limitedbut rapidly expanding evidence will requireleadership from many sectors. 39The strongest evidence links access to recre-ational facilities and programs with child andadolescent physical activity . Recreation de- partments in local and state governments are a primary interest group for intervention inJames F . Sallis and Karen Glanz 94 THE CHILDREN05 5562 sallis-glanz.qxp 1/22/2006 12:54 PM Page 94this area. They could promote physical activ- ity among youth of all ages by designing and outfitting parks to provide diverse opportuni- ties for popular physical activities, ensuringequitable distribution of recreational facili- ties, and emphasizing physical activity over other programs. Because achieving thesegoals may require increased funding, govern- ment leaders could be targeted for advocacy. The Cleveland Parks Department could be amodel for other cities. As another possible model, the National Recreation and Park As- sociation has partnered with the NationalHeart, Lung, and Blood Institute to develop,evaluate, and disseminate the Hearts N' Parks program across the nation. 40 Commercial groups, such as dance and mar- tial arts studios, and community organiza-tions, such as youth sports leagues, churches,and after-school programs, all manage or in-teract with places for youth physical activity.Such groups could boost physical activity inchildren of all skill and income levels. Youthgroups could use these facilities for their so - cial and recreational programs, using sliding- scale fees to increase access for low-incomeyouth. Increasing physical activity opportuni - ties for low-income youth is a priority, be- cause these children have few options. Pro - viding tax breaks for commercial physicalactivity providers, such as dance studios andhealth clubs, to build facilities in low-incomeareas is a strategy worth exploring. Since 1990, the federal government has made transportation funds available forpedestrian and bicycling infrastructure. Stateand local transportation funds support side - walks, trails, traffic calming, and crosswalks. Safe Routes to Schools construction fundingis available from the U.S. Department ofTransportation and from the transportationdepartments of California and a few otherstates. Organized advocacy, however, may be needed to shift priorities within transporta-tion departments to ensure adequate fundingof pedestrian and bicycle facilities. Creating the mixed-use, highly connected communities found to be associated withmore physical activity requires changes in zoning codes and development regulations. Such organizations as Congress for the NewUrbanism and Smart Growth America are promoting these reforms. 41To improve the comfort and safety of pedestrians and bicy- clists, changes are needed to improve roaddesign guidelines. The \"complete streets\"concept would make all streets suitable forpedestrians, cyclists, and motorists. 42Subse - quent research must determine whether walkable neighborhoods and completestreets are health-promoting for youth as wellas adults. However, many initiatives areunder way nationwide to advocate for policychanges that will make environments moresupportive of physical activity. They shouldbe carefully evaluated. The Built Environment and Nutrition The nutrition environment is widely believed to contribute to the epidemic of childhoodand adult obesity in the United States andglobally. 43Research on nutrition environ- ments is less advanced than that on physicalThe Role of Built Environments in Physical Activity , Eating, and Obesity in Childhood VOL. 16 / NO. 1 / SPRING 2006 95Priority should thus be placed on designing roads,sidewalks, and crosswalksthat make it safe for children to walk and cycle. 05 5562 sallis-glanz.qxp 1/22/2006 12:54 PM Page 95activity environments, though several studies have examined schools as sources of food and found, for example, that the availability of fruits and vegetables in school lunches islinked with youngsters' overall consumption of fruits and vegetables. 44(See the article in this volume by Mary Story, Karen Kaphingst,and Simone French for more details on nutri- tion in schools.) Few researchers have ex- plored how other neighborhood environmentsmay affect children's eating patterns, and even fewer have looked into their possible links with childhood obesity . Thus we draw mainly from research on neighborhoods in relation to adults' dietary behaviors. The obesity epi - demic makes it essential to improve our un- derstanding of the effect of food environ - ments on children as rapidly as possible. Several aspects of the broad nutrition envi - ronment in the United States and other in- dustrialized countries may help explain theincreasing prevalence of childhood obesity . Cost concerns and time pressures often lead parents and their children to rely on conven-ience foods and fast foods. The increasingpopularity of dining out over the past twodecades has raised the proportion of nutri-ents consumed away from home. Becauseconvenience foods and restaurant meals aretypically higher in calories and fat and lowerin valuable nutrients than meals prepared at home, frequent consumption of such food in-creases the chances of obesity in children andadolescents as well as in adults. 45A lack of ac- cess to and the high cost of fruits, vegetables, and other nutritious foods may keep children from consuming them. Expanding portionsizes also appear to be contributing to the obesity epidemic. 46 Parents and school administrators are usually called on to provide more healthful foods to children. Evidence indicates, however, thatthere is a great deal of support for commu-nity-level policies that affect local food envi- ronments. In a recent survey in California, 50 percent of respondents rated their neighbor - hoods as being only fair, poor, or very poor in offering healthful food for children, with res-idents of large cities most likely to give nega - tive ratings. 47Eighty-seven percent of re- spondents favored requiring fast-food andchain restaurants to post nutritional informa - tion, and 46 percent favored limiting the number of fast-food restaurants in a commu - nity. 48Respondents generally favored a com - munity approach to reducing childhood obe- sity rather than leaving it to individualchildren and families. They rated parents,health care providers, and schools as moreimportant than churches and faith-based or-ganizations in helping to reduce childhoodobesity , although relatively more African Americans and Latinos favored a major church role. 49 Is the consumers' perception that childhood obesity can be altered through changes in thenutrition environment supported by evi - dence? Though the literature to date is lim- ited, diverse studies support the principlethat nutrition environments may be impor - tant influences on eating behavior and may help explain disparities in behavior and dis-James F .

A study in New Orleans found higher fast- food restaurant density in minority andlower-income neighborhoods, and a study in Australia found that people living in poorer areas had twice the exposure to these restau-rants. 53A state-level analysis in the United States found only a modest link between obe- sity and the prevalence of fast-food restau-rants: the density of such restaurants ac-counted for only 6 percent of the variance in state obesity rates out of a total of 70 percent explained by a model that included manyvariables. 54In another Australian study, the availability of take-away food and restaurantswas not linked with obesity . 55And in one of the only studies known to explore communitynutrition environments and children, over-weight was not linked with proximity to fast-food restaurants among urban low-incomepreschoolers. 56 Consumer Nutrition Environments Data on consumer nutrition environments, by contrast, reflect what consumers en-counter within and around a store or restau - rant, including the availability of healthfulchoices, price, promotions, placement, andnutritional information. Price is an influentialfeature of the nutrition environment. A studyof why Americans eat what they do foundthat cost was the second most important fac - tor, behind taste; convenience was ranked fourth, just after nutrition. 57 The availability of healthful foods is also im- portant. Some healthful foods, such as low-fatdairy products and fruits and vegetables, areless available and of poorer quality in minorityand lower-income areas. Three studies haveThe Role of Built Environments in Physical Activity , Eating, and Obesity in Childhood VOL. 16 / NO. 1 / SPRING 2006 97ease. The available research on nutrition en- vironments outside schools and homes is based on concepts and empirical data from the fields of public health, health psychology,consumer psychology, and urban planning. It falls generally under two headings: commu- nity nutrition environments, which include the number, type, and location of food out- lets, and consumer nutrition environments, which cover the availability and cost of, aswell as information about, healthful and less healthful foods inside those food outlets. The distinction is important because each couldhave broad effects on child health, and theopportunities for modifying each can be quite different. Community Nutrition Environments In the community nutrition environment, stores and restaurants are the most numerousfood outlets. Accessibility can include largeissues, such as whether and to what extentthese outlets are located in certain communi - ties, as well as such smaller issues as whether they have drive-through windows and whattheir hours of operation are. Other foodsources, such as cafeterias in schools, worksites, churches, and health care facilities, areconsidered \"organizational nutrition environ-ments,\" although the nonschool sources maybe more influential for adults than for chil-dren and youth. The community nutrition environment may explain some of the racial, ethnic, and socio-economic disparities in nutrition and health,such as the increasing prevalence of over-weight in low-income children. 50Supermar- kets, for example, are less common in lower - income and minority neighborhoods than in other neighborhoods.51And recent evidence links access to supermarkets with suchindicators of healthful eating as fruit andvegetable intake among African American05 5562 sallis-glanz.qxp 1/22/2006 12:54 PM Page 97documented that disadvantaged neighbor- hoods have a proportionally lower availability of healthful options and produce of poorer quality than do more affluent and whiteneighborhoods. 58A study in Los Angeles compared healthful food options and food preparation at restaurants in poorer neighbor-hoods and at restaurants in higher-income neighborhoods and found fewer healthful menu selections in the lower-income areas. 59 A recent study compared the availability and cost of a standard \"market basket\" of foodsfrom the U.S. Department of Agriculture' s Thrifty Food Plan for low-income consumers with a market basket of healthier foods, suchas whole wheat bread and lean ground beef.Most low-income consumers had access tothe healthier substitutes but at significantlygreater cost than the less healthful options. 60 Few studies have examined the connection between consumer nutrition environmentsand eating behaviors. Allen Cheadle and sev-eral colleagues found positive links betweenthe availability of healthful (low-fat and high-fiber) products at the grocery store and indi-viduals' consumption of these foods. 61Fol- low-up surveys two years later, however, found that changes in food availability maderelatively little difference to individuals' foodconsumption over time. 62Researchers must develop better measures to use grocery storesurveys to track community-level dietary changes over time. Indeed, to better understand in general how the nutrition environment affects eating be- havior, analysts must continue to improve their measures of how consumer nutritionenvironments vary. In a food availability study completed in 1990, Cheadle and his colleagues included calculations of the per-centage of shelf space used for healthful food options, such as low-fat milk and cheese and lean meats, but such measures may be diffi-cult to apply in contemporary grocery stores,which are now larger and more varied in lay- out than stores were only a decade ago. 63 Other opportunities for consumer measures in stores include assessing product promotionand placement related to children, such asdisplaying energy-dense foods and placingunhealthful products on lower shelves. Thecomplexity of the research area is clear, butgiven the public health imperative to im - prove eating behaviors, it must be a high pri- ority to enhance the public' s understanding of the food environments' impact on their eating habits. An important omission in these studies is that none makes it possible to evaluate the rela - tive contribution of environmental anddemographic, psychological, and social fac-tors to diet and obesity . Such multilevel stud - ies are critically necessary to better inform policymakers, researchers, and communitiesabout the potential of environmental changestrategies to make a genuine difference in thechildhood obesity problem. Strategies for Change Although researchers are well informed about which eating patterns will help avoid orreduce obesity, they as yet know relatively lit-tle about how environmental change can af-James F . Sallis and Karen Glanz 98 THE FUTURE OF CHILDRENMost low-income consumers had access to the healthiersubstitutes but at cost than the less healthful options.05 5562 sallis-glanz.qxp 1/22/2006 12:54 PM Page 98fect eating patterns. Nevertheless, we can suggest promising strategies, many of which have already been shown to be feasible. Some of these strategies come from recentonline and newspaper reports; although they are innovative, they have usually not been carefully evaluated. Others come from previ-ously reported efforts to promote healthful eating, such as reducing fat intake or eating more fruits and vegetables. They provide in-teresting case examples, though, again, most have not been rigorously evaluated. 64 At the community nutrition level, increasing the number of supermarkets (and the variety of fresh produce they sell) in low-income and minority neighborhoods could lead to health - ier eating behaviors. Several cities have shown that it is feasible to increase the pres-ence of supermarkets in disadvantaged areasthrough community advocacy and politicalaction. 65Providing transportation to food sources for poor families who do not own carsappears to be both feasible and popular withshoppers. Locating farmers' markets in low-income neighborhoods has also been well re - ceived, although whether the markets affect children' s fruit and vegetable consumption or energy balance remains unclear. 66 The Urban Nutrition Initiative in West Philadelphia combines the physical activity ofgardening with the promotion of healthy eat - ing. This university-community partnership has been recognized as a model health-promotion effort. 67Similar grassroots efforts under the umbrella of community-supportedagriculture connect local farmers and con-sumers to increase the production and con - sumption of fresh produce. 68 Zoning and tax policies can also improve the types and quality of food sold at neighbor-hood stores. Some restaurant chains, includ-ing fast-food restaurants, are increasing their menu of healthful foods by offering side or-ders of salad or vegetables as part of \"combomeals.\" 69A Produce for Better Health Foun- dation study is exploring opportunities to im- plement healthful menu changes in fast-food and fast-casual restaurant chains and familystyle restaurants. Several metropolitan areas have convened fo- rums to brainstorm ways to address their re- gional childhood obesity problems, with changes to the built environment among theoptions. Chicago leaders have come togetherin the Consortium to Lower Obesity in Chicago Children to identify local solutions with special attention to low-income commu - nities and \"urban re-design.\" 70California health care organizations are promotingmore healthful food environments in work - places, hospitals, and clinics in models that might be adopted regionwide. 71And in San Diego County , a community forum is plan- ning to combat childhood obesity by, among other things, promoting better food labelingand by creating partnerships between theschool system and farmers' markets. 72 Common Issues for Physical Activity and Nutrition Few studies simultaneously address both physical activity and nutrition within neigh-borhoods, though such work could advanceunderstanding of how the built environmentinfluences childhood obesity. Studies linkingcommunity design and adult weight raise thepossibility that land use could work throughboth physical activity and eating. 73Not only are people more physically active in tradi - tional neighborhoods, such neighborhoods may also provide more convenient access tohealthful foods or less dominance of fast-foodrestaurants. 74Zoning laws can be used to re- quire certain forms of destinations withinThe Role of Built Environments in Physical Activity , Eating, and Obesity in Childhood VOL. 16 / NO. 1 / SPRING 2006 9905 5562 sallis-glanz.qxp 1/22/2006 12:54 PM Page 99walking distance of most residences, to limit the number of convenience stores and fast- food restaurants, or to encourage farmers' markets and family style, sit-down, or \"slow-food,\" restaurants. Because community design is related to walk- ing for transportation and because food out- lets are among the most common destina- tions for walkers, incentives for offering morehealthful choices at food stores could affect both healthful eating and physical activity. 75 Neighborhoods that have community gar- dens can promote both physical activity andhealthful eating. 76Although urban planners are primarily motivated to reduce sprawl be- cause of concerns about traffic congestion,air pollution, the cost of new infrastructure,and a lack of active transportation, reducingsprawl would also preserve agricultural areasnear cities and thus maintain farmers' abili-ties to provide local produce. 77In turn, more locally grown produce could reduce the costof getting healthful foods to market andcould support local economic development. Drive-through windows at fast-food restau- rants make food purchasing more convenientand may encourage consumers to eat whilethey drive. Drive-through windows are alsosymptomatic of the type of building designthat discourages pedestrian activity. Restrict-ing drive-through windows might improveboth eating and physical activity. The politicsof such restrictions could be complex, butdemonstration projects could test how accept - able they are and what effects they might have. Researchers hypothesize that social cohesion is higher in traditional neighborhoods, wherepeople are more likely to see and talk withtheir neighbors while walking. 78In socially cohesive neighborhoods, parents may also bemore likely to feel comfortable letting theirchildren play outdoors and walk or cycle to nearby stores for minor food-shopping er-rands. Socially cohesive communities mayalso be better advocates for more physical ac-tivity opportunities and for better access to healthful foods. Problems with crime and traffic safety are likely to counter some of the benefits of tradi- tional neighborhoods. Though we could locateno data on this topic, parental concerns about safety could keep children from taking advan- tage of walkable neighborhoods, recreationalfacilities, and healthful food sources such ascommunity gardens and farmers' markets. Parents who are concerned about risks of vio- lence or abduction are likely to act on thosefears, regardless of real crime rates or an ab-solute risk of abduction. Likewise, parentswho are concerned about heavy or fast vehicu - lar traffic are likely to restrict a child's move- ments. Both types of concerns may be moreprevalent and have greater impact among low-income families, who may not have cars totransport children to recreational and health - ful eating opportunities. Researchers should focus on both objectively assessed and per-ceived safety issues as they relate to physicalactivity, eating, and built environments. Lessons Learned and Challenges Changing the built environment to increase children' s physical activity for recreation and transportation, to improve access to healthful foods, and to reduce access to less healthfulfoods can help provide long-term solutions tothe childhood obesity epidemic. Unlike theoften-transitory effects of motivational andeducational approaches to addressing obesity , changes in behavior prompted by changes in the built environment should be long lasting.Although research generally links aspects ofthe built environment with physical activityand eating behaviors, most data are fromJames F . Sallis and Karen Glanz 100 THE CHILDREN05 5562 sallis-glanz.qxp 1/22/2006 12:54 PM Page 100studies of adults, and findings to date are un- able to pinpoint which specific variables would have the greatest effect on childhood eating, physical activity, and obesity. Never-theless, we can draw some lessons from the studies to date and offer some tentative pol- icy recommendations. Given the urgency ofthe childhood obesity epidemic, we cannot wait for optimal evidence and must instead base actions on the best available evidence. 79 Children of all ages need and want places to play. To support the diversity of their physicalactivities, they need many types of recre-ational facilities, both public and private, near their homes and schools. To remedy the relative scarcity of such facilities in low-income neighborhoods, policymakers mustensure that these facilities are more equitablydistributed. Adults who live in walkable communities are more physically active and less likely to beoverweight than those who do not. A fewstudies suggest that adolescents living inwalkable neighborhoods may be more activeand more likely to walk to school than theircounterparts in unwalkable communities, butmore studies of youth are needed. Combin-ing physical improvements to enhance thesafety of routes to school with activities thatpromote walking and cycling appears to in-crease active commuting to school. Improv - ing the safety of roads, sidewalks, and cross- walks may reduce parental concerns abouttraffic danger and encourage more activetransportation among children. Low-income and minority neighborhoods not only have less access to healthful foods butalso may face higher food costs. Evidencelinking access to healthful foods with dietaryintake in children is limited; more studiesshould be a high priority. But enough studiesdocument inequitable access to healthful foods to justify corrective efforts. With obe-sity rates among low-income children andadults much higher than those among well-to-do citizens, there is a strong rationale for grassroots efforts, public-private partner- ships, and even public subsidies of healthfulfood sources in targeted areas. 80Increasing the number of healthful, affordable food choices in a variety of food outlets is a com-plementary strategy that may be largely driven by commercial considerations. In this instance, public pressure and consumer de-mand can make a difference. Challenges of T ranslating Research into Change Conducting research on built environments and childhood obesity and implementingchanges based on the findings will be chal-lenging. Researchers will probably not find asingle \"smoking gun.\" It is more likely thatmany built environment variables will show astrong cumulative effect on diet, physical ac-tivity , and weight status in children than that any single variable will have a dominant influ- ence. Further, different environmental vari-ables are likely to be operating for children ofdifferent ages and genders as well as forthose of different racial, ethnic, and culturalThe Role of Built Environments in Physical Activity , Eating, and Obesity in Childhood VOL. 16 / NO. 1 / SPRING 2006 101Combining physical improvements to enhance thesafety of routes to school withactivities that promotewalking and cycling appearsto increase active commuting to school.05 5562 sallis-glanz.qxp 1/22/2006 12:54 PM Page 101groups and socioeconomic backgrounds. Thus changing the built environment in all the ways needed to combat obesity may be a complex task. Research is further compli-cated by the paucity of reliable and valid measures of food and physical activity envi- ronmental factors. And changing the builtenvironment alone is unlikely to induce large changes in eating habits and physical activity. Educational programs, promotional activi-ties, incentives, and policies will all be neces- sary to support the physical changes. Making so many changes in the built environ- ment would affect not only many government departments at all levels, but also the food industry , the real estate industry , many trans- portation-related industries, recreation-related industries, and entertainment industries.Some of these industries will actively opposepolicies that threaten their current operatingpractices. 81Stimulating health-oriented policy change in government agencies not normallyfocused on health will require creative andsustained effort. Public support for changingthe built environment to combat childhoodobesity has seldom been studied but may bedecisive in adopting and implementing bothpromising and evidence-based policies. 82 Enhancements to encourage more active commuting in communities and potentialsubsidies for healthful foods may well be costly. Those costs must be better understoodand balanced against the costs of continuingcurrent policies that may be driving the youthobesity epidemic. Careful economic analyses must inform policy decisions. 83 Making major changes in government policy and industry practice will require a substan- tial investment in advocacy that will in turnrequire people, organization, and funding. Although many organizations have interests consistent with the built environment'schanges already noted, their capacity is notsufficient to achieve even the initial policy changes supported by existing data. Continu- ous evaluation will be required to learnwhether the changes that are made lead tothe expected outcomes and contribute to re-ducing the obesity epidemic. Finally, there is an urgent need for the next generation of studies on how the built envi - ronment affects youth physical activity, eat- ing, and obesity . Because simply identifying built environment risk factors is not sufficient to create change, advancing the science ofpolicy change is also a high priority . A new re - search emphasis must be to improve the un- derstanding of policy change processes ofgreatest relevance to youth physical activity,eating, and obesity.James F .

Kaphingst, and Simone French Summary Mary Story, Karen Kaphingst, and Simone French argue that U.S. schools offer many opportu- nities for developing obesity-prevention strategies by providing more nutritious food, offering greater opportunities for physical activity, and providing obesity-related health services. Meals at school are available both through the U.S. Department of Agriculture's school break- fast and lunch programs and through \"competitive foods\" sold \u00e0 la carte in cafeterias, vending machines, and snack bars. School breakfasts and school lunches must meet federal nutritionstandards, but competitive foods are exempt from such requirements. And budget pressuresforce schools to sell the popular but nutritionally poor foods \u00e0 la carte. Public discomfort withthe school food environment is growing. But can schools provide more healthful food optionswithout losing money? Limited evidence shows that they can. Although federal nutrition regulations are inadequate, they permit state and local authorities to impose additional restrictions. And many are doing so. Some states limit sales of nonnutritiousfoods, and many large school districts restrict competitive foods. Several interventions have changed school food environments, for example, by reducing fat content of food in vending machines and making more fruits and vegetables available. Inter - ventions are just beginning to target the availability of competitive foods. Other pressures can also compromise schools' efforts to encourage physical activity. As states use standardized tests to hold schools and students academically accountable, physical educa-tion and recess have become a lower priority . But some states are now mandating and promot - ing more physical activity in schools. School health services can also help address obesity by providing screening, health information, and referrals to students, especially low-income stu-dents, who are at high risk of obesity , tend to be underinsured, and may not receive health serv - ices elsewhere.

Schools can promote good nutrition, physical activity, andhealthy weights among children throughhealthful school meals and foods, physicaleducation programs and recess, classroomhealth education, and school health services. In this article we discuss the role of schools in preventing obesity . We analyze schools' food and physical activity environments and exam- ine federal, state, and local policies related tofood and physical activity standards inschools. W e conclude by discussing promising and innovative obesity-prevention strategies. Are Obesity , Nutrition, and Physical Activity Linked with School Performance? Some observers have noted a worrisome cor - relation between weight problems and poor academic achievement.4One research study found that severely overweight children andadolescents are four times more likely thantheir healthy-weight peers to report \"im-paired school functioning.\" Overweight chil - dren are also more likely to have abnormal scores on the Child Behavior Checklist (acommonly used measure of children's behav- ior problems) and are twice as likely to be placed in special education and remedial classes than are children who are not over-weight. 5A study involving 11,192 kindergart- ners found that overweight children had sig- nificantly lower math and reading test scoresat the beginning of the year than did their healthy-weight peers and that these differ- ences persisted into first grade. 6But such findings must be interpreted with caution. Because overweight is linked with poor aca- demic performance does not mean that itcauses poor performance. Low academicachievement can have many underlying causes, including low socioeconomic status, lower parental education, poor nutrition, andparental depression. Overweight should beconsidered a marker for poor academic per-formance and not the cause itself. Overweight can impair school performance in many ways, including health-related ab - senteeism. 7Among the medical conditions linked with overweight in school-aged chil - dren are asthma, joint problems, type 2 dia - betes, depression and anxiety, and sleep apnea.8Social problems\u2014such as being teased or bullied\u2014loneliness, or low self-esteem can also affect how well children doin school. 9 Although the evidence that child obesity af - fects school performance is limited, nutrition clearly affects academic performance. Poornutritional status and hunger interfere withcognitive function and are associated withlower academic achievement. Iron deficiencyis linked to shortened attention span, irri - tability, fatigue, and difficulty with concentra- tion. 10A recent review of studies of breakfast habits and nutritional status in children andadolescents found that breakfast consump-tion may improve cognitive function relatedMary Story , Karen M. Kaphingst, and Simone French 110 THE FUTURE OF CHILDREN06 5562 story-school.qxp 1/22/2006 12:54 PM Page 110to memory, test grades, and school atten- dance.11Studies have also found that chil- dren participating in the federal SchoolBreakfast Program show increases in daily at-tendance, class participation, and academic test scores and decreases in tardiness. 12 Research has also recently begun to elucidate the relationship between physical activity and student performance at school. Among thefindings are that physical activity programs help school-aged children develop social skills, improve mental health, and reducerisk-taking behaviors. 13Evidence also sug- gests that short-term cognitive benefits of physical activity during the school day ade- quately compensate for time spent away fromother academic areas. 14This evidence sug- gests that efforts to improve nutrition and in-crease physical activity in school may havethe twin benefits of reducing obesity andimproving the academic performance of allchildren, whether they are at risk of obesityor not. The School Food Environment Not only do most U.S. school-aged children attend school, they eat a large share of theirdaily food while they are there\u2014estimatesrange from 19 to 50 percent or higher . 15 Food is typically available through the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) schoolbreakfast and lunch programs and through\"competitive foods\" sold in vending ma-chines, as \u00e0 la carte offerings in the cafeteria,and at snack bars, school stores, and fund-raisers. 16 National School Breakfast and Lunch Programs Ninety-nine percent of all public schools and 83 percent of all public and private schoolsparticipate in the National School LunchProgram. 17The School Breakfast Program isoffered in 78 percent of the schools that offer the lunch program.18On an average school day, about 60 percent of children in schools offering the lunch program eat school lunch, and about 37 percent of children in schools inthe breakfast program eat school breakfast(see table 1). Meals in both programs must meet federally defined nutrition standards (see box) forschools to be eligible for federal subsidies,both cash and commodities. Federal schoollunches must provide approximately one-third of the recommended dietary allowance(RDA) for key nutrients; school breakfastsoffer one-fourth of the RDA. A 1998-99 na-tional study found that federal school lunchesgenerally meet standards for the key nutri-ents protein, vitamins A and C, calcium, andThe Role of Schools in Obesity Prevention VOL. 16 / NO. 1 / SPRING 2006 111Table 1.

Kaphingst, and Simone French 112 THE FUTURE OF CHILDRENSummary of Regulations and Funding for the National School Breakfast and National School Lunch Programs Regulations School meals must meet the applicable recommendations of the Dietary Guidelines for Ameri- cans, which recommend that no more than 30 percent of an individual's calories come from fat and less than 10 percent from saturated fat. School lunches must provide one-third of the recom-mended dietary allowance (RDA) for protein, calcium, iron, Vitamin A, Vitamin C, and calories.School breakfasts must provide one-fourth of these RDAs. Local school food authorities decidewhich specific foods to serve and how to prepare them. \"Foods of minimal nutritional value\" as defined by federal regulations cannot be sold in school food service areas during the meal periods. Four categories of prohibited foods are soda pop,water ices, chewing gum, and certain candies, including hard candy, jellies and gums, marshmal-low candies, fondant, licorice, spun candy, and candy-coated popcorn. Funding The National School Lunch and School Breakfast Programs are entitlement programs. As long as they follow regulations, enrolled public and nonprofit private schools are guaranteed funds to offerfree or reduced-price meals. Both programs have a three-tiered system to determine the reim-bursement rates. Children in families at or below 130 percent of the poverty line receive freemeals. Children in families between 130 and 185 percent of the poverty line receive reduced-price meals. Children in families above 185 percent of the poverty line receive a small per-mealsubsidy for full-price (\"paid\") meals, as set by the school. The per-meal subsidies are indexed for inflation. For the 2005-06 school year, the per-meal re- imbursement rate for school breakfasts is $1.27 for free breakfast, $0.97 for reduced-pricebreakfast, and $0.23 for the paid breakfast. Schools where at least 40 percent of the lunchesserved during the second preceding school year were free or reduced price may qualify for extra\"severe need\" school breakfast reimbursements if their costs exceed the standard federal reim-bursement. For severe need, the reimbursement rate for free breakfast is $1.51, that for re-duced-price breakfast is $1.21, and that for paid breakfast is $0.23. For school lunches, the reimbursement rate for free lunch is $2.32, the rate for reduced-price lunch is $1.92, and the rate for paid lunch is $0.22. F or schools where 60 percent or more lunches served during the second preceding school year were free or reduced price, the reim- bursement rate for free lunch is $2.34, the rate for reduced-price lunch is $1.94, and the rate forpaid lunch is $0.24. In addition to these rates, institutions may also receive 17.5 cents in com - modities (or cash in lieu of commodities) as additional assistance for each lunch served.

Schools reducedthe average share of calories from fat in lunches from 38 percent in 1991-92 to 34 percent in 1998-99, but more than 75 per-cent of schools have not met the recom-mended share of 30 percent. Elementary schools are doing better than high schools. 21 The nutritional profile of school meals has improved over the past fifteen years but isnot yet what it should be. Impact of school meals on child nutrition . School meal programs significantly improveschool-age children' s diets. 22Children who eat school highermean of micronutrients, both atmealtime and over twenty-four hours, thanthose who do not. 23For the 59 percent of children eating school meals who come fromlow-income families, the meals provide anecessary safeguard against hunger . 24Partici - pation in the program declines drasticallywith age. It also declines as competing op-tions to school meals become available. 25 Commodity foods. Schools participating in the lunch program are eligible to receivecommodity foods as well as bonus commodi-ties. The commodity foods support Americanfarmers by providing price supports and re - moving surpluses. Commodity foods must be of domestic origin, and 60 percent of thecommodities purchased for schools must befrom surplus stocks. 26Commodities make up about 20 percent of the food schools use,The Role of Schools in Obesity Prevention VOL. 16 / NO. 1 / SPRING 2006 113with local school districts buying the rest on the open market or through purchasing coop-eratives. 27During the 2005-06 school year, schools can receive donated commodityfoods from the USDA, valued at 17.5 cents for each lunch served. 28More than 94,000 schools receive commodities. During the2004 school year, the USDA purchased more than $7.7 million worth of commodities for schools, totaling more than 1.1 billionpounds. 29The states administer the com- modities program, with each state selecting from a list of foods purchased by the USDA.Changes are needed in the commodity foodprogram. The USDA should revise specifica- tions to procure commodity foods that are consistent with those outlined in the Dietary Guidelines. The program should also offer more fresh produce and healthful lower-fatfoods and make more connections with localfarmers. Financial issues . Budget pressures compli - cate schools' efforts to provide nutritious meals. 30School food service programs, once regular line items in local school budgets,now must often be completely self-support-ing and cover costs of food, labor , and other expenses, such as equipment, utilities, and trash removal. 31Federal reimbursements and revenue from food sales are their princi-pal sources of funds. In the 2005-06 schoolyear, the USDA will reimburse participating schools $2.32 for every free lunch provided, $1.92 for every reduced-price lunch sold, and$0.22 for every other (\"paid\") lunch mealsold. 32A recent analysis, however, found that expenses covered by federal reimbursementsfell from 54 percent in 1996-97 to 51 percentin 2000-01. 33Schools can enhance revenues in three ways: by increasing the number ofstudents who eat federal meals, by increasingprices for full-price meals, and by expanding\u00e0 la sales. first two06 PM Page 113options\u2014increasing meal participa- tion and raising prices of school meals\u2014are difficult because many competing options are available from which students can purchasefood at school. To try to break even, many food service directors thus choose the third option: selling popular but nutritionally poorfoods \u00e0 la carte. 35In one analysis in 2000, total revenue from \u00e0 la carte foods was 43 percent.36Not surprisingly, sales of \u00e0 la carte items are inversely related to sales of school lunch meals.37In states that restrict the sale of competitive foods, such as Mississippi,Louisiana, W est Virginia, and Georgia, school meal participation rates exceed the national average. 38 To encourage more students to participate in the school meal program, some schools arehiring culinary experts to develop healthful,tasty meals; are making cafeterias more youthfriendly; and are enhancing the cafeteria's at-mosphere. Indeed, the cafeteria itself can bea barrier to healthy eating. In some schools,lunch is served as early as 10:00 a.m. or aslate as 1:30 p.m. Long cafeteria lines sendstudents to vending machines or schoolstores. Insufficient time for lunch, crampedand unattractive cafeterias, and noise can alsodiscourage participation in school meals. Allthese issues have financial implications, andstructural issues, such as the cafeteria spaceor time allowed for lunch, are not under the school food service's control. School food services, facing difficult times, are using a variety of expense-containment and revenue-producing strategies to try to manage school food service finances. Servingreimbursable meals that are more appealing to students and offering more healthful \u00e0 la carte items would help students eat morehealthfully. For this change to happen, how- ever, schools need to curtail foods sold out- side the cafeteria that compete with schoolmeals. Limiting competitive foods duringschool mealtimes could increase meal partic- ipation and increase revenues. Full funding for the school meal programs could also relieve pressure on schools' foodservices to generate extra funding throughcompetitive food sales. Schools that partici-pate in the federal meal programs receive afixed reimbursement for each meal served.Federal reimbursement rates are typicallynine to ten times higher for free meals thanfor reduced-price or paid meals. 39Although some states contribute supplemental fundsand most schools receive donated USDAcommodity foods, federal reimbursementsare inadequate to cover the remainder of themeals' costs. Competitive Foods Competitive foods are all foods offered for sale at school except federal school meals.40 They include \u00e0 la carte foods offered in the school cafeteria as well as foods and bever-ages sold in snack bars, student stores, vend-ing machines, and fund-raisers. 41Current law tightly limits the Agriculture Department'sauthority to regulate competitive foods,which fall into two categories. The first cate - gory, called foods of minimal nutritional value, is defined in federal regulations asMary Story , Karen M. Kaphingst, and Simone French 114 THE FUTURE OF CHILDRENServing reimbursable meals that are more appealing tostudents and offering morehealthful \u00e0 la carte itemswould help students more healthfully.06 5562 story-school.qxp 1/22/2006 12:54 PM Page 114foods that provide less than 5 percent of the RDA per serving for each of eight key nutri-ents. They include soft drinks, water ices,chewing gum, and certain candies madelargely from sweeteners, such as hard candy and jelly beans. These foods, which the USDA regulates, cannot be sold in food ser-vice areas during meal periods, but they may be sold anywhere else in the school at any time. 42A vending machine with soft drinks and candy, for example, could be placed in the hall outside the cafeteria and be available to students all day. The second category ofcompetitive foods, which is not under USDAauthority, consists of all other foods offered for individual sale. This category, which in- cludes candy bars, potato chips, cookies, anddoughnuts, may be sold in the cafeteria dur-ing meal periods as well as anywhere else inthe school. Although reimbursable schoolmeals must meet federal nutrition and di-etary guidelines, competitive foods have nosuch requirements. The federal definition of\"foods of minimal nutritional value\" is thirtyyears old and narrow in scope. It should beexpanded to include additional foods withlimited nutritional value. Further, althoughthe federal school meal programs set appro - priate portion sizes, competitive foods follow no size guidelines. T wenty ounces of soda, for example, is the standard size in many schoolvending machines. Availability of competitive foods. The avail- ability of high-fat, high-sugar foods and bev-erages in schools creates a food environmentthat invites excess energy intake and excessweight gain. 43The national School Health Policies and Programs Study (SHPPS) 2000found that 43 percent of elementary schools,74 percent of middle schools, and 98 percentof high schools have vending machines,school snack bars, or other food sources out-side of the school meal programs. 44The mostThe Role of Schools in Obesity Prevention VOL. 16 / NO. 1 / SPRING 2006 115common competitive foods are carbonated beverages, fruit drinks that are not 100 per-cent juice, salty snacks, and high-fat bakedgoods. Only 18 percent of the foods availablethrough vending machines, school stores, or snack bars are fruits or vegetables. Most schools (58 percent of elementary schools, 84percent of middle schools, and 94 percent of high schools) sell soft drinks, sports drinks, or fruit drinks. 45In one study, the mean number of soft drink machines available to high school students was 5.3 (ranging from two to eleven).46Another study found that nearly nine out of ten schools offered competitivefoods through \u00e0 la carte cafeteria lines, vend- ing machines, and school stores during the 2003-04 school year . The sale of competitive foods has increased over the past five years, with schools often selling them in or near thecafeteria and during lunch. High schools andmiddle schools were more likely to sell suchfoods than elementary schools. 47 In the SHPPS 2000 survey, nearly all (83 per- cent) schools offered food \u00e0 la carte.48And the wide availability of high-fat foods in cafe - teria \u00e0 la carte options has been docu- mented.49In one study , Simone French and her colleagues found that only a third of foods in high school \u00e0 la carte areas and invending machines met the lower-fat guide-line of less than 5.5 fat grams per serving. 50 The average number of \u00e0 la carte food items typically available per school was 80 (rangingfrom 39 to 156), with chips and crackers mak-ing up the largest share of items. Fruits andvegetables were available \u00e0 la carte in 85 per-cent of the schools, but they made up only 4percent of total \u00e0 la carte foods available. 51 School districts have also established con- tracts with fast-food vendors. In the 2003California High School Fast Food Survey , roughly one-fourth of 173 districts reported selling brand-name products from Taco Bell,06 5562 story-school.qxp 1/22/2006 12:54 PM Page 115Subway, Domino's, and Pizza Hut in high schools.52 School fundraisers often involve the sale of food or beverages. In the SHPPS 2000 sur- vey, 82 percent of the schools reported that school clubs, sports teams, or the parent-teacher association (PTA) sold food at school or in the community to raise money. 53Ac- cording to the California fast-food survey, 74percent of school food service directors re- ported that student clubs sell food during school mealtimes. 54Other groups selling food at mealtimes in high schools are boosterclubs (33 percent), the PT A (31 percent), and the physical education (PE) department (28 percent). Food fundraisers directly competewith the food service department and aresubject to no nutritional standards. Studentgroups could instead raise funds by sellingnonfood items, such as gift wrap, magazines,and plants, and by hosting walk-a-thons andauctions. Impact of competitive foods on child nutri- tion. Competitive foods sold to students are displacing fruits and vegetables and otherhealthful foods and contributing to excessivefat and saturated fat intake. One study exam - ined the diets of 598 seventh- and eighth- grade students and found that the greater theavailability at school of \u00e0 la carte foods, the lower the daily intake of fruits and vegetables and the higher the intake of daily total fat and saturated fat. The greater the availability ofsnack vending machines, the lower the intake of fruit. 55Karen Cullen and Issa Zakeri found that when elementary school students en-tered middle school and gained access to school snack bars, they consumed fewer fruits and non-starchy vegetables, less milk,and more sweetened beverages and high-fat vegetables than they did when they were in elementary school and had no option but theschool lunch. 56In a study of 743 sixth-grade students aged eleven to thirteen in three public middle schools in Kentucky, one-third who purchased the regular school lunch alsobought competitive food items\u2014mostlychips, fruitades or sport beverages, and cakesand cookies\u2014in the lunchroom. 57These stu - dents reduced their school lunch servings, re- sulting in lower intakes of minerals and vita-mins and higher intakes of energy and fat. Allthese studies highlight the importance ofschool lunch program meals to fruit, veg - etable, and milk consumption among chil - dren and adolescents. School funding issues and competitive foods . As noted, competitive food sales generate animportant revenue stream for schools in a cli-mate of funding constraints. Many schoolshave come to rely on profits from competi - tive food sales to support food service opera- tions, academic programs, cocurricular activi-ties, and after -school activities. 58Schools that are under financial pressure are more likelyto make low-nutrition foods and beveragesavailable to their students, have soft drinkcontracts, and allow food and beverage ad-vertising to students. 59A 2005 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report foundthat many schools, particularly high schoolsand middle schools, generated substantialMary Story , Karen M.

School districts nationwide have also negoti- ated contracts for product sales, primarily soft drinks. 61These \"pouring rights\" con- tracts typically involve substantial lump-sum payments to school districts and additional payments over five to ten years in return forexclusive sales of one company's products invending machines and at all school events. 62 Companies also advertise on scoreboards, in hallways, on book covers, and elsewhere.Many contracts increase the share of profitsschools receive when sales volume increases,further encouraging schools to promote con - sumption. These practices contradict the nutrition and health messages students receive in the class-room and contribute to poor dietary habits.They also give soda companies unfettered ac - cess to youth and the chance to develop life- time brand loyalty . 63Despite increased pub - lic attention to food in schools and to the eroding quality of diets among youth, manyschools hesitate to restrict competitive foodfor fear of losing income. In August 2005, in response to growing pres- sure from parents and public health advo-cates, the American Beverage Association an - nounced voluntary restrictions on sales of soft drinks in elementary and middle schools.The companies will encourage school dis - tricts and bottlers to provide only bottled water and 100 percent juice in elementaryschools and to provide lower -calorie bever- ages in middle schools until after school. But because the new policy will apply only to newcontracts, it will take several years to phase high-calorie beverages out of elementary and middle schools. 64And high schools, which have many more vending machines, will beunaffected. Public discomfort with the school food envi- ronment is growing. The question is whether schools can provide more healthful food op- tions without losing sales revenue. 65Evi- dence about how reducing the sale of un- healthful foods and beverages or offering more healthful options would affect revenueis limited. But some studies have found thatschool food service staff reported no loss of revenue when they offered students more healthful \u00e0 la carte choices. 66And schools in Maine, California, Minnesota, and Pennsyl-vania replaced soft drinks with more health-ful beverages without losing revenue. 67 Surprisingly few national data are available on schools' income from vending machines.68 A 2003 Texas Department of Agriculture sur- vey found that total annual revenue fromvending contracts for all 1,256 state schoolswas about $54 million. 69It also found that food service departments lose $60 million ayear in federal reimbursable meal sales tocompetitive foods, resulting in a net loss.During the 2001-02 school year, the totaldeficit for Texas school food service opera-tions was $23.7 million, which had to be sub - sidized from other district sources. Because many schools generate substantial revenue through competitive food sales,making changes entails financial risks. 70 Some school districts, however , have taken steps to mitigate potential revenue changes, such as substituting healthful foods for lesshealthful ones instead of removing all com - petitive foods, getting students involved in promoting healthful foods, using marketingThe Role of Schools in Obesity Prevention VOL. 16 / NO. 1 / SPRING 2006 11706 5562 story-school.qxp 1/22/2006 12:54 PM Page 117The message from Making It Happen! is that, given the opportunity, students will buy andconsume healthy foods and beverages and,more important, that schools can maintain aprofitable bottom line at the same time. Of the seventeen schools and school districts that reported income data, twelve increasedrevenue and four reported no change. The School Physical Activity Environment Schools are unique in their ability to promote physical activity and increase energy expendi-ture\u2014and thereby help reduce childhoodobesity. 75A comprehensive school physical activity program should consist of PE, health education that includes information aboutphysical activity, recess time for elementaryschool students, intramural sport programsand physical activity clubs, and interscholasticsports for high school students. 76Schools can also encourage brief bouts of physical activityduring classroom time\u2014as in the MichiganDepartment of Education's Life SciencesInstitute' s \"Take 10!\"\u2014and walking and bicy- cling to school. 77 Physical education\u2014a formal, school-based educational program that uses physical activ - ity to achieve fitness, skills, health, or educa-tional goals\u2014is at the center of a comprehen-sive school-based physical activity program. 78 It is an important but undervalued curricular area that aims to help all students developthe knowledge, skills, and confidence to bephysically active both in and out of schooland throughout their lives. 79 Physical Activity Recommendations Current guidelines recommend that children engage in at least sixty minutes of physical ac - tivity on most, preferably all, days of the week.80The Institute of Medicine's Prevent-Mary Story , Karen M. Kaphingst, and Simone French 118 THE FUTURE OF CHILDRENapproaches to encourage students to make healthful choices, offering alternate means for fundraising, and implementing changes gradually or at the beginning of the schoolyear. Without support from the groups that use the revenue from competitive food sales, districts can see their policy changes cur-tailed. 71Also, getting student suggestions about what types of nutritious foods would be offered will promote acceptance. Policy implications. Federal rules governing the availability, content, and sale of competi-tive foods and setting schoolwide nutritionstandards are inadequate. 72Congress should grant the secretary of agriculture broader au- thority to regulate the availability , content, and sale of competitive foods during the school day and set nutrition standards for all foodsand beverages sold. Such actions would notonly enhance children's health and nutritionbut also protect the federal investment inchild nutrition through the national schoolmeal programs. 73Limiting the sale of compet- itive foods during school meals would increaseparticipation in school meals and help ensurethat children receive a nutritious meal. Model School Nutrition Programs Advocates, administrators, parents, educators, and health professionals across the countryare promoting grassroots nutrition initiatives.Making It Happen! School Nutrition SuccessStories showcases thirty-two schools that are offering and selling more nutritious foods andbeverages. The schools carried out their re - forms by setting nutrition standards for com- petitive foods, changing food and beveragecontracts, making more healthful foods andbeverages available, using marketing tech-niques to promote healthful choices, limitingaccess to competitive foods, and using fund-raising activities and rewards that supportrather than undermine student health. 7406 5562 story-school.qxp 1/22/2006 12:54 PM Page 118ing Childhood Obesity: Health in the Balance report recommends at least thirty minutes of activity during each school day.81The Na- tional Association for Sport and Physical Ed-ucation recommends 150 minutes a week of PE for elementary school children and 225 minutes a week for middle- and secondary-school children. 82Nationally, only 8 percent of elementary schools and 6 percent of mid- dle schools and high schools meet these rec-ommendations. 83 Physical Education Classes and Barriers to Expanding PE Physical education requirements decline drastically as a student's grade level increases. The share of schools requiring PE drops fromaround 50 percent for grades 1 through 5, to25 percent in grade 8, to only 5 percent ingrade 12. 84Although the share of high school students enrolled in PE classes appears tohave increased from 1991 to 2003 (49 percentto 56 percent), the share of students attendingPE daily fell from 42 percent to 28 percent. 85 The quality of PE classes is also crucial to their effect on child and adolescent over - weight. Only a third of adolescents were phys- ically active in PE class for more than twentyminutes three to five days a week. 86 Schools must fit many subjects and activities into the school day and must balance stateand local resources, priorities, and needs foreducation. In recent years, however, thecomprehensive curriculum has been eroding,especially in the wake of the federal No ChildLeft Behind Act of 2001, which focuses onstudent achievement in defined core aca-demic subjects. 87As states develop or select standardized tests to hold schools and stu-dents accountable, content that is not tested,such as physical education, has become alower priority. 88But, as noted, time devoted to physical education does not lessen per-formance in other areas and can in fact en- hance both students' readiness to learn and academic achievement.89 Recess Unstructured physical activity during recess allows children to have choices, develop rulesfor play, release energy and stress, and use skills developed in physical education. 90It may also help in the classroom. Uninter-rupted instructional time may cause attention spans to wane as restless children have diffi- culty concentrating on specific classroomtasks. One study found that fourth-gradershad concentration problems on days without recess. 91 The SHPPS 2000 survey found that 29 per- cent of elementary schools schedule no re-cess for students in kindergarten throughfifth grade. 92The National Association for Sport and Physical Education, by contrast,recommends that schools provide supervised,daily recess for students up to grades 5 or 6;that, if possible, recess not be scheduledback-to-back with physical education classes;that recess be viewed not as a reward but as anecessary educational support; that studentsnot be denied recess to punish misbehavioror to make up work; and that recess comple - ment, not substitute for, structured PE. 93 Extracurricular Programs Interscholastic sports programs, intramural activities, and physical activity clubs alsokeep children active in school. Intramuralsports and clubs offer students with a widerange of abilities opportunities to engage inphysical activity . But only 49 percent of schools offer intramural sports and sports clubs, and only 22 percent provide trans-portation home for students who participatein interscholastic sports, a problem for lower-income students who may need transporta-The Role of Schools in Obesity Prevention VOL. 16 / NO. 1 / SPRING 2006 11906 5562 story-school.qxp 1/22/2006 12:54 PM Page 119tion.94To help prevent obesity, the Institute of Medicine calls for partnerships between schools and public and private sectors to en- hance funding and opportunities for intramu-ral sports and other activities in school and after-school programs. 95 Health Curriculum Health education is an essential part of a co- ordinated school health program, as recom-mended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. By highlighting the impor- tance of both nutrition and physical activity,health education can help students adopt andmaintain physically active and healthful- eating lifestyles. 96Key elements of health ed- ucation include a planned and sequential ed - ucational program for students in grades K-12; behavioral skills development; instruc-tional time at each grade level; instructionfrom qualified teachers; involvement of par-ents, health professionals, and other commu-nity members; and periodic curriculum eval - uation and updating. 97Research supports the effectiveness of behavioral-oriented curricu - lums in promoting healthful food choices and physical activity.98To maximize classroom time, nutrition and physical activity instruc - tion could also be integrated into the lesson plans of other school subjects, such as math,biology, and the language arts. Only six states do not require schools to pro - vide health education. 99Nearly 70 percent of states require health education curriculumsto include instruction on nutrition and di - etary behavior, and some 62 percent require content on physical activity and fitness. 100 But health education teachers at all levels av - erage only about five hours a year teaching about the former and four hours a year aboutthe latter\u2014not nearly enough to affect chil - dren's behavior. 101Competing time demands, a lack of resources, and the increased focuson meeting state academic standards all chip away at teaching time.102Integrating health education into the existing curriculum is one way to overcome these problems. School Health Services School health services can play a central role in addressing obesity-related issues among students by providing screening, health infor- mation, and referrals to students. Servicesand settings vary widely, ranging from tradi- tional, school-based basic core services to comprehensive primary care either in school-based health centers or in off-campus healthcenters. 103 School-based health centers offer students primary care, including diagnostic and treat-ment services. 104Their number is growing rapidly , from some 200 in 1990 to about 1,500 today.105A 2002 national survey found 61 percent of the centers in urban settings,37 percent in elementary schools, and 36 per - cent in high schools. More than half of the students in schools with such health centersare African American or Hispanic. 106The centers are typically open twenty-nine hoursa week, and 39 percent are open during thesummer. Survey participants cited nutritionas their most important prevention-relatedservice. 107The centers are an untapped re- source for preventing obesity, because thestudents they serve are at high risk of obesity , tend to be underinsured, and may not receive health services elsewhere. 108 Height, weight, and BMI screening and re- porting. School health services are an ideal way to collect height, weight, or body massindex (BMI) information about children.These measurements are traditionally takenin a physician' s office, and some observers think they should not be taken in schools. 109 But an estimated 9.2 million U.S. childrenMary Story , Karen M. Kaphingst, and Simone French 120 THE FUTURE OF CHILDREN06 5562 story-school.qxp 1/22/2006 12:54 PM Page 120and youth lack health insurance and there- fore may not get regular medical care.110Be- cause nearly all children attend school, thesepreventive screening measures would beavailable to all families at no cost. And col- lecting height and weight measures is already an established practice in schools. In 2000,26 percent of states required schools to screen students for height and weight or body mass; of these, 61 percent requiredthem to notify parents of the results. Among school districts, 38 percent required such screening, of which 81 percent requiredparental notification. 111Taking these meas- ures annually and converting them to an age- and gender-specific BMI percentile for each child makes it possible to monitor individualchildren over time. It also provides an oppor-tunity for early intervention in obesity pre-vention. A newer strategy is parental notification by health \"report cards.\" 112Family involvement in obesity interventions is considered inte-gral, and sharing children' s weight through report cards may help raise family awareness of children's weight status and health risk. 113 Concerns about this practice include privacy issues, the problem of labeling and stigmatiz-ing certain children, risks that parents willplace children on diets without consulting aphysician, and risks of causing eating disor-ders. 114Some also question whether BMI re - porting can be effective if a school has an un- healthful food environment and lacks a goodPE program. 115 The Institute of Medicine endorses BMI re- porting. It also recommends that schoolsmeasure each student's weight, height, andgender- and age-specific BMI percentileeach year and make the information availableto parents and also to the students when age-appropriate. 116The institute acknowledgesconcerns about BMI reporting and empha- sizes that student data must be collected and reported validly and appropriately, with at- tention to privacy concerns and with informa-tion on referrals available if follow-up health services are needed. Three school districts\u2014Cambridge, Massa- chusetts; Pennsylvania; and school-based BMI reporting measures. 117They send home each year a health report that includes the child's BMI percentage and a descriptionof his or her risk category . The first study of this school-based practice, conducted with el- ementary school children and their parents inCambridge, was promising. 118Parents of overweight children who received health re-ports were more aware of their child' s weight status and were more likely to consider look- ing into medical help, dieting, and physicalactivities for their child than parents who re - ceived general or no health information. Arkansas also recently created a comprehen - sive program to combat childhood obesity. Major provisions include: conducting annualBMI screenings for all public school stu - dents, with results reported to parents; re- stricting access to vending machines in publicThe Role of Schools in Obesity Prevention VOL. 16 / NO. 1 / SPRING 2006 121School health services can play a central role inaddressing obesity-relatedissues among students byproviding screening, healthinformation, and PM Page 121elementary schools; disclosing schools' con- tracts with food and beverage companies; creating district advisory committees made up of parents, teachers, and local communityleaders; and establishing a Child Health Ad- visory Committee to recommend additional physical activity and nutrition standards forpublic schools. 119In 2004 Illinois required the state's Department of Health to collect height and weight measurements as part ofthe mandatory health exam for students. In 2005 West Virginia, Tennessee, and New York enacted legislation requiring studentBMI reports. 120 Schools as Work Sites Schools are one of the nation' s largest em - ployers, with approximately 4 percent of the total U.S. workforce.121In 2001, nearly 6 mil- lion teachers and staff worked in the publicschool system. 122The school setting thus holds great promise for their health promo-tion. Built-in advantages in this setting in - clude fitness facilities, food service person- nel, nursing and counseling staff, and healthand physical education staff. 123Work site health promotion could encourage staff and teachers to value nutrition and physical activ - ity more highly and to heighten their com- mitment to adopting and implementing re - lated programs for their students.124Faculty and staff who practice health-promotingbehaviors could also be role models forstudents. 125 Work site health promotion for faculty and staff is also part of the coordinated school health program recommended by the Cen-ters for Disease Control and Prevention(CDC). It can include health screenings,health education, employee assistance pro-grams, and health care. 126But school districts lag behind other major employers in offeringwork site programs. 127In schools, as in otherMary Story , Karen M. Kaphingst, and Simone French 122 THE FUTURE OF CHILDRENwork sites, successful programs require an in- volved, committed, and supportive adminis-tration. 128 The SHPPS 2000 survey provides the first comprehensive data on work site pro- grams.129Not one state requires districts or schools to fund or sponsor nutrition and di- etary counseling, physical activity and fitness counseling, or programs such as walking orjogging clubs for teachers and staff. More districts and schools should implement or strengthen work site health promotion. Andresearchers should seek out interventionsconducted in these settings to identify and replicate best practices. 130 State and Local School Nutrition and Physical Activity Policies While in many respects inadequate them - selves, especially regarding competitive foods, USDA nutrition regulations permitstate agencies and local school food authori - ties to impose additional restrictions on all food and beverage sales at any time inschools participating in the federal schoolmeal programs. In recent years, many states,local school districts, and individual schoolshave taken up the challenge. States are alsobecoming more active in promoting physicalactivity. Twenty-three states have adopted additional restrictions, including policies that limit the times or types of competitive foods availablefor sale in vending machines, cafeterias, andschool stores and snack bars. 131Most states restrict access to competitive foods whenschool meals are being served. Five restrictaccess all day long. 132During the first six months of 2005, forty states introduced some200 bills that provide nutritional guidance forschools.

Students at schools with open-campus policies during lunchtime were significantly more likely to eat lunch at a fast-food restaurant than students at schools with closed-campus policies. These findings sug- gest that school food policies that decrease ac-cess to foods high in fats and sugars are asso- ciated with less frequent consumption of these items during the school day. The T rust for America' s Health recently ex - amined state statutes and administrative codes for physical activity policies. 137Only two states, South Dakota and Oklahoma,have no PE requirement for elementary andsecondary schools. T wenty-seven states re- quire PE in elementary, middle, and highschool. Two states, Arizona and Mississippi,have no PE requirement for high school, andtwenty-seven require only one-half credit orone credit of PE for graduation. Illinois is theonly state that requires daily PE in everygrade, although its duration is not specified.State requirements, however, are often notenforced. Amidst many other mandated cur - riculum requirements and tight school bud- gets, PE is often viewed as a low priority. 138 Moreover, the SHPPS 2000 nationwide sur- vey found that 17 percent of elementaryThe Role of Schools in Obesity Prevention VOL. 16 / NO. 1 / SPRING 2006 123New Mexico, South Carolina, Texas, and West Virginia\u2014mandated nutritional stan-dards for competitive foods. 133See the leg- islative activity box for highlights of nutrition-and physical activity-related legislation en- acted during the first half of 2005. Several school districts have also taken ac- tion. More than half of the nation's ten largest school districts restrict competitive foods be-yond federal and state regulations. The New York City Public School District, the nation's largest, eliminated candy, soda, and othersnack foods from all vending machines start-ing in fall 2003. Vending machines on school grounds can sell only water, low-fat snacks, and 100 percent fruit juices. 134The Los An - geles Unified School District passed a soda vending ban that went into effect in January2004. A further ban on fried chips, candy , and other snack foods in school vending ma- chines and stores went into effect in July2004. 135The Chicago public schools an - nounced in 2004 a plan to ban soft drinks, candy , and high-fat snacks from school vend - ing machines and to replace them with more healthful offerings.

It also prohibits foodsof minimal nutritional value from being sold or served during the school day at any elementary,middle, or junior high school campus. Finally the law forbids school administrators from signingfood and beverage contracts that include the sale of sugared, carbonated beverages and all otherfoods of minimal nutritional value on elementary and middle or junior high school campuses. In Kentucky the Board of Education must issue regulations that set minimum nutrition standards for all foods and beverages that are sold outside the National School Breakfast and NationalSchool Lunch Programs. State legislators also banned the sale of competitive foods and bever-ages, except those sold \u00e0 la carte, from the first student's arrival at the school building until thirtyminutes after the last lunch period. They allow only \"school day-approved beverages\"\u2014defined aswater, 100 percent fruit juice, low-fat milk, and any other beverage containing no more than 10grams of sugar per serving\u2014to be sold in elementary school vending machines, school stores,canteens, or fundraisers during the school day. The state will assess financial penalties for schoolsthat violate the new state requirements. Maine's legislators have asked the DOE to work with public schools to encourage nutrition educa- tion as part of a coordinated school health program. The law requires schools' food service pro - grams to post caloric information for prepackaged \u00e0 la carte items made available for purchase.In addition, the DOE must adopt policies that establish nutritional standards for food and bever - age items sold outside the federal meal program. The standards must include maximum portionsizes that are consistent with the single-serving standards established by the Food and Drug Ad-ministration. It also establishes a pilot program to install vending machines that sell only flavoredor unflavored milk, containing no more than 1 percent fat. Finally it mandates the DOE, in collab-oration with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Resources, to implement the NationalFarm to School Program. This program will provide locally grown fruits and vegetables to publicschools. West Virginia now prohibits the sale of soft drinks through vending machines, school stores, or on- site fundraisers during the school day in areas accessible to students in elementary and middle orjunior high schools. During the school day, these schools are permitted to sell only \"healthy bev-erages,\" defined as water, 100 percent fruit and vegetable juice, low-fat milk, and other juice bev-erages with at least 20 percent real juice. F or high schools that permit the sale of soft drinks, the law also requires that \"healthy beverages\" must account for at least 50 percent of the total bev- erages offered and must be located near the vending machines containing soft drinks. Physical Education and Physical Activity Legislation In Kentucky each school council with grades K through 5 must develop and implement a wellness policy that includes moderate to vigorous physical activity each day . It may allow physical activity up to thirty minutes a day or 150 minutes a week to be part of instructional time. Legislators also06 5562 story-school.qxp 1/22/2006 12:54 PM Page 124schools, 25 percent of middle and junior high schools, and 40 percent of high schools ex-empt from required PE courses those stu-dents who participate in community orschool sports or in other school activities orwho have high physical competency testscores. 139And few states and districts require skill performance tests, fitness tests, or writ-ten knowledge tests.Recent legislative activity , however , as seen in the legislative activity box, demonstrates promising attention to this area of children'sdevelopment. Several states are encouraging,not mandating, state and local education offi-cials to enhance PE and physical activity inschools. During the first half of 2005, sixstates\u2014North Dakota, Montana, Utah, Col-orado, Tennessee, and Washington\u2014adoptedThe Role of Schools in Obesity Prevention VOL. 16 / NO. 1 / SPRING 2006 125mandated the state Board of Education to develop a physical activity environment assessment tool for school districts. A new South Carolina law requires 150 minutes a week of physical education and physical activ- ity for students in grades K through 5 beginning in the 2006-07 academic year. It sets student-to-certified physical education teacher ratios for elementary schools to be phased in from 700:1for the 2006-07 academic year to 600:1 for the 2007-08 academic year and to 500:1 for the2008-09 academic year. As the ratio is phased in, the amount of time in PE must increase froma minimum of sixty minutes a week to a minimum of ninety minutes a week, scheduled every dayor on alternate days. Each elementary school must also appoint a physical education teacher toserve as its PE activity director to coordinate additional physical activity outside of PE instructiontimes. In addition, the DOE must provide each school district with a coordinated school healthmodel while each school district must establish and maintain a Coordinated School Health Advi-sory Council to develop, implement, and evaluate a school wellness policy. Texas legislators authorized the state Board of Education to extend its policy requiring elementary school students to engage in 30 minutes of physical activity a day or 135 minutes a week to applyto middle and junior high school students as well. Their legislation calls for health education toemphasize the importance of proper nutrition and exercise and adds reporting requirements forstatistics and data related to student health and physical activity. It also establishes a state-levelSchool Health Advisory Committee within the Department of State Health Services to provide as-sistance in developing and supporting coordinated school health programs and school healthservices. In West Virginia each student in grades K through 5 must participate in at least thirty minutes of physical education, including physical exercise, at least three days a week. Students in grades 6through 8 must participate in at least one full period of PE, including physical exercise, every dayfor one semester of the academic year. Those students in grades 9 through 12 must take at leastone full PE course, including physical exercise, for high school graduation and be given the oppor - tunity to enroll in an elective lifetime physical education course. In addition, the state Board of Ed - ucation must establish a program within the existing health and PE program that incorporates fit-ness testing, reporting, recognition and fitness events, and incentive programs. The program willtest cardiovascular fitness, muscular strength and endurance, flexibility, and body composition.

School-based obe - sity-prevention interventions have also shown some success in changing eating and physicalactivity behaviors but have been less effectivein changing body weight or body fatness. 144A recent report by the T ask Force on Commu- nity Preventive Services concluded that in-sufficient evidence existed to determine theeffectiveness of combined nutrition andphysical activity interventions to prevent orreduce obesity in school settings. The limitednumber of qualifying studies, for example,report noncomparable outcomes. 145 In one such study , T. N.

Federal Policy Initiatives The most recent federal policy initiatives for preventing childhood obesity are found in the Child Nutrition and Women, Infants, andChildren (WIC) Reauthorization Act of 2004, which requires each school district that par - ticipates in the federal school meal program to enact a wellness policy by the day the2006-2007 school year opens. School dis - tricts must set goals for nutrition education and physical activity , write nutrition guide- lines for all foods available at school, ensurethat school meal guidelines are not less re-strictive than federal requirements, and eval - uate how well the new policy is implemented. Parents, students, the school food service,and school administrators must be involvedin developing the new policy. The Food Re-search and Action Center and the NationalAlliance for Nutrition and Activity are devel - oping information and guidelines to assist states and school districts. The Child Nutrition and WIC Reauthoriza- tion Act also expanded a USDA pilot pro-Several interventions have shown that the availability,promotion, and pricing offoods in schools can bechanged to support more healthful food choices.06 5562 story-school.qxp 1/22/2006 12:54 PM Page 126increase physical activity and healthful eating among students, decreased obesity among girls but not boys.147A third intervention, which reduced soft drink consumption inEngland, lowered the number of overweight and obese children aged seven to eleven. 148 Several interventions have changed food en- vironments in schools, reducing the fat con- tent of school lunches and modifying theprices of fruits and vegetables in the school cafeteria and in vending machines. 149They have shown that the availability, promotion,and pricing of foods in schools can bechanged to support more healthful food choices. Interventions are just beginning to target the availability of competitive foodsand beverages. Little research has been doneon the effects of school, district, or state pol-icy changes regarding the school food envi - ronment or changes in student dietary out- comes or in body mass indexes. Studies have also shown that school PE classes can be changed to make them muchmore active and increase the time spent inPE and in moderate to vigorous activity. 150 One recent analysis found that an extra hour of PE per week in first grade (compared withtime spent in PE in kindergarten) loweredBMI in girls who had been overweight or atrisk for overweight in kindergarten. 151No ef- fect was seen in boys. Interventions to in - crease energy expenditure through increased physical activity and decreased consumptionof high-calorie, low-nutrition foods offerpromising strategies for preventing obesity. The few existing school-based obesity- prevention studies suggest that interventionshold promise. 152For future studies, re- searchers should strengthen interventionsand should target the school environment,the home environment, and student and par-The Role of Schools in Obesity Prevention VOL. 16 / NO. 1 / SPRING 2006 127ent behaviors.153Interventions could modify the home environment by installing devices to monitor television time or by increasing the availability of healthful foods and limitingenergy-dense, low-nutrition foods. School environment changes could include more frequent required PE classes, more interest-ing and fun physical education choices, and school-wide guidelines about food and bever- age availability and sales. 154 Research can also help reveal whether spe- cific forms of interventions have different ef-fects on children of different age, gender, orethnic groups. For example, targeting partic- ular behaviors may be more successful with one age group than with another . Younger children may respond better to reducing tele- vision viewing while adolescents may benefitfrom more structured and diverse PE oppor - tunities. Changing \u00e0 la carte and vending ma- chine food and beverage availability may bemore effective for high school students thanfor elementary school students. More re-search is also needed to identify obesity pre - vention' s most potent behavioral targets, such as limiting screen time, sugar-sweetened bev- erages, and portion sizes. School Links with Communities and Families Although most physical activity and nutrition programs directed at youth are conducted inschool, communities can also provide impor-tant resources. And family involvement isoften crucial. Farm-to-School Programs and School Gardens Some schools are offering new farm-to- school programs that link local farmers withschool cafeterias. The programs providehigh-quality local produce, support locallybased agriculture, and often directly connect06 5562 story-school.qxp 1/22/2006 12:54 PM Page 127farmers and children with reciprocal visits. Some schools also sponsor gardening pro-grams. The Martin Luther King Junior Mid-dle School in Berkeley, California, offers theEdible Schoolyard, a nonprofit program that allows students to participate in all aspects of organic gardening and cooking, from seed totable. 155Such hands-on experience may en- courage children to eat more healthfully. A recent study at three schools in California ex-amined fourth graders' knowledge of nutri- tion and their preference for certain vegeta- bles. 156Students at one school received nutrition education, those at a second schoolreceived nutrition education and planted and harvested a vegetable garden, and those at a third served as a control group. Children whoreceived nutrition education alone and thosewho received nutrition education combinedwith gardening had much higher scores thanthe control group. Children who gardenedalso increased their preferences for certainvegetables. Walking and Biking to School In recent decades, dramatically fewer chil - dren have been walking or biking to school. In 1969, 48 percent of students walked orbiked to school. By 2001, less than 15 percentof students aged five to fifteen walked to orfrom school, and just 1 percent biked. 157 Today roughly one-third of students ride a school bus, and half are driven in a privatevehicle. 158Because the trip to and from school happens daily, active commuting(walking or biking) can provide substantialcaloric expenditures over the school year. 159 One study used accelerometers, small elec- tronic devices worn around the waist thatcapture minute-by-minute recordings of ac-tivity level, to measure physical activityamong fourteen- to sixteen-year -old students. It found that boys who walked to school ex- pended forty-four more calories a day andgirls expended thirty-three more calories a day than did their peers who were driven. 160 Projected over the course of a school year, or 200 days, this additional physical activitycould account for a two- to three-pound dif- ference between those who walk to school and those who do not, all other things heldconstant. To examine why most children do not walk or bike to school, the CDC analyzed data from the annual national HealthStyles Survey. 161 Households with children aged five to eight- een were asked if their children walked orbiked to school and about any barriers they faced in doing so. Reported barriers included long distances (55 percent), traffic danger (40percent), bad weather (24 percent), crime(18 percent), opposing school policy (7 per-cent), and other reasons (26 percent). Sixteenpercent of respondents reported no barriers;notably, within this group, 64 percent re-ported children walking and 21 percent re - ported children biking to or from school at least once a week in the preceding month. One major cause of active commuting's de- cline is the trend toward constructing schoolsaway from the center of communities. 162Stu- dents with shorter walk and bike times toschool are more likely to walk and bike. Re-cent nationwide trends toward bigger schoolshave also led to the decline of the \"neighbor - hood\" school. Since World War II, the num- ber of schools has declined 70 percent, whilethe average size has grown fivefold. T oday, however, communities are increasingly con- cerned about school siting decisions as theyrelate to children' s health and overweight sta - tus. Communities, families, school districts, and governments at all levels have begun mo-bilizing to facilitate active commuting by im - proving pedestrian and biking safety, adding bike racks and crossing guards, mapping safeMary Story , Karen M. Kaphingst, and Simone French 128 THE FUTURE OF CHILDREN06 5562 story-school.qxp 1/22/2006 12:54 PM Page 128routes to schools, building new schools or renovating older schools in residential neigh-borhoods, and forming such programs as theWalking School Bus, Bike Trains, Safe Routeto School, National Walk Our Children to School Day, and the federal Kids Walk-to- School Campaign. 163Programs that involve adult volunteers\u2014such as the Walking School Bus, which organizes neighborhood chaperones to supervise children as they walkto school\u2014also increase physical activity among adults. 164 After-School Programs After-school programs in child care centers, schools, and community centers also offer opportunities to implement obesity-preven - tion strategies. The 1990s saw a substantial increase in after-school programs servingchildren of low-income families. 165One of the best known is the federally funded 21stCentury Community Learning Centers, aschool-based after -school program providing academic enrichment and youth develop- ment opportunities. Federal funding grewfrom $40 million in 1997 to almost $1 billionin 2005. In 2001, 1.2 million elementary andmiddle school students in 3,600 schools par - ticipated. 166Implementing obesity-preven- tion strategies in the 21st Century Commu - nity Learning Centers would not only reachmany young people directly but also offer amodel for other such programs. A recent survey found that most after-school programs do not address physical activity andhealthful eating, and that staff at many after-school programs are untrained. 167But some programs are leading the way . For example, the Girls Health Enrichment Multi-Site Studies (GEMS) program aimed to preventobesity among eight- to ten-year -old African American girls. In a set of four pilot interven- tions, girls and their parents were recruitedthrough schools and other community chan- nels to participate in after-school programs,such as ethnic dance, that targeted healthfuleating, physical activity, and reduced televi-sion viewing. 168The results of the GEMS pilot interventions were promising, demon- strating the feasibility and potential effective-ness of incorporating obesity-prevention ef- forts into after-school programs. Federal funds are available to provide after- school snacks to children up to age eighteen in after -school programs operated by schools, nonprofit organizations, and public agencies. Both the federal school lunch program andthe Child and Adult Care Food Program(CACFP) offer cash reimbursements to after - school programs for snacks. Subsidies vary bythe child's family income, as they do forbreakfasts and lunches. Subsidies are pro - vided with CACFP funds to provide free snacks in programs located in areas where 50percent or more of the children enrolled inschool are eligible for free or reduced-pricedschool meals. Participation in the after-schoolsnack program has increased dramatically , from some 645,000 children in 1999 to about 1.2 million in 2003. 169Reimbursable snacks must follow the CACFP' s snack require- ments, but more research is needed to assess the nutritional value of the snack foods beingThe Role of Schools in Obesity Prevention VOL. 16 / NO. 1 / SPRING 2006 129A recent survey found that most after-school programs donot address physical activityand healthful eating, 5562 story-school.qxp 1/22/2006 12:54 PM Page 129offered and to find ways to serve more fruits and vegetables. Congress has recently allowed after-school programs in seven states\u2014Delaware, Illi- nois, Michigan, Missouri, New York, Ore- gon, and Pennsylvania\u2014to serve suppers aswell as snacks to children in areas where more than 50 percent of the children qualify for free or reduced-price school meals. 170 Some low-income children may thus eat three meals and a snack every weekday dur- ing the school year from federal food pro-grams\u2014a fact that highlights both the grow-ing importance of the federal child nutrition programs for children in low-income families and the need to ensure that the foods theseprograms serve are consistent with the rec-ommendations in the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. Family Involvement Parents and caregivers provide the primary social environment in which children formattitudes and behaviors regarding eating andphysical activity . Parents create an environ- ment conducive to active or sedentary lifestyles, they select foods brought into thehome, they determine how often and whattypes of meals are eaten outside the home,and they model eating and physical activitybehaviors. Thus, to achieve maximal andsustained behavior change, parents andcaregivers must be involved in obesityprevention. Reviews of efforts to prevent youth high-risk behaviors, such as school failure, aggressivebehaviors, and substance abuse, have foundthat combined school and family programsdeliver more benefits than those managedseparately . 171Most obesity-prevention pro - grams, however, have focused almost exclu- sively on school programs. Actively involvingparents is not always easy, but some programs that included families achieved high rates of recruitment and retention (around 80 per- cent) by using such incentives as food, childcare, transportation, and rewards for home- work completion or attendance. 172Commu- nity organizations and other local resourcescan also help schools connect with low- income and minority parents. 173One creative and effective way to involve parents is tomake school gyms and swimming pools avail- able to students and their families after school and on weekends. Recommendations for Schools Schools can become one of the nation's most effective weapons in the fight against obesityby creating an environment that is conduciveto healthful eating and physical activity.Health and success in school are interrelated;schools cannot achieve their primary educa-tional mission if their students and staff arenot healthy and physically , mentally, and so- cially fit. Each school can follow ten key strategies, taken from CDC guidelines for itscoordinated school health program, to pro - mote lifelong physical activity and healthful eating for its population: \u2014address physical activity and nutrition through a Coordinated School Health Pro-gram approach, \u2014designate a school health coordinator and maintain an active school health council, \u2014assess the school's health policies and pro- grams and develop a plan for improvement, \u2014strengthen the school's nutrition and phys- ical activity policies, promo- school staff,Mary Story , Karen M. Kaphingst, and Simone French 130 THE FUTURE OF CHILDREN06 5562 story-school.qxp 1/22/2006 12:54 PM Page 130\u2014carry out a high-quality course of study in health education, \u2014implement a high-quality PE course,\u2014increase opportunities for students to en- gage in physical activity, \u2014offer a quality school meals program, and \u2014ensure that students have appealing, healthful choices in foods and beverages of- fered outside of the school meals program. 174 The Institute of Medicine report, Preventing Childhood Obesity: Health in the Balance , also offers comprehensive recommendationsregarding school efforts to advance obesityprevention and outlines immediate stepsschools can take to improve healthful eatingand physical activity. 175Among those steps are improving the nutritional quality of foodsand beverages served and sold in schools andas part of school-related activities, increasingopportunities for physical activity during andafter school, implementing school-based in - terventions to reduce children's screen time, and developing, implementing, and evaluat - ing innovative pilot programs for both staffing and teaching about wellness, health - ful eating, and physical activity.Conclusion Research consistently shows that the diets of most U.S. children fail to meet national nutri- tion guidelines. Nor do most U.S. childrenget the recommended levels of daily physical activity. As a result, today a larger share of the nation's children is overweight than at anytime in history. The prevalence of obesity, having increased dramatically over the past forty years, now threatens the immediate andlong-term health of children and youth. With more than 54 million children in atten- dance daily, the nations' schools offer manyopportunities for developing strategies to prevent childhood obesity. Children spend roughly a third of every weekday in school.While they are there, they can consume up totwo meals, sometimes even three, plussnacks. They have many different avenues forrecreation and physical activity. They alsotake courses in health education and receivehealth services of various kinds at school. Ifschools can work together with policymakers,advocates, parents, and communities to cre - ate an environment where children eat healthfully, become physically fit, and de-velop lifelong habits that contribute to well - ness, the nation will be well on its way to pre- venting obesity .The Role of Schools in Obesity Prevention VOL. 16 / NO. 1 / SPRING 2006 13106 5562 story-school.qxp 1/22/2006 12:54 PM Page 131Mary Story , Karen M.

Kaphingst, and Simone French Summary Mary Story, Karen Kaphingst, and Simone French argue that researchers and policymakers fo- cused on childhood obesity have paid insufficient attention to child care. Although child caresettings can be a major force in shaping children's dietary intake, physical activity, and energy balance\u2014and thus in combating the childhood obesity epidemic\u2014researchers know relatively little about either the nutrition or the physical activity environment in the nation' s child care fa - cilities. What research exists suggests that the nutritional quality of meals and snacks may be poor and activity levels may be inadequate. Few uniform standards apply to nutrition or physical activity offerings in the nation's child care centers. With the exception of the federal Head Start program, child care facilities are regu-lated by states, and state rules vary widely . The authors argue that weak state standards govern- ing physical activity and nutrition represent a missed opportunity to combat obesity. A rela- tively simple measure, such as specifying how much time children in day care should spendbeing physically active, could help promote healthful habits among young children. The authors note that several federal programs provide for the needs of low-income children in child care. The Child and Adult Care Food Program, administered by the Department of Agri-culture, provides funds for meals and snacks for almost 3 million children in child care eachday. Providers who receive funds must serve meals and snacks that meet certain minimal stan-dards, but the authors argue for toughening those regulations so that meals and snacks meetspecific nutrient-based standards. The authors cite Head Start, a federal preschool programserving some 900,000 low-income infants and children up to age five, as a model for other childcare programs as it has federal performance standards for nutrition. Although many child care settings fall short in their nutritional and physical activity offerings, they offer untapped opportunities for developing and evaluating effective obesity-preventionstrategies to reach both children and their parents.

Among pre-school children aged two to five, overweight has doubled over the past thirty years. Almost one in every fourpreschoolers is either overweight or at risk of overweight. 1Prevalence rates are highest among African American, Hispanic, and Na-tive American preschoolers. Of the nation's 21 million preschool children, 13 million spend a substantial part of theirday in child care facilities. 2Although much has been written on the role of schools in obesity prevention, surprisingly little hasbeen written on how child care settings canhelp combat childhood obesity. With so manypreschool children in attendance, child caresettings can be a major force in shaping chil-dren's dietary intake, physical activity, andenergy balance. Changing T rends in Maternal Employment Reliance on child care has grown rapidly in the United States over the past three decadesbecause of changes in demographics, familystructure, gender roles, and families' needsfor economic security. Traditionally, the num-ber of women in the workforce has driven thedemand for child care. 3From 1970 to 2000, the share of mothers in the labor force (ei-ther employed or looking for work) rose from38 percent to 68 percent; for mothers of chil - dren up to age three the rate rose from 24 percent to 57 percent. 4Today 60 percent of mothers with preschool-aged children areemployed, with 70 percent working full-timeand 30 percent part-time. Of women withchildren aged six to seventeen, 75 percent areemployed; 78 percent work full-time and 22percent, part-time. 5Mandatory work re-quirements under the 1996 welfare reform law increased the number of low-income par-ents who work and the number of their chil-dren who receive child care. 6 Child Care Settings Child care participation in the United States is at an all-time high. Child care, in fact, is now the norm. Parents and child care providers are sharing responsibility for alarge and growing number of children during important developmental years, making child care an important setting in which to addressthe problem of obesity. Child Care Supply and Participation According to a study sponsored by the Na - tional Child Care Association, Americans paid approximately $38 billion for licensedchild care in 2001. 7Estimates indicate the number of child care facilities in the nationincreased more than fourfold in the pastthirty years\u2014from 25,000 in 1977, to 40,000in 1987, and to more than 116,000 in 2004. 8 A precise count of child care settings is not possible for several reasons. First, facilitiesopen and close rapidly. Next, because manyfamily day care homes and some centers andpreschools are legally exempt from licensingand registration requirements, they aretherefore not on record in state child care li-censing offices. Finally, the estimated num-ber of child care facilities does not take intoaccount care provided by nannies, babysit-ters, and relatives. 9 Families choose among a variety of day care options: centers (for groups of children in anonresidential setting, such as a business,church, or school); small family child carehomes (typically for six or fewer children inthe day care provider' s home); large family, or group, child care homes (typically for seven to twelve children cared for by two providers in aMary Story , Karen M. Kaphingst, and Simone French 144 THE FUTURE 1/22/2006 (by a nonrela- tive, such as a nanny or au pair, in the familyhome); and kith and kin care (by a relative,neighbor, or friend of one family only). 10 Child Care Patterns for Preschool Children Preschool children enter care as early as six weeks of age and can be in care for as many as forty hours a week until they reach schoolage. 11Forty-one percent of preschool chil- dren are in child care for thirty-five or more hours a week. Another 25 percent are in carefor fifteen to thirty-four hours a week, while16 percent are in care for one to fourteen hours. Eighteen percent spend no time in child care. 12 Nationwide, nearly half of children younger than five with a working mother are cared forin child care centers (32 percent) and familychild care homes (16 percent). About 24 per-cent are cared for by a parent, 23 percent byanother relative and 6 percent by a nanny orbabysitter . Approximately 80 percent of chil - dren aged five and younger with employed mothers are in a child care arrangement foran average of almost forty hours a week. 13 Child care arrangements vary by race and ethnicity. The 2001 National Household Ed-ucation Survey collected information aboutthe types of child care arrangements used byfamilies. 14Some children participate in more than one type of arrangement. Up throughage six, Hispanic children are least likely toreceive child care in a center-based setting(20 percent) and most likely to be cared forby parents only (53 percent). In addition, 23percent receive in-home care by a relative,and 12 percent receive in-home care by anonrelative. African American children aremost likely to receive care in a center-basedprogram (41 percent) and least likely to beThe Role of Child Care Settings in Obesity Prevention VOL. 16 / NO. 1 / SPRING 2006 145cared for in-home by a nonrelative (14 per- cent); 34 percent are cared for in-home by a relative, and 26 percent receive parental care only. For non-Hispanic white children, simi-lar numbers receive parental care only (38 percent) and attend center-based programs (35 percent), with 20 percent receiving in-home care by a relative and 19 percent being cared for in-home by a nonrelative. The percentage of children enrolled in for- mal child care arrangements also varies by state. 15For example, in Minnesota 55 per- cent of children under age five are cared forin child care centers or family day care homes, as against 35 percent in California. State differences may be due to demographicand labor patterns, child care subsidies, andcosts and supply of child care. 16 Child Care Patterns for Children Aged Six to Fourteen A large share of school-aged children also participates in child care. Of the estimated35million U.S. children aged six to fourteen, 22 million (63 percent) have an employed mother. According to the U.S. Census Bu-reau' s Survey of Income and Program Partici - pation, the distribution of primary nonschool arrangements for these children was childcare centers (5 percent); nonrelative care, in-cluding day care homes, babysitters, and nan-nies (9 percent); organized activities (12 per - cent); parental care (37 percent); grandparent care (14 percent); care by other relatives (12percent); and self-care (12 percent). School-aged children spent a significant amount oftime in these nonschool arrangements: 63percent of children aged six to fourteen spentan average of twenty-one hours a week in thecare of someone other than a parent beforeand after school. Children in center -based care average twenty-one hours a week in that setting; those in nonrelative care, such as07 5562 story-care.qxp 1/22/2006 12:54 PM Page 145family child care homes, average nineteen hours a week.17 Racial and ethnic differences in child care participation by setting are less pronounced for school-aged children than for preschool children.18Most school-aged children rely on parent, grandparent, or other relatives' care outside of school hours (61 percent of white children, 67 percent of African American chil - dren, and 69 percent of Hispanic children). Nutrition Obesity prevention involves maintaining en - ergy balance at a healthy weight while achiev-ing overall health and meeting nutritionalneeds. T echnically , energy balance means that energy intake is equivalent to energy expendi- ture, resulting in no net weight gain or weightloss. But children must be in a slightly posi - tive energy balance to get the energy neces- sary for normal growth. In children, the goalis to promote growth and development andprevent excess weight gain. A primary obesity- prevention approach emphasizes efforts thatcan help normal-weight children maintainthat weight and help overweight children pre-vent further excess weight gain. 19Nutrition Recommendations for Young Children A high-quality diet for young children pro- vides sufficient energy and nutrients to pro-mote normal growth and development, to achieve and maintain a healthy weight, and to attain immediate and long-term health. TheInstitute of Medicine Dietary Reference In- takes provide specific daily nutrient needs of children. 20The Dietary Guidelines for Amer- icans provide science-based dietary advice to promote health and reduce the risk for obe- sity and other chronic diseases through dietand physical activity for Americans older thanage two. 21The 2005 Dietary Guidelines make five key recommendations. At least half the grains consumed by children should bewhole grains. Children aged two to eightshould drink two cups a day of fat-free orlow-fat milk or equivalent milk products.Children aged two and older should eat suffi-cient amounts of fruits and vegetables. Chil-dren aged two to three should limit their totalfat intake to 30 to 35 percent of calories, andchildren aged four and older should consumebetween 25 to 35 percent of calories from fat,with most fats coming from sources ofpolyunsaturated and monounsaturated fattyacids. Finally, children should get at leastsixty minutes of physical activity on most,preferably all, days of the week. Poor diet is a major contributor , along with physical inactivity, to the obesity epidemic. To reverse the trend toward obesity, childrenmust have access to and consume suchhealthful foods as fruits and vegetables, con-sume adequate portion sizes, limit intake offats and added sugars, and get plenty of phys - ical activity. The diets of most U.S. children do not meet the Dietary Guidelines . 22They tend to be low in fruits and vegetables, cal - cium-rich foods, and fiber and to be high in total fats, saturated and trans fats, salt, andMary Story , Karen M.

A recent study examined diet quality trends among a nationally representa-tive sample of preschool children aged threeto five between 1977 and 1998. 23Although dietary quality improved slightly over those years, total energy intake increased, as did added sugars and excess juice consumption.Consumption of grains, fruits, and vegetables improved but was still well below recom- mended levels. Diets of infants and toddlers are also of con- cern. In the Feeding Infants and ToddlersStudy, a national random sample of 3,022 in-fants and toddlers from four to twenty-four months old, energy intakes were higher than recommended, according to dietary recalldata, suggesting that many caregivers may beoverfeeding their children. 24Up to a third of children aged seven to twenty-four monthsate no vegetables or fruits on the day of thedietary recall. For fifteen- to eighteen-month-olds, the vegetable most commonlyeaten was french fries. More than 25 percentof nineteen- to twenty-four -month-olds ate french fries or fried potatoes on any day , and 44 percent consumed a sweetened bever- age. 25Although these studies did not distin - guish between foods and beverages con- sumed at home and at child care, they pointto troubling aspects of young children's diets. The overall diets of children must be im - proved. Early attention to diet would have immediate nutritional benefits, would helpprevent obesity , and could reduce chronic disease risk if healthful habits are carried into adulthood. Clearly, establishing healthful di-etary and physical activity behaviors needs tobegin in childhood. Child care settings canlay the foundations for health and create anenvironment to ensure that young childrenare offered healthful foods and regular physi-cal activity.Child Care Meals and Snacks: The Child and Adult Care Food Program The Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) provides federal funds for mealsand snacks served to children in licensedchild care homes, child care centers, HeadStart programs, after -school care programs, and homeless shelters (see table 1). The pro- gram, begun as a pilot program in 1968, be - came permanent in 1978 and is administered by the Department of Agriculture's Food andNutrition Service through grants to thestates. In most states, the state educationalagency administers the program. 26 Participation and reach. In 2004, CACFP reached almost 2 million children a day inchild care centers and Head Start programsand more than 913,000 children in familychild care homes. More than 44,000 childcare centers and 157,000 family child carehomes participated. On an average day,CACFP served meals and snacks to 2.8 mil - lion children in these settings. 27 Eligibility .

Because family child care homes tend to be very small businesses, they can participate in CACFP only if they have arecognized sponsor to serve as an intermedi- ary between them and the responsible state agency. Sponsors are responsible for recruit-ing, for determining that homes meet the CACFP eligibility criteria, for providing training and other support to family childcare providers, for monitoring homes to en - sure they comply with federal and state regu- lations, for verifying the homes' claims for re - imbursement, and for distributing the mealreimbursements to the homes. 28 Funding reimbursement is provided for up to two meals and one snack, or one meal andtwo snacks, for each child. The Departmentof Agriculture also makes available donatedagricultural commodities or cash in lieu ofcommodities. Subsidies for food served tochildren in child care centers are calculateddifferently than for those paid to family andgroup day care homes. Under CACFP regula - tions, meals and snacks served to children in child care centers, Head Start, and outside-of-school programs are reimbursed at rates based on a child's eligibility for free, reduced-price, or paid meals. 29Children in Head Start programs categorically receive free meals andsnacks, thus qualifying the Head Start center for the highest reimbursement rate. Reimbursement for meals served in day care homes is based on eligibility for Tier I rates (which targets higher levels of reimburse-ment to low-income areas, providers, or chil- dren) or lower Tier II rates (not located in a low-income area nor operated by a low-income provider). 30In 1996, welfare reform legislation changed the reimbursement struc- ture for child care homes to target benefits more specifically to homes serving low-income children. 31As a result, the number of low-income children served in CACFPhomes grew by 80 percent between 1995 and1999, and the number of meal reimburse-ments for low-income children doubled. 32A family child care provider serving five low-income children can receive about $4,000 ayear in CACFP funds. 33In fiscal year 2002, the program' s total cost, including cash and commodity subsidies, administrative costs, and a payment to states for audits and over - sight, was $1.8 billion\u2014$100 million more than the previous year' s expenditures.34 Meal pattern requirements. To be eligible for federal reimbursement, providers must servemeals and snacks that meet established mealpattern requirements modeled on the food-based menu planning guidelines in the Na - tional School Lunch Program and School Breakfast Program. The meal patterns spec-ify foods to be offered at each meal and snackas well as minimum portion sizes, which varyby age. 35The four food categories are: milk; vegetables, fruit, or 100 percent juice; grainsor breads; and meat and meat alternates.Fluid milk must be served at all meals andMary Story , Karen M.

Program standards include meal pattern require- ments for children in defined age groups: one to two years, three to five years, and six to twelve years. The program also provides a separate meal pattern for infants. To be eligible for reimbursement, breakfast, lunch, supper, and snacks must contain specified minimum amounts of foods from some or all of the following four components: milk, vegetable or fruit or full-strength (100 percent) juice, bread and grains, and meat and meat alternates. Foods and beverages served to children must be approved, or \"creditable,\" to be reimbursed. The De- partment of Agriculture, state agencies, and sponsoring organizations make these determinationsand issue guidelines and educational materials for providers. Funding The CACFP program is an entitlement program. As long as they follow regulations, participating nonresident child care centers and family or group day care homes are guaranteed to receivefunds to offer free or reduced-price meals. In addition, outside-of-school programs are entitled tofunds for snacks. The program is financed in two ways. First, child care centers and outside-of-school programs receive a per-meal reimbursement, up to two meals and one snack (or two snacks and one meal), based on the family income of the childreceiving the meal. The institution must determine each enrolled participant's eligibility for freeand reduced-price meals. Children in families below 130 percent of the poverty line receive freemeals. Children in families between 130 and 185 percent of the poverty line receive reduced-price meals. Children in families above 185 percent of the poverty line receive a small per -meal subsidy for full-price (\"paid\") meals. The per-meal subsidies are indexed for inflation. In fiscal year 2006, the per-meal reimbursement rates in the forty -eight contiguous U.S. states are: $1.27 for free breakfasts, $2.32 for free lunches for paid lunches and suppers, and $0.05 for paid snacks. Second, family and group day care homes receive reimbursement for up to two meals and one snack (or one meal and two snacks). T o participate, family and group child care homes must have a public or private (nonprofit) sponsor. In this instance, the subsidy rate is determined by the areawhere the child care home is located or by the income level of the provider, with providers in low-income neighborhoods or with low incomes themselves receiving higher subsidies. For fiscal year 2006 for the forty-eight contiguous U.S. states, Tier I homes, which are located in low-income districts or operated by a provider with a household income that is at or below 185percent of the poverty line, are reimbursed at the rate of $1.06 for breakfasts, $1.96 for lunchesand suppers, and $0.58 for snacks. Tier II homes, which are not located in low-income districtsnor operated by a low-income provider, are reimbursed at the rate of $0.39 for breakfasts, $1.18for lunches and suppers, and $0.16 for snacks. (A Tier II provider can apply for the Tier I rate for low-income children in the family child care home.) Sources: Code of Federal Regulations 226.20; Federal Register 70, no. 136, July 18, 2005, pp. 41196-97. Notes: Rates for both sets of financing are somewhat higher for Alaska and Hawaii. In addition to the rates for lunch and supper , institutions may also receive 17.5 cents in commodities (or cash in lieu of commodities) as additional assistance for each lunch and supper served.07 5562 story-care.qxp 1/22/2006 12:54 PM Page 149may also be served as part of a snack. No re- quirements govern whether children older than two should be served whole, 2 percent, 1 percent, or skim milk. Milk and 100 per-cent fruit or vegetable juices are the only beverages that are reimbursable through the program. CACFP regulations pertain only tofoods and beverages for which the provider is seeking federal reimbursement. They do not preclude providers from offering additionallow-nutrition, high-calorie foods. Need for improved nutritional quality in CACFP. CACFP meals and snacks are not re- quired to meet specific nutrient-based stan- dards such as those implemented in the mid- 1990s for the school lunch and schoolbreakfast meals. 36The Healthy Meals for Healthy Americans Act of 1995 required thatthese school meals be consistent with the Di- etary Guidelines for Americans, including fat and saturated fat content. Moreover, asnoted, the CACFP regulations do not pre - vent providers from offering additional low- nutrition, high-calorie foods or beverages forwhich they are not seeking reimbursement.As with schools, comprehensive nutritionpolicies for the total child care food environ - ment are needed. Many child care facilities depend on CACFP to defray expenses, and many parents, espe-cially low-income working families, dependon these settings for a substantial portion oftheir children's nutritional intake. 37CACFP motivates a family child care home to be - come licensed, thus coming under applicable health, quality, and safety standards. It inter-acts regularly with family child care pro - viders, providing monitoring, training, in- cluding nutrition education, and otherassistance. Further , CACFP is an entitle- ment program, meaning that all eligible homes and centers must be allowed to partic-Mary Story , Karen M. Kaphingst, and Simone French 150 THE FUTURE OF CHILDRENipate and that all eligible children being cared for in the homes and centers must be served. Immigrant status does not affect eli- gibility status. CACFP provides a basic nutri-tional safety net for low-income children. Strengthening the regulations to make CACFP meals, snacks, and beverages complywith the Dietary Guidelines , including fat and saturated fat content, could further im- prove children's nutrition and help preventchild obesity. Increasing the number of licensed family child care homes to enable them to participate in CACFP could extendhealthful eating and quality child care tomany more at-risk children. 38 Nutrition Quality of Foods in Child Care Settings Surprisingly little research has been done to assess the nutritional quality of foods in childcare settings. Most studies have focused onCACFP providers. A recent research reviewidentified ten descriptive studies of CACFPin child care settings published between 1982and 2004, four of which were national stud - ies. 39Because CACFP does not have nutri - ent-based standards, almost all of the studies have used the recommendations of theAmerican Dietetic Association (ADA) asevaluation benchmarks. The ADA recom - mends that food served to children in carefor a full day (eight hours or more) meet atleast one-half to two-thirds of their dailyneeds for energy and nutrients and that foodserved to children in part-time care (four toseven hours) provide at least one-third oftheir daily needs. These benchmarks are re-quirements for the Head Start nutrition pro-gram. 40The ADA also recommends that child care meals and snacks be consistentwith the Dietary Guidelines. The only comprehensive national study, done in 1995, collected meal and snack data on a07 5562 story-care.qxp 1/22/2006 12:54 PM Page 150nationally representative sample of 1,962 CACFP-participating child care sites (family child care homes and child care centers, in- cluding Head Start centers) and food intakedata on children aged five and older at 372 centers or homes. Nutrient analysis showed that the most common combinations of mealsand snacks offered (breakfast, lunch, and one to two snacks) provided 61 to 71 percent of children's daily energy needs and more thantwo-thirds of the recommended dietary al- lowance for key nutrients. Meals and snacks had an average of 13 percent of calories fromsaturated fat, exceeding the Dietary Guide-lines of no more than 10 percent. Few providers offered lunches that met the Di- etary Guidelines' goals for total fat or satu - rated fat; 50 percent served lunches with more than 35 percent of the calories from fat.Providers that met the dietary fat recommen - dation were more likely to serve 1 percent or skim milk and fruit, and they were less likelyto serve french fries, fried meats, hot dogs,cold cuts, and high-fat condiments. On aver-age 90 percent of the breakfasts and 87 per - cent of the lunches complied with the meal pattern requirements. The food componentmost often missing from meals was fruits andvegetables. 41 A 1999 national study of CACFP meals and snacks conducted in 542 Tier II child carehomes (not located in a low-income area noroperated by a low-income provider) foundthat meals and snacks offered to childrenaged two and older provided, on average,more than two-thirds of the recommendeddietary allowance for calories and key nutri-ents. 42Mean saturated fat content exceeded national recommendations. Less than one-third of the morning snacks (31 percent) andafternoon snacks (28 percent) included fresh,canned, or dried fruit. Less than 25 percentof day care homes offered any fresh fruit assnacks. Only 3 percent of the afternoon snacks included vegetables. The few smaller-scale studies that have evalu- ated the menus in child care settings, prima- rily CACFP sites, show cause for concern. 43 One study collected data on 171 child care centers that participated in CACFP in seven states.44It collected copies of menus and menu records for meals and snacks for tenconsecutive days. Meal patterns were incon- sistent with the Dietary Guidelines regarding fat, sodium, fruits and vegetables, and servinga variety of foods. Menus were high in fat andseldom provided recommended servings ofvegetables. Cookies were frequently on themenus. Another study evaluated menus innine Texas child care centers participating inCACFP and found that only about half thecenters included fresh produce; among thosethat did, the amount was frequently minimal.Food service staff did not always understandthe CACFP requirements and had limitednutrition knowledge. One staff member saidhe never served fresh fruit because he didn't\"know how far an apple will go,\" but he knewexactly how much applesauce to ladle from acan to make the minimum portion requiredby CACFP . Another staff member thought that bottled orange drink was \"full-strength juice\" because no water was added. 45The Role of Child Care Settings in Obesity Prevention VOL. 16 / NO. 1 / SPRING 2006 151CACFP meals and snacks are not required to meet specificnutrient-based standardssuch as those implemented inthe mid-1990s for the school lunch and breakfast meals.07 5562 story-care.qxp 1/22/2006 12:54 PM Page 151A recent study compared the dietary intakes of fifty children aged three to nine who at-tended nine child care centers in Texas withthe recommendations of the Food GuidePyramid for Young Children. 46Researchers observed children's meals and snacks during child care for three consecutive days andtook reports on dietary intakes of the chil- dren before and after child care from the parents. During child care, the three-year-olds ate enough fruit, but not enough grains, vegetables, or dairy to meet two-thirds of the Food Guide Pyramid for Young Children rec-ommendations. The four- and five-year-oldchildren consumed adequate dairy only. The vegetables and grains served most often were potatoes and refined flour products. Intakesat home did not compensate. These findingssuggest that children attending child carecenters are not getting adequate diets at childcare centers or at home. In summary , relatively little is known about the dietary quality and types of foods and beverages offered in child care facilities, es - pecially those that are not licensed or regu - lated and do not participate in the CACFP program. The nutritional quality of meals andsnacks may be poor. Increased attentionshould thus be paid to the nutritional ade - quacy of foods served in child care settings.More research is needed on the current foodenvironment in child care, including whatfoods are served, their nutritional quality, andstaff training on nutrition. It has been tenyears since any national survey described thenutrient content of meals and snacks in childcare centers and day care homes participat-ing in CACFP , and that survey included only children older than five. 47Given the in- creased number and use of child care facili-ties over the past decade, an updated nationalsurvey is needed to assess nutrition qualityand practices, including types and portionMary Story , Karen M. Kaphingst, and Simone French 152 THE FUTURE OF CHILDRENsizes of foods and beverages offered and con- sumed by children in child care settings. Physical Activity Physical activity is crucial to overall health and to obesity prevention.48Reduced physi- cal activity is a likely contributor to increasingobesity rates among children of all ages. 49 Physical Activity Recommendations for Young Children The 2005 Dietary Guidelines recommend that children and adolescents engage in atleast sixty minutes of physical activity onmost, preferably all, days of the week. 50The National Association for Sport and Physical Education' s guidelines recommend that tod - dlers get at least thirty minutes daily of struc- tured physical activity and preschoolersshould have at least sixty minutes. It also rec - ommends that toddlers and preschoolers en- gage in at least sixty minutes a day of unstruc-tured physical activity and not be sedentaryfor more than sixty minutes at a time exceptwhen sleeping. Thus, preschool-aged childrenshould have at least two hours of exercise aday, half in structured physical activity andthe remainder in unstructured, free-play set - tings. 51Children aged five to twelve should have at least sixty minutes of daily exercise. To help meet the daily physical activity recom- mendations for preschoolers, experts recom - mend incorporating planned physical activity into the daily preschool schedule.52Structured activity sessions should be short, about fifteento twenty minutes, and should emphasize awide variety of different movements. 53States vary widely in their physical activity require - ments for child care settings, but most address the subject in general, non-quantified terms.The failure to specify how much time childrenshould spend being physically active is anoverlooked opportunity to increase physical07 5562 story-care.qxp 1/22/2006 12:54 PM Page 152activity among young children in settings where many spend much of their day. Physical Activity in Child Care Settings Surprisingly little is known about the activity levels of children in child care. Russell Pate and several colleagues used accelerometers,or small electronic devices worn around the waist, to record minute-by-minute activity levels of 281 children attending nine pre-schools (Head Start, church-based, and pri- vate) in South Carolina. 54The children, who wore accelerometers for roughly 4.4 hours aday for an average of 6.6 days, participated ina mean of seven minutes an hour of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) at the preschools. Activity levels varied widelyamong schools, averaging from four to tenminutes an hour. The preschool that a childattended was a significant predictor ofMVPA. The authors speculated that a childattending preschool for eight hours would en-gage in about one hour of MVP A and would be unlikely to engage in another hour of MVP A outside the preschool setting, suggest - ing that many preschool children may not be meeting physical activity recommendations.Another study assessed the physical activitylevel of 214 children aged three to five en-rolled in ten child care centers in SouthDakota. Each child wore an accelerometerfor two continuous days (forty-eight hours). 55 The child care center was the strongest pre - dictor of physical activity levels, with more than 50 percent of the daily activity countsoccurring between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. Thesestudies suggest that school policies and prac-tices greatly influence the overall physical ac-tivity of the nation' s young children. 56The quality and quantity of physical activity inchild care settings can vary depending on in-door space, gross motor play equipment, out - door play area, group size, and the education and training of child care staff. 57The Role of Child Care Settings in Obesity Prevention VOL. 16 / NO. 1 / SPRING 2006 153The only study to evaluate weight-related dif- ferences in physical activity during the pre-school day compared the physical activity ofoverweight and normal-weight three- to five-year-old children while attending preschool. 58 The study assessed 245 children, recruited from nine preschools, on multiple days whileusing both direct observation and accelerom- eters. It found that overweight boys were sig- nificantly less active than normal-weightboys, though it found no weight-related activ- ity differences in girls. Overweight children may thus be at increased risk for further gainsin body fat because of low physical activitylevels during the preschool day . Another study of 266 three- to five-year -old children from nine preschools found that pre-school policies and practices influenced chil-dren' s physical activity . 59Children in preschools with frequent field trips (four ormore a month) and college-educated teachershad significantly higher levels of MVP A. Chil - dren in higher-quality preschools, measured by the number of children per classroom, theeducational backgrounds of the teachers, andspecific features of the facilities, had lowerlevels of sedentary behavior. Similar levels ofphysical activity were observed in private,church-based, and Head Start preschool set-tings. On average, the children failed to meetThe 2005 Dietary Guidelines recommend that children andadolescents engage in at leastsixty minutes of physicalactivity on most, preferably all, days of the week.07 5562 story-care.qxp 1/22/2006 12:54 PM Page 153current recommendations for physical activ- ity.60Children in this study were engaged in MVPA about 27 percent of the time, meaning that on average they would have about thirty-two minutes of MVPA in two play periods lasting an hour each. Most notably, the study found higher levels of physical activity inpreschools with policies and practices that promoted physical activity. We could find no studies that assessed chil- dren's television and video viewing and com- puter use in child care centers or day carehomes, although it has been reported thatchildren spend more time watching TV in child care homes than in centers. 61Many studies have found a positive link betweenchildren's television viewing and obesity, andthe American Academy of Pediatrics recom-mends limiting children' s total television viewing time to no more than one to two hours of quality programming a day. 62Future studies should examine television policiesand practice in child care facilities. Research has found that many preschool-aged children are not meeting the recommendedguidelines of two hours of physical activity aday and that children in child care settingsneed more physical activity . 63How active chil - dren are in preschools is largely determinedby how much time they have to play freely insettings conducive to physical activity , such as outdoor playgrounds, parks, or gyms. One way to ensure that preschoolers get adequate exer-cise is to provide more time in free-play set - tings and add structured physical activity to their program. 64As yet, however, no broad policies govern physical activity for preschoolchildren in child care. Although several na-tional groups have published recommenda-tions, no requirements exist at the federallevel. Physical activity policies, where theyexist, are set by states and facilities.Obesity-Prevention Interventions in Preschool Settings Child care settings offer untapped opportuni- ties for developing and evaluating effectiveobesity-prevention strategies to reach both children and their parents. But we could lo- cate few published obesity-prevention stud-ies with preschool children. 65In Hip-Hop to Health Jr., a study of twelve Chicago Head Start preschool programs serving minoritychildren, children in half the preschools par- ticipated in a fourteen-week (forty minutes three times a week) program of healthful eat-ing and exercise. Their parents receivedweekly newsletters with information mirror- ing the children's curriculum. Children in the other six preschools served as a controlgroup. Children in the program had signifi-cantly smaller increases in BMI than did chil-dren in the control group at both the one-year and two-year follow-ups. 66But the study found no significant treatment group differ-ences in food intake or physical activity . Another study worth noting\u2014and one with implications for obesity-prevention pro - grams\u2014is the Start\" risk-reduction study low-income, predominantly minoritypreschool children in nine Head Start centersin New York, the project modified the foodservice in some centers and left food servicein some centers unchanged as a control. 67 The food service intervention reduced the fat and saturated fat content of preschool mealsand reduced children' s consumption of satu - rated fat while at preschool without compro- mising their intake of energy and essentialnutrients, thus demonstrating the feasibilityof an intervention to change food service inchild care centers. School-based interventions to reduce televi- sion watching in elementary school children,Mary Story , Karen M. Kaphingst, and Simone French 154 THE FUTURE OF CHILDREN07 5562 story-care.qxp 1/22/2006 12:54 PM Page 154including one conducted by T. N. Robinson, have reported reductions in body fat.68One intervention, which involved preschoolers from 2.6 to 5.5 years old, almost all of whomwere white, aimed to reduce at-home televi- sion viewing. 69Children in eight child care centers received a seven-session program toreduce television viewing as part of a health- promotion curriculum; children in eight con- trol centers received a safety and injury-prevention program. Parents were given take-home educational materials and partici- pated in parent-child activities. Parents re-ported that children in the interventiongroup watched television at home an average of 4.7 hours less a week than children in the control group\u2014a reduction similar to thosereported by Robinson. 70But children in the intervention and in the control group had nosignificant differences in body fat. Longerand more intensive interventions that targetother modifiable obesity risk factors mayyield greater results. Reducing consumption of sweetened bever - ages, including juice, both in child care set - tings and at home may be an effective obe- sity-prevention strategy . Several studies indicate that sweetened beverages may con- tribute to the increased prevalence of obesityamong preschool children. One analysis ofNational Health and Nutrition ExaminationSurvey data found a positive link between theconsumption of carbonated soft drinks andoverweight in all age groups, including two-to five-year -olds. 71Another examined the as - sociation between sweet drink consumption and overweight among 10,904 low-incomepreschool children aged two and three atbaseline and then looked at their weight andheight one year later. 72Sweet drinks included juices, fruit drinks, and sodas. Forty-one per - cent of the children consumed these drinks at least three times a day. Energy intake in-creased as the consumption of sweet drinks increased. For example, those who consumed less than one drink a day had a mean intake of 1,425 calories a day, as against 2,005 calo-ries a day for those who consumed three or more a day. Preschool children who were at risk for overweight or who were overweightat baseline and who consumed more than one drink a day were significantly more likely to become or remain overweight. A cross-sectional study in 1997 found that two- to five-year -old children who drank twelve or more ounces of fruit juice a day were more likely (32 percent as against 9 per-cent) to be obese than those who drank lessjuice. 73Not all studies have found a link be- tween juice consumption and overweight,but the American Academy of Pediatrics rec-ommends that children aged one to six drinkno more than four to six ounces of fruit juicea day. 74Fruit juice and fruit drinks are easily overconsumed by toddlers and young chil-dren because they taste good. They are alsoconveniently packaged and can be carriedaround during the day. Because juice isviewed as nutritious, child care providers orparents may not set limits. Like soda, how-ever, it can contribute to obesity. Whole fruitshould be encouraged as an alternative be - cause of the fiber benefit and because whole fruit takes longer to eat.The Role of Child Care Settings in Obesity Prevention VOL. 16 / NO. 1 / SPRING 2006 155Reducing consumption of sweetened beverages,including juice, both in childcare settings and at homemay be an effective obesity- prevention strategy.07 5562 story-care.qxp 1/22/2006 12:54 PM Page 155It is not known how much sweetened bever- ages or juice children consume in child care settings and at home. National data indicate that energy intake, added sugar as a share oftotal energy, and excess juice consumption (more than six ounces a day) increased signif- icantly among preschoolers between 1977 and1998. 75Researchers need to assess sweetened beverage intake among preschoolers in child care facilities and to conduct interventions toremove fruit drinks and soda from child care, to limit juice to six ounces a day, and to exam- ine the effect on weight status. Head Start Head Start, a federal preschool program serving infants and children up to age five,includes a varied mix of programs\u2014educa-tion, health, nutrition, social services, andparental involvement\u2014that presents aunique opportunity to combat childhoodobesity. Created in 1965, Head Start was de-signed to help break the cycle of poverty byproviding preschool children of low-incomefamilies with a comprehensive program tomeet their educational, emotional, social,health, and nutritional needs. 76In 2003, 19,200 Head Start sites throughout the coun - try reached more than 900,000 children. The program is racially diverse, and most childrenare three (34 percent) or four (53 percent)years old. 77Although Head Start has touched millions of children' s lives, it reaches only about 40 percent of those who are eligible.78 One objective of Head Start is to ensure that all children are linked to an ongoing source ofhealth care. 79The emphasis on continuous primary care means that children' s height and weight are monitored and that parents receive guidance on nutrition and physical activity.Head Start maintains a Child Health Recordfor each child and requires a health screeningwithin forty-five days of enrollment. 80Al-though each child's height and weight are measured and BMI calculated as part of a routine health examination, it is not clear how these data are used on an individual basis orwhat information is given to the parents. Nor is it clear whether the BMI data collected are analyzed at a state or national level or used forsurveillance or monitoring. Head Start is also a vital source of nutrition for low-income children. Its federal perform- ance standards require that its meals and snacks provide at least one-third of the dailynutritional needs of children in a part-daycenter-based setting and one-half to two- third of the needs of children in a full-day program. 81Head Start sites participate in the CACFP program and must have a registereddietitian review and evaluate their menus.Performance standards also require that par - ent education activities include \"opportuni- ties to assist individual families with foodpreparation and nutritional skills.\" 82 Head Start' s federal regulations also require that settings provide opportunities for outdoor and indoor active play, adequate indoor andoutdoor space, equipment for active play , and opportunities to develop gross and fine motor skills. The regulations do not specify theamount, frequency, and type of physical activ-ity. No standards or rules govern television use. Overall, evaluations of Head Start show many benefits for children, families, and communi-ties, though little research has focused on obe - sity prevention. 83The only published study to date is Hip-Hop to Health Jr., describedabove. 84Because of its multiple components and because it serves low-income, multiethnicchildren who are at high risk of overweight,Head Start could well be used to strengthenand expand obesity-prevention efforts. Theprogram has national reach and could signifi-Mary Story , Karen M.

Interventionsand policy changes could focus on ensuringthat meals and snacks adhere to the Dietary Guidelines , that physical activity is increased, and that parents are actively involved. BMIscreening results could be provided to parentsand health providers and could be used for sur - veillance on state and national levels. Regulation of Child Care Programs With the exception of Head Start, the states regulate child care facilities. Each state setsand enforces specific health and safety re-quirements, which regulated providers mustmeet to operate legally. 85All states set mini- mum health, safety, and nutrition standardsfor providers. They generally regulate childcare homes through licensing, registration,and certification. Most states require familychild care providers to be licensed if theycare for more than four children. In manystates, licensing or registration is voluntaryfor providers caring for four or fewer chil - dren. Almost all child care centers are regu- lated or licensed in some way. 86 No uniform quality standards govern all child care and early education programs nation-wide, and many programs are exempt from any regulation or licensing requirements.87 Although regulations vary across states, they focus mostly on basic safety and health re-quirements, such as keeping smoke detectorsin working order; locking cabinets that con - tain dangerous materials; specifying the min-imum area for indoor or outdoor space, staff- child ratios, the minimum age of caregivers,and preservice training qualifications and in-service requirements for staff; and ensuringthat children' s immunizations are up to date. 88Regulations regarding nutrition, phys- ical activity, and media use vary widely acrossthe states and are reviewed below . The American Dietetic Association, American Academy of Pediatrics, American PublicHealth Association, and National ResourceCenter for Health and Safety in Child Carehave published recommendations, perform-ance standards, and benchmarks for nutri - tion, food service, and developmentally ap- propriate activities in child care settings. 89 Although setting and enforcing child care re- quirements are primarily state and local re-sponsibilities, the federal government re - quires states to have basic safety and health regulations in place to receive funds from theThe Role of Child Care Settings in Obesity Prevention VOL. 16 / NO. 1 / SPRING 2006 157An Innovative State Program A promising pilot intervention called Nutrition and Physical Activity Self-Assessment for Child Care (NAP SACC) was launched in North Carolina in 2003.1Funded by the Centers for Disease Control and the N.C. Department of Health and Human Services, the program's goal is to promote health- ful eating and physical activity in young children in child care and preschool settings. The interven- tion examines the feasibility of using local health professionals to help child care centers assessand improve their nutrition and physical activity environments. The state implemented the pilot infifteen child care centers, with four control centers. Using an assessment tool with nine nutritionand six physical activity areas, centers self-assessed their policies and practices. Based on the as-sessments, center staff identified specific areas for improvement. Local health professionals con-ducted workshops for the center staff and provided ongoing support and technical assistance. Thesecond phase of the project is now under way in 102 child care centers. 1. Nutrition and Physical Activity Self-Assessment for Child Care (NAP SACC) Website (www.napsacc.org 5562 story-care.qxp 1/22/2006 12:54 PM Page 157Child Care and Development Block Grant. This federal program subsidizes child care costs for low-income families, helping them afford quality child care and removing a bar-rier to parental employment. 90It is a signifi- cant public investment. In 2004, the govern- ment provided $4.8 billion.91To get these funds, states must certify that health and safety requirements are in place and that both regulated and nonregulated providersbeing paid with block grant funds are in com- pliance. Washington does not, however, stip- ulate the contents of the requirements or themeans to enforce them, and states varywidely on these points. Nonregulated Child Care Providers Most states do not regulate all types of child care providers. Nonregulated providers neednot comply with state regulations and are notsubject to state enforcement. Some familychild care providers caring for small numbersof children are also exempt from regulation,and some states exempt certain types of cen-ter-based programs, such as those run by reli - gious groups, school-based preschool, school- or part-year only . 92Non- regulated providers who receive funds from the federal block grant must, however , meet state and local health and safety requirements. National advocacy groups have expressed concern about the gaps in child care regula-tion. The National Health and Safety Perfor-mance Standards for Out-of-Home ChildCare assert that \"every state should have astatute that identifies the regulatory agencyand mandates the licensing and regulation ofall full-time and part-time out-of-home careof children, regardless of setting, except careprovided by parents or legal guardians, grand - parents, siblings, aunts, or uncles or when a family engages an individual to care solely fortheir children.\" 93The National Association for the Education of Young Children statesthat \"any program providing care and educa-tion to children from two or more unrelatedfamilies should be regulated; there should be no exemptions from this principle.\" 94 Regulatory Enforcement The state child care licensing office enforces its state's child care regulations. With currenttight fiscal climates in most states and com- peting priorities for limited funds, states must make choices about the extent to which theycan reasonably carry out this enforcement andthe types of providers who will be affected. 95 Regulatory systems in many states are not funded to enforce licensing regulations effec - tively.96Regulatory burdens also affect providers, and costs can be passed along toparents. Providers may choose to leave themarket\u2014or choose not to be licensed\u2014if reg-ulatory practices become too cumbersome. Regulations Governing Food, Physical Activity , and Media Use The National Resource Center for Health and Safety in Child Care, part of the U.S. Depart-ment of Health and Human Services, HealthResources and Services Administration, main-tains a website that provides links to the com - plete child care licensing standards for all fiftystates and the District of Columbia. 97Using this website, we recently conducted an analy - sis of state child care licensing standards for nutrition, physical activity, and media use. Weexamined licensing regulations for child carecenters, small family child care homes (typi-cally caring for six or fewer children), andlarge family and group child care homes (usu - ally with seven to twelve children). We found not only that regulations vary con- siderably from state to state but that, within a state, regulations may vary for different typesMary Story , Karen M. Kaphingst, and Simone French 158 THE FUTURE OF CHILDREN07 5562 story-care.qxp 1/22/2006 12:54 PM Page 158of child care settings. Typically child care cen- ters are most heavily regulated, followed by large family and group child care homes, with small family child care homes the least heavilyregulated. As noted, many states exempt small family child care homes from licensing requirements and instead rely on voluntaryregistration. Five states\u2014Delaware, Georgia, Illinois, Mississippi, and Tennessee\u2014have par- ticularly comprehensive policies on nutrition,physical activity, and media use. In the follow- ing discussion of licensing regulations in these areas, we describe a state as having a specificregulation if the regulation is mandatory in atleast one child care setting. Nutrition State nutrition regulations vary widely. Thirty states require the Child and Adult Care FoodProgram meal patterns or have similar re - quirements. Fifteen states specify the share of children's daily nutritional requirements tobe provided per meal or based on the lengthof time in care, and twenty-one states specifythe number of meals and snacks to be offeredto children based on length of time in care.Just two states, Michigan and West Virginia,require that meals and snacks must followthe Dietary Guidelines for Americans. Mis- sissippi regulations refer to the Dietary Guidelines , noting that they can \"provide as- sistance in planning meals for ages two (2)and older , which will promote health and prevent disease.\" 98Ten states limit foods and beverages of low nutritional value. Five statesregulate vending machines. Alabama, Geor - gia, and Louisiana prohibit vending machines in areas used by children. Arkansas permitsvending machines in school-age settings pro - vided they are not the only source of snacks and beverages. Mississippi requires food invending machines to meet the state' s nutri- tion regulations for meals and snacks in child care settings.Physical Activity Most states specify that the daily program should promote physical development, in- cluding large and small muscle activity; havea balance of active and quiet activities, indoor and outdoor activities, and individual and group activities; include age- and develop-mentally appropriate activities, equipment, and supplies; and provide enough materials and equipment to avoid excessive competi-tion and long waits. Thirty-three states and the District of Columbia require that the program provide large muscle, or grossmotor, activity or development. Nine statesrequire \"vigorous\" physical activity for chil- dren. No states use the term \"moderate\" to describe the appropriate level of activity . Just two states, Alaska and Massachusetts, specify how long children should engage in physicalactivity . Alaska mandates \"a minimum of 20 minutes of vigorous physical activity for every three hours the facility is open between thehours of 7:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m.\" Massachu - setts calls for \"thirty minutes of physical ac- tivity every day .\" Alaska' s regulations pertain to all types of child care settings; the Massa - chusetts rule affects only child care homes. Thirty-eight states and the District of Colum- bia require that children in child care centersand homes have time outdoors each day,health and weather permitting. Eight ofthese states and the District of Columbiaspecify how long children should be out-doors; most require at least one hour a day.The District of Columbia and Mississippi re - quire the most daily outdoor time\u2014two hours for a full-day program and at leastthirty minutes for a part-day program. Media Use Twenty-two states regulate media use, in- cluding television, computer, video, video game, radio, and electronic game use. MostThe Role of Child Care Settings in Obesity Prevention VOL. 16 / NO. 1 / SPRING 2006 15907 5562 story-care.qxp 1/22/2006 12:54 PM Page 159simply define appropriate or inappropriate content or define acceptable use of media within the program of activities (for example, media should be used with discretion and notas a substitute for planned activities). Only nine states specify time limits on screen time. Five set a maximum of two hours a day; theothers allow less time. Quality Child Care Most children in the United States now spend some time in child care during their critical developmental years. A body of evi-dence has accumulated to show that the qual-ity of care has a lasting impact on a child's well-being and ability to learn. 99High-quality care and early education help children pre - pare for school, ready to succeed; improve their skills; and stay safe while their parentswork. 100But quality care arrangements are hard to find, particularly for low-income par-ents. 101Much of the care available in the United States is poor to mediocre.102 Strong state licensing requirements, ex - panded to apply to most care settings, can help ensure children's health and well-being.Stricter licensing requirements, such as lowstaff-to-child ratios and adequate training forproviders, can help improve the quality ofcare. Providers who care for children on aregular basis play an essential role in chil-dren' s development and experiences. 103 Properly trained and educated teachers en- hance children's development. Recruitingand retaining qualified staff pose significantchallenges, however, when providers' salariesaverage $17,610 a year, often without bene-fits or paid leave. 104Most states do not re - quire providers to have even a basic knowl- edge of child development, and they requirelittle or no training before allowing providersto work with children. Several national or-ganizations have called for uniform trainingfor providers on specific content areas, in- cluding nutrition, child growth and develop-ment, and health and safety. 105The American Dietetic Association recommends that childcare providers and food service personnel re- ceive appropriate nutrition and food service training. 106We found no recommendations for training relating specifically to physical activity, though children in preschools with better-educated teachers have been found tohave significantly higher levels of MVPA. 107 Recommendations for Child Care Settings Largely ignored in the nation's obesity dia- logue so far has been the food and physical ac- tivity environment in child care settings. Butchild care represents an untapped rich sourceof strategies to help children acquire positivehealthy habits to prevent obesity . The infra- structure already exists within Head Start and CACFP child care sites to incorporate health-ful eating and exercise into these programs,thus reaching many low-income and minoritychildren who are at greatest risk for obesity . But regulations and standards governing phys - ical activity and nutrition need to be strength- ened. Child care settings also offer a way toreach parents to make healthful changes athome to reinforce and support healthful eat - ing and regular exercise. The box on the fol-lowing page lists strategies for creating ahealthful environment in child care settings toimprove physical activity and eating behaviorsto prevent obesity in young children. Conclusions The early years spent in child care are cru- cially important to a child' s development. High-quality child care and early education help ensure that a child will develop skillsand enter school ready to learn. 108For a young child, health and education are insepa-rable. Eating nutritious foods and engagingMary Story , Karen M.

Child care settings can andshould provide an environment in whichyoung children are offered nutritious foodsand regular physical activity through struc-tured and unstructured play so that theylearn these healthful lifestyle behaviors at anearly age. Child care homes and centers offermany opportunities to form and supporthealthful eating habits and physical activitypatterns in young children. Thus they canplay a critical role in laying a foundation for healthy weight. The number of children inthe United States aged four and younger isexpected to grow by 1.2 million over the nextdecade, for a 6 percent rise. The number ofworking parents who depend on child careservices is also expected to grow . 109To help stem the childhood obesity epidemic, the na- tion must pay more attention to the food andphysical activity offered in various child caresettings.The Role of Child Care Settings in Obesity Prevention VOL. 16 / NO. 1 / SPRING 2006 161Strategies for Achieving a More Healthful Food and Physical Activity Environment in Child Care Settings Policy Goals At the federal level, Congress should require all meals and snacks offered by the Child and Adult Care Food Program to meet the Dietary Guidelines for Americans . Regulations would apply to all providers in participating child care centers, family child care facilities, and after-school careprograms. States should develop nutrition and physical activity policies for licensed child care facilities that address healthful eating, physical activity, and media use. Policies should also address nutritionand physical activity training for staff and nutrition training for food service staff. At the local level, licensed preschool and child care facilities should have written nutrition policies that follow the Dietary Guidelines for Americans for meals, snacks, and beverages. They should also have written policies to ensure adequate, developmentally appropriate physical activity and tolimit screen time. Research Goals Researchers should pursue four primary goals. First, they should develop, implement, and evalu - ate innovative intervention programs focused on promoting healthful eating and physical activityand on preventing obesity in child care facilities, especially facilities serving low-income and mi-nority children who are at highest risk. Second, they should conduct descriptive environmentalstudies in child care centers, Head Start, and licensed day care homes to assess the food envi-ronment (the types and amounts of foods and beverages served for meals and snacks), the phys - ical activity environment (the amount and type of physical activity), and media use. Third, theyshould conduct a national study of child care programs on the dietary quality of meals and snacksserved and how they compare to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and Dietary Reference In - takes. And finally they should evaluate methods to increase parental involvement, to changeparental behavior, and to change the home environment through child care-based obesity-preven- tion interventions.07 5562 story-care.qxp 1/22/2006 12:54 PM Page 161Notes 1.

Sussner, Juhee Kim, and Steven Gortmaker Summary As researchers continue to analyze the role of parenting both in the development of childhood overweight and in obesity prevention, studies of child nutrition and growth are detailing the ways in which parents affect their children's development of food- Gortmaker argue that interven- tions aimed at preventing childhood overweight and obesity should involve parents as impor- tant forces for change in their children's behaviors. The authors begin by reviewing evidence on how parents can help their children develop and maintain healthful eating and physical activity habits, thereby ultimately helping prevent child-hood overweight and obesity . They show how important it is for parents to understand how their roles in preventing obesity change as their children move through critical developmental peri- ods, from before birth and through adolescence. They point out that researchers, policymakers,and practitioners should also make use of such information to develop more effective interven - tions and educational programs that address childhood obesity right where it starts\u2014at home. The authors review research evaluating school-based obesity-prevention interventions that in- clude components targeted at parents. Although much research has been done on how parentsshape their children's eating and physical activity habits, surprisingly few high-quality data existon the effectiveness of such programs. The authors call for more programs and cost-effective-ness studies aimed at improving parents' ability to shape healthful eating and physical activitybehaviors in their children. The authors conclude that preventing and controlling childhood obesity will require multifaceted and community-wide programs and policies, with parents having a critical role to play. Successfulintervention efforts, they argue, must involve and work directly with parents from the earlieststages of child development to support healthful practices both in and outside of the home.

Parents shape their chil- dren's dietary practices, physical activity, sedentary behaviors, and ultimately theirweight status in many ways. Parents' knowl- edge of nutrition; their influence over food selection, meal structure, and home eatingpatterns; their modeling of healthful eating practices; their levels of physical activity; and their modeling of sedentary habits includingtelevision viewing are all influential in theirchildren's development of lifelong habits that contribute to normal weight or to overweight and obesity . 1 Because the parents' roles at home in pro- moting healthful eating practices and levelsof physical activity\u2014and thus in preventingobesity\u2014are so critical, they should also becentral to collective efforts to combat the na - tion's childhood obesity epidemic. L. Epstein offers three reasons for involving parents inobesity-prevention interventions. First, obe - sity runs in families, and it may be unrealistic to intervene with one member of a familywhile other family members are modelingand supporting behaviors that run counter tothe intervention's goals. Second, parentsserve as models and reinforce and supportthe acquisition and maintenance of eatingand exercise behaviors. Finally, to producemaximal behavior change in children, it maybe necessary to teach parents to use specificbehavior-change strategies such as positivereinforcement. 2Several successful school- based health-promotion interventions, suchas Planet Health and Eat Well and KeepMoving, already include a component tar-geted at improving parenting behaviors, asdoes the well-established Special Supple-mental Nutrition Program for Women, In-fants, and Children (WIC) public health and educational program. 3Because research shows how the parents' roles in influencing the development of overweight and obesitydiffer at different stages of their children's development, these parenting components will be most effective if they are targeted atchildren in particular age groups. Parental Roles during a Child's Development Parenting influences the development of overweight and obesity in various ways at dif-ferent stages of a child's development. Thefollowing discussion is structured around three time periods in children's lives: gesta- tion and early infancy; early childhood, toddlers or preschoolers; andmiddle childhood and adolescence, whenchildren are attending school. 4 Gestation and Infancy Before an infant is even born, aspects of his mother's pregnancy can put him at risk ofoverweight in childhood and later in life. 5An unfavorable intrauterine environment, forexample, can increase a fetus's future risk ofdeveloping adult metabolic abnormalities,including obesity, hypertension, and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. 6The children of mothers who suffer from diabetesmellitus, gestational diabetes, and undernu-trition and overnutrition during pregnancyare at particular risk for obesity, with thegreatest risk factor being gestational dia-betes. 7A key strategy for obesity prevention at this stage of a child's development, there-fore, is to focus on screening for and prevent-ing diabetes during pregnancy . Parents also have an important role to play during infancy , when a child is establishing the foundation for dietary habits and nutri- tional adequacy over a lifetime. 8AlthoughAna C. Lindsay , Katarina M. Sussner, Juhee Kim, OF CHILDREN08 5562 lindsay-etal.qxp 1/22/2006 12:54 PM Page 170debate over whether breast-feeding can help prevent obesity later in life continues, many researchers believe that breast-feeding in- fants does have a protective effect againstobesity. Several studies, for example, have documented lower rates of overweight among children who were breast-fed forlonger durations. 9Their findings, however, were limited to non-Hispanic whites and did not apply to other racial or ethnic groups.10 One explanation for the protective effect of breast-feeding is that it helps infants better regulate their food intake than does bottle-feeding. Encouraging an infant to empty abottle and using formulas more concentrated in energy and nutrients than breast milk may make it more difficult for the baby to attendto his or her own normal feelings of satiety. Ifsuch experiences occur early in infancy andcontinue, an infant may not develop reliablecontrol over food intake. None of the recentstudies of breast-feeding, however, rules outthe possibility that the protective effect ofbreast-feeding on obesity later in life may bedue to confounding factors such as parentalweight status or social and economic status. 11 Toddlers and Preschool Children As toddlers and preschoolers develop habits related to eating and physical activity , parents can shape their early environments in waysthat encourage them to be more healthful. 12 Parents and Healthful Food Behaviors Children come equipped with a biological set of taste predispositions: they like sweet andsalty tastes and energy-dense foods, and theydislike bitter and sour tastes. 13But they de- velop most of their food habits through expo - sure and repeated experience. Research sug- gests that individual differences in thephysiologic regulation of energy intake ap - pear as early as the preschool years and that parents have enormous influence on thesedifferences. 14Current data, although limited, suggest that the way parents feed their chil-dren contributes to individual differences inhow well children can regulate their food in-take and perhaps to the origins of energy im- balance. 15Especially in the early years of a child's life, parents have a direct role in pro-viding experiences that encourage the child's control of food intake. Around preschool age, when children particularly dislike new foods,it is important for parents to model healthful eating habits and to offer a variety of health- ful foods to their children. When parentsprovide early exposure to nutritious foods,even fruits and vegetables, children like and eat more of such foods. 16But parents should observe a clearly defined role in offering thefoods to their children. As described by W.Dietz and L. Stern, parents \"are responsiblefor offering a healthful variety of foods,\"while children themselves \"are responsiblefor deciding what and how much they want toeat from what they are offered.\" 17 Although children are predisposed to re - spond to the energy content of foods in con - trolling their intake, they are also responsive to their parents' control attempts. Researchhas shown that these attempts can refocusthe child away from responsiveness to inter - nal cues of hunger and satiety and towardsuch external factors as the presence of palat-able foods. 18Parents who control or restrict what their young children eat may believethey are doing what is best for their child, butrecent research challenges this assumption.Imposing stringent controls can increasepreferences for high-fat, energy-dense foods,perhaps causing children' s normal internal cues to self-regulate hunger and satiety to be- come unbalanced. 19 Parents should also be aware of the social contexts in which foods are consumed. Stud-The Role of Parents in Preventing Childhood Obesity VOL. 16 / NO. 1 / SPRING 2006 17108 5562 lindsay-etal.qxp 1/22/2006 12:54 PM Page 171ies have found that children develop prefer- ences for foods offered in positive contexts and, conversely, are more likely to dislike foods offered in negative contexts.20Offering healthful foods in positive contexts will en- courage youngsters to enjoy and eat such foods. Another important influence on the types of food young children consume is a household'sfood choices. At an early age children will eat what their parents, especially their mothers, eat. 21And if parents overeat, their children may too. Thus the parents' own eating behav - iors may contribute to the development of overweight in their children.22The types of food available and accessible in the home arealso linked with the weight status of pre-school children. Research suggests, for exam - ple, that increased consumption of sugar- sweetened drinks, like fruit juice, might raisethe risk of overweight among preschool chil - dren. 23One study found that children aged two to five years who drank more than twelveounces of fruit juice a day were more likely tobe overweight than those who drank less. 24 More recently, a study of two- to three-year- old children found that for those who are atrisk for overweight, consuming sweet drinksas infrequently as once or twice daily in-creased their odds of becoming overweight. 25 These findings are consistent with those of long-term studies and interventions focused on sugar-sweetened beverages among school-aged children, although some smaller long- term studies in children found no significant link between fruit juice intake and over-weight. 26 Parents and Physical Activity during Early Childhood Physical activity is a key component of energy balance, and keeping small children active isan essential part of preventing child over-weight. 27Research has found that physical activity is associated with lower risks of accel- erated weight gain and excess adiposityamong preschool-aged children. 28An eight- year study of three- to five-year-old childrenfound that the most active children had sig - nificantly lower body mass index (BMI) than their less active counterparts. 29A study of three- to five-year -old children attending preschool found that overweight boys were significantly less active than normal-weightboys during the preschool day . 30 Few studies have examined the relationship between the activity levels of parents andtheir young children. The Framingham Chil - dren's Study, however, monitored physical ac-tivity with a mechanical device\u2014the Caltracaccelerometer\u2014in four - to seven-year -old children and their parents and found that the children of active mothers were twice aslikely to be active as children of inactivemothers. When both parents were active,these children were 5.8 times more likely tobe active than the children of two sedentaryparents. 31 A few studies of preschool children have found that the more time children spend out-doors, the higher their activity levels. 32TheseAna C. Lindsay , Katarina M. Sussner, Juhee Kim, and Steven Gortmaker 172 THE FUTURE OF CHILDRENParents who control or restrict what their youngchildren eat may believe theyare doing what is best fortheir child, but recentresearch challenges this assumption. 08 5562 lindsay-etal.qxp 1/22/2006 12:54 PM Page 172findings suggest that parents can and should encourage outdoor play. Questions of safetyand accessibility, however, may make it moredifficult for some parents and children tospend time outdoors. Minority and lower- income parents, for example, are more likely to live in communities with fewer parks,sports facilities, bike paths, and other places for children to be active and safe. 33 Although most research on television view- ing's influence on child obesity has been con- ducted among older children and adolescents,some studies have focused on preschool-agedchildren. A study of five- and six-year-old His- panic (predominantly Mexican American) children in Chicago found a link between TVviewing and overweight. 34R. H. DuRant and several colleagues directly observed three-andfour-year-old children in their homes and found that children who watched TV more hours a day and children who watched forlonger periods of time at one sitting were lesslikely to engage in physical activity. 35Another study of 2,761 adults with children aged oneto five years from forty-nine New Y ork State WIC agencies found that viewing TV and videos and having a TV in the bedroom wereboth linked with the prevalence of child over-weight. 36These studies indicate that parents should limit preschoolers' TV and video view-ing and keep televisions out of theirbedrooms. School-Aged Children and Youth National data indicate that 16 percent of chil - dren aged six to nineteen years are over- weight.37As children grow older and as they focus less on family and more on school,peers, and different media, parental influ-ence wanes. As adolescents, children spendincreasingly more time away from home, be - come more exposed to environments that en- courage obesity, and have greater choices intheir own diet and physical activities. When children make critical decisions about nutri-tion and physical activity on their own, par-ents' roles become even more challenging.Nevertheless, parents and family members can still provide a healthful home nutrition and physical activity environment. Parents and Healthful Eating in School-Aged Children Parents can encourage healthful eating habits at home by increasing the number of family meals eaten together, making healthful foodsavailable, and reducing the availability ofsugar-sweetened beverages and sodas. Studies show that eating dinner together as a family promotes healthful eating among chil-dren and adolescents by increasing their con-sumption of fruits, vegetables, and wholegrains and reducing their consumption of fatsand soft drinks. 38These same studies, how- ever, show that families eat dinner together less often as children grow older. One study found that nine-year -olds ate dinner with their family roughly half the time, while four - teen-year-olds ate dinner with their families only a third of the time.39It is crucial, there - fore, that parents maintain family eating practices throughout adolescence. As with preschool-aged children, the avail- ability of foods at home is a major influenceon older children's diets. Studies have foundthat making fruits and vegetables available athome increases children' s consumption of these foods. 40And parents must not only pro- vide healthful foods at home, but also eatthese foods themselves. Between 1965 and 1996, adolescents' soft drink consumption increased 150 percentwhile their consumption of fruit drinks in-creased 89 percent. As with young children,The Role of Parents in Preventing Childhood Obesity VOL. 16 / NO. 1 / SPRING 2006 17308 5562 lindsay-etal.qxp 1/22/2006 12:54 PM Page 173several studies indicate that sugar-sweetened beverages may play an important role in thechildhood obesity epidemic. 41A long-term study of children that began when they wereeleven and twelve years old found that their odds of becoming overweight increased 60 percent for each additional serving of sugar-sweetened drinks consumed daily. 42A second long-term study, this one beginning when children were nine to fourteen years old,linked consumption of sugar-added bever- ages with increased weight gains. 43In a ran- domized controlled trial in England, reduc-ing consumption of carbonated beverageslowered the prevalence of overweight among seven- to eleven-year-olds. 44Such findings show how important it is for parents to limittheir children's consumption of these bever-ages at home. Now that many schools aremaking a commitment to soda-free hallwaysand cafeterias, parents can follow their leadand keep their homes free of sugar-sweet-ened beverages as well. Parents and Older Children' s Activity Levels Children and adolescents spend more time watching television than they do in almostany other activity. By the time they reachschool-age, about half of U.S. children watchtelevision more than two hours a day, and 17percent of African American children watchmore than five hours a day . 45Many studies link TV viewing with overweight.46Random- ized controlled trials indicate that watchingfewer hours of TV can reduce children' s body mass index and obesity risk. 47TV viewing, therefore, may be one important cause ofchildhood obesity that parents can modify athome. TV viewing may increase overweight both by reducing children's physical activity and byencouraging poor eating habits in children byexposing them to commercials for unhealth- ful foods. 48Experimental results suggest both factors are at work.49According to a re- cent nationally representative survey, chil-dren from third through twelfth grade spend an estimated eight hours a day of media time \u2014using computers, listening to music,watching movies, playing computer and video games, and watching TV . About 26 per- cent of children are \"media multitaskers\"who go online while they watch TV , resulting in more exposure to the media environment simultaneously. 50 Studies of the contents of television adver- tisements document that children are ex- posed to a vast number of TV ads for sodas,cereal, candy, and fast food. 51And other re- search suggests that exposure to food com-mercials influences children' s preferences and food requests and can contribute to con- fusion among children about the relativehealth benefits of foods. Recent data indicate that 68 percent of chil - dren have a TV in their bedroom, and half have a video game player and a VCR or DVDplayer as well. Increasing numbers of chil - dren also have cable or satellite TV , com- puter , and Internet access in their bedrooms. Despite such widespread access, more thanhalf of children report that they have noparental rules on TV watching hours. Amongthose reporting such rules, only 20 percentsaid parents enforce them \"most\" of thetime. 52Limiting physical access to TV may help children reduce their TV viewing.53 Children with a TV in their room spend an estimated 1.5 hours more a day watching TVthan do those without a set in their room. 54 Parents can also help by limiting their own TV watching and sedentary behavior. Studiesshow that when parents are sedentary, theirAna C. , Katarina M. Sussner, Juhee OF CHILDREN08 5562 lindsay-etal.qxp 1/22/2006 12:54 PM Page 174children are more likely to be sedentary as well.55Adolescents whose parents watch TV more than two hours a day are more thantwice as likely to be physically inactive asthose children whose parents watch less. 56 During the transition from childhood to ado - lescence, children's physical activity drops off dramatically .57Although current guidelines recommend at least sixty minutes of physicalactivity for older children on most, preferablyall, days of the week, only 63 percent of ado - lescents reported meeting those guidelines in 1999. 58Parents can encourage older children to be more active. Studies suggest that partic - ipating in sports teams or exercise programs can help adolescents reduce their body massindex. 59 Some studies have found that children are more likely to be active if their parents are ac - tive, while others do not find this relationship and rather emphasize the importance ofparental support.60Many studies show that parents can promote children' s physical activ- ity by providing support and encourage- ment.61Further , those parents who realize the importance of physical activity may offer even greater support.62That support can take many forms: arranging access to after -school or community sports and activity programs, watching children' s activities, or simply play- ing with their children.63Parents' views about their children's competence and task orienta-tion may also affect their physical activity . 64 Concerns about traffic, drug dealers, crime, and violence may cause parents to limit placeswhere their child can play , thereby reducing their opportunities for activity. 65 Family-Based Obesity-Prevention Programs Although a great deal of research has been done on how parents shape their children' s eating and physical activity habits, surprisingly few high-quality data exist on the effectivenessThe Role of Parents in Preventing Childhood Obesity VOL. 16 / NO. 1 / SPRING 2006 175A Word of Caution to Parents about Encouraging Child Dieting Even though childhood obesity experts discourage dieting, parents who feel the need to control a child's weight commonly encourage dieting. Studies on dieting behaviors consistently report thattheir parents' inducement to diet is the most significant factor in causing children to begin dieting.Their parents' direct verbal encouragement is more influential than the parents' own dietingbehaviors. Many adolescents whose parents urged them to diet report engaging in unhealthful dieting behav- iors. Focusing on dieting for weight control may overemphasize the thinness ideal and over timemay even lead to an increased risk for obesity. It is important for parents of overweight children tolearn about the dangers of dieting and to talk with their child's doctor or health care providerabout ways to promote healthful habits.

One rea-son for the paucity of data is that, despitesome studies that indicate promising results,few programs are solely parent-based. Most efforts to involve parents are components of more comprehensive interventions. For exam-ple, many school-based programs aimed at preventing childhood obesity are targeted at children within school settings but includeparental components that help parents set lim- its on TV viewing and provide electronic \"lock-out\" devices. 66Likewise, health care- based interventions may add a parentingfocus. Meanwhile, a WIC-sponsored nutritionintervention will take place within the contextof WIC, but it might add a parental compo - nent aimed at reducing TV time. 67 As yet little to no information is available on the cost-effectiveness of obesity-preventioninterventions that have a parenting compo - nent. One middle-school program called Planet Health was found to be highly cost-effective\u2014in fact, more cost-effective eventhan commonly accepted preventive inter-ventions such as screening and treatment forhypertension. 68Precisely what influence the program's parental component specificallygenerated, however, is unclear. Nevertheless,creating more programs to improve parent - ing behaviors relevant to childhood over- weight is a highly promising strategy. Suchprograms would be most effective if they were targeted at children of various ages based on research that shows how parents can best help children at different develop-mental stages. Researchers should carefully evaluate the programs' effectiveness. Solely Parent-Based Interventions One solely parent-based intervention con- sisted of twenty-eight families of seven- totwelve-year-old African American children who received primary care at an urban com- munity clinic serving a low-income popula-tion. Families were randomly selected to re-ceive counseling alone or counseling plus a behavioral intervention that included an elec- tronic television time manager . Both groups reported similar decreases in their children's use of television, videotapes, and videogames. The behavioral intervention group re - ported significantly greater increases in or- ganized physical activity and somewhatgreater increases in playing outside. Changesin overall household television use and inmeals eaten while watching television also ap - peared to favor the behavioral intervention, with small to medium effect sizes, but thesedifferences were not statistically significant. 69 Another recent solely family-based interven - tion tested two versions of a culturally rele-vant program to prevent excess weight gain inpre-adolescent African American girls. Thegirls, aged eight to ten years, were dividedinto two groups, both of which participated inhighly interactive weekly group sessions. Inone group, the sessions targeted the girls; inthe other, the sessions were geared towardtheir parents or caregivers. Girls in bothgroups demonstrated a trend toward reducedbody mass index and waist circumference. Inaddition, girls in both groups reduced theirconsumption of sugar-sweetened beverages,increased their level of moderate to vigorousAna C. Lindsay , Katarina M.

Their parents' weeklynewsletters mirrored these sessions. A recenttwo-year follow-up study found that the in- tervention group's children had significantly smaller increases in body mass index than didthose in the control group. 72 Another recent study assessed the impact of the school-based Child and Adolescent Trial for Cardiovascular Health (CATCH) inter- vention among primarily Hispanic, low-income elementary school children. The in-tervention tested the effectiveness of changes in school food service, physical education, classroom curricula, and family activities.The family component consisted primarily ofskill-building activity packets that studentstook home to complete with their parents.Third and fourth graders and their familieswere also invited to participate in Family FunNights at the school. The family componentsupplemented the classroom curriculum,which focused on improving the children' s di- etary and physical activity knowledge, atti - tudes, and self-reported behaviors, and rein- forced the concepts, activities, and skills ofthe curriculum. Among both boys and girls,the intervention reduced overweight or therisk of overweight. 73 Another successful elementary school-based health behavior intervention on diet andphysical activity was the Eat Well and KeepMoving program. Classroom teachers inmath, science, language arts, and social stud-ies classes taught the quasi-experimental,two-year field trial among children in gradesfour and five, with six intervention and eightmatched control schools. The interventionprovided links to school food services andfamilies and provided training and wellnessprograms for teachers and other staff mem-The Role of Parents in Preventing Childhood Obesity VOL. 16 / NO. 1 / SPRING 2006 177activity, and increased their daily serving of water.70 Comprehensive Interventions with a Parenting Component Most interventions aimed at preventing over- weight and obesity have been school-based,and all have improved health knowledge and health-related behaviors to some extent. 71 Some of the most successful school-based in- terventions, however, have included a parent- ing component. These interventions have re- sulted in dramatic changes in healthbehaviors associated with child obesity andoverweight as well as in changes in body mass index or obesity. School-based interventions at the preschool level are scarce, but one study's findings pro-vide strong support for establishing such pro - grams. The Hip-Hop to Health Jr. program targeted three- to five-year-old minority chil-dren enrolled in Head Start programs inChicago, with the aim of reducing the ten-dency toward overweight and obesity inAfrican American and Latino preschool chil - dren. The intervention presented a develop- mentally , culturally , and linguistically appro - priate dietary and physical activity curriculum for preschoolers, and a parentcomponent addressed the families' dietaryand physical activity patterns. Each week ofthe intervention covered a particular topic,such as the importance of \"Go and Grow\"foods, eating fruit, and reducing TV viewing.Parents received weekly newsletters with in - formation that mirrored the children's cur- riculum on healthful eating and exercise aswell as a five- to fifteen-minute homeworkassignment that reinforced concepts pre-sented in the weekly newsletters. During thefourteen-week intervention, children in acontrol group attended a twenty-minute classonce a week in which they learned about var-08 5562 lindsay-etal.qxp 1/22/2006 12:54 PM Page 177bers. Its aim was to decrease the consump- tion of foods high in total and saturated fat, to increase fruit and vegetable intake, to reduce television viewing, and to increase physicalactivity. Compared with students in the con- trol schools, students in the intervention schools reduced their share of total energyfrom fat and saturated fat. They also in- creased their fruit and vegetable intake, vita- min C intake, and fiber consumption. They reduced their television viewing marginally. 74 Recently, a pilot study divided children in four elementary schools into an interventiongroup and a control group and evaluated howa school-based health report card affectedfamily awareness of and concerns about childweight status, plans for weight control, andpreventive behaviors. Parents of overweightchildren (including those at risk of over - weight) in the intervention group had greater awareness of their children's weight statusand initiated more activities to control weightthan did the parents of children in the con-trol group. 75 Planet Health was a two-year, school-based health behavior intervention targeting mid-dle school-aged boys and girls in sixth through eighth grades. Students participated in a school-based interdisciplinary program that used existing classroom teachers andtook place in four major subjects and physi- cal education classes. Sessions focused on decreasing both television viewing and theconsumption of high-fat foods and on in- creasing both fruit and vegetable intake and physical activity, with no explicit discussionof obesity. Compared with girls in the control group, girls in the intervention group re- duced their prevalence of obesity; no differ-ences were found among boys. The interven-tion reduced television hours among both girls and boys, increased fruit and vegetable consumption among both girls and boys, andreduced total energy intake among girls inthe intervention group compared with girlsin the control group. Among girls, obesityprevalence was reduced for each hour thattelevision viewing was reduced. Although notprimarily a parent-focused program, PlanetHealth had several family components, in-cluding an activity called \"Power Down,\"where the household together engaged in aTV charting exercise to reduce TV time. 76 Further analysis of Planet Health found a re - duced risk of disordered, or unhealthy, weight control behaviors in girls. An eco - nomic analysis found the program substan-tially cost-effective. 77 Obesity-related interventions have also fo- cused on limiting television viewing.78A re- cent randomized control trial called \"Switch-Play\" aimed to replace TV viewing time withmore physical activities. More than half thechildren reported reducing their TV viewingwhile less than half increased physical activ-ity. Most of the children enjoyed alternativeactivity programs, and only 7 to 17 percenthad difficulty turning off their favorite TVshows. 79Ana C. Lindsay , Katarina M. Sussner, Juhee Kim, and Steven Gortmaker 178 THE FUTURE OF CHILDRENA systematic review of research on familyinvolvement in weight controlrecently found that relativelyfew intervention studies exist,but those few suggest thatparental involvement helps children lose weight.08 5562 lindsay-etal.qxp 1/22/2006 12:54 PM Page 178An after-school intervention known as the GEMS pilot study tested the feasibility, ac-ceptability, and potential efficacy of after-school dance classes and a family-based inter-vention to reduce television viewing and weight gain among African American girls in Stanford, California. At the follow-up, girls inthe intervention group exhibited trends to- ward lower body mass index and waist cir- cumference, increased after-school physicalactivity, and reduced television, videotape, and video game use, as compared with the control group. The treatment group also re-ported significantly reduced household tele-vision viewing and fewer dinners eaten while watching TV . 80 Although intervention studies show the bene- fit of cutting TV hours, such practical barriersas long hours of parental work and inade - quate child care options make it difficult for families to implement these changes. Formany families, particularly in low-income,urban areas without safe places to play out-doors, TV is a substitute babysitter . Mothers are often more concerned with the types of TV programs their children watch than withhow much time their children spend watch - ing TV . These mothers raise the issue of af- fordable and accessible recreation facilitiesand programs and say the lack of such op-tions contributes to their children's watchingmore TV at home. 81 A systematic review of research on family in- volvement in weight control recently foundthat relatively few intervention studies exist,but those few suggest that parental involve-ment helps children lose weight. 82The stud - ies also indicate that results, in terms of weight loss and behavioral changes, are bet-ter when children are treated together withtheir parents. 83Involving at least one parent in a weight-loss process improves overallshort- and long-term weight regulation, as does overall support from family and friends.84For families with several members battling overweight, family treatment cansubstantially reduce the per-person costs of obesity treatment, and children and their parents can achieve similar percentages ofoverweight change. 85 Conclusion Parents play a critical role at home in pre- venting childhood obesity, with their role changing at different stages of their child'sdevelopment. By better understanding theirown role in influencing their child's dietary practices, physical activity, sedentary behav- iors, and ultimately weight status, parents canlearn how to create a healthful nutrition envi-ronment in their home, provide opportuni-ties for physical activity , discourage sedentary behaviors such as TV viewing, and serve as role models themselves. Obesity-related in-tervention programs can use parental in - volvement as one key to success in develop- ing an environment that fosters healthyeating and physical activity among childrenand adolescents. Although few interventions solely target parents, current evidence suggests that par - enting interventions may work best as acomponent of comprehensive interventionswithin a variety of settings, includingschools, health services, or such programs asWIC. Recent research highlights the suc-cess of school-based programs, such asPlanet Health, CATCH, Eat Well and KeepMoving, and the GEMS pilot study, that in-corporate parenting and at-home compo - nents into their curricula. 86Another poten- tial avenue is to incorporate parentingeducation modules into well-establishedpublic health and educational programs,such as WIC, Head Start, and birthingThe Role of Parents in Preventing Childhood Obesity VOL. 16 / NO. 1 / SPRING 2006 17908 5562 lindsay-etal.qxp 1/22/2006 12:54 PM Page 179classes, following the model of such pro- grams as Hip-Hop to Health Jr .87 As more of these interventions are created, researchers should carefully evaluate their cost-effectiveness. New interventions should replace those that are based either in schoolalone or in a health center alone with strate- gies that affect multiple settings at the same time. 88Community, statewide, and national obesity-prevention programs should empha- size an educational collaboration among schools, health centers, and parents.Achieving the goal of preventing and control- ling the childhood obesity epidemic requires multifaceted and community-wide programs and policies. But even in such broad andcomprehensive programs, parents have a critical and influential role to play. Interven- tions should involve and work directly withparents from the very earliest stages of child development and growth both to make healthful changes at home and to reinforceand support healthful eating and regular physical activity.Ana C.

The disparities pose a major chal- lenge for policymakers and practitioners planning strategies for obesity prevention. In this arti - cle Shiriki Kumanyika and Sonya Grier summarize differences in childhood obesity prevalence by race and ethnicity and by socioeconomic status. They show how various environmental fac-tors can have larger effects on disadvantaged and minority children than on their advantagedwhite peers\u2014and thus contribute to disparities in obesity rates. The authors show , for example, that low-income and minority children watch more television than white, non-poor children and are potentially exposed to more commercials advertising high-calorie, low-nutrient food during an average hour of TV programming. They note thatneighborhoods where low-income and minority children live typically have more fast-foodrestaurants and fewer vendors of healthful foods than do wealthier or predominantly whiteneighborhoods. They cite such obstacles to physical activity as unsafe streets, dilapidated parks,and lack of facilities. In the schools that low-income and minority children attend, however,they see opportunities to lead the way to effective obesity prevention. Finally , the authors examine several aspects of the home environment\u2014breast-feeding, television viewing, andparental behaviors\u2014that may contribute to childhood obesity but be amenable to changethrough targeted intervention. Kumanyika and Grier point out that policymakers aiming to prevent obesity can use many ex- isting policy levers to reach ethnic minority and low-income children and families: Medicaid,the State Child Health Insurance Program, and federal nutrition \"safety net\" programs. Ulti-mately, winning the fight against childhood obesity in minority and low-income communitieswill depend on the nation' s will to change the social and physical environments in which these communities exist.

In this article, we present and summarize data from multiple sources on racial, ethnic,and related socioeconomic correlates of obe-sity. We document differences in child obe- sity across race and ethnic groups and be- tween low- and high-income children. W e then consider which obesity-promoting fac- tors might be more prevalent or more inten-sified among low-income and ethnic minoritychildren than among the general population,with an eye toward identifying modificationsthat would do the most to prevent obesity . We try to highlight issues for diverse minority populations, but because far more informa - tion is available about African Americans and Hispanic Americans than about other groups,the discussion focuses mostly on these twopopulations. 2 Obesity Prevalence among Minority and Low-IncomeChildren No single data source provides information on trends in child obesity for all the majorracial and ethnic groups in the United States.The National Health and Nutrition Examina-tion Survey (NHANES), a nationally repre-sentative survey that has been conducted pe - riodically since the early 1970s, has large enough samples of white, African American,and (since 1982) Mexican American childrento estimate obesity rates within racial andethnic groups at different points in time.Table 1, which is based on NHANES data, shows rates of obesity for white, African American, and Mexican American boys and girls in two age groups, ages six to eleven andtwelve to nineteen, for three time periods since the mid-1970s. Although obesity rates have increased for boys and girls within eachethnic and racial group, they have increased more for African American and Mexican American children. By 1999-2002, obesityrates were higher for both of these two groups than for white children within each age and gender group. In some cases, obesity rates forethnic minority children exceeded rates forwhite children by 10 to 12 percentage points. For boys of both age groups, the obesity rate among Mexican Americans exceeded thatamong African Americans. For example,nearly a quarter of Mexican American adoles-cent boys were obese in 1999-2002, as against19 percent of African Americans and 15 per-cent of whites. This pattern differs for girls,with the highest obesity rates found amongAfrican American girls. For example, amongadolescent girls, 24 percent of African Ameri - cans, 20 percent of Mexican Americans, and 13 percent of whites were obese. Several other ethnic minority groups have high rates of child obesity . Measures of obe- sity for preschool children participating inHawaii's Supplemental Nutrition Program forWomen, Infants, and Children (WIC) indicate that more than a quarter of Samoan children are obese, a rate more than double that for anyother ethnic subgroup represented in the sam - ple. 3Note, however, that the WIC sample is not representative\u2014families must be low-income and nutritionally \"at risk\" to qualify . Obesity rates are also high among American Indian children. A large Indian Health Servicestudy estimated obesity prevalence at 22 per - cent for boys and 18 percent for girls based on data for more than 12,000 five- to seventeen-Shiriki Kumanyika and Sonya 1/22/2006 12:55 PM Page 188year-old American Indian children in North and South Dakota, Iowa, and Nebraska.4A study of seven American Indian communitiesin Arizona, New Mexico, and South Dakotareported obesity prevalence of 26.8 percentfor boys and 30.5 percent for girls based ondata for 1,704 elementary school children withan average age of 7.6 years. 5As with U.S. chil- dren generally, trend data for Navajo six- totwelve-year -olds showed an increase in obesity rates over time. 6 Asian American children are an exception to the general pattern of higher obesity ratesamong ethnic minority groups. A 2003 studyof New Y ork City elementary school children found obesity rates of 31 percent for Hispan- ics, 23 percent for African Americans, 16 per-cent for whites, and 14 percent for AsianAmericans. 7Another study compared over- weight (with an 85th percentile BMI cutoff)for white, African American, Hispanic, and Asian American adolescents in 1996, usingdata from the National Longitudinal Study ofAdolescent Health. 8This survey of more than 14,000 students in seventh through twelfthgrade indicates that Asian American adoles-cents have relatively low rates of overweight.The share of boys that were overweight was23 percent among Asian Americans, 26 per-cent among African Americans, 27 percentamong whites, and 28 percent among His-panics. Among girls, only 10 percent of AsianAmericans were overweight, as against 22percent of whites, 30 percent of Hispanics,and 38 percent of African Americans. How-ever, in adults, a BMI below the usual cutoff for obesity is associated with higher health risks in people of Asian origin when com-pared to other populations. 9If this case is also true in children, the lower prevalence ofobesity in Asian American children does notTargeting Interventions for Ethnic Minority and Low-Income Populations VOL. 16 / NO. 1 / SPRING 2006 189Table 1.

Low-income children are at excess risk of obesity regardless of ethnicity, although eth- nic differences in pediatric obesity appear at lower-income levels.10Several authors have analyzed NHANES data on the links between socioeconomic status and obesity among chil- dren and youth overall and in specific agegroups. 11One analysis of two- to nineteen- year-old children in NHANES surveys be- tween 1971-74 and 1999-2002 finds higherrates of obesity among all children after 1976-80. 12Sim- ilarly , the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth for four- to twelve-year-olds indicates that low-income children have higher obesityrates than do wealthier children. 13 The association between socioeconomic sta - tus and obesity in school-aged children and adolescents varies by ethnicity and genderand appears to be quite complex. 14In gen - eral, among white children, obesity typically declines as income and parental educationincrease. Different patterns have been foundfor children from ethnic minority groups. Forexample, among twelve- to seventeen-year-old non-Hispanic white children in the1988-94 NHANES survey, rates of obesitydecline for both boys and girls as family in-come increases. By contrast, among African Americans and Mexican Americans, girls' obesity rates increase with income; boys' rates show no consistent pattern. 15Another study found that although rates of obesity for white girls decrease as family income rises, rates for African American girls are higher inthe lowest and highest income ranges than in the in-between bracket. 16For both groups, however, obesity rates decline with higherparental education. An analysis of the Na- tional Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Growth and Health Study also noted ethnicdifferences in the relationship between so-cioeconomic status and obesity. 17It found the expected inverse link between obesity and both parental income and education\u2014with obesity decreasing as income or educa-tion increased\u2014in white girls but not inAfrican American girls. Overall, these studiesindicate that differences in obesity ratesacross race and ethnic groups do not simplyreflect differences in the average socioeco - nomic status across groups. In summary , obesity rates are higher for African American and Hispanic children and adolescents than for their white peers. AmongAfrican Americans rates are particularly highamong girls, although the disparity varies byage and socioeconomic status. Hispanic boysseem to be at particularly high risk for obesity.Obesity rates for American Indian childrenappear to be comparable to or in some caseshigher than those for African American chil-dren. Samoan children are also at high risk.Asian American children, by contrast, are lesslikely than those from other ethnic groups tobe obese by standard definitions although theapplicability of the standard definitions toAsian Americans is unclear. Although poorerchildren are more likely to be obese when allchildren are considered, this link varies acrossethnic and racial groups.Shiriki Kumanyika and Sonya Grier 190 THE FUTURE OF CHILDRENLow-income children are at excess risk of obesityregardless of ethnicity,although ethnic differences in pediatric obesity appear levels.09 5562 kumanyika.qxp 1/22/2006 12:55 PM Page 190Health Effects of Childhood Obesity on Minority and Low-Income Populations Early observers tracking the increase in childhood obesity were concerned that obese children would become obese adults and suf- fer obesity-related health complications.18 Their concerns, however, are now more im- mediate: obese children are already suffering from these complications. Stephen Daniels,in an article in this volume, documents the many health problems that accompany child- hood obesity. Obesity-related diseases seenin children include precursors of cardiovas-cular disease, type 2 diabetes, and sleep- disordered breathing. 19 Ethnic minority and low-income children ap- pear more likely to experience some of theobesity-related health problems. T ype 2 dia- betes provides a useful example. Among adults, type 2 diabetes is more commonamong African Americans and Hispanicsthan among whites. Although many of thedata on type 2 diabetes in children comefrom clinic records or case studies ratherthan from population samples, the datastrongly suggest that the patterns of diabetesrisk for children and adolescents parallelthose for adults. 20Similarly , symptoms of metabolic syndrome\u2014an important risk fac-tor for diabetes and cardiovascular diseaseamong adults\u2014are more prevalent in somealthough not all minority youth populations. 21 In the 1988-94 NHANES, the metabolic syndrome was more prevalent in MexicanAmerican adolescents than in whites (girlsonly) but less prevalent in blacks than inwhites (both sexes). 22Left ventricular hyper - trophy, or thickening of the heart's main pumping chamber, and sleep apnea are twoother health consequences of pediatric obe - sity that are also more prevalent in some eth- nic minority groups. For example, one studyof a sample of children (with an average age of 13.6 years) being evaluated for high blood pressure found left ventricular hypertrophy in 70 percent of Hispanics, 39 percent ofAfrican Americans, and 33 percent of whites. 23In an overnight sleep-monitoring study of children aged two to eighteen years,African Americans had higher odds than whites of having sleep apnea. 24 The higher rates of obesity among ethnic mi- nority and low-income children, when com- bined with the adverse health effects of childobesity, are likely to produce continued racialand economic differences in health out- comes. Preventing obesity for all children may be a way to reduce socioeconomic andethnic health disparities. Understanding and Closing the Gap Effectively addressing ethnic and socioeco- nomic disparities in childhood obesity re - quires understanding which causes of obesity might be especially prevalent or intensifiedin ethnic minority and low-income popula - tions; understanding how aspects of the so- cial, cultural, and economic environments ofminority and low-income children mightmagnify the effects of factors that cause obe - sity; and determining which changes in thoseenvironments would help most to reduceobesity . In what follows, we discuss these is - sues in relation to media and marketing influ- ences, community food access, built environ-ments, schools, and home environments,noting in each case how factors that may pro-mote obesity are particularly likely to affectlow-income and minority youth. Media and Marketing Research suggests that low-income and eth - nic minority youth are disproportionately ex- posed to marketing activities.25A KaiserTargeting Interventions for Ethnic Minority and Low-Income Populations VOL. 16 / NO. 1 / SPRING 2006 19109 5562 kumanyika.qxp 1/22/2006 12:55 PM Page 191Foundation report found that among chil- dren eight to eighteen years old, ethnic mi-norities use entertainment media more heav-ily than majority youth do. AfricanAmericans and Hispanics spend significantly more time watching TV and movies and play- ing video games than do white youth. 26 African American youth also watch on-screen media (TV , DVDs, videos, movies) more than Hispanics and whites do, and Hispanicswatch such media significantly more than whites do. Television is especially prevalent in African American and low-income house-holds. Media use differs, as well, by socioe-conomic status. Low-income children watch TV for more hours and have significantly higher levels of total media exposure thanhigher-income children. 27Consumers in low- income households, who are heavy viewers ofdaytime television, are more likely to viewtelevision advertising as authoritative and ashelpful in selecting products, and they mayprefer it to print media. 28 Because of their heavy media use, ethnic mi - nority and low-income youth are exposed to a great deal of food advertising at home. Re-search has found that such advertising can af - fect children's food preferences after even brief exposure. 29A study of media use among Latino preschoolers confirmed just how in-fluential such commercials can be. Sixty-three percent of mothers said that in the pastweek their preschooler had asked for a toyadvertised on television, 55 percent reportedthat their preschooler had asked for an adver - tised food or drink, and 67 percent noted that their preschooler had asked to go to an ad-vertised store or restaurant. 30Older elemen - tary school children exposed to television commercials for sweets and other snackswere more likely to choose candy and sugarydrinks and less likely to choose fruit and or-ange juice when offered a snack. 31Most research on food advertising, however, does not focus on ethnic minority or low- income youth. A systematic review of the ef- fects of food promotion on children exam-ined more than 100 articles, fewer than six of which dealt explicitly with ethnic minority or low-income children. 32Experimental evi- dence, however, indicates that ethnic minori- ties seem especially responsive to targeted ads.33African American adolescents, for ex- ample, identify with black characters in ad- vertisements, and they rate advertisements featuring these characters more favorably.34 Such responses may lead them to buy and consume less nutritious food products when advertised by these characters. Ethnic minority and low-income children may also be exposed to a different mix of in-formation than are other children. Contentanalyses of television advertising have foundthat shows featuring African Americans havemore food commercials than do generalprime-time shows and that these commer-cials feature more energy-dense foods. 35Ad- vertisements for such products appear to be particularly effective in increasing children'stotal caloric consumption. 36Advertisements in African American adult magazines are alsodominated by low-cost, low-nutrition, en - ergy-dense foods, and the magazines are lesslikely to contain health-oriented messages. 37 Similarly , a content analysis of the products advertised to low-income consumers found that most featured food and drinks, largelyitems such as cookies and other snacks. 38 Such an imbalanced information environ- ment makes it harder for parents to knowabout and to provide more healthful options. Food and food-related images, such as body size, are also pervasive in various media. Acontent analysis of movies\u2014and ethnic mi-norities watch movies more often than whitesShiriki Kumanyika body shape, gender, andethnic background. 39More healthful, low-fat foods often appeared in scenes involvingwell-educated and affluent characters. Over- weight characters were underrepresented, but when they did appear, they ate morehigh-fat, high-calorie foods than did their thinner counterparts. There is no evidence, however, on whether the movies' representa-tion of food and food-related images affects how children perceive themselves or alters the foods they consume. More research on the specific marketing envi- ronments of ethnic minority and low-income consumers is urgently needed. Policymakersand practitioners should consider policy inter-ventions, including strengthening marketingand advertising guidelines in ways that reducethe overexposure of all children to marketingfor high-calorie, high-fat foods. 40Because ethnic minority and low-income children areexposed to more media than other children,policies that improve marketing and advertis - ing may be most beneficial for these groups of children. Researchers have also suggestedthat schools can reduce the negative effects ofadvertising on minority and low-income chil-dren by teaching media literacy courses thatmake children aware of the many messagesthey receive daily from the media and howthose messages can affect their attitudes andbehavior . 41 Food Access and A vailability The characteristics of communities in which ethnic minority and low-income children livemay affect the foods that are available fortheir consumption. Compared with more af-fluent communities, minority and low-income communities have fewer than aver - age supermarkets and convenience stores that stock fresh, good-quality, affordablefoods such as whole grains or low-fat dairy products and meats. 42A 1995 study esti- mated that supermarket flight from the innercities left the typical low-income neighbor-hood with 30 percent fewer supermarkets than higher-income areas. At least one study that included a large cohort of African Amer- icans has linked supermarket availability di - rectly to fruit and vegetable intake. 43 With fewer supermarkets available, low- income minority families may be more likely to shop in small corner stores or bodegas.These stores tend to offer markedly lesshealthful foods in lower -income neighbor- hoods, as demonstrated in a New York studycomparing in-store food availability in low-in-come, minority East Harlem and the adja - cent, affluent Upper East Side. 44Prices of more healthful foods may also be higher inbodegas and corner stores than in supermar - kets. One study reported that although low- fat milk was available in more than two-thirdsof the bodegas in areas where residents wereless educated, had lower incomes, and wereLatino, some such stores charged more forlow-fat milk than for regular milk. 45Evidence shows that higher prices for more healthfulfoods have an effect on children's weight. ATargeting Interventions for Ethnic Minority and Low-Income Populations VOL. 16 / NO. 1 / SPRING 2006 193Content analyses of television advertising have found thatshows featuring AfricanAmericans have more foodcommercials than do generalprime-time 1/22/2006 on a nationally representa- tive sample of elementary school children concludes that children living in areas with lower prices of fruits and vegetables had sig-nificantly lower gains in BMI between kinder- garten and third grade. Further, these effects were larger for children in poverty, childrenwho were obese or overweight in kinder- garten, and Asian and Hispanic children. 46 This evidence is consistent with that from a study of low-income women in Baltimore that found the cost of fresh produce kept them from eating more fruits and vegetables.47 African American and low-income neighbor- hoods also have many fast-food restaurants. Arecent study found that African Americanadults ate more fast foods than did whites,perhaps because of their greater availabil-ity. 48A study in New Orleans found that black neighborhoods had more fast-foodrestaurants per square mile than did whiteneighborhoods. 49Another study found that areas of South Los Angeles with fewerAfrican American residents (8 percent on av-erage) were twice as likely as areas with moreAfrican Americans (36 percent on average) tohave full-service rather than limited-service,fast-food restaurants. 50 Studies of parents' attitudes toward fast-food restaurants highlight the problems that maybe produced by having fast-food outlets nearby as well as the reasons why fast-food outlets are popular among low-income fami- lies. Hispanic women in a low-income com-munity reported that the overabundance of fast-food restaurants and their intensive mar- keting interfered with their ability to exercisecontrol over their children's eating habits. They also reported that acculturation to fast food caused their children to reject morehealthful, traditional Hispanic foods. 51But Latino women in a California study preferred fast-food restaurants and especially valuedtheir family- and child-friendly aspects. 52 On the important question of whether living near fast-food restaurants increases thechance that children become obese, the evi-dence is inconclusive. Research has found thatfoods served in fast-food outlets are muchmore energy-dense and have a higher fat con-tent than meals consumed at home. 53Further- more, there is a correlation between fast-foodconsumption and body weight, at least amongadults. In a survey of women aged twenty toseventy years in North Carolina, those who re - ported eating at fast-food restaurants \"usually\" or \"often\" had higher energy and fat intakesand higher body mass indexes than those whoreported eating at them \"rarely\" or \"never .\" 54 In the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) Study, which fol-lowed for fifteen years a group of young adultsaged eighteen to thirty at the time of enroll-ment, those who ate at fast-food restaurantsmore than twice a week weighed an average of4.5 kilograms more than those who ate inthem less than once a week. 55 This evidence suggests that if children who live close to fast-food outlets consume morefast food, they may be more likely to becomeobese. But the few studies that specificallyexamine how the proximity of fast-food out-Shiriki Kumanyika and Sonya Grier 194 THE FUTURE OF CHILDRENA study in New Orleans found that blackneighborhoods had more fast-food restaurants persquare mile than Page 194lets affects children's fast-food consumption and their weight status do not find a connec-tion. Living close to fast-food restaurants wasnot linked with being overweight amongthree- to five-year-old children in Cincinnati or to the self-reported frequency of fast-food restaurant use among seventh- to twelfth-grade students in Minnesota. 56Researchers require more evidence, based on children from more geographical regions and agegroups, before they can draw a definitive conclusion on this issue. Built Environments Where and how often children and adoles- cents engage in physical activity depends on the physical design and quality of their neigh - borhoods.57In low-income urban communi- ties, the built environment affects children'sphysical activity much more than it affectsthat of adults. Because many adults do notown cars and must depend on public trans-portation, they often have to be physically ac - tive just to get to and from work or shop- ping. 58By contrast, for safety reasons, parents may restrict their children' s outdoor activities by using a combination of TV and easy access to snack foods to get children to go straighthome from school and stay there. Children'slimited access to parks and recreational facili - ties may also curtail their physical activity. 59 Neighborhood or community constraints on children' s physical activity are likely to vary regionally and across ethnic groups. In low- income communities, family work schedules,discretionary time, money , and car ownership may make it hard for parents and caregivers to transport children to sports and otherrecreational activities, suggesting the need todevelop nearby after-school or community-based, supervised programs. Despite the logic that inadequate opportuni- ties for physical activity should adversely af-fect children's weight, the evidence on this issue is limited. Several observational studies have failed to link children's weight status to the availability of neighborhood parks or toparental perceptions about safety. 60A better approach would be to study direct links be- tween specific neighborhood-based physicalactivity options and the types and amounts of physical activity in which children engage, taking into account how their family or homelife, as well as the neighborhood's social or- ganization, affects their access to these op- tions. Additional research on this topic thatfocuses on low-income and minority childrenis needed. School Settings Schools offer opportunities for improving children's nutrition, increasing their physicalactivity , and preventing obesity. But schools in inner-city or low-income communities may be unable to take advantage of these opportuni-ties, as most obesity-prevention initiativesproposed to date require significant fundingand some depend on a school' s physical facili - ties and neighborhood characteristics. 61In addition, school officials, teachers, and par-ents have many competing priorities, such asnew academic accountability standards andefforts to prevent drug abuse and violence. Research on whether schools in low-income areas are less able to provide students withhealthful foods or physical activity options isinconclusive. Several reports have comparedenvironmental quality , resources, and per - student spending in schools with differing community income or differing shares of mi-nority students. A report by the U.S. GeneralAccounting Office (GAO) focused on suchschool problems as inadequate or unsatisfac-tory buildings, building features, or environ - mental conditions as well as expenses above the national average. Schools reporting theTargeting Interventions for Ethnic Minority and Low-Income Populations VOL. 16 / NO. 1 / SPRING 2006 19509 5562 kumanyika.qxp 1/22/2006 12:55 PM Page 195most problems in all areas were large schools, central-city schools, schools in the western United States, schools with populations of at least 50.5 percent minority students, andschools with 70 percent or more poor stu- dents. 62The differences, however, were often not striking, and the greatest variationswere often by state. A Centers for Disease Control and Preven- tion analysis addressed general health and safety issues as well as conditions and poli- cies with more direct implications for physi-cal activity and nutrition. It included ath-letic facilities and playground equipment, kitchen facilities and equipment, the pres- ence of a cafeteria, soft drink vending con - tracts, and junk food promotion. 63Contrary to expectation, schools in urban areas,schools with a high share of minority chil - dren, and schools with a low share of col- lege-bound students were not worse offthan other schools. Schools with the besthealth-protective environments turned outto be elementary schools, public schools,and larger schools. Poorer children benefit from the National School Lunch and National School BreakfastPrograms. These food programs, which pro - vide free or reduced-price meals to low-income children, disproportionately enrollminority children. In 2004, in fourth grade,for example, nearly 70 percent of AfricanAmerican students, as against 23 percent ofwhites, were eligible for free or reduced-price lunches. Nearly half of African Ameri-can students, as against only 5 percent ofwhites, attended schools where most childrenare eligible for subsidized meals. 64Because these meals must meet federally set nutri-tional standards, these programs offer an op - portunity to improve the nutrition of low- income minority children.Although poorer children are eligible for free or reduced-price lunches in school, many schools offer a wide variety of \"competitive\" foods that do not meet nutritional standards.Schools that participate in the school lunch program face some federal restrictions on what foods they can serve during lunch peri-ods in the school cafeteria, and many states and school districts are imposing additional standards. 65But children can often purchase sodas and high-fat, high-sugar foods at school. As noted by the Government Accountability Office, these unregulated competitive foodsundermine the school breakfast and schoollunch programs, with negative nutrition im- plications for the children, but they may gen- erate substantial revenue for the schools. 66 The GAO report does not indicate whether schools with limited resources depend moreon revenue from competitive food sales thando wealthier schools. If they do, limitations oncompetitive food sales may impose a relativelylarger burden on low-income schools. Moreresearch on this topic is needed. If in fact low-income schools will be disproportionatelyharmed by restrictions on competitive foods,then new regulations on competitive foodsales might be coupled with compensatory fi - nancing for the schools most harmed. In addition to restricting the sales of less healthful foods, many schools are consideringinterventions to promote the consumption ofmore nutritious foods. Some of these initia-tives may be more effective in schools servinglow-income children than in schools withmore resources. For example, an interven-tion that lowered the prices of fruits and veg-etables had a greater impact in inner -city schools than in suburban schools and sug- gests that making nutritious foods more ac-cessible in these schools can increase de - mand. 67In-school free fruit and vegetable distribution should be of particular benefit toShiriki Kumanyika and PM Page 196low-income children, who have less access to fruits and vegetables than their more affluent counterparts. Such approaches as salad bars with links to local farmers' markets or evenstudent gardening programs could also be useful. 68But before any such programs can begin on a large scale, comparative analysis ofthe availability of the community resources required for feasibility is essential. Home and Family Settings Another important question for researchers analyzing ethnic and socioeconomic dispari-ties in childhood obesity is whether differ-ences in home environments contribute to differences in child obesity rates. There are various underlying reasons why parentingpractices may differ across ethnic and socio-economic groups. Minority and low-incomehouseholds have a higher share of female-headed families, lower parental education,and higher rates of teen parenting, all ofwhich may profoundly affect the home envi - ronment. 69Economic insecurity can influence food choices directly , by encouraging the pur - chase of cheaper , energy-dense foods, and in- directly, by producing psychosocial stress that affects parenting.70The higher prevalence of obesity among adults in minority and low-income populations may also affect children' s weight status. 71Maternal obesity and dia- betes, both relatively more common amongminority women, may predispose children toobesity. 72In addition, obesity among parents may affect both the weight norms their chil-dren develop and the modeling of eating be - haviors and physical activity they observe. In what follows, we focus on three aspects of the home environment\u2014breast-feeding, tele-vision viewing, and parental attitudes andbehaviors. Each may be of particular impor - tance for the development of obesity in eth- nic minority and low-income children andmay be amenable to change through targeted interventions. Breast-feeding. Although breast-feeding rates for all groups have increased notably in recent years, disadvantaged minority groups still have lower rates than others.73As of 2001, the rates of breast-feeding for African American infants were 53 percent in-hospital and 22 percent at age six months. For Hispanics, the rates were 73 percent in-hospital and 33 per- cent at six months, whereas for whites, therates were 72 percent in-hospital and 34 per-cent at six months. 74High rates of teen preg - nancy may contribute to lower breast-feeding rates, early introduction of solid foods, andearly feeding of high-sugar foods for AfricanAmerican infants. 75In another article in this volume Ana Lindsay and several colleaguesnote that the evidence on whether childrenwho are breast-fed longer are less likely to be-come obese is inconclusive. Instead, motherswho choose to breast-feed may be more likelyto adopt other behaviors that reduce thechance of obesity . Nonetheless, the link be - tween longer breast-feeding and a lower risk of obesity, combined with the other well-doc-umented benefits of breast-feeding, arguesfor efforts to increase breast-feeding amongethnic minority families. Television viewing. TV watching may con- tribute to obesity by increasing sedentary be-Targeting Interventions for Ethnic Minority and Low-Income Populations VOL. 16 / NO. 1 / SPRING 2006 197Schools with the best health- protective environmentsturned out to be public schools, kumanyika.qxp 1/22/2006 Page 197havior, increasing TV , and exposing children to advertisementsfor unhealthful foods and beverages. 76The Institute of Medicine has recommended thatparents restrict their children's television watching to fewer than two hours a day. 77 Television's pervasive role in the lives of mi- nority and low-income children, however, may make it hard for parents to turn off the TV. As noted, ethnic minority and low- income children have, as a group, high aver - age levels of television viewing. African American households that can afford themare more likely than others to have premiumchannels and to have three or more TV sets. 78 Interestingly, the lower their parents' educa- tion, the higher the likelihood that a child willhave a VCR or DVD in the bedroom. AfricanAmerican children are also more likely thanwhites to report having televisions in theirbedrooms, along with DVDs, cable and satel - lite connections, premium channels, and video game consoles. Youth from the lowestincome group are the most likely to havetheir own television sets. Watching televisionduring meals is also more common in familieswith lower parental education, or lower in - come, as well as among Hispanics and African Americans. The National Heart,Lung, and Blood Institute Growth and Health Study found that eating while watch-ing TV was more common among AfricanAmerican girls. This practice is also linkedwith reported higher caloric intake. 79 Developing interventions, possibly school- or child care center-based, to help low-income and minority parents reduce their children's TV time is important. Such interventionscould also teach parents to help their chil- dren learn to evaluate critically the advertise- ments and programs they see at home. Parental attitudes and behaviors. Efforts to get parents to pay closer attention to their children' s weight and BMI can be controver - sial, because some parents can become overly restrictive about their children's foodintake. Addressing childhood obesity issueswith parents in minority and lower-incomecommunities requires particular sensitivityto differences in attitudes about weight thatmay be the products of culture or economicinsecurity . Societal attitudes about weight may be changing as more and more adults becomeoverweight and obese. But in communitieswhere most women or adults are obese, as inmany ethnic minority and low-income com-munities, attitudes, norms, behaviors, andcultural influences may be in equilibriumwith a high level of obesity. There may be amixture of positive and negative attitudesabout being overweight, especially wherepeople who are thin are thought to be sick,addicted to drugs, too poor to have enough toeat, or to risk \"wasting away\" in the case offood shortage or of serious illness. 80In such environments, parents and other familymembers may consider being overweight asnormal, perhaps determined by heredity.Shapeliness, robustness, and nurturing quali-Shiriki Kumanyika and Sonya Grier 198 THE FUTURE OF CHILDRENHigh rates of teen pregnancy may contribute to lowerbreast-feeding rates, earlyintroduction of solid foods,and early feeding of for American infants.09 5562 kumanyika.qxp 1/22/2006 12:55 PM Page 198ties may be standards of female attractiveness that encourage the overall acceptance of peo-ple who\u2014by BMI standards\u2014are otherwiseconsidered overweight or obese. One studyfound that African American girls were more likely than white girls to try to gain weight, largely because their parents told them theywere too thin. 81 Several child feeding attitudes or practices that are theoretically associated with obesity development are common among low- income mothers. Among them are height-ened concerns about a child being hungry;greater difficulty withholding food from a child, even one who has just eaten; and con- cern about underweight even if a child isabove normal weight. 82Focus groups have found that low-income parents may see theiroverweight or obese children as \"thick orsolid.\" And other family members mightchallenge parents if they try to control theirchild' s diet. 83The view that \"a fat child is a healthy child\" or that children's weight fol-lows a natural trajectory where heavy chil - dren will \"grow out of it\" may be more com - mon among families that are food insecure or where hunger concerns are part of a group' s identity. In spite of such cultural differences, pro- grams to motivate and educate low-incomeparents and caregivers in diverse ethnic mi - nority populations about how to promote healthful eating and physical activity in theirchildren, combined with programs for thechildren themselves, have yielded promisingresults. 84Childhood obesity-prevention pro- grams should also work with parents on theirown weight issues. By promoting an under-standing of the core principles of energy bal-ance and by helping parents model the tar - geted nutrition and physical activity behaviors for their children, such programscould lead to favorable changes at home. Given the challenges of parenting in low-in-come communities, these programs shouldlessen rather than increase the stresses onparents by helping them and their children in ways that go beyond eating and physical ac- tivity. For example, after-school programscould include tutoring and time to do home- work in addition to providing healthful snacks, dance, and active play. 85Working with girls and their mothers together\u2014coun- seling mothers about weight control and hav- ing them interact with their daughters\u2014maybe particularly effective for African Americanpreadolescent or adolescent girls. 86The ideal program simultaneously addresses many is- sues, including empowerment strategies, inthe community, school, and home. Conclusions and Implications Any strategy to address childhood obesity in the overall population must include targetedinterventions for children in the nation' s mi- nority and low-income families. Preventing child obesity in ethnic minority and low-income populations requires thinkingthrough all the issues that apply to the popu-lation at large and then considering howthese issues might differ in a population withdifferent socio-cultural characteristics andusually less favorable health profiles, environ-mental circumstances, and life chances. To date, the research on childhood obesity that is specifically focused on ethnic minority andlow-income populations is limited. But theavailable evidence clearly shows that thehigher rates of obesity in minority and low-income communities are associated with aplethora of unfavorable influences\u2014economicstresses, reduced access to affordable healthfulfoods and opportunities for physical activity , overexposure to targeted advertising and mar- keting of energy-dense foods, and factors re-Targeting Interventions for Ethnic Minority and Low-Income Populations VOL. 16 / NO. 1 / SPRING 2006 19909 5562 kumanyika.qxp 1/22/2006 12:55 PM Page 199lated to family ecologies. Simply counseling parents and children about weight control will be almost pointless in environments that work against carrying out recommendations forhealthful eating and physical activity. To iden- tify environmental changes that will most likely reduce childhood obesity in minority and low-income communities requires more investiga- tion. Researchers also should focus on how culturally influenced attitudes and practicesinteract with environmental variables. Although reducing obesity prevalence among minority and low-income children will not bepossible without also improving their social and economic environments, clearly tremen- dous opportunities exist for targeted policiesand interventions. In particular, policymakerscan reinforce current programs that fosternutritional equity\u2014food stamps, school andchild care center feeding programs, and thesupplemental WIC program\u2014by adding aspecific component on childhood obesity . They may also strengthen both routine and specialized health care services for obesitytreatment and prevention for low-incomeand minority children through improvementsin Medicaid, the State Children' s Health In - surance Program, and services delivered in federally qualified and locally supportedcommunity health centers. 87Such reforms, however, will almost certainly require a sig-nificant financial commitment.Policies must also improve access to healthful foods and physical activity in low-income and minority communities. Families need more protection from the \"invisible hand of thefree market\" as the primary determinant of affordable, accessible, and healthful food op- tions. Food availability, access, and theclosely related media and marketing issues should be top policy priorities in schools, families, and communities alike. The builtenvironment must offer children more op- tions for physical activity. Researchers and policymakers must face head-on the safety is-sues, such as violence and drug trafficking,that compromise socially disadvantaged inner-city neighborhoods. Because attention to these issues is highly specific for any local - ity and influenced by local policies, a feasible overall obesity-prevention strategy might ad-dress food-related and media-related initia - tives at the national or regional level and built environment issues at the local level. Underlying all these conclusions is one main message. Making serious progress in the fightagainst childhood obesity in minority andlow-income communities will depend on ournational will to radically alter the negative ef - fects of the social and physical environments in which these communities exist.Shiriki Kumanyika and Sonya PM Page 200Notes 1. In this article, \"obesity\" refers to children up to age eighteen whose body mass index (BMI, calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters) is at or above the 95th percentile of the ap- propriate age- and gender-specific BMI reference curve. Children with BMI values at or above the 85th percentile are classified as being \"overweight.\" Note that this terminology differs from that used by theCenters for Disease Control and Prevention, which refers to children with BMI values at or above the 95th percentile as \"overweight\" and those with BMI values at or above the 85th percentile as \"at risk for over- weight.\" 2. Minority status is assigned to a set of diverse populations and subpopulations that fit the \"non-white\" U.S. Census Bureau's racial and ethnic classifications. The major minority group categories are African Ameri- can, Hispanic or Latino, American Indian and Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian, Asian American, and Pacific Islander. These broad groupings mask substantial heterogeneity within groups. For example, the group\"Hispanic or Latino\" may include individuals of any race and includes U.S.-born and immigrant popula-tions from Mexico, Puerto Rico, Cuba, Central and South America, and Spain. American Indians and Alaska Natives include hundreds of different federally recognized groups. Asian Americans come from all parts of Asia and are often classified together with Pacific Islanders, which can be misleading. Obesity rates may vary substantially across these subgroups. 3. G.

Targeting Interventions for Ethnic Minority and Low-Income Populations VOL. 16 / NO. 1 / SPRING 2006 208Treating Child Obesity and Associated Medical Conditions Sonia Caprio Summary With American children on course to grow into the most obese generation of adults in history, Sonia Caprio argues that it is critical to develop more effective strategies for preventing child-hood obesity and treating serious obesity-related health complications. She notes that although pediatricians are concerned about the obesity problem, most are ineffective in addressing it. Treatment should begin, Caprio explains, with a thorough medical exam, an assessment of nu- trition and physical activity, an appraisal of the degree of obesity and associated health compli-cations, a family history , and full information about current medications. Caprio also summa- rizes the current use of medications and surgery in treating child obesity and argues that for severe forms of obesity, the future lies in developing new and more effective drugs. Caprio explains that today's most effective obesity treatment programs have been carried out in academic centers through an approach that combines a dietary component, behavioral modifi - cation, physical activity , and parental involvement. Such programs, however, have yet to be translated to primary pediatric care centers. Successfully treating obesity, she argues, will re- quire a major shift in pediatric care that builds on the findings of these academic centers re - garding structured intervention programs. To ensure that pediatricians are well trained in implementing such programs, the American Medical Association is working with federal agencies, medical specialty societies, and publichealth organizations to teach doctors how to prevent and manage obesity in both children andadults. Such training should be a part of undergraduate and graduate medical education and ofcontinuing medical education programs. Caprio also addresses the problem of reimbursement for obesity treatment. Despite the health risks of obesity, patients get little support from health insurers, thus putting long-term weight-management programs beyond the reach of most. Caprio argues that obesity should be recog - nized as a disease and receive coverage for its treatment just as other diseases do. VOL. 16 / NO. 1 / SPRING 2006 209www.futureofchildren.org Sonia Caprio, M.D., is a professor of pediatric endocrinology at the Yale University School of Medicine.10 5562 caprio.qxp 1/22/2006 12:55 PM Page 209Since the mid-1980s prevalence rates of childhood and adolescent obesity in the United States have more than doubled.1American children are on course to grow into the most obese generation of adults in his- tory. The worsening obesity epidemic makesit critical to continue examining and develop- ing new and more effective treatment strate- gies. And because many obese youngsterssuffer obesity-associated metabolic, orthope- dic, and other health complications that tend to increase with the severity of obesity, it isessential not only to identify the obese childbut to recognize, treat, and monitor the asso- ciated obesity-related diseases. 2 Although pediatricians are concerned about the problem of obesity, most feel unpre-pared, ill equipped, and ineffective in ad - dressing it. Many studies, as well as a survey of pediatricians, dietitians, and pediatricnurse practitioners, confirm that pediatri - cians do indeed face many challenges in treating childhood obesity . 3Most pediatric primary care providers are not trained to pro - vide the extensive counseling on nutrition, exercise, and lifestyle changes that is re - quired to treat obesity, and most are pes- simistic that treatment can be successful.Most also have insufficient time and atten-tion to dedicate to the obese child, a problemcompounded by the lack of reimbursementby third-party payers. Pediatricians also lacksupport services, especially access to mentalhealth professionals, nutritionists, or exercisephysiologists. And they are frustrated by in-sufficient patient motivation and a lack ofparental concern. 4In a study of obese African American children, many parentsneither perceived their children as very over-weight nor felt that weight was a health prob - lem for their child. 5Although comparable data are not available for white children, thisstudy suggests that many African American parents do not perceive obesity as a pediatric health concern. Given the magnitude of the childhood obe- sity problem, however, pediatricians and other health care providers are going to haveto step up and take a major role in the care and health of the obese child. Successfully treating obesity will require a major shift inpediatric care. The Role Pediatricians Should Take in Treating Obesity In 1998 the Maternal and Child Health Bu- reau, an agency of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, convened a com - mittee of pediatric experts to develop recom- mendations to guide physicians, nurse practi-tioners, and nutritionists in evaluating andtreating overweight children and adolescents. 6 A group of pediatricians, nurse practitioners, and nutritionists reviewed the recommenda - tions and approved their appropriateness for practitioners. Although the document is notentirely evidence-based, it represents the con - sensus from experts in pediatric obesity and is the gold standard of care for all practitionersevaluating and treating the obese child. Evaluating the obese child should begin with a detailed medical examination, togetherwith an assessment of nutrition, physical ac - tivity, and behaviors that are linked to obesity, followed by an appraisal of the degree of obe-sity and its associated metabolic complica - tions. The goals of the medical exam are to identify and treat diseases associated withchildhood obesity , to rule out possible under - lying causes of obesity, and to assess the child's readiness for change. The focusshould be on the child' s entire family and any other caregivers or role models living at home. 7The examination should include aSonia Caprio 210 THE 5562 caprio.qxp 1/22/2006 12:55 PM Page 210family history of parental obesity, gestational diabetes, dyslipidemia (abnormal levels of fat in the blood), and cardiovascular disease, as well as type 2 diabetes.8It should also gather information about any medication the child uses, because so many common medicines, such as glucocorticoids and antipsychoticmedications, influence weight. 9A nutritional history should include the quality and portion size of the meals, when and where the childeats, and levels of satiety and fullness follow- ing a meal. It should also record the amount and quality of snacks and daily consumptionof juice and soft drinks, which often replacemilk in children's and adolescents' diets and are a major contributing factor to high calorie intake. 10Finally , it should inquire how often the child eats \"fast food,\" because children who frequently eat at fast-food restaurantsconsume more total energy , more energy per gram of food, more total fat and carbohy- drates, more added sugars, less fiber, andfewer fruits and vegetables than children whodo not. 11 The child' s activity level should also be as- sessed. Studies that use motion sensors show that children who spend less time in moder - ate activity are at a higher risk than their more active counterparts of becoming obeseduring childhood and adolescence. 12Televi- sion watching and video games contribute tomore sedentary leisure activities as well as toincreased snacking and inappropriate foodchoices prompted by television advertising.Many hours of television viewing are posi - tively correlated with overweight, especially in older children and adolescents. 13 Overweight in both children and adolescents can profoundly affect quality of life, self-esteem, and social competence. 14Among se - verely obese adolescents, 48 percent have moderate to severe depressive symptoms.Treating Child Obesity and Associated Medical Conditions VOL. 16 / NO. 1 / SPRING 2006 211Overweight adolescents often engage in sig- nificantly more unhealthy behaviors and ex-perience more psychosocial distress thantheir normal weight peers. 15Because psycho- logical disorders may cause or be related to obesity, it is important for a pediatrician to recognize them and to be able to refer a childto a therapist as needed. Assessment of Obesity: The Body Mass Index The initial assessment should begin with an accurate measure of height and weight, whichis used to calculate, record, and plot thechild's age- and gender-specific body mass index (BMI) on the Centers for Disease Con- trol and Prevention 2000 BMI charts. 16BMI in children provides a consistent measure ofobesity across age groups, correlating withmeasures of body fatness in children and ado - lescents. Although some controversy attends the use of BMI to assess obesity in children,as detailed in the article in this volume by Pa - tricia Anderson and Kristen Butcher, the In- ternational T ask Force on Obesity finds BMI a reasonable index of adiposity . 17 Early recognition of excessive weight gain relative to normal growth is an essential com-ponent of the physical examination andshould be part of any visit in primary healthcare. In 2003, the American Academy of Pe-diatrics recommended that pediatricians cal - culate and plot BMI in all children and ado- lescents. 18Most health care providers, however , fail to address it in the pediatric population. A 2002 study of pediatricians, pe- diatric nurse practitioners, and dietitiansshowed that fewer than 20 percent of pedia - tricians assessed body mass index. 19And two recent studies indicate that screening prac-tices for overweight using BMI during rou - tine visits have not been adopted. 20Many pe- diatricians, it seems clear, are overlooking10 5562 caprio.qxp 1/22/2006 12:55 PM Page 211obesity during well child visits. Why such screening practices have not been adopted isunclear. In a recent report from the U.S. Pre-ventive T ask Force in the journal Pediatrics, Evelyn Whitlock and several colleagues con-cluded that the existing evidence is insuffi-cient to recommend for or against routine screening using the BMI for overweight inchildren and adolescents in primary care set-tings. 21But the report should be interpreted carefully: according to an article by NancyKrebs in the same journal, the report shouldSonia Caprio 212 THE FUTURE OF CHILDRENRacial Disparities in the Care of Childhood Obesity African American and Hispanic children and adolescents have higher prevalence rates of obesity than do white children and adolescents, but they receive less care.1The disparity is particularly disconcerting because black and Hispanic children are at greater risk for obesity-associated com- plications, such as type 2 diabetes, than are white children.2 In a national survey of ambulatory pediatric visits, Stephen Cook and several colleagues report disturbing racial and health-related disparities. Blood pressure screening differed by race and in- surance status, with 47.7 percent of visits of white children including such screening as against 29 percent of visits of black children. Diet and exercise counseling also varied by age, insurance type, and clinician type. Exercise counseling occurred half as often in visits by black children.3A recent report by Karen Dorsey and several colleagues on the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of childhood obesity in pediatric practice also found large disparities in treatment.4 In their study of four pediatric clinics (two community health centers and two hospital-based clinics) in New Haven that are serving an urban population with many racial and ethnic minorities insured by Medicaid, they report that providers may be under-diagnosing girls, children who are Hispanic, those insured through Medicaid, and those living apart from their biological parents. The authors also document a lack of testing for diabetes or lipid disorders among this at-risk population of children. Efforts should be invested to understand and correct these racial disparities. Health professionals of different ethnic backgrounds should develop and implement ethnicity- based management programs for children and adolescents with diverse ethnic, racial, and cultural backgrounds. The United States has few black and Hispanic obesity specialists, nutritionists, and exercise physiologists, and the enormous racial and ethnic gap in providers must be filled. P ediatri - cians must also address these health disparities in the community through other means, such as working with the local news media. The state of Illinois has recently proposed three pieces of child - hood obesity legislation that are likely to be enacted soon. The first urges the U.S. Department of Agriculture to update nutritional labels for foods distributed through the Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women and Children (WIC). The second requires each school board in the state to es- tablish a school district office of nutrition to help prevent childhood obesity. The third urges the state board of education to develop guidelines showing how schools can meet standards for satu- rated fat in school meals and provide healthy alternatives. Many other states are also working in the same direction, and more legislation to prevent and treat childhood obesity is likely . 1. C. L. Ogden and K. M.

Assessment of Obesity-Related Diseases To identify the obesity-related diseases that are being seen increasingly in children, labo- ratory tests should include a fasting lipid pro-file, which measures cholesterol and triglyc-eride levels, a liver function test, and fasting glucose and insulin levels. 23A consensus panel of the American Diabetes Associationrecommends that overweight children withtwo additional risk factors, such as a familyhistory of type 2 diabetes, race or ethnicity(American Indian, African American, His-panic, or Asian Pacific), signs of insulin insen-sitivity , or hypertension, be considered for further testing. 24Another consensus report finds that patients with obesity-related dis - eases, such as type 2 diabetes, hypertension, polycystic ovarian syndrome, dyslipidemia,nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, and sleepapnea, will require described in detail in the article byStephen Daniels in this volume. Childrenwith these conditions should be cared forwithin specialized obesity clinics. Current Specialized Treatment Programs and Interventions Surprisingly little evidence-based, high- quality research exists on interventions totreat childhood obesity. A summary of the re-search behind obesity interventions for bothadults and children was published in April2004 in the British Medical Journal . 26Most of the effective treatment programs have been carried out in academic centers through an interdisciplinary approach that combines a dietary component, behavioralmodification, physical activity, and parental involvement. 27L. H. Epstein and his team at the State University of New York at Buffalohave been in the forefront of developing programs that reduce adiposity in childhood through this multidisciplinary approach. Themost important finding of these interventions may be that relatively modest but sustainable changes in lifestyles may have more long-term impact on obesity than radical regimensthat enable patients to lose weight rapidly but not to maintain their new, lower weight afterward. In perhaps the only successfullong-term intervention, Epstein used suchbehavioral strategies as contracting, self-monitoring, and social reinforcement withobese children and their parents to limit con-sumption of fatty foods and to increase exer-cise. 28Although research has demonstrated that intensive group programs can be suc-cessful, such programs have yet to be trans - lated to primary care centers. In the absence of well-established, office-based evaluationand treatment programs, the Maternal andChild Health Bureau and the National Cen-ter for Education in Maternal and ChildHealth have issued recommendations for theobese child's evaluation and treatment thatare strongly based on comprehensive inter - ventions like those Epstein developed. Dietary Components of T reatment Most lifestyle intervention programs in chil- dren use a diet that mildly restricts calories.The classic example is the T raffic Light Diet, which color-codes foods as green, yellow, and red to signal whether they are safe to eat inany quantity (green), require moderation andcaution (yellow), or should generally beavoided (red). Combining comprehensiveTreating Child Obesity and Associated Medical Conditions VOL. 16 / NO. 1 / SPRING 2006 21310 5562 caprio.qxp 1/22/2006 12:55 PM Page 213obesity-treatment programs with the Traffic Light Diet can significantly change eating patterns.29Indeed, one study found that the diet continued to affect the eating habits ofchildren five to ten years after treatment began. 30Diets more restricted in calories, in- cluding high-protein diets, are used rarelyand only in more severe forms of obesity. Given their potential danger, they should be implemented under strict medical control,possibly in a clinical setting. Interest is also growing in whether low- carbohydrate diets can help reduce adiposityin adults. 31A recent study showed that obese men and women lost more weight and hadmore significant reductions in plasma triglyc-eride concentrations on a low-carbohydratediet than on conventional low-fat diets. 32And limited evidence suggests that the nature orquality of ingested carbohydrates may modu - late weight gain in childhood. Although the relationship between carbohydrates andweight gain is still highly controversial, stud - ies by D. Ludwig and several colleagues strongly link consumption of sugar-sweet-ened drinks with obesity . 33Thus emerging data would suggest that eliminating carbon-ated drinks or other sugary drinks from thediet can significantly reduce caloric intakeand obesity. 34But low-carbohydrate diets should not be used for children and adoles-cents until more information is available re- garding their effects on insulin resistance and their long-term effects on weight and meta- bolic health. Role of Physical Exercise Physical activity is a critical component of obesity treatment in both adults and chil- dren. Increasing the caloric expenditure of obese children may not only accelerate theirweight loss, but also make it easier to main- tain weight changes. Exercise in the absence of dietary intervention, however, has notbeen found to affect weight significantly. Andfor the obese child, exercising can be diffi- cult. Few studies have explored the effects of aerobic exercise on children' s body weight and cardiovascular fitness. Nor is much infor- mation available regarding the effects of re-sistance exercise on children' s metabolism and body weight. But because the capacity for voluntary exercise declines with the in-creasing severity of obesity , resistance exer- cise may prove more effective than more strenuous aerobic exercise. As yet there areno evidence-based guidelines by which to de - sign exercise programs for obese children. Epstein and his team have suggested reduc - ing sedentary behaviors as an alternative to increasing physical activity , an interesting ap- proach that may be helpful both in treatingand in preventing obesity. Inactivity can bedecreased in many ways, usually most suc - cessfully when a parent is involved. The best example is reducing the time that the childspends watching television. 35 Pharmacologic Approaches in Pediatrics Many experts in pediatric obesity argue that behavioral treatment alone is ineffective, par-ticularly in the case of severe obesity. Few ifany guidelines exist for using medications intreating child obesity. In general, however,experts suggest that children and adolescentsSonia Caprio 214 THE FUTURE OF CHILDRENThus emerging data would suggest that eliminatingcarbonated drinks or othersugary drinks from the dietcan than the 95th percentile for age and sex and with obesity-related med-ical complications that may be corrected orimproved through weight reduction shouldbe considered for intensive regimens, includ- ing medication. 36Most medications approved for weight loss in the United States eithersuppress appetite or reduce nutrient absorp- tion. A third emerging therapy is not aimed directly at controlling weight but rather tar-gets insulin resistance to reduce the meta- bolic complications associated with obesity. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved sibutramine (Meridia), an appetite suppressant, for weight loss and maintenance in conjunction with reduced caloric intake inadults and adolescents older than age six-teen. 37R. I. Berkowitz and several colleagues provided the first placebo-controlled trial of sibutramine in treatingobese adolescents. 38The double-blind study followed eighty-two adolescents with a BMIof 32 to 44 for six months, and then all pa-tients received the drug without being blindto the treatment for another six months. In - cluding sibutramine as part of a comprehen- sive behavioral program resulted in greaterweight loss in obese adolescents than the tra-ditional behavioral treatment alone, but theweight loss plateaued after six months oftherapy. Serious side effects, such as hyper-tension and tachycardia (rapid heart rate),were reported in nineteen out of forty-threeyoungsters; in five, the drug dose had to bereduced or discontinued. The study found nomajor improvement in insulin resistance anddyslipidemia. A. Matos-Godoy and severalcolleagues also evaluated the efficacy andsafety of sibutramine a double-blind, obeseadolescents. 39Unlike the Berkowitz study , it found no clinically significant changes in blood pressure.40Both studies concludedthat sibutramine should be used for weight loss in adolescents and children only on an experimental basis until more extensive safety and efficacy data are available. In future tests of sibutramine in children and adolescents with severe obesity, researcherscould experiment with different strategies. For example, introducing the drug after a pe- riod of weight reduction with traditional ap-proaches may reduce the potential for such side effects as hypertension. Orlistat (Xenical), a drug that decreases nu- trient absorption, cuts intestinal fat absorp- tion by up to 30 percent. The FDA approved its use in children older than age twelve. Amulticenter, one-year randomized, placebo-controlled trial in used orlistat lost weightand had significantly greater reductions inBMI and body fat than those given theplacebo. 41But the two groups saw no signifi - cant differences with respect to changes in lipid or glucose levels. The explanation forthe failure of lipid and glucose levels to im - prove may be that the body weight loss was small (5 percent). Although researchers donot yet know how much BMI must be re-duced to provide short- and long-term healthbenefits in children and adolescents, theabove study would suggest that small changesin weight do not affect the metabolic riskfactors. The third class of drugs used in treating obe - sity are those that target insulin resistance, which, along with the associated high insulinlevels, are often present in obese childrenand adolescents and which vary with the de-gree and severity of overweight. Both disor-ders may not only contribute to the metaboliccomplications of obesity but also accentuateweight gain in children and adolescents byTreating Child Obesity and Associated Medical Conditions VOL. 16 / NO. 1 / SPRING 2006 21510 5562 caprio.qxp 1/22/2006 12:55 PM Page 215promoting lipid storage. Thus targeting in- sulin resistance may have a dual effect\u2014pre-venting further weight gain and improvingthe associated metabolic complications. Met-formin, for example, is used in treating type 2 diabetes. 42It is approved for adolescents. Only two small studies have used metforminin a randomized trial in obese adolescents. 43 Both found small but statistically significant effects on BMI and significant effects on fast-ing blood sugar, insulin, and lipids. The stud- ies are encouraging and should be repeated in a larger sample and for a longer duration. When possible, it is always best to treat obe- sity without using drugs. Unfortunately, however , once both adult and child patients have lost weight, their efforts to maintain their new weight often fail. That so manypeople regain weight after stopping medica - tion clearly suggests that obesity is a chronic condition that requires continuous treat-ment. And even though environmental fac - tors have played an important role in child- hood obesity' s dramatic rise over the past two decades, clearly there is a genetic com - ponent to body weight. Indeed, recent data suggest that 5 percent of cases of severe obe - sity in children younger than ten are due to genetic mutations. 44These children and ado - lescents need multiple strategies, includingdrugs, used in combination in a carefully de-signed treatment program. Research over the past decade has dramati- cally advanced knowledge about the molecu - lar mechanisms regulating body fat and the central regulation of energy intake. Ulti-mately , for the severe forms of obesity , the future lies in developing new and more effec- tive medications. Researchers should con-tinue to investigate the causes of childhoodobesity and to refine obesity's classificationsand diagnoses based on health risks.Surgical Approaches Surgery is used to treat obesity in adults only when patients are severely obese (or their BMI greater than 40) or when they have aBMI greater than 35 together with severe obesity-related health complications. In the Swedish Obese Subjects (SOS) Study, a largestudy evaluating surgery's efficacy, patients were equally divided among surgical and non- surgical groups. 45After two years, the surgical patients had lost 28 kilograms (62 pounds); those in the control group, 0.5 kilograms. After eight years, the average weight loss was20 kilograms in surgical patients and 0.7 kilo-grams in controls. Thus overall, surgery pro- moted substantial, prolonged weight loss in patients with severe obesity . 46Results in the relatively few published surgical trials in obesechildren and adolescents seem to parallelthose of adult trials. 47Nevertheless, evidence- based guidelines should be developed for sur-gery as a treatment of childhood obesity. Primary and Specialized Care Chronically obese children are increasingly being referred to pediatric endocrinologycenters, often years after the onset of obesity.A study by T . Quattrin and several colleagues found that most of the children who were re- ferred to specialists had developed obesity intheir preschool years, when preventive meas-ures are likely to be most effective, if imple-mented. T wo years after the first visit to the specialist, only 38 percent of the children were less overweight than they were on theirfirst visit. 48The study concluded that such re - ferrals are ineffective, and efforts should go, instead, to developing and making availableto pediatricians early family-based, behav - ioral lifestyle intervention programs. The study's primary point, however, was not to ad-dress where the child should receive care butto emphasize that effectively treating obesityin children and adolescents requires a well-Sonia Caprio 216 THE OF CHILDREN10 5562 caprio.qxp 1/22/2006 12:55 PM Page 216designed, multifaceted intervention program. Given the chronic nature of obesity, frequentvisits for treatment are indispensable. Thetraditional, sporadic, every-six-months visitthat a normal primary care practice provides is not adequate. Because many obese chil- dren and adolescents also suffer from one ormore metabolic complications, the role of the pediatric endocrinologist is critical in the multidisciplinary approach to the problem.Both pediatricians and patients must realize that the goal of treatment is not the initial weight loss alone but also weight manage-ment to achieve the best possible weight forimproved health. The growing prevalence of childhood obesity indicates an urgent need to develop effective strategies for preventionand treatment. How W ell Equipped Are Pediatricians to Handle \"Adult\" Diseases? The typical medical complications of obesity , once confined to adulthood, are now emerg- ing in childhood.49During the past decade, pediatricians were confronted with unusualdiseases like type 2 diabetes, nonalcoholicfatty liver disease, and polycystic ovary disor - der. 50To slow or reverse the increase in childhood obesity and its associated healthrisks, it is necessary to treat childhood obesityas soon as it is detected. Given the limits totreating long-standing obesity , early pediatric interventions to limit excessive weight gain in preschool and preadolescent children appearto be the best way to tackle the problem. Themost effective way to prevent complicationsof obesity in teenagers and adults is to intro-duce, model, and reinforce healthful behav - iors and lifestyles early in childhood. Because so many children suffer from over - weight and obesity, such interventions are most appropriately based in the primary pedi-Treating Child Obesity and Associated Medical Conditions VOL. 16 / NO. 1 / SPRING 2006 217atric care setting, preferably with the support of registered dietitians and structured inter-vention programs. Especially when caring forthe younger child, managing excessive weightgain should be the province of the primary care pediatrician. Although, as noted, few overweight children are now actively treatedin the primary care setting and many are referred to specialists, the epidemic of child- hood obesity and the paucity of pediatric obe-sity subspecialists have overwhelmed special- ized treatment programs' capacities to handle the demand for their services. Because almost all children receive their health care in primary care settings, develop - ing effective and feasible strategies for pre-venting and treating childhood obesity in pri-mary care settings offers an importantopportunity for addressing this major publichealth problem. Giving the primary careprovider a major role in preventing the onsetof childhood obesity and in interveningpromptly to correct excessive weight gain iscritical. As noted, however , primary care pe - diatricians lack the training to care for obese patients. Few have time to assess, intervene,and monitor progress related to the child' s di- etary, behavioral, and physical activities, es- pecially when the doctors are generally notThe most effective way to prevent complications ofobesity in teenagers andadults is to introduce, model,and reinforce lifestyles 12:55 PM Page 217reimbursed by third-party payers either to provide services themselves or to employ a multidisciplinary team within their practices to provide appropriate services.51The clinical system is well prepared to treat acute condi- tions but not chronic conditions like obesity. Changing the Role of the Primary Health Care Provider: A Solution to the Prevention and Treatment ofChildhood Obesity The number of obese children and adoles- cents is large and growing. These young peo-ple are in need of intensive intervention, butclearly the burden is too large to be borne by specialty physicians. Thus the primary care provider' s role must be changed. As leading authorities on the health of chil- dren in their communities, pediatricianscould play a unique role both in increasingcommunity awareness of the problem ofoverweight and in identifying promising ap - proaches that deserve additional testing. 52 Realizing that primary care centers are not now effectively preventing and treating obe - sity, the field needs to move forward. Al- though consensus on the best strategies forprevention and treatment is still evolving, theAmerican Medical Association (AMA) hasbegun to take action. Working with theCouncil on Scientific Affairs (CSA) and otherassociations and experts, the AMA issued areport in 2004 on the epidemiology of obesityand the problems it causes. 53The report in- cluded recommendations on labor force andtraining, on costs and reimbursement, and onracial disparities in treatment. Labor Force and Training Among its recommendations the AMA urges physicians, managed care organizations, andother third-party payers to recognize obesityas a complex disorder that involves appetiteSonia Caprio 218 THE FUTURE OF CHILDRENregulation and energy metabolism and that carries with it risks of various diseases. The AMA is working with federal agencies, med- ical specialty societies, and public health or-ganizations to educate physicians about how to prevent and manage obesity in children and adults, including basic principles andpractices of physical activity and nutrition counseling. It advises that such training should be included in undergraduate andgraduate medical education and offered through accredited continuing medical edu- cation programs. The AMA directs physicians to assess their pa- tients for overweight and obesity during routine medical examinations and to discuss with theirat-risk patients the health consequences of fur-ther weight gain. If treatment is indicated,physicians should encourage and facilitate theirpatients' weight-maintenance or reduction ef-forts or refer them to a physician with specialinterest in managing obesity . Physicians should also become knowledgeable about community resources and referral services that can helpthem manage obese patients. The AMA urges federal support for research to determine the causes and mechanisms ofoverweight and obesity; the long-term safetyand efficacy of voluntary weight maintenanceand weight-loss practices and therapies, in-cluding surgery; and the effectiveness of in - terventions to prevent obesity in children and adults and of weight-loss counseling by physi-cians. Finally it encourages a national effortto educate Americans about the health risksof being overweight and obese and to provideinformation about how to achieve and main - tain a preferred healthy weight. Cost and Reimbursement To promote reimbursement for care, the AMA exhorts federal agencies to work with10 5562 caprio.qxp 1/22/2006 12:55 PM Page 218organized medicine and the health insurance industry to develop coding and payment mechanisms for the evaluation and manage- ment of obesity. Reimbursement for obesitytreatment is one of the great anomalies of the U.S. health care system. Despite the health risks associated with obesity, patients get lit-tle support from health insurers. The low re- imbursement rates preclude the long-term fi- nancial feasibility of weight-managementprograms without other support or a signifi- cant proportion of patients who can pay for care \"out-of-pocket.\" One study of 191 chil-dren in a hospital weight-management pro-gram found a median reimbursement rate of 11 percent, with variations from 0 to 100 per- cent. 54Many insurers will not cover weight- loss treatments unless the patient has an obe-sity-related condition such as diabetes orhyperlipidemia. Although the reimbursement problem has been and continues to be a critical barrier totreating child and adolescent obesity, signs ofchange are beginning to appear . The Ameri - can Obesity Association (AOA), an advocacy organization, has committed itself to expand-ing insurance coverage for obesity treatment.And state policymakers are slowly beginningto allow Medicaid treatment options for theirlow-income citizens. This year, two of fourbills introduced were enacted into law. InIowa, Governor T om V ilsak signed into law a bill that requires the state's Medicaid pro- gram to develop a strategy for providing di-etary counseling to child and adult Medicaidenrollees by July 1, 2006. Counseling andsupport will be offered to assist enrollees indeveloping a personal weight-loss program.And Colorado's governor, Bill Owens, signeda measure establishing an obesity treatmentpilot program for Medicaid beneficiaries whoare older than fifteen and have a BMI equalto or greater than 30. On the private side, fivestates introduced legislation requiring insur- ers to provide or offer coverage for surgical procedures used to treat obesity. In keeping with the guidelines of the Na- tional Institutes of Health and other organi- zations, obesity should be recognized as a dis-ease and should receive coverage for its treatment just as other diseases do. Third- party payers should reimburse practitionersfor preventive counseling and management programs for children that are known to be cost-effective. The Future of Pediatric Obesity The key to successfully treating childhood obesity ultimately lies in developing andfunding a targeted research agenda. At thetop of that agenda should be basic researchinto the biology and physiology of regulatingappetite during the various developmentalstages of childhood. Research should alsofocus on the mechanisms that regulate bodyfat distribution during adolescence as well asgender and ethnicity differences in bodycomposition and fat distribution. Other keyresearch areas include the differing suscepti-bility to weight gain during childhood andTreating Child Obesity and Associated Medical Conditions VOL. 16 / NO. 1 / SPRING 2006 219In keeping with the guidelines of the NationalInstitutes of Health and otherorganizations, obesity shouldbe recognized as a diseaseand should receive coveragefor its treatment just as other diseases do.10 5562 caprio.qxp 1/22/2006 12:55 PM Page in phys- ical activity at puberty; more clinical studies on the efficacy of specific prevention and treatment programs; and the effort to movefrom efficacy to broad effectiveness. Until recently, childhood obesity has been considered a clinical problem for specialist pediatricians. Now, however, the problem must be approached in a more global man-ner. The public health community must con- sider the urgent need to institute preventive programs. Given the reluctance of policy-makers to institute changes, particularlythose that are unpopular or expensive, it is important to establish objective evidence of the beneficial impact of any preventive ortreatment programs. To stop the epidemic ofchildhood obesity, acting on all levels\u2014med-ical, social, political, and educational\u2014is fun - damental. A broad range of action would include conducting nutrition education cam-paigns, regulating the marketing of junk foodto children, eliminating energy-dense foods and sodas from schools, and promoting phys-ical activity. In an outstanding 2003 editorial in the Archives of Pediatric and Adolescent Medi- cine, Leona Cuttler, June Whittaker, and Eric Kodish suggested forming a national pedi- atric obesity panel under the aegis of the Na- tional Institutes of Health, the Centers forDisease Control and Prevention, or the Insti- tute of Medicine. 55Including representatives of major stakeholders, the panel would shapepolicy, analyze the best practices through rig-orous evaluation, disseminate information ac- crued, revise policy at regular intervals as new information is gained, and become acentral trusted voice. Under such a panel'sleadership, the United States could trans-form its approach to treating childhood obe - sity and ultimately stem the epidemic that threatens so many of the nation's children.Sonia Caprio 220 THE FUTURE OF CHILDREN10 5562 caprio.qxp 1/22/2006 12:55 PM Page 220Notes 1.
