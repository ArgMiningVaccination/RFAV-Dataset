Reviews Of Our Immune Booster IV Drip Very Professional I Met Ken the wonderful Nurse and I am so satisfied I Had IV for my immune health and Vitamins and could not be happier ! I feel excellent. COVID-19 protocol was amazing high standards Ken was also so helpful in all aspects answer all my questions and provided Best Customer Service ! I will call again ! I love IV medics. I have a very week immune system and IV medics have been a life saver. Keeping me out of the hospital. Their immune IV has really helped me so much. Not to mention they have really great prices. They are also very punctual, knowledgeable, attentive, and kind in my dealings with them. Very easy to schedule an appt. Easy to book and very easy to work with. Great deal on the immunity max IV drip right now. Janell was super sweet and made me feel very comfortable. She inserted the IV with very little to no pain. Janell is very professional and kind. First time doing IV therapy and in my own home and pajamas =) I found the Mobile IV company over the holidays when my Natural Path doctor was closed. I woke up in the middle of the night and started feeling a cold/flu coming on. I emailed the company at 4 AM, and Richie came to my rescue the very next morning. Richie is extremely caring, SOOO good at needles and is an absolute blast to talk with during the IV treatment. My whole family now uses his services for immune boosting and even hangovers. I have used IV nutritions for several years now and now more than ever it's important to have a strong immune system! Richie is the guy to call! This review is for Nurse Leslie - I have had two Immune boost Max IV drip treatment these past two weeks, both from Nurse Leslie and I have to say she is amazing. She was prompt, on time and 100% prepared for my treatments. I am 27 weeks pregnant, recovering from side effects of Covid19 and couldn't have asked for a better/gentle nurse. She did two treatments for my boyfriend as well, we also booked her for my father in law. I would probably be booking weekly treatments and will definitely request for Nurse Leslie personally! 5 stars hands down Thank you, Elizabeth!! Can't say thanks enough to Mobile IV, my mom had been feeling horrible for 4 days & couldn't seem to kick whatever it was. I had the idea of these mobile iv's I had heard of & found Mobile IV, requested an appointment at around 12:45pm. Not sure what to expect, got a text to confirm time & a few other questions, had a same day appointment. Elizabeth not only had an impressive resume, she was kind & a wealth of knowledge for my mom who had been sick for days. She already sounds better & feels better, the most important part! She got the immune boost + a shot of b12, life changing is what she called it. Thanks so much, Elizabeth for being so caring, efficient, & kind to my mom!!! This is really an awesome service to use!! I will definitely recommend to my friends!! Elizabeth even texted my mom later to check in on how she was feeling!
