African Swine Fever \u2014a highly contagious disease transmitted by the soft tick, Ornithodoros sonrai , that infects pigs in Africa. Air Quality Control R egions (AQCR) \u2014the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator has designated AQCRs in the United States. Important factors in setting the boundaries of an air quality control region include climate and meteorology, topography, vegetation, land use patterns, population characteristics, and growth projections. Anadromous \u2014anadromous fishes are those that spend all or part of their adult life in salt water and return to freshwater streams and rivers to spawn. Analgesics \u2014a pain killer such as acetaminop hen or aspirin. Animal Biosafety Level (ABSL) \u2014ABSL represent the application of biosafety levels to research involving animals and organisms requiring a particular level of biosafety level containment. There are guidelines in place to ensure safe work sites through a combination of engineering controls, management policies, work practices, and procedures. Increasing levels of personnel and environmental protection are provided for by the different biosafety levels. The higher the level, the more stringent t he level of protection. ABSL -1 is suitable for work on animals involving well -characterized agents that are not known to cause disease in healthy adult humans and that are of minimal potential hazard to laboratory personnel and the environment. ABSL -2 buil ds upon the practices, procedures, containment equipment, and facility requirements of ABSL -1. ABSL -3, building upon the ABSL -2 requirements, is suitable for work with biological agents that present the potential of aerosol transmission and that cause seri ous or potentially lethal disease. ABSL -4 builds upon the standard practices, procedures, containment equipment, and facility requirements of ABSL -3. ABL -4 involves practices suitable for addressing dangerous or exotic agents that pose high risk of life- threatening disease, aerosol transmission, or related agents with unknown risk of transmission. Antisepsis\u2014the reduction or prevention of infection by the elimination or reduction of the growth of microorganisms that cause disease or decay. Antiviral Therapi es\u2014a technique that uses antiviral medication to fight viral infections. However, rather than destroying the virus, this technique aims at preventing the virus from replicating so that it cannot continue to reproduce. Aseptic\u2014 free of pathogenic microorgani sms; sterile. Attainment Area \u2014geographic area that meets the primary National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) established by the EPA to protect health and the environment. An area may meet the established NAAQS for one criteria pollutant but have una cceptable levels for another. Thus, an area could be in attainment for one criteria pollutant and in non- attainment for another. Autoclave \u2014an apparatus that uses steam under pr essure to sterilize materials. Typically, steam is heated between 121 Celsius (\u00b0 C) to 134\u00b0C and takes 3 to 15 min to achieve sterility . Benthic \u2014the benthic zone is the ecological region at the lowest level of a body of water such as an ocean or a lake, including the sediment surface and some sub -surface layers. NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 8-2 Best Management Practi ce (BMP) \u2014are actions people can take to reduce their impact on the environment. BMPs have been described for agriculture, forest management, and construction. Bioagent \u2014organisms or the product of organisms that present a health risk to humans. These can be bacterial, fungal, parasitic, rickettsial, or viral agents. Biocontainment \u2014the containment of extremely pathogenic organisms (as viruses) usually by isolation in secure facilities to prevent their accidental release, especially during scientific research . Biodefense \u2014procedures involved in taking defensive measures against attacks using biological agents. Biological Safety Cabinets (BSCs) \u2014primary containment devices in laboratories working with infectious agents. There are three general types available (Cl ass I, II, and III). Properly maintained Class I and II BSCs, when used in conjunction with good microbiological techniques, provide an effective containment system for safe manipulation of moderate and high- risk microorganisms. Class II BSCs also protect the research material itself through high -efficiency particulate air filtration of the air flow down across the work surface. Class III BSCs offer the maximum protection to laboratory personnel because all infectious agents and hazardous materials are cont ained in a totally enclosed cabinet. Class III BSCs are designed for work with microbiological agents assigned to BSL -4 and provide maximum protection to the environment and the worker. Biosafety Level (BSL) \u2014the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention a nd the National Institutes of Heath have defined four levels to designate and regulate laboratory work with biological materials, such as microorganisms. The higher the level, the more stringent the level of protection. The range is BSL -1, in which the mic roorganisms are not known to cause disease in healthy adult human beings, to BSL -4, in which the microorganisms pose a risk of life -threatening disease and for which there is no known vaccine or therapy. BSL-3Ag refers to research involving large agricultu ral animals. BSL -3E refers to enhancements made to strengthen the physical containment features of the laboratory or facility; however, the improvements do not meet the criteria of the next BSL. There are guidelines in place to ensure safe work sites throu gh a combination of engineering controls, management policies, work practices, and procedures. Increasing levels of personnel and environmental protection are provided for by the different BSLs used in microbiological/biomedical laboratories. Biosafety L evel 1 \u2014facilities appropriate for handing stand ard microbiological practices. Infectious agents worked with in BSL -1 facilities are not known to consistently cause disease in healthy adults. Biosafety Level 2 \u2014facilities appropriate for handling indigenous agents of moderate risk to personnel and the environment. Pathogens worked with in BSL -2 facilities are transmitted through ingestion or introduction via punctures or mucous membrane exposure. Biosafety Level 3 \u2014facilities appropriate for handling pathoge ns of indigenous or exotic origin with a known potential for aerosol transmission. Agents worked with in BSL -3 facilities may cause serious and potentially lethal infections. More emphasis is placed on primary and secondary barriers to protect personnel an d the community. Biosafety Level 3 Enhanced (BSL -3E)\u2014refers to the protective enhancements commensurate with the risk assessment of the pathogens and requirements for BSL -3. Biosafety Level 3 Agriculture (BSL -3-Ag)\u2014includes the containment features of a BS L-3 facility and is specifically designed to protect the environment by also including almost all of the features used for BSL -4 facilities as enhancements. This level refers to research involving large agricultural animals and foreign and emerging pathoge ns that may cause serious consequences in livestock but are not harmful to humans because NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 8-3 protective measures are available. All BSL -3Ag containment spaces must be designed, constructed, and certified by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) as primary containment barriers. Biosafety Level 4\u2014 facilities appropriate for handling exotic pathogens that pose a high risk of life-threatening disease in animals and humans through the aerosol route and for which there is no known vaccine or therapy. BS L-4 facilities have complex, specialized ventilation requirements and waste management systems to prevent release of viable agents to the environment. Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) \u2014more commonly known as mad cow disease, BSE is a progressive neur ological disorder of cattle that results from infection by an unusual transmissible agent called a prion. Carbon Monoxide (CO) \u2014carbon monoxide , with the chemical formula CO, is a colorless, odorless, and tasteless gas. It consists of one carbon atom coval ently bonded to one oxygen atom. Carbon monoxide is produced from the partial combustion of carbon- containing compounds, notably in internal combustion engines. Chain of Custody (COC) \u2014documentation that records the movement of samples from the selection, to the laboratory receipt, to the final disposal; documentation shows traceability of movement of each sample through a laboratory process from collection to disposal. Chemical Sterilization \u2014a process by which chemicals are applied to destroy all living mi croorganisms, rendering the material non- infectious or sterile. Classical Swine Fever\u2014a highly contagious viral disease of swine that occurs worldwide in acute, sub -acute, chronic, and a persistent forms. Symptoms vary from high fever, severe depression, m ultiple superficial and internal hemorrhages, anorexia, and death. Recovery is occasionally seen in mature animals. Clean Air Act (CAA) \u2014is the primary federal law in the United States governing air pollution. Like other laws enacted by Congress, it was inc orporated into the United States (U.S.) Code. The House of Representatives maintains a current version of the U.S. Code, which includes amendments of the CAA enacted since 1990. Clean Air Act Conformity \u2014the CAA requires that federal actions conform to a S tate's Implementation Plan. Specifically, the act requires the action/activity will not cause or contribute to any new violation of any standard in any area; increase the frequency or severity of any existing violation of any standard in any area; or delay timely attainment of any standard or any required interim emission reductions or any other milestones in any area. To implement this requirement, the CAA directed the EPA to issue rules that governed how conformity determinations would be conducted for tw o categories of actions/activities: 1) those dealing with transportation plans, programs, and projects and 2) all other actions, e.g., projects requiring federal permits. Clean Water Act (CWA) \u2014is the primary federal law in the United States governing wate r pollution. The CWA established the symbolic goals of eliminating releases to water of high amounts of toxic substances, eliminating additional water pollution by 1985, and ensuring that surface waters would meet standards necessary for human sports and r ecreation by 1983. The principal body of law currently in effect is based on the Federal Water Pollution Control Amendments of 1972, which significantly expanded and strengthened earlier legislation. Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) \u2014is the codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the executive departments and agencies of the federal government. It is divided into 50 titles that represent broad areas subject to federal regulation. Each volume of the CFR is update d once each calendar year and is issued on a quarterly basis.

Contagious Bovine Ple uropneumonia \u2014a highly infectious acute, sub -acute, or chronic disease, primary to cattle, that affects the lungs and occasionally the joints. Critical Habitat \u2014as habitat loss is the primary threat to most imperiled species, the original Endangered Species Act (ESA) of 1973 allowed the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA) Fisheries to designate specific areas as protected \" critical habitat\" zones. In 1978, Congress amended the ESA to require desi gnation for all threatened and endangered species except those that might be harmed by the publication of such maps. Congress indicated that the exception should rarely be invoked. Critical habitats are required to contain \" all areas essential to the conse rvation \" of the target species. Such lands may be private or public. The FWS and NOAA Fisheries may exclude essential areas if they determine that economic or other costs exceed the benefit. Cumulative Impacts \u2014\"Cumulative impact \" is the impact on the envi ronment that results from the incremental impact of the action when added to other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions regardless of what agency (federal or non -federal) or person undertakes such other actions. Cumulative impacts can r esult from individually minor but collectively significant actions taking place over a period of time.

Executive Order (EO) \u2014is a directive issued by the President. U.S. Presidents have issued EOs to help direct the operation of executive officers. Some orders do have the force of law when made in pursuance of certain Acts of Congres s, when those acts give the President discretionary powers. Farmland Protection Policy Act (FPPA) \u2014Congress passed the Agriculture and Food Act of 1981 containing the FPPA \u2014Subtitle I of Title XV, Section 1539- 1549. The final rules and regulations were publi shed in the Federal Register on June 17, 1994. The FPPA is intended to minimize the impact that federal programs have on the unnecessary and irreversible conversion of farmland to nonagricultural uses. It assures that\u2014to the extent possible \u2014federal program s are administered to be compatible with state and local units of government and private programs and policies to protect farmland. Federal agencies are required to develop and review their policies and procedures to implement the FPPA every 2 years.

The EPA designated primary NAAQS to protect public health and secondary NAAQS to protect public welfare and the environment. National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) \u2014requires the preparation of an EIS for major federal actions that may significantly affect the quality of the environment. In NEPA, the term \" environment \" encompasses the natural and physical environment (i.e., air, water, geography, and geology), as well as the relationship of people with that environment (i.e., health and safety, socioeconomic conditions, cultural resources, noise, and aesthetics). Necropsy \u2014examination of a dead animal to determine cause of death. Nitrogen Oxides (NO x)\u2014is a generic term for mono -nitrogen oxides (NO and NO 2). These oxides are produced during combustion, especially combustion at high temperatures. At ambient temperatures, the oxygen and nitrogen gases in air will not react with each other. In areas of high motor vehicle traffic, such as in large cities, the amount of nitrogen oxides emitted into the atmosphere can be quite significant. Non-attainment Area \u2014geographic area that does not meet the primary NAAQS limits established by the EPA to protect public health and the environment. Normal operations \u2014all normal (incident -free) conditions and those abnormal c onditions that frequency estimation techniques indicate occur with a frequency greater than 0.1 events per year. NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 8-6 Notice of Intent \u2014a public notice or notice of intent is information directed to citizens of a governmental entity regarding government -related activities. Public notices have traditionally been published in specified governmental publications and in local newspapers, a common source for community information. Ozone (O 3)\u2014ground- level ozone (the primary constituent of smog) is the most complex, dif ficult to control, and pervasive of the six principal air pollutants. Unlike other pollutants, ozone is not emitted directly into the air by specific sources. Ozone is created by sunlight acting on NO x and volatile organic compounds (VOC) in the air. There are thousands of types of sources of these gases. Some of the common sources include gasoline vapors, chemical solvents, combustion products of fuels, and consumer products. Emissions of NO x and VOC from motor vehicles and stationary sources can be carried hundreds of miles from their origins and result in high ozone concentrations over very large regions. Particulate Matter (PM) \u2014also known as particle pollution, PM is a complex mixture of extremely small particles and liquid droplets. Particle pollution i s made up of a number of components, including acids (such as nitrates and sulfates), organic chemicals, metals, and soil or dust particles.

PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls) \u2014are a group of chemicals consisting of 209 individual compounds. PCBs were widely used as a fire preventive and insulator in the manufacture of transformers and capacitors because of their ability to wi thstand exceptionally high temperatures. PCBs were banned by the EPA in 1979 and are classified as a probable human carcinogen by numerous national and international health- protective organizations. Pelagic \u2014of, relating to, or living in open oceans or seas rather than waters adjacent to land or inland waters. Perennial Streams\u2014streams are those that flow year -round. Plum Island Animal Disease Center (PIADC) \u2014the laboratory for the diagnosis, research, and training for foreign animal diseases. The USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) Foreign Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory is located at PIADC. This laboratory has the capability of diagnosing over 30 foreign animal diseases and is responsible for educating veterinarians in the recogniti on and diagnosis of these diseases. The USDA Agricultural Research Service operates a program focused on basic discovery and research of foreign animal diseases. The Department of Homeland Security scientific program focuses primarily on the advanced devel opment of vaccines and other countermeasures. Potable \u2014describes the condition of water as suitable for human consumption; water quality complies with the U.S. EPA standards for drinking water, which regulates various chemical, microbiological, radiological and physical contaminants. Prion \u2014infectious particle of protein that, unlike a virus, contains no nucleic acid, does not trigger an immune response, and is not destroyed by extreme heat or cold. Prion diseases are usually rapidly progressive and always fa tal. These particles are considered responsible for such diseases as scrapie, bovine spongiform encephalopathy, kuru, and Creutzfeldt -Jakob disease. Pyrophoric \u2014a material that is capable of spontaneous combustion when exposed to air. Reagent \u2014a substance us ed in a chemical reaction to detect, measure, examine, or produce other substances.

Sulfur is prevalent in all raw materials, including crude oil, coal, and ore, that contain common metals lik e aluminum, copper, zinc, lead, and iron. SO x gases are formed when fuel containing sulfur, such as coal and oil, is burned: when gasoline is extracted from oil: or metals are extracted from ore. Teratogen \u2014an agent that causes a structural abnormality fol lowing fetal exposure during pregnancy. Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs) \u2014is a calculation of the maximum amount of a pollutant that a water body can receive and still meet water quality standards, as well as an allocation of that amount to the pollutant 's sources. Virulence \u2014the degree of pathogenicity of a microorganism as indicated by the severity of disease produced and the ability to invade the tissues of the host; by extension, the competence of any infectious agent to produce pathologic effects. Viru s\u2014an infectious agent composed of biological material that requires a host to provide materials necessary to replicate and grow; a virus can not replicate without the support of living hosts, such as bacteria, plants, and animals. Vivarium \u2014a place, such as a laboratory, where live animals or plants are kept under conditions simulating their natural environment. Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) \u2014are emitted as gases from certain solids or liquids. VOCs include a variety of chemicals, some of which may have short - and long- term adverse health effects. Concentrations of many VOCs are consistently higher indoors (up to 10 times higher) than outdoors. VOCs are emitted by a wide array of products numbering in the thousands. Examples include paints and lacquers, pa int strippers, cleaning supplies, pesticides, building materials and furnishings, office equipment such as copiers and printers, correction fluids and carbonless copy paper, graphics and craft materials including glues and adhesives, permanent markers, and photographic solutions.
