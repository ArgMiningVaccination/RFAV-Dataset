While they can be a frequent occurrence for people who [remove their hair](https://www.byrdie.com/best-hair-removal-products-4587757)\u2014be it from waxing, shaving, tweezing, etc.\u2014they're nevertheless annoying and at times even painful. They occur when hair grows back and curls under the skin, becoming trapped. Thankfully though, there are several ways to treat and prevent them from occurring \u2014 and some of the best ones are home remedies. That's right, using just a few ingredients you likely already have in your home, you can create DIY recipes that'll soothe inflammation, buff away dead skin cells, and resurface new skin to free trapped [ingrown hairs](https://www.byrdie.com/best-ingrown-hair-treatments-4774468). What's more, we tapped three skincare experts to share the home remedies that they approve and recommend. Honey, oatmeal, and yogurt are just some of the ingredients you'll find recommended below by dermatologists, Kautilya Shaurya and Blair Murphy-Rose, along with the co-founder of LUSH skincare, Helen Ambrosen. Whether you're applying these DIY treatments to your legs, [bikini line](https://www.byrdie.com/how-to-shave-your-bikini-area-without-getting-bumps-7488724), etc., know you're one step closer to healthy, bump-free skin. Meet the Expert [Kautilya Shaurya](https://www.instagram.com/doctorkderm/?hl=en), MD, is a at New York's [Schweiger Murphy-Rose](https://www.instagram.com/drblairrose/?hl=en), MD, FAAD, is a dermatologist at [Laser & Skin Surgery Center of New York](https://www.laserskinsurgery.com/). Yogurt and Oatmeal Mix To decrease inflammation and provide gentle exfoliation simultaneously, combine oatmeal with cooling yogurt. Yogurt can also double as a sunburn remedy, as yogurt's natural properties will bring down the skin's temperature. Plus, it will help to cool down red, inflamed skin, adds Ambrosen. Ingredients: - 1/3 cup plain yogurt - 2 tbsp. oatmeal Directions: - Combine yogurt and oatmeal. - Gently mix until it becomes a soft paste. - Leave the paste on the skin for two-three minutes to cool it down. - Use soft, circular motions for a gentle exfoliation. - Rinse off with warm water. Key Ingredients [Yogurt](https://www.byrdie.com/yogurt-mask-for-breakout-4777026) is filled with good bacteria including probiotics, lactic acid, hyaluronic acid, as well as vitamins A, C, and E. Its cool texture soothes irritation while the gentle exfoliants reveal a brighter tone. Aspirin-Honey Treatment This recipe is a double whammy. Not only does aspirin contain [salicylic acid](https://www.byrdie.com/benzoyl-peroxide-vs-salicylic-acid), but honey also has antibacterial properties, which can help reduce the possibility of inflammation and infection, says Dr. Shaurya. So the two of them will help ward off infection and reduce swelling when applied to your skin. Here's how to make the treatment. Ingredients: - 3 uncoated aspirin tablets - 1 tsp. honey - 1/2 to 1 tsp. water or oil Directions: - Add warm water or oil to a bowl. - Mix in honey. - Crush aspirin tablets. - Mix together. - Leave mask on for 10 minutes. - Wipe off entirely with warm water. Baking Soda-Oatmeal Treatment Here's a great combo: Baking soda, which is an amazing exfoliator, helps reduce and prevent ingrown hairs. [Oatmeal](https://www.byrdie.com/oatmeal-scrubs-for-the-face-and-body-346778) has a soothing effect, reducing redness and irritation caused by exfoliation. Dr. Murphy-Rose mentions DIY ingredients like oatmeal as a great way to reduce inflammation after ingrown hairs occur. Ingredients: - 1 tbsp. baking soda - 1 cup of water - 1 tbsp. ground oatmeal Directions: - Mix baking soda and oatmeal together. - Add water to the bowl. - Stir until it has a paste-like texture. - Using a cotton pad, scoop up the mixture. - Apply to the affected area, and let it sit for 10 minutes. - Rinse with warm water. Tea Tree Oil Soak [Tea tree oil](https://www.byrdie.com/uses-for-tea-tree-oil-5079155) is anti-inflammatory, and it has antibacterial and antiseptic properties, which is why it's found in so many [acne products](https://www.byrdie.com/best-acne-creams-for-every-situation-4586445). It also helps to keep your skin's naturally occurring oils in check. Ingredients: - Warm water - Tea tree oil Directions: - Warm 8 ounces of water in a bowl. - Add about 20 drops of tea tree oil. - Use a clean washcloth to apply the mixture to the affected area. Use a warm washcloth to gently exfoliate and loosen dead skin. Dr. Murphy-Rose recommends doing this toward the end of your shower or bath when the skin is saturated with water. Ensure the temperature isn't too hot, and let the warm water do its thing. Black Tea Bag Treatment Tea is known to have many [natural healing properties](https://www.byrdie.com/best-teas-for-bloating-5080839), and black tea, in particular, is anti-inflammatory, which allows it to soothe skin and reduce redness. It also contains antioxidants like caffeine, which, aside from being part of our morning routine, also has great preventative acne and anti-aging benefits. Caffeine is also an anti-inflammatory and, therefore, a key benefit for ingrown hairs. Ingredients: - 1 black tea bag - Warm water Directions: - Heat water. - Dip tea bag to moisten. - Apply tea bag to the affected area. - Let sit for two to three minutes. Coconut Oil-Sugar Scrub You can use an exfoliant or another mild granular ingredient (like sea salt or granulated sugar), mix it with a carrier (like avocado or coconut oil\u2014something that won't immediately dissolve the granules), and make any DIY scrub. [Coconut oil](https://www.byrdie.com/coconut-oil-for-skin), for example, is hydrating, keeps skin moisturized, and reduces inflammation. It's our winter skin savior. Mix it with raw sugar, and you've got a winner. You can [use this scrub daily](https://www.byrdie.com/sugar-scrub-ingrown-hair-home-treatment-1717008) until you see an improvement, and then you can switch to two or three times a week. Just be careful that the scrub isn't too abrasive. Key Ingredients Coconut oil, also known as lauric acid, is derived from coconuts. The lauric acid found in coconut oil can have antimicrobial properties, which can help kill bacteria on the skin and reduce inflammation. It is also known to help remove makeup, exfoliate the skin, and lock in moisture. Ingredients: - 1 cup of raw sugar - 1/2 cup of coconut oil - 10 drops of tea tree oil or your preferred essential oil Directions: - Combine sugar and coconut oil in a bowl. - Add in essential oil. - Mix together. - Apply, and then rinse using warm water. - Dry with a clean towel. Ground Rice Exfoliant For those with tough, resilient skin, opt for a natural physical exfoliant that has grit. Ground rice is excellent for this, says Ambrosen, as it sloughs away surface-level dead skin cells \u2014 it's why LUSH uses it in their exfoliating products, such as the [Buffy body butter](https://www.lushusa.com/shower/body-butters-conditioners-1/buffy/9999900265.html). Ingredients: - Ground rice flour - Vegetable oil Directions: - Combine ground rice flour and vegetable oil. - Stir until it becomes a paste. - Gently rub it into the skin to buff away dead skin cells. - Rinse with warm water and pat dry. Oil-Based Serum If you're particularly sensitive, it's best to avoid overly harsh scrubs. Abrasive scrubs like sugar and salt scrubs do exfoliate the skin but often at the expense of causing excess skin irritation, Dr. Murphy-Rose says. She generally prefers the use of gentle chemical (acid) exfoliation, but if you're not into chemical exfoliants and want something to soothe skin post-shave, your best DIY option might be an [oil-based recipe](https://www.byrdie.com/non-comedogenic-oils-5094086) like this one. Ingredients: - 1 tbsp. castor oil - 1 tbsp. hemp oil (optional) - 10 drops tea tree oil Directions: - Find a reusable glass bottle. - Combine castor oil and hemp oil. - Add tea tree oil to mix. - Apply combination after shaving to prevent irritation. Tea Tree Oil and Witch Hazel Serum As mentioned, tea tree oil has natural antiseptic properties, and combined with warm water it makes for a gentle treatment. It helps loosen hair and clears out the follicles. Now, up the ante by adding witch hazel\u2014a natural plant that has antibacterial and antiseptic benefits that help prevent inflammation\u2014 that can be applied as a toner immediately following hair removal/shaving. Ingredients: - 10 drops of tea tree oil - 1 cup warm water - Tea tree oil Directions: - Warm 1 cup of water in a bowl. - Add tea tree oil to warm water. - Apply to skin. - Dab with witch hazel as a toner afterward. Aloe Vera-Baking Soda Treatment Look for products or natural ingredients (like aloe vera) that contain salicylic acid. It's known to help prevent infection, reduce bacteria, aid proper skin cell turnover, and prevent blockage of hair follicles. \"Salicylic acid is one of my favorite ingredients for at-home ingrown hair prevention because it is one of the few acids that can travel into the pore, working deep within the epidermis to keep your pores clear,\" says Dr. Shaurya. It also possesses anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties, which are two key components in combating ingrown hairs. Ingredients: - 2 tbsp. aloe vera - 1 tbsp. baking soda Directions: - Combine aloe vera and baking soda. - Let sit for two to three minutes. - Store the rest in a jar to use for later. - Keep in the fridge. Other at-home options range widely and include cleansers like CeraVe's [SA Body Wash](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077TWXCQV/?creativeASIN=B077TWXCQV&linkCode=w61&imprToken=8RtQ-OOsCP1IXs5a.ZgMTA&slotNum=21&tag=skincareskills01-20), saturated peel pads like First Aid Beauty's [Ingrown Hair Pads](https://www.firstaidbeauty.com/skin-care-products/serums-and-treatments/ingrown-hair-pads-with-bha-aha). There are plenty of [different exfoliants](https://www.byrdie.com/salicylic-acid-products) and [chemical peels](https://www.byrdie.com/body-peels) to choose from if the DIY route isn't for you. \"I recommend the use of alpha and beta hydroxy acids to exfoliate your skin, followed by a light non-comedogenic oil-free moisturizer,\" Dr. Murphy-Rose adds. Honey and Oatmeal Treatment We know honey has soothing and antibacterial properties, and this combination of ingredients keeps follicles clear of any blockages while providing calming and moisturizing benefits to the skin. All these things help coax ingrown hairs out of the follicle before they become inflamed or infected. Ambrosen recommends applying this mixture to already dampened skin for the best results. Ingredients: - 1/3 cup honey - 2 tbsp. chopped oatmeal Directions: - Combine honey and chopped oatmeal. - Slowly stir the mix until it becomes a soft paste. - Apply to slightly damp skin. - Use gentle pressure to work the paste into the skin, using circular motions. - Rinse it off with warm water and pat dry. - Where are ingrown hairs most common? Ingrown hairs are caused by hair that is trapped beneath the surface of the skin as it grows\u2014so anywhere hair can grow (arms, chin, back, etc.), - Are there side effects of ingrown hairs? Ingrown hairs can cause irritation or pimple-like lesions on the skin. - What if the ingrown hair continues to cause a problem? If you're noticing an accumulation of ingrown hairs (so much so that they're causing you discomfort or leading to infections), you should see a dermatologist.
