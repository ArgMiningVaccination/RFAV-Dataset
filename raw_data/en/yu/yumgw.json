The Coagulation and Beyond: Position Paper from 4th MCCT Akbulut et al. 809 Introduction During the Fourth Maastricht Consensus Conference on Thrombosis (MCCT), held in April 2022, the main theme of the conference was \"Blood coagulation and beyond \"express- ing the desire of the organizers to look beyond boundaries. A characteristic of this conference is the strong interaction among presenters and audience encouraged by the breakout sessions following presentations creating room for in-depth discussions among basic, translational, and clinical scientistsfrom different backgrounds. The MCCT meeting focused on ve different topics, to be addressed below. The authors comprise not only faculty but also PhD students that wereactively involved in discussions as well as note taking of the discussion sessions; these notes and the summary of the presentations provided the basis for this article in which allactively involved act as contributory authors. This meeting was co-organized with the EU-Marie Curie International Training Network TICARDIO and all PhD students from thisnetwork were contributing to this article. Theme 1: The \"Coagulome \"as a Critical Driver of Cardiovascular Disease The Brain Coagulome To brie fly introduce the term coagulome, which we use in analogy to the previously used term \"endotheliome \"to describe a multifactorial approach to the endothelium,1 assessing its multifunctional properties in health and disease by combining differ ent methods, to obtain anintegrated image of this pivotal cellular compartment, is essential. Primary and secondary prevention of ischemic stroke (IS) benets from antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapies.2 However, compared with coronary heart diseases (CHDs), P2Y12 inhibitors other than clopidogrel have no clinical use in primary stroke prevention and can be contraindicated (prasugrel) in patients with a previous stroke for increased risk of intracranial bleeding.3Similarly, dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) is effective just in the early phases of theIS (21 -30 days) before becoming useless or detrimental. In the case of vorapaxar, which is the only approved drug of a novel class antithrombotic agent acting on the protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR-1), trials directly assessing stroke management are lacking. 4PAR-1 is fundamental for pleiot- ropy of coagulation factors in the central nervous system(CNS). 5The main proteases that can activate PAR-1 are matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9)5and thrombin, whose activation state, concentration, and association with activat-ed protein C (aPC) lead to differential pathway activation in physiology 6as well as CNS pathologies. Factor (F) XI has been shown to be involved in thrombus stabilization during stroke.7In a large population, elevated FXI was associated with the risk of IS and a FXI:C level <15 U/dL incurred protection against stroke.8,9The FXIa level was higher in subjects with previous stroke compared with those with a history of transient ischemic attack (TIA) (34 vs. 11.4%, p<0.0001), suggesting that FXIa is associated with worse functional outcomes of cerebrovascular disease.10The relat- ed mechanism could be that inhibition of FXI(a) reduces Thrombosis and Haemostasis Vol. \u00a9 2023. The Coagulation and Beyond: Position Paper from 4th MCCT Akbulut generation, activation of brinolysis may of clots that form or embolize into cerebral arteries.11 Consistent with those ndings in human studies, in the mouse model of acute IS (temporal occlusion of the middle cerebral artery), administration of antibody 14E11 that blocks the activated FXII (FXIIa)-dependent activation ofFXI resulted in a signi cant reduction in infarct size and a signicant improvement in neurological function compared with the control group. 12Clinical and experimental evidence demonstrated that coagulation proteins have pleiotropic effects on the CNS not limited to physiological repair of vascular damage and pathological ischemic/hemorrhagicstroke. The different effects of antiplatelet and anticoagulant agents on the CNS can be in part due to the existence of aunique and complex interface represented by the neuro- vascular unit (NVU). Indeed, other organs can promptly differentiate their own blood vessels when repairing a lesion,or for metabolic reasons even without perturbing the tissue integrity, the same cannot be said for the CNS. The NVU is a unique integrated frontier in which the mesenchymal cells(endothelial cells [ECs], pericytes, smooth muscle cells, broblasts) do not originate from within the CNS tissue (purely ectodermal formed by neurons and macroglia) butpenetrate without violating its integrity during embryogen- esis. During CNS development through a clear contribution of coagulation factors such as tissue factor pathway inhibitor(TFPI), FV, FVII, and FX, the mesenchyma enters the nervous parenchyma. 13The same happens for the resident immune cells, the microglia, which is a distinct population of myeloidcells, not differentiated from the bone marrow (BM), but originating from the yolk sac. 14Hence the coagulation fac- tors, as mentioned, do not limit their intervention to vascular repair and exert their function also on the nervous tissue, justifying their emerging role in neurological diseases otherthan stroke. This pleiotropy has been demonstrated in various pathol- ogies that have no strict vascular etiology, such as multiplesclerosis (MS), Parkinson 's disease (PD), and Alzheimer 's disease (AD). 5TFPI was shown to be increased in the frontal cortex of AD brains compared with healthy controls.15In MS patients, TFPI levels were higher in the group of progressive MS compared with relapsing -remitting MS and healthy controls. Same results were obtained for plasminogen acti-vator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) expression in these groups. 16In a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of recovering MS patients, it was shown that plasma levels of TFPI17and other coagula- tion inhibitors (e.g., protein S) increased with increasing recovery rate and patients with a generally low level of TFPI in earlier disease states showed better rehabilitationafterwards. 17 As a neurodegenerative disease, AD is characterized by abnormal loss of cholinergic neurons in areas of the brainthat are primarily responsible for cognition and memory. The key pathological elements in AD have been proven to be amyloid- (A) peptides and neurogenic ber tangles. Inanimal studies, human amyloid precursor protein (hAPP) transgenic mice from line J20 (hAPP-J20 mice) are used toestablish the AD model, and the results have shown that coagulation factors are involved in the metabolism of A , 18,19 which can lead to the activation of FXII, resulting in FXI activation and thrombin generation, ultimately leading to a prothrombotic environment that contributes to the devel- opment of AD. These data are supported by decreased levelsof plasmatic FXI in AD patients, with depletion of its inhibi- tor, suggesting a chronic activation with subsequent inacti- vation and clearance of FXI during the disease. 20Moreover, in the same patients, activation of the intrinsic coagulation pathway is supported by elevated plasmatic brin levels.20 Compared with cognitively healthy people or patients diag- nosed with mild cognitive impairment, patients who are diagnosed with AD have signi cantly increased plasmatic levels of FXI.21FXI may therefore be a predictor of AD-type diagnosis, as an increase in FXI has been associated with a reduction in cognitive function.21,22Proteomic analyses of plasma and postmortem brain tissues (the inferior frontalcortex, superior frontal cortex, and cerebellum) from AD patients demonstrated a clear activation of complement coagulation cascade, in particular of FXII and FXIII, furthercorroborating this hypothesis. 23 The pathogenesis of AD could be particularly sensitive to NVU disruption; brin deposition, possibly an end stage product resulting from the long-term dysfunction of the NVU, has been demonstrated in both large vessels and capillaries of AD patients and can have a great impact onmetabolic coupling, particularly in the hippocampal re- gion. 24Parenchymal deposition of brin, as the last step of the coagulation cascade, could enhance the in flammatory state and contribute to the loss of integrity of the blood - brain barrier (BBB). In the dysfunctional NVU, astrocytic cyclophilin transduc-tion and thrombin/PAR-1 signaling. 25The BBB breakdown was more severe in carriers of APOE4, an identi ed genetic risk factor for AD with cognitive impairment, independentlyof AD biomarkers, both A and tau. The BBB damage, measured in vivo by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as well as pericyte- and platelet-derived biomarkers such assoluble platelet-derived growth factor receptor (sPDGFR ) predicted the future cognitive status in carriers even after controlling the analysis for A and tau levels. 25These predic- tive biomarkers correlated with increased CypA - MMP9 the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and are very prom- ising for early diagnosis of AD. Fibrin -Abrils are not accessible to breakdown by plasmin, -Ainteraction (as demonstrated through RU-505) could pave the way to overcome the failures in disease-modifying therapies for neurodegeneration.27 Finally, FXIIa, thrombo-in flammatory mediators, are detected in AD and their effects can be experimentally attenuated by FXII depletion.28 Thrombosis and Coagulation and Beyond: Position Paper from 4th MCCT Akbulut et al. 811 The aforementioned data reinforce the idea of the vicious circle starting with the regional failure of the NVU andleading to protein deposition and neuroin flammation. Potential areas for future investigation: Investigate the emerging pleiotropic role of coagulation cascade in the CNS with the central role of PAR1 interference. Explore the role of pericytes for NVU stability, for vascular tone, permeability, and metabolic regulation and as early CSF biomarkers of AD.

Targeting the brin/CD11b complex and inhibiting FXIa and FXII with novel or existing drugs in future clinical trials for neurodegeneration, especially AD. The Cardiovascular Coagulome: Focus on Thrombin and Inhibition of Its Ampli cation While the role of thrombin generation in CHD, including the process of atherogenesis and atherothrombosis, has been demonstrated in experimental and clinical studies, current research focuses on speci c coagulation proteases, including FXI and the tissue factor (TF)/TFPI axis. FXI, as a component of the intrinsic pathway of coagula- tion, is activated by FXIIa and then proceeds to the down-stream coagulation cascade that eventually triggers thrombin generation. In addition, FXI can also be feedback- activated by thrombin, further accelerating brin formation. Over the past decades, many studies have attempted to investigate the role of FXI in thrombin generation and itsrelationship with thrombus formation. In the animal model of atherosclerosis (ApoE knockout mice, ApoEko), knockout of FXI reduced peripheral athero-sclerosis by up to 33%. 29,30In another animal study, low- density lipoprotein receptor knockout (Ldlr/C0//C0) mice com- bined with high-fat diet were treated with anti-FXI antibody(14E11) or FXI ASO. Compared with controls, 14E11 and FXI- ASO both reduced the area of atherosclerotic lesions in the proximal aorta, and 14E11 also reduced aortic sinuslesions. 31These data suggest that FXI plays a role in athero- genesis, and that depletion of FXI may reduce development of atherosclerosis. Another indicative factor for thromboge-nicity in coronary lesions might be the co-localization of TFPI with TF. Tissue studies of coronary atherosclerotic plaques revealed expression of TFPI in ECs, macrophages, foam cells,and smooth muscle cells. Co-localization with TF only oc- curred in ECs and macrophages in the groups of highest severity and was also found in the necrotic lipid core. 32 CHD is the result of partial or complete occlusion of the coronary arteries due to thrombosis, which impairs the blood supply to the heart muscle. Outcomes of the PRIME studyincluding nearly 10,000 men showed that patients with a general low free TFPI plasma concentration had a more thantwofold increased risk of developing CHD. This effect was increased to sevenfold, when von Willebrand factor (vWF) levels were increased. 33Additionally, TFPI levels another study, TFPI levels in hospitalized patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) were indicative for the severity of myocar- dial infarction (MI) but were not associated with mortality.35 Numerous polymorphisms of TFPI have been studied over the last decades that in part correlate with increased risk of cardiovascular disease,36,37but sometimes only shown to be related to altered TFPI plasma levels, but not to an increased risk for CHD.38-40However, studies reporting blood concen- trations of coagulation should be carefully interpreted, sincelower circulating levels could re flect both reduced produc- tion or increased consumption (or vice versa). This requires more research to understand the pathophysiology in therespective disease setting to improve applicability of a given coagulation factor as a putative biomarker. Lorentz et al found that mice treated with an anti-FXI antibody, 14E11, had decreased myocardial infarct size in a model of ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, indicating that FXI activation or activity might contribute to cardiac I/Rinjury. 41Kossmann et al revealed that depletion of FXI could not only decrease damage. 42 The role of FXI in acute MI (AMI) is less clear than in stroke. Patients with lower levels of FXI are at less risk of venousthromboembolism (VTE) and MI 43and FXI level is correlated with MI risk among men in the study of Myocardial Infarction Leiden.44Butenas et al reported that plasma FXIa level could be quanti ed in most patients with ACSs, whereas it was undetectable in age-matched healthy controls.45However, conflicting data exist. Salomon et al reported similar inci- dences of AMI in patients with severe FXI de ciency and the general population and inherited FXI de ciency seems to be not protective against AMI.46Results from the Risk of Arterial Thrombosis in Relation to Oral Contraceptives (RATIO) case- control study showed that high levels of FXI are associatedwith IS, but are not or to a lesser extent associated with MI, in young women. 47These data suggest that the contribution of FXI in thrombosis varies between vascular beds and sex. Thequestion why the de ciency of FXI has disparate effects on acute IS and MI, and what the exact role of FXI on MI is, still requires further exploration. Atrial brillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac rhythm disorder and is associated with a prothrom- botic state. It was shown in a cohort study that in long-termfollow-up, the FXIa level in circulating blood has been associated with poor prognosis such as IS and cardiovascular death in AF patients on anticoagulants. 48Recently, the FXIa inhibitor asundexian at two doses (20 and 50 mg daily) showed lower bleeding rates than the active comparator, the FXa inhibitor apixaban 5 mg, in a phase II trial in AF at risk Thrombosis and Haemostasis Vol. 123 No. 8/2023 \u00a9 2023. The Coagulation and Beyond: Position Paper from 4th MCCT Akbulut et al. 812 for stroke. However, it still remains to be further investigated to what extent inhibition of FXI(a) is equally or more effectivethan established direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) to pre- vent thrombotic events and if they could improve long-term prognosis of AF. 49Current clinical studies testing the ef cacy and safety of different types of FXI inhibitors, or FXI-lowering agents, is discussed further on in this article. Potential areas for future investigation: A possible therapeutic target to prevent thrombo-in flam- mation occurring in the heart is the direct targeting of FXIor FXII that both can bind to platelets that concentrate both factors through their GPIb and PAI-1 surface pro- teins and thereby increasing thrombin generation. Apotential drawback of targeting in particular FXII is the increased risk for infection. Patients who are receiving FXI/FXII inhibitor treatment should therefore be moni-tored on a regular basis for markers of infection or inflammatory disease, such as concentration of comple- ment fragment C1q in soluble plasma. It remains to be investigated in clinical trials what exactly the differences are between inhibition of FXI and FXII and whether there is any redundancy to targeting prekallik-rein. Also, potential mechanisms of bypassing FIX activa- tion should be elucidated beforehand. It is still unclear whether possible therapeutic options against cardiovascular thrombosis would also be suitable for treating or preventing thrombotic events in the man- agement of aortic valve stenosis. One major risk factor foraortic valve stenosis patients is acquired vWF syndrome, which is directly related to disease severity. In this condition, vWF becomes proteolytically cleaved by highshear forces as it passes the stenotic valve. This results in a higher bleeding risk for patients of aortic valve stenosis that is not easy to measure. Another possible treatment strategy for preventing hypercoagulation in the heart might be drugs targeting TF or FVII, but to avoid bleeding, a safer approach is thetargeting of TF signaling pathways. Also, inhibitors of TF/FVII, such as NAPc2, 50could be repurposed as anti- inflammatory or anti brotic Bone Marrow: Role of Coagulation in Cell Traf cking Following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), the blood and immune system take a long time to regenerate. This period is dangerous since patients have a low ability to mount an immune respon se and are at a high risk for life- threatening infections and internal bleeding. Therefore, nd- ing novel ways to shorten the recovery time will reduce morbidity and mortality rates post HSCT. Previously the roleof coagulation-associated pathways in the regulation of murine hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) maintenance within the BM has been described. 51-55Impor- tantly, these pathways also regulate the mobilization of human HSPC in healthy stem cell donors, and moreover, impact the neutrophil and platelet engraftment rates ofpatients post HSCT. 56In particular, the involvement the major thrombin receptor in human HSPC regula- tion, was shown through analysis of peripheral blood sam-ples obtained from 20 healthy HSPC donors before and after treatment with G-CSF. Overall, the baseline levels of PAR1expression on circulating mononuclear cells (MNCs) before G-CSF treatment positively correlated with higher G-CSF-mobilized leukocytes and CD34 \u00feHSPC. To fur- ther assess the signaling in human HSPC mobilization, chimeric immune-de cient mice were utilized, pre-engrafted with human cord HSPC.Importantly, blocking PAR1 signaling by vivo speci c PAR1 antagonist inhibited mobilization of human white blood cells and CD34 \u00feHSPC to the circulation of chimeric mice. Migration, homing, engraft- ment, and mobilization of human HSPC are dependent on the chemokine CXCL12, which is highly expressed in the BM, andits major receptor CXCR4, which is expressed by human HSPC. Importantly, in vitro migration of human HSPC toward a gradient of the chemokine CXCL12 was inhibited by block-ing PAR1, suggesting a role in human HSPC migration and engraftment. Indeed, by following recovery parameters of patients transplanted with G-CSF-mobilized cells, accelerat-ed neutrophil and platelet engraftment in patients trans- planted with mobilized cells expressing higher PAR1 levels on MNC at baseline was demonstrated. Utilizing functionalpreclinical murine models, the importance of the thrombin/PAR1/nitric oxide (NO) axis as a crucial regulatory pathway mediating G-CSF-induced mobilization was dem-onstrated. 57The most primitive, hematopoietic (HSCs) express Its major ligand, aPC, is alsoproduced in the via the APC/EPCR/PAR1 axis controls BM HSC adhesion and retention via NO inhibition and activation of adhesion interactions. In contrast, G-CSFactivates NO generation in HSPC, EPCR shedding from their surface, which leads to their mobilization. Importantly, EPCR expression is essential for chemotherapy resistance of nor- mal mouse 53and human HSC58via adhesion interactions suggesting that, unfortunately, EPCR also protects humanacute myeloid leukemia stem cells from radio- and chemo- therapy treatments. To conclude, Nevo and colleagues iden- tied a new player participating in the regulation of human HSPC, with potential to predict ef ciency as well as clinical outcome of G-CSF-induced mobilization, homing, and en- graftment kinetics as well as ef ciency. Potential areas for future investigation: Assess the clinical importance of PAR1 by validating its role in autologous HSPC transplantation setting, wherethe main dif culty is harvesting mobilized HSPC from heavily chemotherapy-treated patients. Manipulating PAR1 expression in human HSPC to improve the ef ciency of mobilization and prognosis of HSPC- transplanted patients. Analyze the role of coagulation proteases in G-CSF-in- duced mobilization. Kidney: The Coagulome in Kidney Disease The loss of the microvasculature, also referred to as micro- vascular rarefaction, is a critical determinant in kidney disease states such as acute kidney failure, diabetic Thrombosis and Haemostasis Vol. 123 No. 8/2023 \u00a9 2023. The Coagulation and Beyond: Position Paper from 4th MCCT Akbulut et al. 813 nephropathy, or kidney transplant rejection.59The resulting ischemia is a driver for an in flammatory response that is associated with increased expression of pro brotic media- tors such as TGF or CTGF (connective tissue growth factor; CNN2) that ultimately contribute to chronic kidney failure. Pericytes are essential functional components of the micro- vasculature stabilizing the capillaries through multiple re-ciprocal interactions. A key mechanism in microvascular rarefaction is the dissociation of pericytes from to endothelial factor, or a disbalance in circulating levels ofangiopoietin(ang)-2 over ang-1. 62Conditions associated with ischemia can rapidly upregulate TF expression by vascular EC and elicit a pro-coagulant response throughactivation of the endothelial PARs. As a consequence, acti- vated ECs lose their cell -cell contacts, dissociate from the pericytes, and engage in an angiogenic response, all process-es that can promote microvascular rarefaction. For instance, in AF, the disbalance between supply and the excessive need for oxygen by the brillating myocytes leads to a state of hypoxia 5that promotes subendothelial TF expression. There- fore, the coagulome in the microvascular rarefac- tion that drives the pro- brotic substrate for AF is under active investigation. For instance, a recent paper by D\u00f3lleman et al explored the impact of DOACs on vascular integrity in vitro using platelet-free plasma in thrombin generation andendothelial barrier assays. rivaroxaban could preserve endothe- lial barrier function while dabigatran failed to protect endo- thelial integrity. The barrier disrupting effect of dabigatrancould be prevented in the presence of a custom-made peptide that blocks thrombin 's exosite-I. The take-home message of this study is that selective use of DOACs could well have a favorable impact on long-term (micro-)vascularhealth. Many studies have shown that activation of the coagula- tion system and platelets go hand in hand. In mouse modelsof kidney I/R injury, platelets rapidly adhere to the ischemic (micro-)vasculature. Using an in vitro model, it was dem- onstrated that platelets predominantly adhere to the (TF- rich) EC matrix where gaps were formed resulting from the loss of EC -EC contacts in cultured monolayers ( Fig. 1 ). Using this model of perfusion of platelet-rich plasma, it was demonstrated that the adhered platelets markedly stimu- lated the generation of FXa depending on the presence ofphospholipids, TF, and TFPI (Dolleman et al, manuscript in preparation). Subsequent studies revealed that the adhered platelets resemble the so-called coated platelets 64that, due to dual activation, highly express P-selectin, TF, TFPI, and heparinase. These data strongly support a potential role for platelets in ischemia-driven microvascular rarefaction. Thiscould be particularly relevant for patients with diabetic nephropathy. In fact, recent data show that platelets can be detected in the glomeruli of patients with diabetic kidneydisease. Moreover, a direct relation was observed between platelet-derived extracellular vesicles and the degree of albuminuria in these patients. 65Subsequent mechanistic studies in a mouse model for diabetic nephropathy demon- strated that the platelet P2Y12 inhibitor ticagrelor could counteract progression by matrix expansion, macrophage in ltration, and brosis. 66Future studies with selective platelet inhibitors such as GLP-1 analogues67could well augment our Fig. 1 Platelet-rich plasma rotation perfusions on TNF -treated monolayers of human umbilical vein endothelial cells. After 15 minutes the cultures were xed and stained for platelets (F-actin), nuclei (Hoechst), and (right panel) brin (anti brinogen antibody).

Potential areas for future investigation: While equally effective in anticoagulant activity, selective use of DOACs could have long-term bene cial effects for microvascular complications in chronic kidney disease patients. These in vitro ndings should be validated by in vivo animal and clinical studies. The long-term bene t of the use of selective platelet inhibitors by patients with diabetic nephropathy war-rants clinical investigation. Coagulation in Endothelial Cell Barrier Function Hyperlipidemia results in LDL/APOB-containing lipoproteinaccumulation in the artery walls, promoting vascular in- flammation, EC dysfunction, and localized loss of endothelial barrier function. Recent works have highlighted the exten-sive crosstalk between coagulation and in flammation in such diseases in which EC dysfunction serves as a hallmark. 68-72 Yet, the inciting factors for in flammation in hyperlipidemia remain unclear. Studies have shown that inhibiting FXI reduced in flammatory markers in mouse and nonhuman primate models of either acute and chronic in flamma- tion.31,73 -75Translating this to patients, it has recently been shown that pharmacological inhibition of FXI reduces inflammatory markers, including the hallmark biomarker C- reactive protein (CRP), in a clinical trial in end-stage renal disease patients on hemodialysis.76Follow-on studies are underway to evaluate whether use of FXI inhibition for theprevention of catheter-associated thrombosis similarly blunts the rise in CRP levels following placement of an indwelling catheter, which would provide further evidenceof a link between the FXI activation and in flammation (ClinicalTrials.gov #NCT04465760). Continuing this theme, preliminary studies in a primate model of diet-induced hyperlipidemia show that the elevated CRP levels in an obesecohort were reduced by approximately 25% following 4 weeks of anti-FXI therapy. De ning the mechanisms by which FXI plays a role in propagating in flammation will provide insight into whether FXI inhibition has potential therapeutic anti-in flammatory bene disease and, in particular, hyperlipidemia. Vascular endothelium serves as a site of catalysis for enzymatic reactions, while also facilitating multiple path-ways that maintain blood cells in a quiescent state. As such, EC dysfunction is common in in flammatory diseases, such as atherosclerosis, and often appears early on in thecourse of the disease. 77,78Recent observations have shown that FXI inhibition preserves endothelial barrier function in mice and primates in vivo,31,75suggesting that the EC surface may serve as a source or a sink for FXIa activity (Fig. 2 ). Mechanistic studies discovered that the antico- agulant role of the endothelium includes sequestration ofFXIa activity. 79Next, it was determined that FXIa is inactivated by complex formation with vascular EC-de- rived PAI-1. It was found that FXIa -PAI-1 complexes were either released into the media or traf cked to EC endo- somes and lysosomes in vitro ( Fig. 2 ). In a nonhuman primate model of lethal systemic in flammatory response syndrome (SIRS) associated with sepsis, the authors were able to detect FXIa -PAI-1 complexes in the circulation after a bacterial challenge.79In preliminary studies, it was found that inactivation of FXIa by PAI-1 on the EC surface may invoke a signaling pathway to increase vascu- lar permeability by way of cleavage of EC VE-cadherin.Taken together, these data suggest that the kallikrein - kinin system, and, in particular, FXI, act as a nexus b e t w e e nt h ec o a g u l a t i o nc a s c a d e ,i n flammation, and EC barrier function. This work holds promise to provide rationale for FXI inhibition as a useful approach for pro- tecting barrier function in settings characterized by in- flammation such as hyperlipidemia.

The Coagulation and Beyond: Position Paper from 4th MCCT Akbulut et al. 815 Potential areas for future investigation: To determine whether the ability of FXI to act \"upstream \" and activate FXII contributes to activation of the kallikre- in-kinin system to promote in flammation. To explore if FXI activation or activity directly regulates EC barrier (dys)function. Theme 2: Novel Mechanisms of Thrombosis The Relevance of Factor XII? FXIIa is a serine protease consisting of a heavy and a light chain held together by a disul de bond. It auto-activates upon contact with negatively charged compounds (e.g., glass, kaolin, and diatomaceous earth), as well as biological nega-tively charged molecules (e.g., DNA, RNA, misfolded proteins, polyphosphates). Substrates of FXIIa include coagulation, in flammation, brinolysis, and angio- genesis. Surprisingly, however, its de ciency in humans has not been associated with an overt pathological phenotype. Nevertheless, a cohort study found FXII levels to be inverselyassociated with overall mortality, although not for those atthe lowest levels. 80These apparently contradictory ndings have stirred the debate on the physiologic functions of FXII( Fig. 3 ). Involvement of FXII in human hemostasis is based on its essential role in contact-activated in vitro coagulation assays.Moreover, its concentration in blood is higher than any other coagulation factor from the contact activation system (e.g., /C2410-fold higher than FXI). This stands in stark contrast to the lack of a bleeding phenotype in FXII-de cient humans and knockout mouse models. Thus, the question arises: is FXII really a coagulation factor? To explain this discrepancy, it hasbeen hypothesized that FXII might only be involved in hemostasis of soil-contaminated wounds, where it is acti- vated by negatively charged silicates. This so-called \"dirty wound theory \"is based on the observation that marine animals lack FXII, in contrast to land-based animals. 81 From an evolutionary perspective, particularly the absence of FXII in sea mammals suggests its redundancy in wounds which are continually cleaned by surrounding water. This theory is supported by experiments in FXII-knockout mice,where hemostatic differences between clean and soil- Fig. 3 Potential physiological role of factor XII. BK, bradykinin; C3(a), (act Coagulation and Beyond: Position Paper from 4th MCCT Akbulut et al. 816 contaminated wounds were observed.82Future studies will have to establish if these differences also have physiologicalrelevance in humans. While its hemostatic role in wound healing remains uncertain, activated FXII is known to trigger the formationof migration, and complement activation contributing to the immune defensein the wound site. Interestingly, excess FXIIa levels are observed in a genetic disease called hereditary angioedema (HAE), characterized by recurrent episodes of severe edemadue to extreme bradykinin release. 83It is caused either by a FXII mutation causing increased autoactivation or a de cien- cy of its main inhibitor, C1 esterase inhibitor.84Another mutation of FXII resulting in spontaneous auto-activation has been identi ed as the cause of a rare disorder termed FXII-associated cold autoin flammatory syndrome (FACAS), which is headaches, and malaise.85These phenotypes of HAE FACAS both support the notion that FXII is mainlyinvolved in regulating in flammation and vascular permeability. Notably, patients with HAE or FACAS are not reported to have increased thrombosis risk, despite the underlying uncontrolled FXII activation. This begs the question: can FXIIa \"choose \"to have enzymatic activity for a certain substrate? Unraveling of this question will require further molecular insight into FXII. Currently, this protein is thought about as a \"string of pearls \"with ve domains linked to the protease domain by a proline-rich region. However, the natural con rmation of FXII is most likely very different and our understanding of individual domainsis limited. Molecular research will have to establish in what ways this protein can be activated and interact with its substrates, which might explain distinct enzymatic activity in different conditions. Furthermore, FXII has been implicated in the brinolytic system based on its high degree of homology with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). Indeed, in vitro experiments have shown that FXIIa can convert plasminogen to plasminand enhance brinolysis, but its rate is much lower than that of tPA or urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA). 86Therefore, the relevance of this in vivo remains to beestablished. Conversely, however, plasminogen was found to influence pathways of FXII presenting as HAE in the setting of a rare plasminogen mutation (HAE-PLG). 87 Finally, although FXII is mainly secreted by the liver, there is growing evidence for a separate pool of leukocyte- expressed FXII that contributes to wound healing and angio-genesis. 88This was found to be mediated by unactivated FXII signaling through the uPA receptor, stimulating processes such as EC growth and proliferation. This more recent nding highlights the variety of roles FXII has in human physiology, some of which might still need to be uncovered. In conclusion, although clinical data on FXII do not support a pivotal role in hemostasis or thrombosis, new perspectives regarding the role of FXII have been discovered in the last two decades. These include a role in in flammation,brinolysis, and angiogenesis, with novel pathways down- stream of FXII still pending to be elucidated. Potential areas for future investigation: To establish why gain-of-function mutations in FXII lead to an in flammatory, but not a thrombotic state. To further delineate the relationship between structure and function of FXII. Biomechanics of Fibrin and Fibrin Clot Lysis In both physiological and pathological conditions, thrombiare subjected to extreme mechanical forces such as woundstretch, clot contraction, or shear stress. Yet, thrombi manage to retain their structural integrity through a remarkable combination of compliance and resilience. These character-istics are understood to be provided by the brin network, which forms the primary scaffold of clots. Fibrin networks can reversibly stretch up to approximately 150%, resistelongation of several hundred percent, and stiffen by at least two orders of magnitude before rupture. 89,90Biophysical studies over the past decade have shown that these uniquemechanical features stem from the complex structure of brin bers, which are bundles of proto brils that are themselves double-stranded laments of brin molecules. Consequently, brin networks undergo several phases of stretch at different structural levels ( Fig. 4 ).91 Atrst, stretch causes the natively disordered and hence flexible C-domains of brin molecules to straighten, which allows elongation (i.e., strain) with almost no increase in resistance to deformation (i.e., elastic modulus). Next, thebers gradually align in the direction of strain, which is accompanied by a strong increase of the elastic modulus. Finally, the strain is transferred to the folded domains of thebrin monomers, which results in a further linear increase of the modulus. If the strain continues to be increased, however, Fig. 4 Elastic modulus of a brin network as a function of strain, measured by shear rheology. Fibrin forms a soft elastic network at lowstrain, and stiffens 100-fold in various stages marked by the vertical dashed lines when the strain is increased. The stages correspond to entropic elasticity (low strain), strain-induced ber alignment, ber backbone stretching, and nally brin monomer unfolding. Thrombosis and 2023. The Coagulation and Beyond: Position Paper 4th MCCT Akbulut et al. 817 the folded monomer domains start to unfold, which provides irreversible elongation, and eventually leads to rupture. These insights into brin mechanics have only recently been acquired by applying novel methods based on rheology combined with in situ X-ray scattering or vibrational spec-troscopy complemented with single- ber and single-mole- cule stretching assays. 90-92This mechanistic understanding ofbrin mechanics is ready to be used now to assess the role of mechanical forces in thrombotic and bleeding disorders. Thus far, clot characteristics have mainly been studied using microscopy. These studies found that patients with MI, IS,VTE, and recurrent episodes are characterized by in vitro brin clots with a dense network and thinner bers. 93Such clots are known to be less permeable, making them lesssusceptible to brinolysis, which could explain associations to adverse outcomes. However, dense clots are also known to be stiffer, which potentially increases thrombus obstructive-ness or embologenicity, giving an alternative explanation for differences in outcomes. In contrast, patients with hemo- philia A and B were found to have clots with loose networksand thick bers, which might make them more prone to bleeding events due to the fragility of such clots. 94,95 These ndings suggest that mechanical phenotyping of clots is a promising avenue for future research. It might provide parameters that can contribute to more accurate diagnosis and risk strati cation, mirroring the use of me- chanical phenotyping for connective tissue disorders and cancer.96Also, it could give rise to novel therapies using pharmacological or mechanical interventions that in fluence thrombus mechanics to, for example, improve outcomes of endogenous or therapeutic thrombolysis. However, much still needs to be elucidated about clot mechanics and the roleof the brin network in physiology and pathology. Experi- ments on brin have mostly been performed in puri ed systems. This means it is largely unknown how brin inter- acts with other clot components such as platelets and red blood cells, and hence how thrombus composition andspatially heterogeneous structure thrombi). 97,98In summary, integration of biophysical research into the eld of thrombosis and hemostasis is bound to bring fascinating fundamental insights and clinically relevant advances in the near future. Potential areas for future investigation: The interplay of macromolecules including brin and different cell types (platelets, red blood cells) in clot mechanics and sensitivity to lysis. The relation between different mechanical properties of thrombi (stiffness, viscoelasticity, plasticity, rupture strength) and the risk of embolization and sensitivity of clots to lysis. Evaluate the potential of mechanical phenotyping of thrombi, either collected by thrombectomy or reconsti- tuted from patient plasma, for diagnosis and risk strati cation. Evaluate the potential of mechanical phenotyping of thrombi to assess the ef cacy of novel therapies usingpharmacological or mechanical interventions that in flu- ence thrombus mechanics to improve outcomes of endog- enous or therapeutic thrombolysis. T h eM i c r o b i o m ea n dT h r o m b o s i s In contrast to acute in flammatory conditions in case of viral infections, the gut microbiota is a driver of low-grade inflammation, chronically impacting vascular in flamma- tion.99Dependent on host nutrition, microbiota-derived products constantly leak into the portal circulation, with signaling-active molecules and metabolites reaching thehepatic microcirculation. 100Studies on germ-free mouse models clearly demonstrate that the transcriptome of the liver sinusoidal endothelium is broadly in fluenced by gut microbial colonization, with the sphingolipid synthesis path- way recently identi ed as one of the primarily affected microbiota-modulated pathways.101,102Furthermore, vWF expression in the hepatic endothelium is augmented by the presence of gut commensals.103Another example is the sensitivity of neutrophils toward lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced neutrophil extracellular traps (NET)osis, presence of gut commensals. 104Impor- tantly, several experimental and clinical studies unveiled thegut microbiota as a novel risk factor for cardiovascular disease and arterial thrombosis. 103,105 and germ-free had elevated levels and Apoe -decient mice presented increased atherosclerotic lesion size, an effect that wasabolished at production of the short-chain fatty acid butyrate, has a protective role in atherogenesis.111Another microbiota-derived metabolite related to cardiovascular risk and arterial trimethylamine (TMA), a choline metabolite produced and converted to flavin-dependent monooxygenase-3 in the a translational pig model it was recently demon-strated that the reduction of dietary fat for a time period of 30 days, resulting in reduced plasma cholesterol levels, was able to revert dysbiosis of the fecal microbiome and to reduceplasma TMAO levels, 116a predictive functional marker for adverse cardiac events.117Vascular innate immune signaling, triggered by microbial-associated molecular patterns de-rived from the intestinal microbiota, for instance by the activation of endothelial Toll-like receptor-2 signaling in the liver resulting in enhanced vWF synthesis, is an addi-tional mechanism linking the gut microbiota with enhanced arterial thrombus growth. 5In contrast to germ-free diversity might Thrombosis and Vol. 123 No. 8/2023 \u00a9 2023. The Coagulation and Beyond: Position Paper from 4th MCCT Akbulut et al. 818 cardiovascular disease therapies as shown for ticagrelor by a recent study on the ef cacy of antiplatelet treatment in STEMI.113Moreover, it was shown that chronic statin thera- py is linked to lower prevalence of microbiota dysbio- sis.119,120In addition to above, abnormal gut microbiome homeostasis could be linked to development of chronic effects from viral infections.121Alterations in gut micro- biome have been reported, linked to cytokine release fromcells, due to viral load, with implications also seen in SARS- CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) infections. 122,123Also, circulating extracellular vesicles po- tentially transport viral miRNA in promoting dysbiosis.124Extracellular vesicles, carrying cytokines and pro-in flammatory markers, may also further exacerbate atherosclerosis and viral infections, such as during corona- virus disease 2019 (COVID-19).125,126 Potential areas for future investigation: Based on gnotobiotic experimentation and insights from sequencing and multi-omics studies, it will be interestingto reveal microbiota-triggered molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in thrombogenesis at various settings. Given the broad interference of microbiota-derived metabolites with host metabolism and the microbiota- dependent regulation of host metabolic pathwaysinvolved in cardiovascular disease development, an im- proved understanding of their role in cardiovascular disease and thrombosis is needed. Well-designed functional studies are needed to identify microbiota -drug interactions, which, dependent on microbiome composition, can in fluence the outcome of antithrombotic therapies. Viruses and Coagulation: The Case of COVID-19 Viral infections are associated with coagulation disorders, driven by in flammatory pathways.127,128All aspects of the coagulation cascade, primary hemostasis, coagulation, andbrinolysis, can be affected and the net result may be bleeding 129and/or [athero]thrombosis.130The spectrum of viral infections comprises different dynamics, ranging fromacute to chronic and from a mild to a severe clinical course, resulting in a different interplay between the in flammatory and coagulation cascades and with different risk pro les for thrombo-embolic and/or bleeding complications. The inter- action between infection, in flammation, and the hemostatic system is a multifactorial dynamic process led by modi able and nonmodi able risk factors. Unlike most bacterial infec- tions treatable with speci c antibiotics, no speci c antiviral treatment is available for most viral infections, other thansupportive treatment. Otherwise, the success of treatment interventions such as dexamethasone or anti-IL-6, depends much on timing and it is a challenge to de ne the optimal moment or time period of intervention in a heterogeneous patient population. Investigation of coagulation disorders related to different viral infections has not been performeduniformly; therefore, common pathways are not fully eluci- dated yet. Furthermore, research is hampered due to speci c biosafety facilities needed to study speci c viruses. A betterinsight into pathogenesis on the one hand and improvement of bedside monitoring tools on the other hand is urgentlyneeded to improve clinical management. An increasing body of evidence demonstrates extensive and bidirectional interactions between in flammation and coagulation. 127,131 -136Normally, coagulation is balanced by pro- and (natural) anticoagulant mechanisms. In flammation impacts the initiation, propagation, and inhibitory phases ofblood coagulation. 132In viral and bacterial infections, this can actually lead to both thrombotic and hemorrhagic com- plications. Pathogens, as well as in flammatory cells and mediators, can induce the expression of TF on monocytes and EC surfaces.136Direct or indirect activation of the endothelium by viruses or other pathogens may result inalterations in the coagulation and brinolytic systems. 137,138 There is also an incompletely understood connection of infections with RNA viruses activating toll like receptor(TLR) 7 and autoimmune antibody production. 139These antiphospholipid autoimmune antibodies also develop in severe COVID-19 disease.140 The clinical picture of altered coagulation in several viral infections manifests itself in bleeding (hemorrhage), throm- bosis, or both. An exaggerated response may even lead todisseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) with the for- mation of microvascular thrombi in various organs. 141DIC contributes to multiple organ failure and is associated withhigh mortality in both bacterial and nonbacterial dis- eases. 134,141It is not yet clear why some viruses cause hemorrhaging (e.g., Ebola), while others are associatedwith thrombosis (e.g., cytomegalovirus) and yet others show both complications (e.g., varicella zoster virus). 142-144 Bleeding may be aggravated by the occurrence of thrombo- cytopenia either separately, or as part of viral coagulop- athy.128In addition to this, the bleeding complications of hemorrhagic viruses vary in severity, such as the minor bleeding complications in some forms of dengue and more severe bleeding in Ebola and Marburg. As mentioned formany viral infections, targeted therapy is not available, and only supportive care can be provided. In many mild cases, treatment may not even be necessary. However, to improvetherapy and supportive care for complicated viral infections, a better understanding of the pathogenesis of bleeding and thrombotic complications due to viral infections is needed. The Case of COVID-19 In patients with severe COVID-19 infection, many studieshave shown that not the infection itself, but the host immune response results in a hyperin flammatory state, which can be a trigger of vascular thrombotic events, a phenomenon thatwe call immunothrombosis. 145 The term thromboin flammation is derived from throm- bosis associated with in flammation and is used to describe pathophysiologic perturbations due to vascular endothelial injury and/or and humoral in flammatory mech- anisms of immune surveillance are activated in this dynamic process. In acute infections, thromboin flammation may cul- minate in microvascular thrombosis, which is of Thrombosis and Haemostasis Vol. 123 No. 8/2023 \u00a9 2023. The Coagulation and Beyond: Position Paper from 4th MCCT Akbulut et al. 819 the disease, as has been reported in postmortem studies of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome due topathogens invading the respiratory tract and provoking an inflammatory response associated with acute lung injury. 147 Immunothrombosis, if balanced, is a physiological role in host defense. The term describes the microvascular throm- botic response that facilitates microbe containment and elimination, a critica l component of in nate immunity.148,149 The pathological entity from immunothrombosis is in situ pulmonary thrombosis which is a different entity from the embolic events from deep vein thrombi which are a net resultof thromboin flammation. 150As part invasion, microcirculatory thrombosis also produces multiorgan injury.151,152These important host defense mechanisms have been described, but with the ongoing pandemic and massive numbers of COVID-19 patients who manifested lung or multiorgan dys-function, the concept of immunothrombosis was increasing- ly reported. 148In summary, although thromboin flammation and immunothrombosis have many similarities, they shouldnot be used as interchangeable counterparts, even if they have been used synonymously in the past. Long COVID de ned as long-lasting multiorgan symptoms that last for weeks to months after SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with cardiovascular manifestations including peri-myocarditis. If and how in situ thrombosis does play arole in long COVID is still unanswered, and studies are ongoing. Currently there is no guided therapy for long COVID other than anecdotal reports and further studies are neededto unravel the underlying mechanisms. 153 Potential areas for future investigation: Determine the viral or in flammatory triggers for either thrombosis and/or bleeding. The role of vascular bed-speci c hemostasis in viral infections. Study the role of in flammatory components, i.e., virus- speci c T-cells in the initiation and regulation of the hemostatic balance. Determine better ways of translating results from the homogeneous [experimental] models into clinical prac-tice, or heterogeneous reality to improve the timing and type of therapeutic interventions. Theme 3: How to Limit Bleeding Risks: Insights from Translational Studies Genetics and Bleeding Disorders Hemostasis is controlled by interplays between platelets, coagulation, and brinolysis; their normal function is to prevent bleeding. Genetic variants in genes that encode for regulators of these three processes are known to cause inherited forms of bleeding. The summary deals with theuse of next-generation sequencing (NGS) approaches for diagnostic and gene discovery. To date, almost 100 curated disease-causing genes have been identi ed to platelet, or thrombotic disorders (www.isth.- org/page/GinTh_GeneLists). 154This is a dynamic list that is yearly updated as since 2011; 25 novel genes have beendiscovered using NGS approaches.155This gene list is useful for clinical laboratories that have implemented multigenepanel tests to diagnose inherited bleeding disorders. This is a cost-effective approach to rapidly screen patients. The inter- national study ThromboGenomics has shown that the diag-nostic rates obtained for thrombocytopenia, platelet function, and coagulation disorders are 47.8, 26.1, and 63.6%, respectively, while this rate drops to 3.1% for patientswith unexplained bleeding disorders (having normal labora- tory test parameters) using a multigene panel test. 156These differences can be explained by the inclusion criteria and thequality of the laboratory test that detects the abnormality. Patients with abnormal test data for (anti-)coagulation parameters or with low platelet counts are easy to identify,and genetic variants are often associated with such defects. Still, genetic variants were also detected in some patients with normal laboratory parameters where these assays wereunable to detect the defect. In contrast, the genes for the platelet function disorder \"storage pool disease \"or having unexplained bleeding disorder are still unknown and there-fore, screening with a multigene panel test is not useful as exempli ed by causing a very low diagnostic rate in the ThromboGenomics study. Of interest is the unexpectednding of oligogenic inheritance where patients have more variants in more than one gene. Today, this eld still strug- gles with the detection of numerous variants of unknownsignicance (VUSs) that cannot be used in clinical prac- tice. 157These VUSs require further functional and genetic studies to prove pathogenicity. Rapid screening models anddata exchange with the community could improve the vari- ant classi cation. International studies BRIDGE-BPD genome sequencing (WGS) for the discovery of novel genes for bleeding disorders. 158,159Success rates are typically high if screening consanguineous or very large pedigrees, or if more families have been recruited with similar gene phe-notypes. Even if the genetic defect is discovered, it can take several years to understand the disease as illustrated for SRC-related thrombocytopenia. 154Five years after the dis- covery of the SRC gain-of-function variant E527K, the same variant was detected in other pedigrees that helped to delineate the syndromic phenotype associated with throm-bocytopenia and RNAseq provided evidence for defective interferon regulation as underlying cause. 154Still many patients do not receive a diagnosis even though theircomplete genome has been analyzed. This can be explained by the fact that each genome contains numerous unique coding variants and the noncoding regions are very dif cult to analyze due to the lack of information about regions of interest (promoter or regulatory regions) versus junk DNA. An additional layer of information will be critical to under-stand noncoding variation. Therefore, blood cell RNAseq will be performed for patients who do not have a diagnosis but from whom WGS data are available. Gene expressionand splicing analysis will assist in the understanding of variants that in fluence these processes as the cause of a bleeding disorder. Thrombosis and Haemostasis Vol. 123 No. 8/2023 \u00a9 2023. The Coagulation and Beyond: Position Paper from 4th MCCT Akbulut et al. 820 Potential areas for future investigation: Oligogenic inheritance is unexplored in our eld. It is currently not understood what the clinical relevance is of combining common and rare variants in different knowngenes that modify bleeding and thrombosis risks. This might be relevant for molecular diagnostics as it is known that single variants can result in a different clinicalseverity of a certain disorder. Some patients present with obvious clinical bleeding phenotypes but have normal laboratory test data. Geneticcauses still remain unknown for such patients as it is very difcult to nd causative genes if no idea of the underly- ing defective pathway is known. It might be necessary todevelop better laboratory assays to study such patients and these should include ECs that are currently not studied. In addition to the currently used WES and WGS, other OMICS methods will be required to explore disease mech- anisms and enhance gene discoveries. Novel statisticalmethods that can combine OMICS results will be required to address these needs. Genetics and Antithrombotics: Toward Individual Drug Tailoring Personalized Antithrombotic Therapy Based on Genetic Testing Besides several other factors (i.e., body weight, diabetes, etc.) genetic polymorphisms play a role in the variable response ofdrugs in patients. 160Therefore, genetic testing may in fluence the ef cacy and/or safety of antithrombotic treatment, and thus optimize patients 'outcomes. Genetic Testing When a nucleotide change in a gene is present in more than 1% of a population, it is called a genetic polymorphism. These polymorphisms often affect the drug-metabolizing cyto-chrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes, which play a role in activa- tion or deactivation of a drug. 161 In patients with ACSs or undergoing percutaneous coro- nary intervention (PCI), DAPT P2Y12 inhibitor (ticagrelor, prasugrel, and clopi- dogrel) is the cornerstone of medical therapy to prevent therecurrence of thrombotic events including stent thrombo- sis. 162Ticagrelor and prasugrel are much stronger than clopidogrel and have shown reduced thrombotic events inlarge outcome trials. 163,164However, the reduced thrombot- ic risk is counterbalanced by an increased bleeding risk.163,164In addition, it is well known that major bleeding has a similar impact on patient outcome as a recurrent thrombotic event, e.g., MI.165,166Aspirin is metabolized by different enzymes, but up to now none of the genetic poly-morphisms has impacted clinical outcome. 167Ticagrelor is a direct-acting drug, while both clopidogrel and prasugrel need activation by cytochrome CYPP450 genes.168The active compound of ticagrelor is metabolized by CYP3A4, which can also directly bind to the P2Y12 receptor.169Prasugrel is metabolized mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2B6, and to someextent by CYP2C9 and CYP2C19; however, polymorphisms in these genes are not related with a heightened thromboticrisk. 170However, clopidogrel is very much affected by poly- morphisms which lead to less response in 30% of patients.171 In the two-step activation of clopidogrel process, CYP2B6, CYP2C9) ( Fig. 5 ).172 CYP2C19 plays a role in both steps and is the greatest contributor in this metabolic process. The prevalence of the CYP2C19 polymorphisms (/C32a n d/C33) is approximately 25% of the Caucasian population.168There are much data demon- strating carriers of CYP2C19 LoF-alleles have reactivity (HPR).173-176This to higher risk for thrombotic including stent thrombosis.173,177 Clinical Evidence for a Genotype-Guided Antithrombotic Therapy Many studies have assessed a CYP2C19 genotype-guided strategy (escalating or de-escalating) in patients with coro-nary artery disease (CAD). 178,179De-escalation means switching from a more potent drug (ticagrelor or prasugrel) to the less potent clopidogrel in extensive metabolizers,while escalation means switching from clopidogrel to tica- grelor or prasugrel in intermediate or poor metabolizers. De- escalation can be used in ACS, where standard treatment isticagrelor. Escalation can be done in chronic coronary syn- drome patients undergoing PCI, stroke or peripheral artery disease, where clopidogrel is standard treatment. In the RCT the Popular Genetics, a genotype-guided de- escalation strategy was tested versus usual care in 2,488 patients undergoing primary PCI for STEMI. All patients weretreated with aspirin, but in the genotype-guided group, intermediate and poor metabolizers were treated with tica- or prasugrel (39%), and extensive metabolizers with clopidogrel (61%). Patients in the control group were all treated with ticagrelor or prasugrel. Genotype-guidedP2Y12-inhibitor treatment reduced the bleeding risk (9.8 vs. 12.5%, in thrombotic events. In the RCT TAILOR-PCI, 5,302 patients undergoing PCI for ACS or stable CAD were randomized to genotype-guidedescalation or conventional therapy (clopidogrel). 180In the genotype-guided group, intermediate or poor metabolizers were treated with ticagrelor (31%), and the other patientswere treated with clopidogrel (68%). The primary analysis was only in patients who were intermediate or poor metab- olizers and did not show a statistical difference in cardiovas-cular death, MI, stroke, stent thrombosis, and severe recurrent ischemia 95% CI: 0.43 - 1.02; p\u00bc0.06), but the reduced event rate suggests a clinical benet with the genotype-guided group. There was also no signicant difference in bleeding between groups. Despite the fact that the trial was underpowered to detect an effectsize less than the prespeci ed expected 50% relative risk reduction, it showed a promising reduction in thrombotic risk of genotype-guided therapy. A meta-analysis including Thrombosis and Vol. 8/2023 \u00a9 2023. The Coagulation and Beyond: Position Paper from 4th MCCT Akbulut et al. 821 15,949 patients with CAD showed that in intermediate or poor metabolizers, ticagrelor/prasugrel reduced thrombotic risk as compared with clopidogrel, but in extensive metab-olizers there was no difference in thrombotic risk whether patients were treated with ticagrelor/prasugrel or clopidog- rel. 178,179Therefore, the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Imple- mentation Consortium recommends to avoid clopidogrel in intermediate poor metabolizers and use prasugrel orticagrelor 178(Table 1 ). Nevertheless, genotype-guided an- tiplatelet therapy is not yet standard care in patients with CAD, although genotype-guided de-escalation of P2Y12 in-hibition has a class IIb guideline recommendation and can be considered for ACS patients deemed unsuitable for potent platelet inhibition, i.e., with a high bleeding risk. 181 Based on the above-presented evidence, some centers have implemented a genotype-guided strategy for P2Y12 inhibition.182Their results are in line with previous meta- analyses and thus promising. Most evidence for genotype-guided antiplatelet treat- ment was obtained in patients with CAD. Nevertheless, othervascular patients sharing the same pathophysiology may also bene t from genotyping. A meta-analysis in patients with IS or TIA demonstrated that intermediate and poormetabolizers of clopidogrel have a higher risk of recurrent stroke. 183These results are supported by the RCT CHANCE-2, demonstrating in 6,412 patients with acute IS or TIA, whowere intermediate or poor metabolizers of clopidogrel, that ticagrelor reduced thrombotic risk as compared with clopidogrel. 184Clinical Rationale for Antagonizing Antithrombotic Agents in Bleeding Patients Novel Reversal Agents Although the DOACs have considerably improved anticoagu- lant treatment, the risk of bleeding is still present. Impor- tantly, all bleeds are multifactorial in nature depending on an interaction of modi able and nonmodi able risk fac- tors.185,186Furthermore, ethnic differences may play a role, as recently discussed for Asian populations and antithrom- botic medication.187This implies that the presence of an anticoagulant, whether a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) or a DOAC, is merely a contributing factor, rather than a causal one. Rapid reversal of the anticoagulant effect of DOACs may therefore be required in the case of life-threatening bleeding, emergency surgery, or severe trauma. Prothrombin complexconcentrates (PCCs) and recombinant FVIIa (rFVIIa) have the ability to overcome the anticoagulant effects of DOACs. More recently, speci c reversal agents have been developed that act as a decoy and scavenge the thrombin and FXa inhibitors.

The Coagulation and Beyond: Position Paper from 4th MCCT Akbulut et al. 822 alfa have to bind to their target, they have to be in excess of the circulating anticoagulant and consequently large quan- tities have to be administered, which is one of the reasonsthat their use is associated with high costs. Also, these agents are speci c for their target and knowledge about DOAC intake has to be available before reversal can be initiated.The search for novel reversal agents for anticoagulant drugs is therefore continuing. Table 2 summarizes the available reversal agents and several novel reversal agents that are currently under devel- opment. Scavenging proteins such as anti-FXa anticoagulants),191interact with the small- molecule anticoagulants and have been shown to be effective in vitro and in animal models. Alternatively, several hemo- stasis-enhancing proteins have been identi ed, character- ized, and tested in vitro and in vivo. Examples for this approach are modi ed FX(a) molecules, such as FXa-I16L, FX-C and FX-Phe174, so-called superFVa.FXa-I16L is a FXa that is zymogen-like and therefore resistant to active-site inhibitors.192Its activity is restored after binding to FVa and is thereby more potent thandecoy FX molecules. Because of its potent hemostatic-en- hancing effect, it not only counteracts FXa inhibitors, but also thrombin inhibitors. This variant has been tested in a phase 1clinical trial, appeared safe and well-tolerated, 193and procoagulant effect. FX-C is a chimera of human FX with an inserted 99 loop of snake FX from Pseudonaja textilis .194This makes the mole- cule insensitive to FXa DOACs. Functionality has been proven in vitro and in vivo, and the molecule is currently undergoing phase 1 testing (source: VarmX Web site). SuperFVa is an aPC-resistant FVa variant with three mutations: Arg306/506/679Gln.195In addition, a disul de bond has been inserted between the A2 and A3 domains to enhance stability. SuperFVa improved thrombin generation in plasma and reversedbleeding by both FXa and thrombin inhibitors in mice. 196 Apart from protein approaches, there are currently two small molecules in development as reversal agents.Table 1 Overview of the different CYP2C19 phenotypes with the coherent CYP2C19 diplotypes and the antiplatelet therapy recommendations when considering clopidogrel for cardiovascular indications diplotypesResponse to increased antiplatelet response to clopidogrelIf considering clopidogrel, use at standard dose Rapid metabolizer (RM)/C31//C317 Normal or increased antiplatelet response to clopidogrelIf considering clopidogrel, use at standard dose Extensive metabolizer (EM)/C31//C31 Normal antiplatelet response to clopidogrelIf considering nocontraindication Poor metabolizer (PM) /C32//C32,/C32//C33o r/C33//C33S i g response toclopidogrelAvoid clopidogrel.

The agents are categorized in reversal of dabigatran (anti-IIa), anti-Xa anticoagulants or with universal action. Furthermore, the agents were divided in proteins or small molecules and by mechanism of action (decoy or Coagulation and Beyond: 4th MCCT Akbulut al. 823 Ciraparantag, a small molecule that speci cally binds to the DOACs and heparin, acts rapidly and reduces bleeding in-duced by these anticoagulants in animals. 197In humans, it is well tolerated.198Major disadvantage of the (clinical) use of ciraparantag is that it can only be monitored with a wholeblood clotting time, since it binds to citrate in collection tubes and to clotting reagents that are normally used in the coagulation laboratories. Another small molecule under development is OKL-1111. This is a cyclodextrin that does not initiate coagulation, but enhances thrombin formation in both the absence andpresence of anticoagulants. In bleeding models in animals, it could be demonstrated that reversal was obtained toward DOACs, low-molecular-weight heparin, VKAs and clopidog-rel (Meijers, unpublished observations) making it a truly universal reversal agent. Phase 1 studies are planned for 2023. Potential areas for future investigation: Determine which of the characteristics of the novel reversal agents (speci c or universal, small molecule or protein, decoy or nondecoy) will be leading in the choice for the best reversal agent. The next hurdle will be the demonstration of improved clinical outcome of novel reversal agents compared with PCC, idarucizumab, or andexanet alfa in patients present-ing with serious bleeding or requiring urgent intervention or surgery. Theme 4: Hemostasis in Extracorporeal Systems: The Value and Limitations of In Vitro Models Assessing Thrombosis and Hemostasis Ex Vivo Evaluation of the hemostatic process in preclinical as well as clinical settings becomes increasingly important in theassessment of the thrombotic or bleeding risk in patients. The routine hemostasis assays in the clinical diagnosticlaboratory are imperative for the screening and diagnosis of hemostatic abnormalities and for monitoring the effec- tiveness of antithrombotic therapies, especially in high-riskpatients. Although most widely used point-of-care assays like whole blood aggregometry and coagulation tests (pro- thrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time[aPTT]) can detect severe hemostatic defects and effects of pro- and antithrombotic drugs, these assays lack sensitivity and fail to measure the interdependency of i.e., platelet activation, clot formation 199-201(Table 3 ). In an effort to include as many components of the hemostaticsystem as possible, more robust and global assays were developed such as thrombin generation assays, viscoelastic assays and global assays, like thrombin generation and thromboelastometry, have demonstrated potential to improve the identi cation of patients on antith- rombotic drugs who are at risk of bleeding.204,205Still, clinical applicability of these global assays is dif cult due to (pre-)analytical variables, duration of test procedure, andinterpretation of test results. Micro fluidic flow devices have been used for decades mainly in research, enabling the simultaneous assessmentof platelet and coagulation activation under flow condi- tions. 206In addition, endothelialized models allow to study effects of endothelial barrier function and endothelial acti-vation on hemostatic processes, providing a more physiolog- ical approach to assess the risk of bleeding or thrombosis ex vivo ( Fig. 6 ).207,208This has improved patient diagnostics and our understanding of inherited or acquired hemostatic abnormalities tremendously. However, standardization of such assays and their (routine) use in clinical diagnostics Table 3 Overview of hemostatic parameters and the corresponding clinical tests Hemostatic time is \u00a9 2023. The Coagulation and Beyond: Position Paper from 4th MCCT Akbulut et al. 824 remains challenging, in spite of previous efforts from inter- national scienti c committees and the general consensus on the need for standardization.209Reasons for the lack of standardization include the complicated and time-consuming (pre) analytical handling of the (endothelialized) assays, along-side with high costs currently associated with available assays. Important aspects to enable translation of flow-based assays into clinical diagnostics or treatment monitoring include: The full automation in (pre)analytical handling. Easy-to-use software applications (development using articial intelligence-based algorithms, integration of bioinformatics). Fast, user-independent output. Cost-effectiveness. Manufacturability and implementation of quality control measures. Clinical validation of micro fluidic assays. Multicenter Studies \u2014Committees Applying global assays in multicenter studies will reveal the clinical value and applicability of (a combination of) these assays for risk prediction, diagnosis, and treatment. Thesemulticenter studies could accelerate the standardization of novel flow-based tests by providing access to large datasets and thereby allowing assessment of test variation betweencenters. In addition to achieving standardization at the level of manufacturing, sample preparation, data extraction, and analysis, such studies can de ne patient populations that benet from novel assays. In line with these goals, large multicenter studies come with swift recruitment of the appropriate patient population and adequate power. There-by, setting of reference ranges can be established relatively easy for the general population and speci c disease states. When implementing global assays, evaluation of the netclinical bene t will be an important aspect to support the coverage of health care costs by health insurance companies.Moreover, funding for such efforts could be provided and/or supported by pharmaceutical companies, as the developed and tested global assays can also be used to test potentialnovel antithrombotic, pro-hemostatic drugs and antidotes in earlier phases. Approval processes of novel tests come with inherent challenges, but these can be tackled by involvingexpert committees that participate in clarifying and stream- lining the process. Therefore, international scienti c com- mittees can initiate and oversee studies and publish results in standardized, internally validated ways (e.g., Scienti ca n d Standardization Committee of International Society ofThrombosis and Hemostasis) along with consensus state- ments so that petitioners for approval can follow a more efcient process. Potential areas for future investigation: To further develop global hemostasis assays that encom- pass all aspects of hemostasis and to bring these from aresearch setting toward a clinical setting. To standardize global hemostasis assays and their corre- sponding analyses for the screening and diagnosis ofhemostatic abnormalities. To de ne the optimal combinations of global and routine hemostasis tests for speci c clinical questions or settings. Extracorporeal Circuits and Hemostatic Challenges Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a form of temporary life support for patients with severe but poten- tially reversible lung and/or heart failure, unresponsive to optimal care. The ECMO ECMO) with an arti cial circuit and membrane, thereby taking over Fig. 6 Balancing system complexity with throughput to meaningfully addr ess biological and translational questions. With the development of progressively more physiologically relevant and complex in vitro models, there is a concurrent decrease in throughput which has signi cant implications for addressing biological questions. A key consideration will be maintaining scalability, both experimentally and in terms of cost, as improved 3D cultures, micro fluidic platforms, and bioprinted models are developed. Thrombosis and Haemostasis Vol. 123 No. 8/2023 \u00a9 2023. The Coagulation and Beyond: Position Paper from 4th MCCT Akbulut et al. 825 the circulatory and respiratory functions.210Thus, ECMO secures support while the health care team works on treatingthe underlying disease or until organs for transplant become available. Although ECMO represents a potentially lifesaving thera- py and its increase in clinical practice has mirrored a rapid expansion of research on this technology, it still retains intrinsic side effects and complications due to the arti cial materials required and its effects on the circulatory, endo- thelial, hematologic, in flammatory, and immune systems. Complications in patients receiving ECMO therapy are common and can be associated with worse outcomes. 211In particular, current rates of bleeding events are unacceptably high and reported to occur in approximately 30% ofpatients, 212with a 10% risk of major bleeding and 4 to 10% risk of intracranial hemorrhage.213,214Bleeding events independently impact patient prognosis, includingmortality. 215-217 Patients undergoing ECMO support are predisposed to bleeding through various mechanisms, and these can beclassi ed into patient, treatments, and circuit-related. Many factors that may place patients undergoing ECMO at higher risk of bleeding have been identi ed, 218including underlying critical conditions prompting ECMO initiation, comorbidities, multiorgan dysfunction, and the technology itself.218-220The contact between the patient 'sb l o o dw i t h the ECMO circuit and the SIRS lead to activation of the coagulation cascade, with effects on brinolysis, thrombin formation, and platelet function.218,221,222These changes to hemostatic balance result in the coexistence of both throm- botic and hemorrhagic risks, and the nal effects may be difcult to predict. Moreover, although anticoagulation remains a standard practice in patients undergoing ECMO,223,224thrombotic events have been identi ed in approximately 15% courses225and might compli- cate ECMO therapy with signi cant morbidity and mortality. Despite the increasing clinical experience and research data available, much is still unknown about best practices and risk minimization in patients receiving ECMO therapy. In addition, our current knowledge and understanding of whatpredisposes patients on extracorporeal circuits to bleeding or thrombosis are poor. Therefore, advancement in preven- tion and early recognition of hemostatic complications, bothhemorrhage and thrombosis, is essential to improve the management and outcomes of patients undergoing ECMO. A genetic predisposition to coagulation disorders in thesesettings, where blood and body are exposed to arti cial surfaces, is already well-known but still poorly investigated and might represent an additional target for future research. Unfortunately, there is a lack of consensus regarding the most suitable approach to best identify risk factors, espe- cially in very sick patients, and genetic screening, whileattractive, may not be proven fruitful. Truth be told, since both ECMO patients and ECMO technology imply the involvement of multiple variablesand biological pathways, our current clinical practice may suffer from a compartmentalized approach. Therefore, coop- eration between basic scientists and clinicians is very muchneeded to bridge the gap, tackle the challenges, and reply to the compelling questions that are still waiting to be an-swered. While historically the well-known strategy \"divide et impera \"has been used by empires to succeed in expanding their territories, the scienti c community should come together and share our knowledge and resources to thrive. Potential areas for future investigation: Current rates of bleeding in patients treated on extracor- poreal circuits are unacceptably high. Our current knowledge and understanding of what pre- disposes patients on extracorporeal circuits to bleeding or thrombosis are poor. Cooperation between basic scientists and clinicians is needed to bridge the gap to enable the dif cult questions that need to be answered regarding the use of extracor- poreal circuits. Lack of consensus on prioritizing those studies that would best identify risk factors, especially in patients who are very sick and with multiple biological pathways involved. Genetic screening, while attractive, may not be proven fruitful. Generating Novel Vascularized Organoids for Disease Modeling and Drug Development The advent of organoids, bioprinting, and organ-on-a-chip technologies has at long last offered viable alternatives tosimplistic in vitro models and nonhuman in vivo approaches. 226-228Species and tissue-speci c three-dimen- sional (3D) cultures which mimic the architectural, molecu-lar, and cellular complexity of human organs (to varying degrees) offer many of the bene ts of in vitro systems (scalability, manipulability, etc.). They have demon-strated remarkable utility in drug screening, the generation of patient-speci c and precision medicine models, and are allowing for unique insights into how cells interact with one another in complex 3D structures. 226 During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, organoid models dem- onstrated their utility in investigating poorly understood aspects of disease pathology. Our own work using microvas- cular organoid models demonstrated an important role ofpericyte-mediated viral uptake in the loss of vascular integ- rity contributing to thrombosis recently, a vascularized BM organoid was developed and validated which faithfully recapitulates key features of the myelopoietic central BM. It was demonstrated that this system allows for drug screening in the context ofmyelo brosis, but more importantly supports the engraft- ment of primary patient cells from several cancers which have been classically dif cult to study ex vivo (primary myelo brosis, multiple myeloma, acute lymphocytic leukemia). 230 With the promise of these approaches in mind, they are not without their limitations. Self-arranging organoids, par- ticularly those derived from human-induced pluripotent stem cells, remain relatively fetal in their development,and engineering more \"adult \"versions of these systems remains a key area of study and improvement. While \"or- gan-on-a-chip \"and bioprinting strategies offer the promise Thrombosis No. 8/2023 \u00a9 2023. The Coagulation and Beyond: Position 4th MCCT Akbulut et al. 826 of mimicking more adult tissue, they do so at the cost of the scalability and accessibility of these models. Moreover, costremains a signi cant factor in the generation of certain organoid systems. As the tissue engineering eld continues to grow and expand, a key consideration is interpreting data derived from these models. While most researchers would balk at the notion of completely replacing animal systems with 3Dhuman models, this is ultimately the end goal of many who are working in the eld. Key questions remain: how to reconcile con flicting hu- man and murine data? How to meaningfully interpret mechanistic information in a (still) arti cial system? These and other considerations are, and should be, part of the on-going dialogue between basic scientists, engineers, and clinicians about meaningfully exploiting what promise to be revolutionary approaches to how to model disease anddevelop therapies. Potential areas for future investigation: Organoids are an important advance that will enrich the drug discovery process, alongside the use of current assays/mouse models. Organoids could be used as part of an iterative approach, with simpler organoid models used in screening before moving on to more complex systems. Use of organoids to instruct choice of drug in personalized medicine approaches is challenging and currently un- proven, but with future developments could be feasibleand valuable. Theme 5: Clinical Dilemmas in Thrombosis and Antithrombotic Management New Insights into Inherited Thrombophilia The association between inherited thrombophilia and the occurrence of (recurrent) VTE has been demonstrated in the past focusing only on a few genetic defects including anti-thrombin (AT), protein C, protein S de ciencies and two polymorphisms, factor V Leiden (FVL) and prothrombin G20210A mutations. 231Surprisingly, the vast majority of information clinicians daily use for the management of thrombophilic patients is based on the results of previous studies only dealing with thrombophilia mechanisms dis-covered in the second half of the last century. In contrast, it is commonly seen that in a large number (almost 50%) of families symptomatic for thrombophilia, none of thesedefects can be identi ed. The logical consequence is that other still unknown inherited thrombophilia may exist. Recently, new genetic defects responsible for severe throm-bophilia have been identi ed, namely, pseudo-homozygosity for aPC resistance, the hyperfunctional FIX and FVIII, and the resistance to AT. 231 FVL is responsible for approximately 95% of cases of APC resistance. However, several point mutations in the F5 gene causing APC resistance have been identi ed in different populations.231Recently, severe thrombophilia in a Ala2086Asp been that affects pathways more strongly than the prothrombinase activity of FVa.232It can also occur that heterozygous FVL carriers present with a concomitant heterozygous F5 gene mutation responsible for FV de ciency, resulting in the 50% of FV plasma levels being all FVL. In these pseudo-homo-zygotes the thrombotic risk is as high as that observed in homozygous individuals. 233 Factor IX Padua is a gain-of-function mutation in the F9 gene (R338L) discovered in 2009 detected in a family symp- tomatic for VTE and exhibiting extremely high plasma factor IX activity (eight times the normal) with concomitant nor-mal antigen levels. 234Very recently, another hyper-function- al FIX variant (R338Q, Factor IX Shanghai) was identi ed in a 13-year old boy referred for recurrent deep vein thrombosis(DVT). 235In 2021 the rst thrombophilic defect in the F8 gene (FVIII Padua) associated with markedly elevated FVIII levels and severe thrombophilia was described in two Italianfamilies. 236Genetic analysis revealed a 23.4-kb tandem duplication of the proximal portion of the F8 gene (promoter, exon 1, and a large part of intron 1), which co-segregatedwith high FVIII levels in the family. Finally, in 2012 a novel gain-of-function polymorphism leading to resistance to AT has been identi ed. 237The molecular basis is a missense mutation of the prothrombin Arg596 residue (exon 14) resulting in impaired thrombin -AT binding and defective inhibition of the mutated thrombin by AT. Other similarcases were subsequently described in Serbia, India, and Italy. The symptomatic ve families show three different muta- tions of the these hereditary thrombophilias are rare, clini- cians ought to keep in mind these novel mutations when dealing with patients or families with unexplained history of recurrent VTE. Nonetheless, the large number of newly discovered inherited defects in the last decades seems to justify why one should not abandon testing for thrombo-philia patients belonging to families with VTE. In fact, previous epidemiological studies and recommen- dations are based on limited knowledge of inherited throm-bophilic conditions. Advanced diagnostic tools including NGS are now adding important information on the etiology of thrombosis. Thus, new clinical studies are needed to re-dene the role of inherited thrombophilia in the manage- ment of patients with thrombosis. Managing Atrial Fibrillation in Hemophilia In the community of patients with hemophilia (PWH), cardiovascular disease is an emerging medical issue as thelifespan of these individuals continues to approach that of the general population. 241A speci c topic concerns patients with AF, where anticoagulants are widely used for theprevention of IS and systemic embolism. The overall prevalence of AF in PWH in Europe is 0.84% and increases to 3.4% in patients >60 years and is therefore not different from that in the general population. 242In a patient with a congenital bleeding disorder such as hemo- philia, the decision to start antithrombotic therapy is even Thrombosis and Haemostasis Vol. 123 No. 8/2023 \u00a9 2023. The Coagulation and Beyond: Position Paper from 4th MCCT Akbulut et al. 827 more challenging as the balance between thrombosis and hemorrhage is quite delicate. In PWH with AF, there are many uncertainties to deal with by clinicians in clinical-decision making. First, the minimum clotting level to be able to start anticoagulation therapy isunknown. Several experts and consensus statements suggest that a minimum factor VIII/IX level of 20 to 30 IU/dL is needed for oral anticoagulation 241-245and this is somewhat conrmed by a clinical registry.246On the other hand, PWH with factor levels <20 IU/dL might be considered naturally anticoagulated, as depicted by lower endogenous thrombinpotential levels. 247 In the general population with AF, a risk score, such as the CHA 2DS2-VASc score, is used to identify patients at risk for IS and therefore in need for anticoagulation therapy. In addi- tion, the HAS-BLED score has been used to predict bleeding events on oral anticoagulation therapy. Balancing these twoscores helps the clinician to decide whether the downside of oral anticoagulation outweighs the prevention of thrombotic events. However, in PWH these scores have not been andprobably never will be prospectively validated due to the low number of adverse events in this speci c population. There- fore, due to lack of evidence, treatment of PWH with AFshould always be individualized taking into account the bleeding and thrombotic risk. As a general thought, PWHs with factor levels <20 IU/dL probably do not need additional antithrombotic therapy. In patients with mild hemophilia (>20 IU/dL), oral anticoagulation therapy is probably feasi- ble. In that case, a DOAC has the preference over VKAs due totheir favorable safety pro le. 248 There is a strong need for more clinical data on anti- coagulation therapy in PWH. Ideally, a registry is started todocument the ef cacy and safety of different types of antithrombotic treatment in PWH. However, due to the low event rates this will be a dif cult task. Furthermore, there is a need for clinical validation of global hemostatic assays or thrombin generation tests to adapt individualizedtreatments. Especially, with the rapid adaptation of nonfac- tor replacement therapies (i.e., emicizumab), our long-last- ing experience with factor levels will be challenged and theneed for these hemostatic tests will be increasing. The Elusive Safe Antiplatelet Agent Platelets are activated by two major groups of receptors, G protein-coupled receptors, which are the targets for current antiplatelet drugs, and tyrosine kinase-linked receptors,which are targets for a new class of antiplatelet agents. All of the current antiplatelet drugs increase the risk of bleeding and this can give rise to nuisance bleeds that may in fluence compliance and, in a minority of patients, life-threatening bleeds. Furthermore, over 50% of patients on antiplatelet medication experience further thrombotic episodes. Thus,there is an urgent need for drugs with improved ef cacy that spare hemostasis. The last major, widely prescribed new class of antiplatelet drugs introduced into the clinic was that of the P2Y 12 receptor antagonists over 20 years ago, with the thienopyr-idine, clopidogrel, being the rst in class. Several other P2Y 12receptor antagonists have since been introduced of which ticagrelor is the most notable because of its reversible actionand greater ef cacy. This offers an advantage over the irreversible thienopyridines but at the risk of increased bleeding. A PAR1 thrombin receptor antagonist, vorapaxar,has also been introduced but has not been widely described due to the increase in risk of bleeding. The major tyrosine kinase-linked receptors in terms of signal strength are those with a motif in their cytosolic tail known as an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM). platelets express three ITAM receptors,CLEC-2, GPVI and Fc Syk, and Btk tyrosine kinases. However, within this group, only the collagen and brin(ogen) receptor GPVI has been shown to play a role in hemostasis, although the importance of this appears to have been overestimated. This is shown by clinical data on patients in Chile with an insertion mutationthat introduces a stop codon prior to the transmembrane sequence of GPVI and thus prevents surface expression. It is estimated that over 4,000 individuals are homozygous forloss of GPVI in Chile and yet only 12 cases from 11 unrelated families have been found. 249The majority of these have a mild bleeding diathesis which in some cases hasdiminished/disappeared on reaching adulthood. Further- more, only two patients with an inherited de ciency in GPVI have been reported outside of Chile. Given that collagenis a standard agonist in the clinic for the study of patients with a suspected platelet disorder, these data suggest that loss of GPVI does not give rise to a major bleeding diathesis. This conclusion is also supported by a phase I safety trial on a GPVI-blocking Fab, now known as glenzocimab. 250A press release in February 2022 on a Phase Ib and IIa trial onglenzocimab reported a tendency to a reduction in bleeding and improvement in cognitive symptoms in patients with acute IS when given in combination with standard treatment (thrombolysis or thrombectomy). This study was powered for safety rather than ef cacy but the observation of an encouraging therapeutic effect provides a basis for a phase III trial and reinforces GPVI as a target for a new class of antiplatelet drugs. This safe targeting of GPVI in terms of bleeding is further supported by clinical data on the use of Btk and Syk kinase inhibitors in the treatment of B cell malignancies and im-mune thrombocytopenia (ITP). In both cases, the bleeding symptoms reduce over time showing that ITAM-based sig- naling pathways can be safely targeted (in terms of bleeding)with kinase inhibitors even when the starting platelet count Inhibitors of Src, Syk, and Btk tyrosine kinases have been introduced into the clinic for treatment ofthese disorders and have been shown to be well tolerated for up to several years. Moreover, these inhibitors target activa- tion of platelets by all their ITAM receptors. The ation inhibitor of the Tec family kinase Btk, ibrutinib, was shown to cause excessive bleeding raising concerns about its use as an antiplatelet drug, but this is now recognized to bedue to one or more off-target effects, most likely on other kinases. The second- and third-generation inhibitors of Coagulation and Beyond: Position Paper from 4th MCCT Akbulut et al. 828 have been shown to be well tolerated in patients, with bleeding symptoms reducing over time as patients respondto treatment. This is particularly notable for fostamatinib which is used in patients with refractory ITP and who therefore have a low platelet count. 251 The C-type lectin-like receptor CLEC-2 appears to have little or no role in hemostasis in humans and an uncertain role in arterial thrombosis. In contrast, CLEC-2 has beenshown to drive thrombosis at sites of in flammation in the venous system in mouse thrombo-in flammatory models, namely DVT and bacterial infection. 252Platelet activation in these models is mediated by in flammation-driven up- regulation of the ligand for CLEC-2 in the vessel wall podo- planin. Patients treated with ibrutinib show a reduction inDVT suggesting that CLEC-2 may also drive thrombosis in thrombo-in flammatory disease in humans. 253 The low af nity immune receptor Fc RIIA is the only Fc receptor on platelets and has no known role in hemostasis. Activation of Fc RIIA underlies heparin-induced thrombo- is associated with a marked reductionin platelet count and in some patients life-threatening thrombosis. The molecular basis of this disorder is the formation of antibodies that bind to the positively chargedchemokine PF4 which form s an immu ne complex with the negatively charged heparin. A related, but much rarer condi- tion, with less than 50 cases world-wide, autoimmune HIT, isalso mediated by anti-PF4 antibodies but is independent of heparin. In February 2021, the rst cases of a new syndrome, now known as vaccine-induced immune thrombocytopeniaand thrombosis (VITT), were identi ed in patients who had received a rst dose of the Oxford-AZ adenovirus vaccine to SARS-COV-2 in the previous 5 to 20 days. The frequency ofVITT is extremely low, in the order of 1:50,000 to 100,000. VITT is also mediated by antibodies to platelet factor 4 (PF4), with the binding of PF4 to the adenovirus vector driving antibody production. 254Platelet activation by sera from patients with VITT can be prevented by treatment with aSrc, Syk, or Btk inhibitor, although the low frequency of the syndrome, cost of the kinase inhibitors, and potential side- effects prevent this being translated to a clinical trial. 255 In summary, platelet tyrosine kinase-linked receptors, no- tably glycoprotein VI (GPVI), represent targets for a new class of antiplatelet drugs that may be more powerful againstarterial thrombotic disorders such as ACSs and IS than current drugs with a reduce risk of bleeding. In addition, they are targets in both thrombo-in flammatory disorders and immune complex-driven thrombosis, two groups which are not cur- rently treated with antiplatelets. Receptor blockade can be achieved using protein-based inhibitors such as the GPVI Fabglenzocimab or have not been identi ed. The kinase inhibitors have the advantage of being orally available and blocking activation by all three ITAM receptors but with the concern of off-target effects on myeloid cells and lymphocytesleading to an increase in susceptibility to infection. The irreversible nature of the second- and third-generation Tec family kinase inhibitors such as rilzabrutinib may enable themto be used at a much lower concentration thus reducing off- target effects. 256 Will FXIa Inhibition Ful ll a Promise? FXI De ciency (Hemophilia C or Rosenthal Disease) In 1953 Rosenthal et al described this autosomal disorder in a family with bleeding events during surgery or dental proce-dures. The prevalence of severe FXI de ciency is about /C251/ million, and more frequent in certain populations. Clinically, the prolongation of the aPTT may lead to the diagnosis, ratherthan bleeding complications, which are generally mild, even in severe de ciency. Bleeding may be provoked by surgery, particularly in tissues with high brinolytic activity like urogenital or oropharyngeal, but may also include epistaxis, heavy menstrual bleeding, or postinjury, while unprovoked bleeding into muscle or soft tissue or hemarthrosis is notfrequent. Bleeding may also occur in heterozygous subjects with mild de ciency (20 -60%) and does not correlate with FXI level. Bleeding can be corrected by FXI (blood product or recombinant clotting factor). Pronounced FXI de ciency lowers risk for IS and venous thrombosis. FXI(a) Inhibition FXI(a) is therefore an interesting target for antithrombotictherapy as upstream inhibition of the intrinsic cascade may be effective, yet potentially safer with regard to bleeding as FXI-de cient patients rarely have spontaneous bleeding, suggesting that FXI may have a limited role in hemostasis. FXI /C0//C0mice have normal tail bleeding times but show decreased clot formation at injury sites of arterial or ve-nous. 257Likewise, treatment of rodent oligonucleotides (FXI-ASO) or anti-FXI anti- bodies has shown resistance to experimentally induced thrombosis and a low risk of bleeding complications.258,259 Different strategies targeting FXI/FXIa for antithrombotic therapy are under development in clinical trials. Novel FXI inhibitor agents include inhibitors of biosynthesis, antibod- ies, and small molecules ( Table 4 ). The Clinical Trials of Targeting FXI Four FXI(a) inhibitors have been tested in patients undergo- ing total knee arthroplasty (TKA). FXI ASO IONIS-FXIRX that inhibits FXI biosynthesis in liver and abelacimab (MAA868) that inhibits FXI by binding the catalytic domain of both FXI(zymogen) and FXIa were compared with enoxaparin (40 mg) for prevention of VTE in TKA patients. In the FXI ASO trial, the study showed that the higher dose (300 mg)regimen (4%) was superior to enoxaparin (30%) for the prevention of VTE and had a lower rate of bleeding events than with enoxaparin. 260Similar to the FXI ASO result, the trial of abelacimab showed that the incidence of VTE in the 30 mg abelacimab regimen was noninferior to enoxaparin, and the 75 monoclonal antibody that can inhibit FXIa, was tested in 813 adult TKA patients (FOXTROT). Thrombosis and Haemostasis Vol. 123 No. 8/2023 \u00a9 2023. Coagulation and Beyond: 4th MCCT Akbulut et al. 829 Osocimab (0.6, 1.2, and 1.8 mg/kg) was compared with enoxaparin and apixaban for thromboprophylaxis, and was noninferior with respect to ef cacy, while it caused less bleeding.262Likewise, milvexian, a small molecule that inhibits FXIa activity, was effective for the prevention of VTE and was associated with a low risk of bleeding when compared with enoxaparin at ve different dosing regimens . Hence, these trials demonstrated that FXI contributes to postoperative VTE and that lowering FXI levels or inhibiting its activity provides an effective and possibly safe method forits prevention. For the patient with AF, abelacimab (120 mg, 180 mg) (NCT04213807) and the small molecule asundexian (BAY2433334) (PACIFIC-AF, NCT04218266) are compared with placebo or apixaban. The rst phase 2b trial data of PACIFIC-AF have been already published. Compared withapixaban in patients with AF at risk of stroke, the bleeding rate for the primary endpoint (ISTH major and clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding) was reduced by 67% in patients receiving asundexian. 49,263However, PACIFIC-AF was not powered to test differences in rates of thromboticevents between groups. There are another two different phase II clinical trials in which asundexian was tested: PACIFIC AMI and PACIFIC Stroke, which were both recentlypublished. In patients with ACS (NSTEMI and STEMI), asundexian on top of DAPT in dose-dependent, near-complete inhibition ofFXIa activity without a signi cant increase in bleeding and a low rate of ischemic events when compared with DAPT alone. 264In patients with noncardioembolic IS, asundex- ian on top of single antiplatelet therapy did not increase the risk of major bleeding, but did also not reduce the composite of covert brain infarction or IS.265In the Axi- omatic trial, the safety of milvexian, another direct FXIa inhibitor, was tested in noncardioembolic stroke com- pared with placebo. Similarly, this trial did not showsignicantly increased bleeding compared with placebo, without having the power to assess ef cacy. Taken togeth- er, these ndings warrant further investigation in phase III clinical trials. The OCEANIC AF (NCT02168829) is the rst of its kind to test ef cacy of asundexian as compared with apixaban of FXI De ciency and FXI Inhibition For the clinical use of FXI inhibitors \u2014not only those with the long half-life \u2014the management of bleeding or peri-proce- dural management is crucial. Bleeding management in patients with FXI de ciency includes fresh frozen plasma, FXI concentrates (half-life 50 -70 hours), which may be ad- ministered every 48 to 72 hours, also low-dose rFVIla (e.g., lower doses of rFVlla [15 -20 \u00b5g/kg]), and anti brinolytic agents, such as tranexamic acid. Antithrombotic agents, suchas anticoagulants and antiplatelet medications, should gen- erally be avoided. Reversal studies of FXI inhibitors are being performed in healthy volunteers using PCC and rFVIla, and fully human antibody Fab fragments with very high af nity for FXIa inhibitors are being explored for their potential to neutralizetheir anticoagulant effects. Outlook for FXI FXI inhibition with separat-ing thrombosis from bleeding is very promising and sup-ported by the clinical presentation of FXI de ciency patients and animal models. In addition, FXI inhibition also links to inflammatory pathways and with the contact pathway may also be an effective antithrombotic treatment for foreign surfaces. However, the benchmark of today 's anticoagulant treat- ment achieved with DOACs is not easily surpassed. Therefore, identifying the important medical needs, selecting the ap- propriate indications, and choosing the optimal trial designwill determine the future success of FXI inhibition. Potential other areas of interest are patients with cancer and throm- bosis and patients with severe renal insuf ciency or other factors that are associated with high risks for bleeding (and thrombosis). How to Prevent Thrombosis in the Next Corona Pandemic; Lessons Learned COVID-19 brought the clinical and research world into widespread recognition of the problem of coagulopathy in infections.

The Coagulation and Beyond: Position Paper from 4th MCCT Akbulut et al. 830 the publication of a flurry of guidelines focused on the antithrombotic management of these patients.266Soon after, the research world started turning their attention to the mechanisms of thrombosis in COVID-19 and how the differ- ent pathways may be involved in the thrombotic complica-tion. 267In the Maastricht discussion, several clinical pointers were presented to assist in future management of hemostat- ic and thrombotic complications associated with infections.In COVID-19, the preponderance of thrombosis is in the pulmonary circulation. 268This should ideally be termed as pulmonary thrombosis rather than pulmonary emboli. Therationale for this consideration is the activation of localized bronchoalveolar coagulation by the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the hosts 'immune system (widely k nown as immunothrom- bosis) in the causation of these clots. These are different to the emboli from lower limbs or other parts of the circulatory beds, which are commonly recognized as pulmonary emboli.The presence of localized coagulation systems may occur in the gastrointestinal tract and possibly the integumental barrier or at sites where pathogen entry is likely. Movingon to the laboratory aspects, D- dimer elevation is a charac- teristic aspect of COVID-19. 269This is predominantly due to alveolar brinolysis rather than clot breakdown and hence correlated with prognosis in these patients rather than with thrombotic risks. A useful future study would be to look at how extravascular brinolysis may correlate with disease outcomes in different pathological states. Severe thrombo- cytopenia is rare in COVID-19 although mild to moderate drop in platelet counts can be common.270There are also reports of markedly elevated vWF levels in these patients too, which in some reports were correlating strongly with poor outcomes. Can these two be linked? Possibly, the thrombo-cytopenia is caused by the release of large amounts of vWF from endothelial activation which means a decrease of platelet counts can be suggestive of microthrombus forma- tion. This leads to under-recognition of microvascular thrombi from a clinical point of view. In the absence of otherclear explanations, a drop in the platelet counts or brinogen levels in the setting of sepsis or in flammatory states may mean formation of microthrombi and the need for interven-tion to limit this process. But the timing of intervention is important too. Coagulation systems including platelets and brinogen are anti-infective and as such are commonly activated in different infections. There is a ne line between these bene cial effects of the host 's hemostatic system turning to the harmful state of micro- and macrovascularthrombosis. The ideal time for intervention is that period when the shift to harm from a bene cial period occurs. 271 Monitoring trends in the common tests may be the way forward in this regard but future research should also focus on the different pathways and the correct timing for inter- vention targeting the coagulation system in infections. Areas of potential research with the lessons learnt from the corona pandemic include: (1) the importance of differ- entiating localized thrombosis from systemic coagulationactivation and how we can target site-speci c thrombosis and thus minimize bleeding from systemic antithrombotic therapy; (2) examination of how extravascular brinolysismay correlate with disease outcomes in different pathologi- cal states; (3) how the trends in laboratory markers mayguide treatment decisions to escalate or withdraw antith- rombotic agents, and (4) what may be the best time and pathways to target the activated platelets and coagulationsystem for host bene t. TICARDIO from vascular and blood cell activa- tion, are now recognized as new protagonists in cellularcrosstalk involved in thrombo-in flammation. Initially described as catalytic surfaces able to activate TF- dependent procoagulant pathways, leukocyte-derivedmicrovesicles (LMVs) were more recently ascribed a brino- lytic activity. 272,273Using rst whole blood stimulated with LPS (LPS-MV) to mimic in flammatory conditions, granulo- cyte MVs were found to lyse a thrombus in vitro, according to their plasmin generation capacity (MV-PGC), in a uPA/uPAR- dependent manner.274Second, de ning MV coagulolytic balance (MV-CLB) as the ratio between MV procoagulant andbrinolytic activity, the impact of MV with distinct CLB prole was investigated on the dynamics of thrombus for- mation in vivo, using a laser injury model mice arterial thrombosis intravital microscopy. Interestingly, plas- minogen accumulation initiation in mice receiving brinolytic EV-BCL compared with procoagulant EV-CLB pro le. Accumulated knowledge on the role of LMV has not only revisited their role as ambivalent catalytic surfaces able to tune a coagulolytic balance275-277but have also driven technological advances, resulting in the development ofsensitive and speci c assays allowing the plasmin activity. 278-280 According on new pathways and targets involving LMV in immuno-thrombotic responses andtheir translation into novel diagnostic and therapeutic strat- egies, sepsis-induced coagulopathy was chosen as a typical thrombo-in clinical situation associating coagu- lation activation and abnormal brinolysis. While converg- ing animal and clinical studies emphasized the deleterious role of procoagulant MV in sepsis and septic shock, thehypothesis was that MVs have a protective effect supported by their capacity to lyse a thrombus. Granulocyte MVs from sepsis patients were found to display a heterogeneous pat-tern of PGC, driven by uPA-uPAR expression, and were able to lyse a thrombus according to their MV-PGC level. Injection of granulocyte MV with a high PGC level reduced clot formationand improved survival in a mouse model of septic shock, demonstrating a protective effect of these granulocytic sub- populations, 274opening perspectives for a potential antith- rombotic strategy. In a cohort of 225 patients with septic shock enrolled in a multicenter prospective study, the MV- CLB predicted mortality in septic shock patients with betterperformances than the procoagulant and pro brinolytic activities taken individually, and allowed stratifying the severity of septic shock. This new functional signature Thrombosis and Haemostasis Vol. 123 No. 8/2023 \u00a9 2023. The Coagulation and Beyond: Position Paper from 4th MCCT Akbulut et al. 831 of MV opens unexplored avenues for the guidance of indi- vidualized therapy targeting coagulopathy in septic shock. Data presented in the SEPSIS context illustrate the view of granulocyte MV-CLB as an ambivalent microsystem tuning thrombo-in flammation. Potential areas for future investigation: From one side, a deeper understanding of what deter- mines the MV-CLB, including the role of the distinct triggers and subsets of MV and the impact of pharmaco- logical modulations, is required. From another side, the de nition of the true value of MVas biomarkers of thrombotic risk, through multicenter pro- spective clinical studies thanks to methodological inno-vation and standardization, to measure MV in a more automatized way and integrate them into scoring systems with other biomarkers and clinical variables. These per-spectives are included in ongoing research programs. 125 Conflict of Interest None declared.
