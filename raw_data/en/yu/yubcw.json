DESCRIPTION: UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND UPPER CHESAPEAKE HEALTH (UMUCH) HAVE PRIORITIZED THE FOLLOWING HEALTH CONCERNS IN ORDER OF IMPORTANCE: BEHAVIORAL HEALTH, PREVENTION AND WELLNESS, AND FAMILY STABILITY AND WELLNESS. KEY FINDINGS REGARDING THE PRIORITIZATION OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH, PREVENTION AND WELLNESS, AND FAMILY STABILITY AND WELLNESS BEHAVIORAL HEALTH (MENTAL HEALTH/ADDICTIONS): THE SUICIDE RATE OF A COMMUNITY IS CONSIDERED TO BE A KEY INDICATOR OF ITS MENTAL HEALTH STATUS. HARFORD COUNTY'S RATE OF 12.3 PER 100,000 POPULATION FAR EXCEEDS THE 9.2 RATE FOR THE STATE OF MARYLAND. ACCORDING TO THE MARYLAND BEHAVIORAL RISK FACTOR SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM (BRFSS) FOR 2013-2015, 21% OF HARFORD COUNTY RESIDENTS HAVE BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH DEPRESSIVE DISORDER, COMPARED TO 16.1% FOR THE STATE. IN ADDITION, 18.2% OF HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS REPORTED THAT THEY HAVE SERIOUSLY CONSIDERED ATTEMPTING SUICIDE. WHILE APPROXIMATELY 96% OF HARFORD COUNTY RESIDENTS ARE INSURED, THERE IS A NOTABLE LACK OF MENTAL HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS TO MEET COMMUNITY NEEDS. AS SUCH, THE HEALTH RESOURCES AND SERVICE ADMINISTRATION HAS DESIGNATED ALL OF HARFORD COUNTY AS A HEALTH PROFESSIONAL SHORTAGE AREA (HPSA) FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. SINCE 2007, THE NUMBER OF DRUG AND ALCOHOL RELATED INTOXICATION DEATHS HAS MORE THAN DOUBLED IN BOTH MARYLAND AND HARFORD COUNTY. THE NUMBERS OF DRUG RELATED LAW ENFORCEMENT INCIDENTS AND OVERDOSE CALLS HAVE ALSO INCREASED DRAMATICALLY SINCE 2011, BY 57% AND 95% RESPECTIVELY. ANOTHER INDICATOR OF THE SEVERITY OF THE ADDICTION PROBLEM IN HARFORD COUNTY IS THE NUMBER OF SUBSTANCE EXPOSED NEWBORNS (SEN) BORN IN THE COMMUNITY. BETWEEN 2000 AND 2016, HARFORD COUNTY HAS EXPERIENCED AN EIGHT-FOLD INCREASE IN THE RATE OF HOSPITAL ENCOUNTERS FOR NEWBORNS WITH MATERNAL DRUG/ALCOHOL EXPOSURE. THIS NOT ONLY INDICATES AN INCREASE IN SUBSTANCE ABUSE, BUT ALSO A LACK OF TREATMENT ACCESS. IN RESPONSE TO BEHAVIORAL HEALTH, THE FOLLOWING ACTIONS ARE BEING TAKEN: *OPEN OUTPATIENT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CLINIC *OPEN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH URGENT CARE CENTER *OPEN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CRISIS RESIDENTIAL BEDS *WELLNESS ACTION TEAMS OF CECIL AND HARFORD COUNTY (WATCH PROGRAM) TO SCREEN PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ISSUES AND MAKE APPROPRIATE REFERRALS. *DEVELOP CLINICAL PATHWAYS FOR PATIENTS ENTERING CRISIS CENTER *PROVIDE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SUPPORT GROUPS AND CHRONIC PAIN SELF-MANAGEMENT CLASSES *PROVIDE EDUCATION TO INTERNAL TEAM AND ASHLEY ADDICTION TREATMENT ON LATERAL VIOLENCE (ABUSE IN WORKPLACE BY ONE EMPLOYEE TO ANOTHER, IT INCLUDES BOTH OVERT AND COVERT ACTS OF VERBAL AND NON-VERBAL AGGRESSION). *PROVIDE EDUCATION ON CO-OCCURRING BEHAVIORAL HEALTH/SUBSTANCE ABUSE ISSUES AND TRAUMA INFORMED CARE. *PROVIDE EDUCATIONAL CLASSES SPECIFIC TO BEHAVIORAL HEALTH: MENTAL HEALTH FIRST AID, QUESTION, PERSUADE, REFER (QPR) *WORK WITH THE HARFORD COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE TO PROVIDE CRISIS MANAGEMENT ASSISTANCE AS PART OF THEIR CRISIS INTERVENTION AND CRISIS NEGOTIATION TEAMS. *PARTICIPATE ON THE SUBSTANCE EXPOSED NEWBORN (SEN) TASKFORCE TO DEVELOP POLICIES AND IMPLEMENTATION PLANS TO LINK PREGNANT WOMEN WITH SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TO TREATMENT. *PROVIDE DEPRESSION SCREENINGS (PHQ-9) AT CERTAIN HEALTH EVENTS. PREVENTION AND WELLNESS: AS A WHOLE, HARFORD COUNTY RESIDENTS HAVE ACCESS TO A BETTER FOOD ENVIRONMENT AND GREATER ACCESS TO EXERCISE OPPORTUNITIES WHEN COMPARED TO THE STATE AND THE NATION. DESPITE GREATER OPPORTUNITIES TO ENGAGE IN HEALTHY BEHAVIORS REGARDING NUTRITION AND EXERCISE, HARFORD COUNTY ADULTS ARE JUST AS LIKELY OR MORE LIKELY TO BE OBESE OR OVERWEIGHT (72.4%) AND PHYSICALLY INACTIVE (26.3%) AS THE REST OF THE STATE. IN ADDITION, TOBACCO USE IS HIGH AMONG BOTH ADULTS (20.7%) AND YOUTH (16.9%) WHICH CORRELATES WITH HIGH RATES OF CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD) AND LUNG CANCER. EVEN MORE CONCERNING IS THE HIGH RATE OF STUDENTS REPORTING THEY CURRENTLY USE ELECTRONIC VAPOR PRODUCTS (24.6%), AND THE TOTAL PERCENTAGE OF STUDENTS (32.1%) USING ANY TYPE OF TOBACCO PRODUCT (BURNED, SMOKELESS, OR ELECTRONIC). OBESITY, INSUFFICIENT PHYSICAL EXERCISE, AND TOBACCO USE ARE SOME OF THE BIGGEST DRIVERS OF PREVENTABLE CHRONIC DISEASES AND INCREASED RISK FOR MANY HEALTH CONDITIONS. OBESITY, OFTEN A SYMPTOM OF DIET AND EXERCISE, CAN HAVE A TREMENDOUS IMPACT ON HEALTH AND WELLBEING. BLACK ADULTS WERE ALMOST TWICE AS LIKELY TO BE OBESE THAN WHITE ADULTS, AND ADULTS WITHOUT A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA WERE ALMOST TWICE AS LIKELY TO BE OBESE THAN THEIR COLLEGE GRADUATE COUNTERPARTS. AS SUCH, MINORITY AND LOW INCOME FAMILIES ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY NEGATIVELY AFFECTED. THE TOP FIVE CAUSES OF DEATH IN HARFORD COUNTY ARE HEART DISEASE, CANCER, CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE, STROKE, AND ACCIDENTS, WHICH ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE STATE AND THE NATION. THE ROLE OF ACCIDENTS AS THE FIFTH LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH IS A RELATIVELY NEW PHENOMENON THAT COULD LIKELY BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE GROWING OPIOID EPIDEMIC AND ACCIDENTAL OVERDOSES, AS WELL AS AN AGING POPULATION. IN RESPONSE TO PREVENTION AND WELLNESS, THE FOLLOWING ACTIONS ARE BEING TAKEN: GENERAL: *COMPREHENSIVE CARE CENTER (CCC): TRANSITION NURSE NAVIGATION AND SOCIAL WORKER - TO ENSURE CONTINUITY OF CARE THROUGH EDUCATION, DISEASE MANAGEMENT, MEDICATION AND SYMPTOM REVIEW, AND COORDINATE CARE WITH APPROPRIATE COMMUNITY RESOURCES INCLUDING ARRANGEMENT OF TRANSPORTATION.

FAMILY STABILITY AND WELLNESS: WHILE THE MAJORITY OF BABIES IN HARFORD COUNTY ARE BORN INTO MARRIED FAMILIES (69.4%) TO MOTHERS OVER THE AGE OF 20 (96.5%), THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT ETHNIC AND RACIAL DISPARITIES. MOST CONCERNING IS THE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER NUMBER OF LOW BIRTH WEIGHT BABIES BORN TO BLACK WOMEN (12.1%) AS COMPARED TO WHITE (7.6%), AND THE 2.5 TIMES HIGHER RATE OF INFANT MORTALITY FOR BLACK BABIES (14.4 PER 1,000 BIRTHS) AS COMPARED TO WHITE (4.8 PER 1,000 BIRTHS). THE PERCENTAGE OF MOTHERS RECEIVING PRENATAL CARE IN THE FIRST TRIMESTER IN HARFORD COUNTY IS 71.%, HOWEVER WHEN BROKEN DOWN ALONG RACIAL AND ETHNIC LINES THE PERCENTAGE OF NON-WHITE MOTHERS RECEIVING PRENATAL CARE IN THE FIRST TRIMESTER IS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER. ACCORDING TO 2016 MARYLAND VITAL STATISTICS, 74.8% OF WHITE WOMEN RECEIVED PRENATAL CARE IN THE FIRST TRIMESTER, WHILE ONLY 59.7% OF BLACK WOMEN AND 60.3% OF HISPANIC WOMEN DID. THE LACK OF PRENATAL CARE AND THE POTENTIALLY NEGATIVE HEALTH OUTCOMES FOR NEWBORNS CAN HAVE LONG LASTING DETRIMENTAL DEVELOPMENTAL EFFECTS, INCLUDING SCHOOL READINESS AND LONG-TERM HEALTH COMPLICATIONS. WHILE HARFORD COUNTY'S VIOLENT CRIME AND PROPERTY CRIME RATE ARE MUCH LOWER THAN THE STATE RATE, CRIME AND THE RESULTING INCARCERATION DISPROPORTIONALLY AFFECT LOW-INCOME AREAS. IN HARFORD COUNTY, THE CITY OF ABERDEEN, ONE OF THE COMMUNITY'S LOWEST INCOME AREAS, HAS A SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER RATE OF OVERALL AND VIOLENT CRIME RATE THAN THE SURROUNDING MUNICIPALITIES. IN RESPONSE TO FAMILY HEALTH AND RESILIENCY, THE FOLLOWING ACTIONS ARE BEING TAKEN: *LINK PREGNANT PATIENTS TO NEEDED RESOURCES (I.E. TREATMENT FACILITIES, CARE COORDINATION PROGRAMS, AND DSS). *PROVIDE EDUCATION REGARDING SUBSTANCE EXPOSED NEWBORN POSTNATAL TREATMENT NEEDS AND EXPERIENCES TO TREATMENT PROVIDERS. ENGAGE HARFORD COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT, PEER RECOVERY SPECIALISTS, OB PROVIDERS *INCREASED ACCESS TO CLINICAL AND PSYCHO/SOCIAL SERVICES FOR UNINSURED, HOMELESS, AND MARGINAL POPULATIONS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTY AS PARTICIPANT IN PROJECT HOMELESS CONNECT. *IMPROVE HEALTH AND WELLBEING OF HIGH RISK AND RISING RISK MEDICARE POPULATION THROUGH INTENSE CARE COORDINATION AND HOME VISITING THROUGH WATCH TEAM. *PROVIDE ACES TRAINING THROUGHOUT HARFORD COUNTY. *PROVIDE ADVANCE DIRECTIVE CLASSES, LINKAGES, EDUCATION AND ASSISTANCE. *PARTICIPATE IN CHERISH THE CHILD, TRAUMA CONFERENCE *PROVIDE COMMUNITY EDUCATIONAL PRESENTATIONS RELATED TO NUTRITION AND LIFESTYLES AND HOW THEY CAN IMPROVE FAMILY HEALTH AND RESILIENCY. *IMPROVE LINKAGES FOR APPROPRIATE HOUSING AND HOUSING RENOVATIONS THROUGH HABITAT FOR HUMANITY HOUSING PARTNERSHIP *IMPROVE TRAUMA RESPONSE FOR REDUCED ACE SCORES THROUGH HANDLE WITH CARE POLICY FOR CHILDREN WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED TRAUMA RETURN TO SCHOOL.

FOUNDED IN 1993 AS A NON- PROFIT 501C3 BY LEADERS FROM UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND UPPER CHESAPEAKE HEALTH, THE HARFORD COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT, AND HARFORD COUNTY GOVERNMENT, HEALTHY HARFORD IS A COALITION OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, BUSINESSES, NON-PROFITS, AND CITIZENS DEDICATED TO IMPROVING THE HEALTH OF HARFORD COUNTY RESIDENTS THROUGH EDUCATION, POLICY CHANGES, IMPROVEMENTS IN THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT, INCREASED ACCESS TO CARE, AND IMPROVED CARE COORDINATION FOR PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC ILLNESS. HEALTHY HARFORD'S MISSION IS TO INSPIRE AND EMPOWER HEALTHY PEOPLE, HEALTHY FAMILIES, AND HEALTHY COMMUNITIES IN MIND, BODY, AND SPIRIT, WITH A FOCUS OF IMPROVING HEALTH AND WELLNESS IN THE HARFORD COUNTY REGION BY PROMOTING HEALTHY LIFESTYLES, BUILDING COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS, AND PROVING CARE COORDINATION. THE HARFORD COUNTY LOCAL HEALTH IMPROVEMENT COALITION (LHIC) - JOINTLY LED BY THE HARFORD COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT AND UMUCH. THIS COALITION BRINGS TOGETHER REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE COMMUNITY EVERY OCTOBER TO EXAM THE HEALTH OF OUR COMMUNITY AND DETERMINE A PLAN FOR MOVING FORWARD. PRIMARY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PRIORITIES FOR THIS COALITION INCLUDE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH, CHRONIC DISEASE PREVENTION & WELLNESS AND FAMILY HEALTH & RESILIENCY. THE CHARGE FOR EACH PRIORITY IS THEN LEAD BY A COMMUNITY WORKGROUP. EACH WORKGROUP HAS STRATEGIC INITIATIVES, ACTION PLANS, AND MEASURABLE GOALS. THEY MEET EITHER MONTHLY OR QUARTERLY AND REPORT OUT AT THE ANNUAL LHIC MEETING. OTHER COMMUNITY COALITIONS THAT UMUCH PLAYS AN ACTIVE ROLE IN INCLUDE: HARFORD COUNTY CANCER COALITION, SUICIDE PREVENTION WORKGROUP, OVERDOSE FATALITY REVIEW TEAM, CITIZEN REVIEW BOARD FOR CHILDREN, AND HARFORD COUNTY CHILD FATALITY REVIEW BOARD.

SCHEDULE H, PART III, LINE 2 - METHODOLOGY USED TO ESTIMATE BAD DEBTTHE HEALTH SERVICES COST REVIEW COMMISSION (HSCRC) STARTED SETTING HOSPITAL RATES IN 1974. AT THAT TIME, THE HSCRC APPROVED RATES APPLIED ONLY TO COMMERCIAL INSURERS. IN 1977, THE HSCRC NEGOTIATED A WAIVER FROM MEDICARE HOSPITAL PAYMENT RULES FOR MARYLAND HOSPITALS TO BRING THE FEDERAL MEDICARE PAYMENTS UNDER HSCRC CONTROL. IN 2014, MARYLAND'S WAIVER WITH MEDICARE WAS RENEGOTIATED AND UPDATED TO REFLECT THE CURRENT HEALTHCARE ENVIRONMENT. UNDER THIS NEW WAIVER, SEVERAL CRITERIA WERE ESTABLISHED TO MONITOR THE SUCCESS OF THE SYSTEM IN CONTROLLING HEALTHCARE COSTS AND THE CONTINUANCE OF THE WAIVER ITSELF: 1. REVENUE GROWTH PER CAPITA 2. MEDICARE HOSPITAL REVENUE PER BENEFICIARY 3. MEDICARE ALL PROVIDER REVENUE GROWTH PER BENEFICIARY 4. MEDICARE READMISSION RATES 5. HOSPITAL ACQUIRED CONDITION RATE BECAUSE OF THIS SYSTEM, THE HOSPITAL IS UNABLE TO ESTIMATE HOW MUCH OF THE AMOUNT REPORTED IN LINE 2 IS ATTRIBUTED TO PATIENTS WHO WOULD APPLY UNDER THE FAP.

REVENUE IS REDUCED FOR ANTICIPATED DISCOUNTS UNDER CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS AND FOR CHARITY CARE. AN ESTIMATED PROVISION FOR BAD DEBTS IS RECORDED IN THE PERIOD THE RELATED SERVICES ARE PROVIDED BASED UPON ANTICIPATED UNCOMPENSATED CARE, AND IS ADJUSTED AS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE. THE PROVISION FOR BAD DEBTS IS BASED UPON MANAGEMENT'S ASSESSMENT OF HISTORICAL AND EXPECTED NET COLLECTIONS CONSIDERING HISTORICAL BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, TRENDS IN HEALTHCARE COVERAGE, AND OTHER COLLECTION INDICATORS. PERIODICALLY THROUGHOUT THE YEAR, MANAGEMENT ASSESSES THE ADEQUACY OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS BASED UPON HISTORICAL WRITE-OFF EXPERIENCE BY PAYOR CATEGORY. THE RESULTS OF THIS REVIEW ARE THEN USED TO MAKE MODIFICATIONS TO THE PROVISION FOR BAD DEBTS AND TO ESTABLISH AN ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE RECEIVABLES. AFTER COLLECTION OF AMOUNTS DUE FROM INSURERS, THE CORPORATION FOLLOWS INTERNAL GUIDELINES FOR PLACING CERTAIN PAST DUE BALANCES WITH COLLECTION AGENCIES. FOR RECEIVABLES ASSOCIATED WITH SERVICES PROVIDED TO PATIENTS WHO HAVE THIRD-PARTY COVERAGE, THE CORPORATION ANALYZES CONTRACTUALLY DUE AMOUNTS AND PROVIDES AN ALLOWANCE FOR BAD DEBTS, ALLOWANCE FOR CONTRACTUAL ADJUSTMENTS, PROVISION FOR BAD DEBTS, AND CONTRACTUAL ADJUSTMENTS ON ACCOUNTS FOR WHICH THE THIRD-PARTY PAYOR HAS NOT YET PAID OR FOR PAYORS WHO ARE KNOWN TO BE HAVING FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES THAT MAKE THE REALIZATION OF AMOUNTS DUE UNLIKELY. FOR RECEIVABLES ASSOCIATED WITH SELF-PAY PATIENTS OR WITH BALANCES REMAINING AFTER THE THIRD-PARTY COVERAGE HAD ALREADY PAID, THE CORPORATION RECORDS A SIGNIFICANT PROVISION FOR BAD DEBTS IN THE PERIOD OF SERVICE ON THE BASIS OF ITS HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS, WHICH INDICATES THAT MANY PATIENTS ULTIMATELY DO NOT PAY THE PORTION OF THEIR BILL FOR WHICH THEY ARE FINANCIALLY RESPONSIBLE. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE DISCOUNTED RATES AND THE AMOUNTS COLLECTED AFTER ALL REASONABLE COLLECTION EFFORTS HAVE BEEN EXHAUSTED IS CHARGED AGAINST THE ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS.

WE EXAMINED TRENDS IN HEALTH INDICATORS OF COUNTY RESIDENTS OVER TIME, HIGHLIGHTING RACIAL AND GEOGRAPHIC DISPARITIES, AND IDENTIFIED AREAS OF POVERTY AND AT- RISK POPULATIONS WHICH PROVIDED A BASIS FOR OUR PUBLIC HEALTH PLANNING. DATA IN OUR ASSESSMENT CAME FROM A VARIETY OF NATIONAL AND STATE SOURCES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE UNITED STATES CENSUS BUREAU, MARYLAND STATE HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PLAN, MARYLAND VITAL STATISTICS, THE MARYLAND BEHAVIORAL RISK FACTOR SURVEILLANCE SURVEY, THE INJURIES IN MARYLAND REPORT, AND NATIONAL COUNTY HEALTH RANKINGS.

A MORE DETAILED DESCRIPTION, INCLUDING MAPS AND DATA TABLES, CAN BE FOUND IN OUR COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT AVAILABLE AT: HTTPS://WWW.UMMS.ORG/UCH/COMMUNITY/ASSESSMENT- AND-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN IN 2017, THE TOTAL POPULATION OF HARFORD COUNTY WAS ESTIMATED TO BE 250,132, WHICH WAS AN INCREASE OF 2.16% FROM 2010 (244,826). THE COUNTY IS LOCATED IN THE NORTHEASTERN PART OF THE STATE, WITH THE TOWNS AND CITIES OF VARYING SIZES, WEALTH, AND DIVERSITY. BEL AIR IS HARFORD'S COUNTY SEAT, HOME TO ROUGHLY 10,139 RESIDENTS, OR 4% OF THE COUNTY'S POPULATION. THE CITIES OF ABERDEEN AND HAVRE DE GRACE EACH MAKE UP APPROXIMATELY 9% AND 7%, RESPECTIVELY. THE REMAINING 80% OF THE COUNTY'S POPULATION IS MOSTLY DISTRIBUTED ALONG THE ROUTE 40 CORRIDOR AND IN RURAL PARTS OF THE COUNTY. THE MEDIAN AGE IN HARFORD COUNTY IS 40.6 OVERALL, WITH THE AGE CATEGORY CONTAINING THE LARGEST PERCENTAGE OF THE POPULATION BEING ADULTS AGES 50-54. THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE POPULATION IS CLOSE TO THE DISTRIBUTION OF AGE AND SEX IN THE UNITED STATES, ALTHOUGH THE COUNTY HAS A SLIGHTLY LOWER PERCENTAGE OF YOUNGER PEOPLE AND A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF MIDDLE-AGED ADULTS. THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL VARIATION IN THE LEVELS OF RACIAL AND ETHNIC DIVERSITY ACROSS HARFORD COUNTY. WHILE WHITES MAKE UP THE MAJORITY OF HARFORD COUNTY'S POPULATION, THE PERCENTAGES OF AFRICAN AMERICANS AND HISPANIC/LATINO RESIDENTS ARE INCREASING IN BOTH EDGEWOOD AND ABERDEEN. SINCE 2010, THE POPULATIONS OF THESE TWO ZIP CODES HAVE STARTED TO MORE CLOSELY REFLECT THE DEMOGRAPHICS FOUND ACROSS THE STATE OF MARYLAND, WHILE THE RACIAL COMPOSITION OF HAVRE DE GRACE HAS REMAINED RELATIVELY STABLE OVER TIME. SEVEN PERCENT OF HARFORD COUNTY RESIDENTS REPORTED SPEAKING A LANGUAGE OTHER THAN ENGLISH AT HOME. WHEN COMPARED TO THE UNITED STATES, MARYLAND IS A WEALTHY STATE, WITH A MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME ($78,916), WELL ABOVE THE NATION'S ($61,372). HARFORD COUNTY IS ONE OF MARYLAND'S WEALTHIER JURISDICTIONS, WITH A MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME OF $83,445. HOWEVER, THE COUNTY'S HIGHER INCOME IS NOT DISTRIBUTED EQUALLY ACROSS THE COUNTY: THE THREE MUNICIPALITIES IN HARFORD COUNTY HAVE VASTLY DIFFERENT MEDIAN INCOMES, WITH THE CITY OF ABERDEEN HAVING THE LOWEST ($60,489), FOLLOWED BY HAVRE DE GRACE ($76,416) AND BEL AIR ($85,798) (U.S. CENSUS BUREAU, 2017 AMERICAN COMMUNITY SURVEY 5-YEAR ESTIMATES). PERCENTAGES PROVIDED IN THE 2008-2010 AMERICAN COMMUNITY SURVEY, 3-YEAR ESTIMATES (U.S. CENSUS BUREAU) INDICATE THAT THE POVERTY RATE IN HARFORD COUNTY FAMILIES HAS INCREASED, CLIMBING FROM 4% TO 5.4%, IN LINE WITH AN INCREASE IN MARYLAND'S POVERTY RATE (5.7% TO THE RECENT ESTIMATE OF 6.6%) (U.S. CENSUS BUREAU, 2017 AMERICAN COMMUNITY SURVEY 5-YEAR ESTIMATES). HARFORD COUNTY POVERTY RATES FOR WHITE AND BLACK FAMILIES ARE STARKLY DIFFERENT: THE PERCENTAGE OF FAMILIES WITH A HOUSEHOLDER WHO IS WHITE HAS AN ESTIMATED POVERTY LEVEL OF 5.1% WHILE FAMILIES WITH A BLACK OR AFRICAN AMERICAN HOUSEHOLDER HAS A POVERTY LEVEL OF 14.3% (U.S. CENSUS BUREAU, 2011-2015 AMERICAN COMMUNITY SURVEY 5-YEAR ESTIMATES). THE DISPARITY IN HOUSEHOLD INCOMES IN HARFORD COUNTY AND THE CITIES OF ABERDEEN AND HAVRE DE GRACE IS CONSISTENT WITH THE PERCENTAGE OF FAMILIES WHOSE INCOME IS BELOW THE POVERTY LEVEL. BOTH IN MARYLAND AND IN HARFORD COUNTY, POVERTY RATES ARE HIGHEST IN FAMILIES HEADED BY A FEMALE AND FOR FAMILIES WITH RELATED CHILDREN UNDER 18 YEARS OF AGE. HARFORD COUNTY HAS A SLIGHTLY HIGHER POVERTY RATE AMONG FAMILIES WITH A FEMALE HEAD WHEN COMPARED TO MARYLAND, AND A SLIGHTLY LOWER RATE FOR PEOPLE AGE 65 AND OVER. POVERTY RATES FOR FAMILIES ARE DISTRIBUTED UNEQUALLY ACROSS THE COUNTY, WITH ALMOST A THIRD OF FAMILIES WITH A FEMALE HEAD AND CLOSE TO ONE QUARTER OF RELATED CHILDREN BELOW THE POVERTY LEVEL IN ABERDEEN. THE POVERTY RATES IN HARFORD COUNTY ARE REFLECTED IN THE PERCENTAGE OF FAMILIES RECEIVING FOOD STAMPS, WITH ABERDEEN HAVING THE HIGHEST PERCENTAGE OF FAMILIES AND THE TOWN OF BEL AIR HAVING THE LOWEST. THE PERCENTAGE OF HOUSEHOLDS IN HARFORD COUNTY RECEIVING FOOD STAMPS HAS INCREASED BY 3% SINCE THE 2008-2010 AMERICAN COMMUNITY SURVEY; 3-YEAR ESTIMATES (U.S. CENSUS BUREAU) REPORTED THAT 5% OF HARFORD COUNTY HOUSEHOLDS WERE FOOD STAMP RECIPIENTS, CONSISTENT WITH THE INCREASE IN THE POVERTY LEVEL IN THE COUNTY. HARFORD COUNTY PUBLIC SCHOOL DISTRICT HAS 54 SCHOOLS, INCLUDING SEVEN TITLE I ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS, WITH THE MISSION TO ENSURE ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT FOR AT-RISK STUDENTS ATTENDING SCHOOLS IN HIGH POVERTY AREAS. ALL SEVEN ARE LOCATED IN THE SOUTHERN PORTION OF THE COUNTY: THREE IN ABERDEEN, AND ONE EACH IN EDGEWOOD, HAVRE DE GRACE, JOPPA, AND ABINGDON (HTTP://WWW.HCPS.ORG/SCHOOLS/). HARFORD COUNTY PUBLIC SCHOOLS HAD A TOTAL OF 37,780 STUDENTS IN THE 2017-2018 SCHOOL YEAR. THE HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION RATE WAS 88.94%, SLIGHTLY HIGHER THAN MARYLAND'S RATE OF 87.12% (HTTP://REPORTCARD.MSDE.MARYLAND.GOV/). ACCORDING TO SCHOOLDIGGER, AN ORGANIZATION THAT CALCULATES SCHOOL RANKINGS BASED ON TEST SCORES RELEASED BY THE MARYLAND DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION, HARFORD COUNTY PUBLIC SCHOOLS RANKED 11TH BEST OUT OF THE 24 PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEMS IN MARYLAND IN 2017. THIS WAS A DROP FROM 5TH BEST IN 2015 (HTTPS://WWW.SCHOOLDIGGER.COM/GO/MD/DISTRICTRANK.ASPX). IN 2017, 92.9% OF PEOPLE 25 YEARS AND OVER IN HARFORD COUNTY HAD AT LEAST GRADUATED FROM HIGH SCHOOL AND 35.2% HAD A BACHELOR'S DEGREE OR HIGHER. AN ESTIMATED 7.1% DID NOT COMPLETE HIGH SCHOOL. IN COMPARISON, IN THE TOWN WITH THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF POVERTY, ABERDEEN, AN ESTIMATED 11.9% DID NOT COMPLETE HIGH SCHOOL, AND ONLY 14.2% HAD BACHELOR'S DEGREE. IN HARFORD COUNTY, 64.4% OF THE POPULATION AGE 16 AND OVER WAS EMPLOYED; 31.2% WERE NOT CURRENTLY IN THE LABOR FORCE. AN ESTIMATED 74.9% OF THE PEOPLE EMPLOYED WERE PRIVATE WAGE AND SALARY WORKERS; 20.9% WERE FEDERAL, STATE, OR LOCAL GOVERNMENT WORKERS; AND 2.7% WERE SELF-EMPLOYED IN THEIR OWN (NOT INCORPORATED) BUSINESS (U.S. CENSUS BUREAU, 2013-2017 Upper Chesapeake Medical Center, Inc. 52-125392053 5/17/2021 1:10:02 PMReturn Reference - Identifier Explanation AMERICAN COMMUNITY SURVEY). WHILE THE MEDIAN VALUE OF HOMES IN HARFORD COUNTY ($281,400) IS ONLY SLIGHTLY LESS THAN MARYLAND'S ($296,500), THE DIFFERENCE WHEN CONSIDERING HOUSING PRICES BY ZIP CODE IS DRAMATIC. PRICES RANGE FROM BELOW THE STATE VALUE IN THE EDGEWOOD AREA, WHERE THE MEDIAN HOME VALUE IS $163,300, TO WELL ABOVE THE STATE IN THE MONKTON AREA, WHERE THE MEDIAN HOME COSTS $517,400. TRANSPORTATION IS ALSO A CONCERN IN MANY PARTS OF THE COUNTY, ESPECIALLY FOR SENIORS, YOUTH, AND LOW-INCOME INDIVIDUALS IN THE RURAL AREAS OF NORTHERN HARFORD COUNTY. AMENITIES SUCH AS SHOPPING, ENTERTAINMENT, AND HEALTH SERVICES ARE OFTEN FAR AWAY, AND THERE ARE FEW PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS. THE BUS SERVICE HAS LIMITED HOURS AND ROUTES MAKING IT DIFFICULT FOR THOSE WITHOUT CARS TO ACCESS THEM. DATA SHOW THAT 1.6% OF RESIDENTS IN THE COUNTY HAVE NO ACCESS TO A VEHICLE, WITH THAT NUMBER REACHING 3.4% IN HAVRE DE GRACE. IN 2015, HARFORD COUNTY HAD AN ANNUAL VIOLENT CRIME RATE OF 239 PER 100,000 PEOPLE, WHICH IS MUCH LOWER THAN MARYLAND'S RATE OF 471. SIMILARLY, THE RATE OF PROPERTY CRIME IN HARFORD COUNTY WAS LOWER THAN THE STATE'S AT 1,257 PER 100,000 WHEN COMPARED TO MARYLAND'S RATE OF 2,395. WHILE THE OVERALL CRIMES RATES IN BOTH HARFORD COUNTY AND MARYLAND HAVE DECREASED SINCE 2011, IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE VIOLENT CRIME RATE IN ABERDEEN (503.1) IS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THE COUNTY'S AS A WHOLE, ILLUSTRATING THE INEQUITY IN LIVING CONDITIONS FOR FAMILIES RESIDING IN THIS AREA. DESPITE THE DRAMATIC DECREASES IN BOTH VIOLENT CRIME AND PROPERTY CRIME IN HARFORD COUNTY AND THROUGHOUT THE STATE, THE NUMBER OF DRUG-RELATED INCIDENTS REPORTED BY THE HARFORD COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE HAS INCREASED BY 80% FROM 2011 TO 2017. THIS GROWING TREND HAS SHIFTED THE FOCUS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT TO COMBAT THE DRUG CRISIS IN HARFORD COUNTY. IN HARFORD COUNTY, MOST RESIDENTS HAVE ACCESS TO GROCERY STORES WHERE HEALTHY FOODS ARE AVAILABLE. ACCORDING TO THE 2017 COUNTY HEALTH RANKINGS, WHICH PROVIDES A MEASURE OF \"LIMITED ACCESS TO HEALTHY FOODS,\" 97% OF RESIDENTS LIVE CLOSE TO A GROCERY STORE, WITH ONLY 4% OR AN ESTIMATED 10,041 PEOPLE HAVING LIMITED ACCESS TO HEALTHY FOOD. Upper Chesapeake Medical Center, Inc. 52-125392054 5/17/2021 1:10:02 PMReturn Reference - Identifier Explanation SCHEDULE H, PART VI, LINE 4 - COMMUNITY INFORMATION CONTTHIS MEASURE IS BASED ON THE PERCENTAGE OF THE POPULATION THAT IS LOW INCOME AND DOES NOT LIVE CLOSE TO A GROCERY STORE. WHILE ACCESS TO GROCERY STORES IS NOT A PROBLEM FOR MOST HARFORD COUNTY RESIDENTS, MANY FAMILIES REQUIRE ASSISTANCE IN PURCHASING FOODS: 8.3 % OR 20,760 OF HOUSEHOLDS IN HARFORD COUNTY RECEIVED FOOD STAMPS FROM THE SUPPLEMENTAL NUTRITION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM IN 2017 (U.S. CENSUS, FACT FINDER). A MORE PRESSING ISSUE FOR A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF HARFORD COUNTY RESIDENTS IS HAVING AN INADEQUATE AMOUNT OF FOOD OR \"FOOD INSECURITY\" AT SOME TIME DURING EACH YEAR. FOOD INSECURITY IS THE USDA'S MEASURE OF LACK OF ACCESS, AT TIMES, TO ENOUGH FOOD FOR AN ACTIVE, HEALTHY LIFE FOR ALL HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS AND LIMITED OR UNCERTAIN AVAILABILITY OF NUTRITIONALLY ADEQUATE FOODS. PER THE USDA FOOD ENVIRONMENT ATLAS, HOUSEHOLDS EXPERIENCING FOOD INSECURITY EXPERIENCE THIS CONDITION, ON AVERAGE, IN SEVEN MONTHS OF THE YEAR. IT IS ESTIMATED THAT IN 2017 THE FOOD INSECURITY RATE FOR THE HARFORD COUNTY POPULATION WAS 8% OR 20,082 PEOPLE. THIS IS LESS THAN MARYLAND'S RATE OF 11%. IN HARFORD COUNTY, THE WEEKLY FOOD BUDGET SHORTFALL FOR FOOD INSECURE PEOPLE WAS $17.38 PER PERSON, PER WEEK IN 2015. IN SUMMARY, MOST HARFORD COUNTY RESIDENTS HAVE ACCESS TO GROCERY STORES TO PURCHASE HEALTHY FOODS. HOWEVER, A NUMBER OF THESE RESIDENTS FACE FOOD INSECURITY AT SOME TIME DURING THE YEAR, WITH HEALTHY FOODS OUT OF REACH. ACCORDING TO THE 2014-2016 BEHAVIORAL RISK FACTOR SURVEILLANCE SURVEY (BRFSS), 17.3% OF HARFORD COUNTY ADULTS REPORTED THAT THEY CURRENTLY SMOKED CIGARETTES EVERY DAY OR SOME DAYS. ADULTS WITH ANNUAL INCOMES LESS THAN $15,000 WERE 5.7 TIMES MORE LIKELY TO SMOKE THAN THOSE WITH INCOME AT OR ABOVE $75,000 IN 2014. EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT ALSO CORRELATED TO SMOKING RATES: ADULTS WITHOUT A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA WERE 9.7 TIMES MORE LIKELY TO SMOKE THAN COLLEGE GRADUATES ACCORDING TO THE 2014 BRFSS. SCHOOL-AGED STUDENTS WERE CONSIDERED SMOKERS IF THEY SMOKED AT LEAST 1 CIGARETTE OR CIGAR IN THE PAST 30 DAYS. THE 2016 YOUTH RISK BEHAVIOR SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM SURVEY (YRBS) FOUND THAT THE PERCENTAGE OF CURRENT SMOKERS IN HARFORD COUNTY HIGH SCHOOLS WAS 9.3% WHEN COMPARED TO 16.9% IN 2014. WHILE THIS RATE HAS DECREASED OVER TIME, THE PERCENTAGE OF STUDENTS REPORTING THAT THEY CURRENTLY USE ELECTRONIC VAPOR PRODUCTS EXCEEDED THE NUMBER OF CURRENT SMOKERS AT 14.3% ACCORDING TO THE 2016 YRBS. THE PERCENTAGE OF STUDENTS USING ANY TYPE OF TOBACCO PRODUCTS (CIGARETTE, SMOKELESS TOBACCO, CIGAR, OR ELECTRONIC VAPOR PRODUCTS) WAS 21.9% (2016 YRBS). SINCE 2007, THE NUMBER OF DRUG AND ALCOHOL-RELATED INTOXICATION DEATHS HAS MORE THAN DOUBLED IN BOTH MARYLAND AND HARFORD COUNTY. NOTABLY, HEROIN AND FENTANYL HAVE CAUSED THE LARGEST INCREASE IN INTOXICATION DEATHS DUE TO THE INCREASINGLY VOLATILE NATURE OF THE CHEMICALS BEING MIXED INTO THE LOCAL DRUG SUPPLY. THE NUMBERS OF DRUG-RELATED LAW ENFORCEMENT INCIDENTS INCREASED BY 79% SINCE 2011. IN BRFSS DATA FOR 2014-2016, 15.04% OF HARFORD COUNTY ADULTS REPORTED BINGE DRINKING IN THE PAST MONTH AND 4.0% REPORTED BEING CHRONIC DRINKERS (1-2 OR MORE DRINKS PER DAY), BOTH OF WHICH ARE CLOSE TO THE STATE PERCENTAGES. THE PERCENTAGE OF HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS REPORTING BINGE DRINKING WAS HIGHER THAN THE ADULT'S: 15.6% OF HARFORD COUNTY HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS REPORTED BEING BINGE DRINKERS IN 2016. ACCORDING TO THE 2016 BRFSS, HARFORD COUNTY'S OBESITY RATE WAS 34.9%, WHICH WAS HIGHER THAN THE STATE'S (28.6%). SEVERAL FACTORS WERE SHOWN TO INCREASE A PERSON'S CHANCE OF OBESITY INCLUDING INCOME, RACE, AND EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT. BLACK ADULTS WERE ALMOST TWICE AS LIKELY TO BE OBESE WHEN COMPARED TO WHITE ADULTS, A DISPARITY THAT IS MUCH MORE EVIDENT IN HARFORD COUNTY THAN THE STATE AS A WHOLE IN THE 2015 BRFSS, BUT THIS GAP HAD BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED IN THE 2016 ASSESSMENT. IN THE 2015 BRFF ASSESSMENT, ADULTS WITHOUT A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA WERE ALSO ALMOST TWICE AS LIKELY TO BE OBESE THAN THEIR COLLEGE GRADUATE COUNTERPARTS. ADULTS MAKING OVER $75,000 ANNUALLY WERE SLIGHTLY LESS LIKELY TO BE OBESE THAN ADULTS MAKING LESS THAN $15,000. DATA FROM THE MARYLAND VITAL STATISTICS ADMINISTRATION INDICATE THAT THE TOP THREE LEADING CAUSES OF DEATH IN MARYLAND INCLUDE HEART DISEASE, CANCER, AND CEREBROVASCULAR DISEASE (STROKE). THE ROLE OF ACCIDENTS AS THE FOURTH LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH IS A RELATIVELY NEW PHENOMENON THAT COULD LIKELY BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE GROWING OPIOID EPIDEMIC AND ACCIDENTAL OVERDOSES. HARFORD COUNTY'S LEADING CAUSES OF DEATH DO NOT MIRROR THE STATE'S. THE COUNTY'S THREE LEADING CAUSES OF DEATH INCLUDE HEART DISEASE, CANCER, AND CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD). THE STATE'S THREE LEADING CAUSES OF DEATH INCLUDE HEART DISEASE, CANCER, AND CEREBROVASCULAR DISEASE. IN ADDITION, BETWEEN 2014 AND 2016 THE NUMBER OF YEARS OF POTENTIAL LIFE LOST IN HARFORD COUNTY WAS 5,800 PER 100,000 POPULATION WHEN COMPARED TO 6,500 FOR THE STATE OF MARYLAND. FOR AFRICAN AMERICANS IN HARFORD COUNTY, THAT NUMBER INCREASED TO 7,600 YEARS OF LIFE LOST. THE RATE FOR EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT (ED) VISITS IN MARYLAND WAS 353.2 PER 1,000 RESIDENTS IN 2016. HARFORD COUNTY'S RATE WAS SLIGHTLY LOWER AT 316.1. WHEN EACH ZIP CODE WAS EXAMINED INDIVIDUALLY, IT WAS FOUND THAT THE ZIP CODES WITH THE HIGHEST ED VISIT RATES WERE ABERDEEN (580), EDGEWOOD (502), AND HAVRE DE GRACE (460), ALL OF WHICH WERE WELL ABOVE THE STATE AND COUNTY AVERAGES. USING THE CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICE'S DEFINITION OF CHRONIC CONDITIONS, 2016 DATA FOR HARFORD COUNTY INDICATED THAT THE THREE MOST COMMON CONDITIONS ASSOCIATED WITH ED VISITS WERE HYPERTENSION, TOBACCO USE, AND HYPERLIPIDEMIA (HIGH CONCENTRATION OF FATS OR LIPIDS IN A PATIENT'S BLOOD). HAVRE DE GRACE'S TOP THREE CHRONIC DISEASE INDICATORS WERE THE SAME AS THOSE RECORDED FOR THE COUNTY. HOWEVER, WHILE ABERDEEN AND EDGEWOOD HAD TOBACCO USE AND HYPERTENSION AS THEIR LEADING INDICATORS, THE THIRD AND FOURTH HIGHEST INDICATORS WERE DEPRESSIVE DISORDERS AND ASTHMA, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH SUGGEST THAT THESE CONDITIONS WERE NOT BEING SUCCESSFULLY TREATED ON AN OUTPATIENT BASIS. CANCER MORTALITY RATES ARE ALSO WORSE IN HARFORD COUNTY THAN FOR THE STATE OF MARYLAND. WHILE THE STATE'S MORTALITY RATES HAVE STEADILY DECLINED OVER TIME, HARFORD COUNTY'S RATE HAS ONLY SLIGHTLY DECREASED. HARFORD COUNTY RATES ARE THE SAME OR WORSE FOR EVERY CANCER TYPE WHEN COMPARED BOTH LOCALLY AND NATIONALLY.

A NOTIFIABLE DISEASE IS ANY CONDITION THAT, WHEN IDENTIFIED IN A PATIENT, IS REQUIRED TO BE REPORTED TO THE GOVERNMENT SO THAT ITS INCIDENCE CAN BE MONITORED FOR POTENTIAL OUTBREAKS AND CLUSTERING. IN MARYLAND, THERE ARE 86 NOTIFIABLE DISEASES THAT ARE REPORTED TO THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL (CDC). OF THOSE DISEASES, THE HIGHEST CASE RATES IN HARFORD COUNTY WERE OBSERVED FOR CHLAMYDIA, LYME DISEASE, GONORRHEA, SALMONELLOSIS (SALMONELLA), AND ASEPTIC MENINGITIS. HARFORD COUNTY'S LYME DISEASE RATE IS MUCH HIGHER THAN THE STATE RATE. IN ADDITION, 24 HARFORD COUNTY RESIDENTS WERE DIAGNOSED WITH HIV IN 2017.

THE RATE OF MOTOR VEHICLE CRASH DEATHS WAS 10 PER 100,000 IN HARFORD COUNTY AND 9 IN MARYLAND. IN ADDITION, THE PERCENTAGE OF MOTOR VEHICLE DEATHS IN WHICH ALCOHOL- IMPAIRMENT WAS THE PRIMARY FACTOR WAS HIGHER IN MARYLAND AT 30%, THAN THE 21% FOR HARFORD COUNTY DEATHS. INTENTIONAL INJURIES FROM SUICIDE AND HOMICIDE ACCOUNTED FOR 1.6% OF DEATHS IN HARFORD COUNTY IN 2017 AND UNINTENTIONAL INJURY DEATHS ACCOUNTED FOR 7.4%. WHILE INJURY DEATHS FROM MOTOR VEHICLE ACCIDENTS HAVE DECREASED OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS, DEATHS FROM INTENTIONAL SELF-HARM (SUICIDE), POISONING, AND FALLS HAVE CONTINUED TO INCREASE THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THE MARYLAND BRFSS DATA FOR 2014-2016 INDICATES THAT 21.4% OF HARFORD COUNTY RESIDENTS HAVE BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH DEPRESSIVE DISORDER, COMPARED TO 15.6% FOR THE STATE. IN ADDITION, HOSPITAL DATA MADE AVAILABLE BY THE CHESAPEAKE REGIONAL INFORMATION SYSTEM FOR OUR PATIENTS (CRISP) REPORTING SYSTEM, WHICH SERVES AS A REGIONAL HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE FOR MARYLAND, VIRGINIA, WEST VIRGINIA, AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, INDICATES THAT THE RATES OF HOSPITALIZATIONS AND EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT VISITS FOR MENTAL HEALTH-RELATED CONDITIONS ARE SIMILAR IN HARFORD COUNTY AND THE STATE OF MARYLAND, BUT GEOGRAPHIC DISPARITIES APPEAR IN THE THREE ZIP CODES WITH THE HIGHEST NEED INDEX FOR THE COUNTY. THE NEED INDEX IS BASED ON THE COMMUNITY NEED INDEX DEVELOPED BY DIGNITY HEALTH IN 2004. ACCORDING TO THE 2014 AND 2016 MARYLAND YOUTH RISK BEHAVIOR SURVEY, THE PERCENTAGE OF STUDENTS WHO REPORTED FEELING SAD OR HOPELESS FOR MORE THAN TWO WEEKS IN A ROW CLIMBED 33.3% BETWEEN THE FIRST YEAR OF MIDDLE SCHOOL AND THE SENIOR YEAR OF HIGH SCHOOL. THE PERCENTAGE OF HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS WHO SERIOUSLY CONSIDERED COMMITTING SUICIDE WAS 18.2 % WHILE 14.4% MADE A PLAN FOR HOW THEY WOULD COMMIT SUICIDE. ACCESS TO HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE HAS REMAINED STRONG IN HARFORD COUNTY WITH THE EXPANSION OF MEDICAID ELIGIBILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE MARYLAND HEALTH EXCHANGE FOR QUALIFIED HEALTH PLANS UNDER THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. IN 2017, THE PERCENTAGE OF UNINSURED ADULTS WAS JUST 3.9% COMPARED TO MARYLAND'S 9% ACCORDING TO THE U.S. CENSUS BUREAU. HOWEVER, THE FOLLOWING DISPARITIES ARISE BY ZIP CODE, AGE, SEX, RACE, AND EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT. NOTICE THAT THE FOLLOWING CHARACTERISTICS MAKE ADULTS LESS LIKELY TO HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE: 18 TO 24 YEARS OF AGE, MALE, HISPANIC, AND LESS THAN A HIGH SCHOOL DEGREE. POPULATIONS WITH THE HIGHEST UNINSURED RATES LIVE IN ABERDEEN (21001) AND EDGEWOOD (21040). IN THE 2014-2016 BRFSS, 88.5% OF HARFORD COUNTY RESIDENTS REPORTED HAVING A PERSON THAT THEY THINK OF AS THEIR PERSONAL DOCTOR OR HEALTH CARE PROVIDER, HIGHER THAN THE STATE PERCENTAGE OF 85.05%. RESPONSES TO THE 2016 BRFSS INDICATE THAT MORE HARFORD COUNTY RESIDENTS HAVE HAD ROUTINE HEALTH CHECKUPS IN THE LAST YEAR (79.05%) THAN MARYLAND RESIDENTS (75.79%). HOWEVER, IN THE 2014-2016 BRFSS, 9.1% OF HARFORD COUNTY RESIDENTS REPORTED NEEDING TO SEE A DOCTOR BUT NOT BEING ABLE TO BECAUSE OF A COST BARRIER. IN 2014 THE TWO MOST REPORTED REASONS FOR DELAYING MEDICAL CARE INCLUDED NOT BEING ABLE TO GET AN APPOINTMENT SOON ENOUGH (9.1%) AND NOT HAVING TRANSPORTATION TO REACH AN APPOINTMENT (8.3%), ACCORDING TO THE MARYLAND BRFSS. DATA BELOW SHOWS THAT HISPANICS WERE ALMOST 10 TIMES MORE LIKELY THAN WHITES TO REPORT TRANSPORTATION AS A BARRIER TO RECEIVING CARE. ACCORDING TO THE MARYLAND DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH'S HEALTH RESOURCES AND SERVICES ADMINISTRATION, A PORTION IN EDGEWOOD, HARFORD COUNTY IS CONSIDERED A HEALTH PROFESSIONAL SHORTAGE AREAS (HPSA) FOR PRIMARY CARE. WHILE MOST MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS CAN BE TREATED SUCCESSFULLY, MANY WHO SUFFER FROM THESE DISEASES DO NOT RECEIVE THE CARE THEY NEED. THE HEALTH RESOURCES AND SERVICES ADMINISTRATION DESIGNATED ALL OF HARFORD COUNTY AS A HEALTH PROFESSIONAL SHORTAGE AREA (HPSA) FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. THIS DESIGNATION MEANS THAT THE NEED FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FAR OUTWEIGHS THEIR AVAILABILITY. THE MARYLAND DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH'S BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ADMINISTRATION COMPARES EACH MARYLAND COUNTY'S OPIOID TREATMENT PROGRAM (OTP) CAPACITY TO THE ESTIMATED NEED IN THAT COUNTY. IN 2015 HARFORD COUNTY'S ESTIMATED NEED WAS 2,570 PATIENTS. IN COMPARISON, EXISTING CAPACITY COULD ONLY SERVE 1,687 PATIENTS, LEAVING ABOUT 883 PERSONS IN NEED. IN ADDITION, DATA FROM COUNTY HEALTH RANKINGS SHOW THAT IN 2016, HARFORD COUNTY'S MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDER RATIO WAS 740:1. THIS IS MUCH HIGHER THAN MARYLAND'S RATIO OF 490:1. UNITED STATES COUNTIES IN THE 90TH PERCENTILE FOR THIS MEASURE REPORT RATIOS CLOSER TO 360:1 FOR MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS. ANOTHER INDICATOR THAT SUGGESTS LIMITED ACCESS TO SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT IS THE RATE OF SUBSTANCE-EXPOSED NEWBORNS. DATA SHOWS A 677% INCREASE IN THE RATE OF HOSPITAL ENCOUNTERS FOR NEWBORNS WITH MATERNAL DRUG/ALCOHOL EXPOSURE FOR HARFORD COUNTY AND MARYLAND BETWEEN 2000 AND 2017. ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE DENTAL CARE IS CRITICAL TO ENSURING GOOD ORAL HEALTH.

Management' s Responsibility for the Financial Statements Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles; this includes the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentat ion of financial statements that are free of material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. Auditors ' Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditors' judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, wh ether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity 's preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity' s internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.

UMMS was created in 1984 when its founding hospital was privatized by the State of Maryland. Prior to that time, the founding hospital was state -owned, operated and financed as part of the University of Maryland, now a part of the University System. As part of the privatization process, the Maryland General Assembly and the University of Maryland 's Board of Regents adopted legislation (the Governance Legislation) separating the major health care delivery components from the University System to UMMS. This Governance Legislation provides for certain level of oversight by the State of Maryland to ensure UMMS ' founding purposes are consistently set forth in its functions and operating practices. Over its 3 5-year history, UMMS evolved into a multi -hospital system with academic, community and specialty service missions reaching primarily across Maryland. In continuing partnership with the University of Maryland School of Medicine, UMMS operates healthcare programs that improve the physical and mental health of thousands of people each day. The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Corporation, its wholly owned subsidiaries, and entities controlled by the Corporation. In addition, the Corporation maintains equity interests in various unconsolidated joint ventur es, which are described in Note 5. The significant operating divisions of the Corporation are described in further detail below. All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

(b) Basis of Presentation The consolidated financial statements are prepared on the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. (c) Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents, excluding amounts shown within investments and assets limited as to use, consist of cash and interest -bearing de posits with maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase. Cash and cash equivalent balances may exceed amounts insured by federal agencies and, therefore, bear a risk of loss. The Corporation has not experienced suc h losses on these funds. (d) Investments and Assets Limited as to Use The Corporation 's investment portfolios are classified as trading and are reported in the consolidated balance sheets, as long- term a ssets, at their fair value, based on quoted market prices, at June 30, 2020 and 2019. Unrealized holding gains and losses on trading securities with readily determinable market values are included in nonoperating income. Investment income, including realized gains and losses, is included in nonoperating income in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and changes in net assets . Upper Chesapeake Medical Center, Inc. 52-125392098 5/17/2021 1:10:02 PMUniversity of Maryland Medical System Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) (In Thousands) 2005 -3486109 14 (1) Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) Assets limited as to use include inve stments set aside at the discretion of the board of directors for the replacement or acquisition of property and equipment, investments held by trustees under bond indenture agreements and self -insurance trust arrangements, and assets whose use is restrict ed by donors. Such investments are stated at fair value. Amounts required to meet current liabilities have been included in current assets in the consolidated balance sheets. Changes in fair values of donor -restricted investments are recorded in net assets with donor restrictions unless otherwise required by the donor or state law. Assets limited as to use also include the Corporation 's economic interests in financially i nterrelated organizations ( Note 13). Alternative investments, which the Corporation defines to include multi -strategy commingled funds, hedge funds, hedge fund -of-funds, and private equity investments, are recorded under the equity method of accounting. Underlying securities of these alternat ive investments may include certain debt and equity securities that are not readily marketable. Because certain investments are not readily marketable, their fair value is subject to additional uncertainty, and therefore , values realized upon disposition m ay vary significantly from current reported values. Investments are exposed to certain risks, such as interest rate, credit , and overall market volatility. Due to the level of risk associated with certain investment securities, changes in the value of investment securities could occur in the near term, and these changes could materially differ from the amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. (e) Inventories Inventories, consisting primarily of drugs and medical/surgical suppl ies, are carried at the lower of cost or market, on a first- in, first- out basis. (f) Economic Interests in Financially Interrelated Organizations The Corporation recognizes its rights to assets held by recipient organizations, which accept cash or other fi nancial assets from a donor and agree to use those assets on behalf of or transfer those assets, the return on investment of those assets, or both, to the Corporation. Changes in the Corporation 's economic interests in these financially interrelated organizations are recognized in the accompanying consolidated statements of changes in net assets.

Depreciation is provided on a straight -line basis over the estimated useful lives of the depreciable assets using the half-year convention. The estimated useful lives of the assets are as follow s: Buildings 20 to 40 years Building and leasehold improvements 5 to 15 years Equipment 3 to 15 years Interest costs incurred on borrowed funds less interest income earned on the unexpended bond proceeds during the period of construction are capitalized as a component of the cost of acquiring those assets. Gifts of long -lived assets, such as land, buildings, or equipment are reported as unrestricted support unless explicit donor stipulations specify how the donated assets must be used. Gifts o f long- lived assets with explicit restrictions that specify how the assets are to be used and gifts of cash or other assets that must be used to acquire long -lived assets are reported as restricted support. Absent explicit donor stipulations about how long those long- lived assets must be maintained, expirations of donor restrictions are reported when the donated or acquired long- lived assets are placed in service. (h) Deferred Financing Costs Costs incurred related to the issuance of long -term debt, which a re included in long- term debt , are deferred and are amortized over the life of the related debt agreements or the related letter of credit agreements using the effective- interest method. (i) Intangible Assets and Goodwill Intangible assets include amounts recognized in connection with acquisitions. Intangible assets are initially valued at fair market value using generally accepted valuation methods. Amortization is recognized on a straight -line basis over the estimated useful life of the intangible assets. Intangible assets with definite and indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment if indicators of impairment arise.

The carrying value of goodwill is evaluated at least annually for impairment . The Corporation has one reporting unit within continuing operations . There was no impairment loss recognized for the year ended June 30, 2020 and 2019. The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill are as follows: Health Care Delivery Goodwill at June 30, 2018 $ 48,810 Acquisitions - Write -downs - Goodwill at June 30, 2019 48,810 Acquisitions - Write -downs - Goodwill at June 30, 2020 $ 48,810 (j) Impairment of Long -Lived Assets Long- lived assets, such as property, plant, and equipment, and purchased intangibles subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the car rying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying a mount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the consolidated balance sheets and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and are no longer depreciat ed. The assets and liabilities of a disposed group classified as held for sale would be presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the consolidated balance sheets. No impairment losses were recorded for the years ended June 30, 2020 or 2019. Upper Chesapeake Medical Center, Inc. 52-1253920101 5/17/2021 1:10:02 PMUniversity of Maryland Medical System Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) (In Thousands) 2005 -3486109 17 (1) Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) (k) Investments in Joint Ventures When the Corporation does not have a controlling interest in an entity where less than 50% of the voting common stock is owned or does not exert a significant influence over the entity, the Corporation applies the equity method of accounting. (l) Self -Insurance Under the Corporation 's self -insurance programs (general and professional liability, workers ' compensation, and employee health and long -term disability benefits), incurred claims are estimated primarily based upon actuarial methods which include incurred but not reported claims analysis and reported claims the severit y of incidents and the expected timing of claim payments. These estimates are continually reviewed and adjusted as necessary based on experience. These adjustments are recorded within the current period operating income. (m) Net Assets The Corporation clas sifies net assets based on the existence or absence of donor -imposed restrictions. Net assets without donor restrictions represent contributions, gifts , and grants, which have no donor -imposed restrictions or which arise as a result of operations. Net assets with donor restrictions are subject to donor -imposed restrictions that must or will be met either by satisfying a specific purpose and/or passage of time. Generally, the donors of th ese assets permit the use of all or part of the income earned on related investments for specific purposes. The restrictions associated with these net assets generally pertain to patient care, specific capital projects, and funding of specific hospital ope rations and community outreach programs. (n) Net Patient Service Revenue and Patient Accounts Receivable In accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, net patient service revenue, which includes hospital inpatient services, hospital outpatient services, physician services, and other patient services revenue, is recorded at the transaction price estimated by the Corporation to reflect the total consideration due from patients and third -party payors (including commercial payers and government programs) and others. Revenue is recognized over time as performance obligations are satisfied in exchange for providing goods and services in patient care. Revenue is Upper Chesapeake Medical Center, Inc. 52-1253920102 5/17/2021 1:10:02 PMUniversity of Maryland Medical System Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) (In Thousands) 2005 -3486109 18 (1) Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) recor ded as these goods and services are provided. The services provided to a patient during an inpatient stay or outpatient visit represent a bundle of goods and services that are distinct and accounted for as a single performance obligation. The Corporation 's estimate of the transaction price includes the Corporation 's standard charges for the goods and services provided with a reduction recorded related to explicit price concessions for such items as contractual allowances, charity care, potential adjustments that may arise from payment and other reviews, and implicit price concessions such as uncollectible amounts. The price concessions are determined using the portfolio approach as a practical expedient to account for patient contracts as collective groups rather than individually. Based on historical experience, a significant portion of the self -pay population will be unable or unwilling to pay for services and only the amount anticipated to be collected is recognized the transactions price . Subsequent changes to the estimate of the transaction price are generally recorded as adjustment to net patient service revenue in the period of change. Subsequent changes that are determined to be the result of an adverse change in the payor 's or patient 's ability to pay are considered bad debt expense and recorded within operating expenses. Estimates for uncollectible amounts are based on the historical collections experience for similar payors and patients, current market conditions, and other relevant factors. The Corp oration recognizes a significant amount of patient service revenue even though they do not assess the patient 's ability to pay. The standard charges for goods and services for the Medical Center, ROI, Midtown, Baltimore Washington, Shore Regional, Charles Regional, St. Joseph, Upper Chesapeake, and Capital Region reflects actual charges to patients based on rates established by the state of Maryland Health Services Cost Review Commission (HSCRC) in effect during the period in which the services are rendered. See Note 20 for further discussion on the HSCRC and regulated rates. Patient accounts are recorded at the net realizable value based on certain assumptions determined by each payor. For third -party payors including Medicare, Medicaid, and commercial insurance, the net realizable value is based on the estimated contractual adjustments which is based on approved discounts on charge s as permitted by the HSCRC. For self -pay accounts, which includes patients who are uninsured and the patient responsibility portion for patients with insurance, the net realizable value is determined using estimates of historical collection experience.

Under this exemption, the Corporation was not required to disclose the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to performance obligations that are unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied at the end of the reporting period. Any unsatisfied or partially unsati sfied performance obligations at the end of the year are completed within days or weeks of the end of the year. Net patient service revenue by line of business are as follows: Year Ended June 30 2020 2019 Hospital inpatient and outpatient services $ 3,658,694 $ 3,734,201 Physician services 238,498 245,150 Other 18,739 37,703 Net patient service revenue $ 3,915,931 $ 4,017,054 (o) Charity Care The Corporation is committed to providing quality healthcare to all, regardless of one 's ability to pay. Patients who meet the criteria of its charity care policy receive services without charge or at amounts less than its established rates. The criteria f or charity care consider the household income in relation to the federal poverty guidelines. The Corporation provides services at no charge for patients with adjusted gross income equal to or less than 200% of the federal poverty guidelines. For uninsured patients with adjusted gross income greater than 200% of the federal poverty guidelines, a sliding scale discount is applied. Income and asset information obtained from patient credit reporting data are used to determine patients ' ability to pay. The Corporation maintains records to identify and monitor the level of charity care it furnished under its charity care policy. Upper Chesapeake Medical Center, Inc. 52-1253920104 5/17/2021 1:10:02 PMUniversity of Maryland Medical System Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) (In Thousands) 2005 -3486109 20 (1) Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) Due to the complexity of the eligibility process, the Corpo ration provides eligibility services to patients free of charge to assist in the qualification process. These eligibility services include, but are not limited to, the following: Financial assistance brochures and other information are posted at each point of service. When patients have questions or concerns, they are encouraged to call a toll -free number to reach customer service representatives during the business day. Financial assistance programs are published on the Corporation' s Web site and included on the statements provided to patients. The Corporation offers assistance to patients in completing the applications for Medicaid or other government payment assistance programs, or applying for care under the Corporation 's charity care policy, if applicable. The Corporation also employs an external firm to assist in the eligibility process. Any patient, whether covered by insurance or not, may meet with a UMMS representative and receive financial counseling from UMMS ' dedicated financial assistance unit. The Corporation recognizes that a large number of uninsured and insured patients meet the charity care guidelines but do not respond to the Corporation' s attempts to obtain necessary financial information. In these instances, the Corporation uses credit re porting data to properly classify these unpaid balances as charity care as opposed to bad debt expense. Utilization of income and asset information and credit reporting data indicate the vast majority of amounts reported as uncollectible (implicit price co ncessions) represent amounts due from patients that would otherwise qualify for charity benefits but do not respond to the Corporation' s attempts to obtain the necessary financial information. In these cases, reasonable collection efforts are pursued, but yield few collections. Amounts determined to meet the criteria under the charity care policy or determined to be uncollectible from patients are reported as reductions to net patient service revenue. The amounts reported as charity care represent the cost of rendering such services. Costs incurred are estimated based on the cost -to-charge ratio for each hospital and applied to charity care charges. The Corporation estimates the total direct and indirect costs to provide charity care were $48,254 and $48,821 for the years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Upper Chesapeake Medical Center, Inc. 52-1253920105 5/17/2021 1:10:02 PMUniversity of Maryland Medical System Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) (In Thousands) 2005 -3486109 21 (1) Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) (p) Nonoperating Income and Expenses, Net Other activities that are only indirectly related to the Corporation 's primary business of delivering healthcare services are recorded as nonoperating income and expenses, and include investment income, equity in the net income of joint ventures, general donations and fund- raising activities, inherent contributions, changes in f air value of investments, changes in fair value of undesignated interest rate swaps, and settlement payments on interest rate swaps that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment . Settlement payments on interest rate swaps were approximately $ 18,444 and $15,124 for the years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively , and are reported within other nonoperating losses, net. (q) Derivative Financial Instruments The Corporation records derivative and hedging activities on the consolidated balance sheets at their respective fair values. The Corporation utilizes derivative financial instruments to manage its interest rate risks associated with long -term tax -exempt debt. The Corporation does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. The Corporation 's specific goals are to (a) manage interest rate sensitivity by modifying the reprising or maturity characteristics of some of its tax -exempt debt, and (b) lower unrealized appreciation or depreciation in the market value of the Corporation' s fixed -rate tax -exempt debt when that market value is compared with the cost of the borrowed funds. The effect of this unrealized appreciation or depreciation in market value ; however, will generally be offset by the income or loss on the de rivative instruments that are linked to the debt. All derivative instruments are reported as other assets or interest rate swap liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets and measured at fair value. Currently, the Corporation is accounting for its inte rest rate swaps as economic hedges at fair value with changes in the fair value recognized in other nonoperating income and expenses.

Changes in net assets without donor restrictions that are exclu ded from the performance indicator, consistent with industry practice, include contributions of long- lived assets (including assets acquired using contributions, which, by donor restrictions, were to be used for the purpose of acquiring such assets), change s in the funded status of defined benefit pension plans , and other items that are required by generally accepted accounting principles to be reported separately. (s) Income Taxes The Corporation and most of its subsidiaries are not -for-profit corporations formed under the laws of the State of Maryland, organized for charitable purposes and recognized by the Internal Revenue Service as tax -exempt organizations under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (the Code) pursuant to Sectio n 501(a) of the Code. The effect of the taxable status of its for- profit subsidiaries is not material to the consolidated financial statements. The Corporation follows a threshold of more likely than not for recognition and derecognition of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Management does not believe that there are any unrecognized tax liabilities or benefits that should be recognized. (t) Donor -Restricted Gifts Unconditional promises to give cash and other assets to the Corporation are reported at fair value at the date the promise is received. Conditional promises to give and indications of intentions to give are reported at fair value at the date the promise becomes unconditional. Contributions are reported as net assets with donor restriction s if they are received with donor stipulations that limit the use of the donated assets. When a donor restriction is s atisfied, net assets with donor restrictions are reclassified as net assets without donor restrictions and reported in the consolidated statements of operations and changes in net assets as net assets released from restrictions. Such amounts are classified as other revenue or transfers and additions to property and equipment. Donor -restricted contributions whose restrictions are met within the same year as received are reported as unrestricted contributions on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.

An allowance for uncollectible contributions receivable is provided based upon management 's judgment including such factors as prior collection history, type of contributions, and nature of fund- raising activity. (u) Fair Value Measurements The following methods and assumptions were used by the Corporation in estimating the fair value of its financial instruments: Cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, assets lim ited as to use, investments, trade accounts payable, accrued payroll and benefits, other accrued expenses, and advances from third -party payors - The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets approximate the related fair values. Pension plan assets - The Corporation applies Ac counting Standards Update (ASU) 2009- 12, Fair Value Meas urements and Disclosures (Topic 820): Investments in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset per Share (or Its Equivalent) , to its pension plan assets. The gu idance permits, as a practical expedient, fair value of investments within its scope to be estimated using the net asset value (NAV) or its equivalent. The alternative inve stments classified within the fair value hierarchy have been recorded using the NAV. The Corporation discloses its financial assets, financial liabilities , and fair value measurements of nonfinancial items according to the fair value hierarchy required by generally accepted accounting principles that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest pr iority to unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets for identic al assets or liabilities ( Level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority to measurements involving signifi cant unobservable inputs ( Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows: Level 1 inputs are quoted market prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Corporation has the ability to access at the measurement date. Upper Chesapeake Medical Center, Inc. 52-1253920108 5/17/2021 1:10:02 PMUniversity of Maryland Medical System Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) (In Thousands) 2005 -3486109 24 (1) Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted marke t prices including within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. If the asset or liability has a specif ied (contractual) term, a Level 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. Assets and liabilities classified as Level 1 are va lued using unadjusted quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. The Corporation uses techniques consistent with the market approach and the income approach for me asuring fair value of its Level 2 and Level 3 assets and liabilities. The market approach is a valuation technique that uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. The income approach generally converts future amounts (cash flo ws or earnings) to a single present value amount (discounted). The level in the fair value hierarchy within which a fair value measurement in its entirety falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. As of June 30, 2020, and 2019, the Level 2 assets and liabilities listed in the fair value hierarchy tables presented in Notes 3 and 11 utilize the following valuation techniques and inputs: Cash Equivalents The fair value of investments in cash equivalent securities, with maturities within three months of the date of purchase, is determined using techniques that are consistent with the market approach. Significant observable inputs include reported trades and observable broker -dealer quotes. U.S. Government and Agency Securities The fair value of investments in U.S. government, state, and municipal obligations is primarily determined using techniques consistent with the income approach. Significant observable inputs to the income approach include data points for benchmark constant maturity curves and spreads.

Significant observable inputs include benchmark yields, reported trades, observable broker -dealer quotes, issuer spreads, and security specific characteristics, such as early redemption options. The fair value of collateralized corporate obligations is primarily determined using techniques consistent with the income approach, such as a discounted cash flow model. Significant observable inputs include prepayment speeds and spreads, benchmark yield curves, volatility measures, and quotes. Derivative Liabilities The fair value of derivative contracts is primarily determined using techniques consistent wit h the market approach. Derivative contracts include interest rate, credit default, and total return swaps. Significant observable inputs to valuation models include interest rates, treasury yields, volatilities, credit spreads, maturity , and recovery rates . (v) Commitments and Contingencies Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation, fines, penalties, and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably es timated. Legal costs incurred in connection with loss contingencies are expensed as incurred. (w) Going Concern Management evaluates whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Corporation' s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the financial statements are issued. As of the date of this report, there are no conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the Corporation 's ability to continue as a going c oncern.

Actual results could differ from those estimates. (y) New Accounting Pronouncements The Corporation adopted ASU 2016- 02, Leases (ASC Topic 842) , on July 1, 2019. ASC Topic 842 required the recognition of right -of-use assets (ROU) and lease liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and the disclosure of qualitative and quantitative information about leasing arrangements. The guidance was ad opted using a modified retrospective approach without restating prior comparative periods. The Corporation elected to utilize the transition practical expedient to not reassess whether a contract is or contains a lease, the lease classification and initial direct costs. Additionally, the Corporation also elected the practical expedient which allows the System to treat the lease and non -lease components of a contract as a single component and account for as a lease. The Corporation recognized operating ROU a ssets and corresponding operating lease liabilities of approximately $99,000 in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at July 1, 2019. See further discussion in Note 6. Effective January 1, 2019, the Corporation adopted ASU 2016- 18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 320): Restricted Cash, which requires that the statement of cash flows explain the change during the period in total cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents. Therefore, amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents should be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning -of-period and end- of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. See further discussion in Note 3.

Nota bly, Governor Hogan issued an executive order on March 16, 2020 restricting elective procedures. As a result, volume in the months of March and April declined significantly and based on the State of Maryland' s phased resumption of certain elective procedur es in May and June, volumes increased compared to April 2020. In response to COVID -19, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act, was signed into law on March 27, 2020. The CARES Act authorizes funding to hospitals and other healthcare providers to be distributed through the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund (Relief Fund). Payments from the Relief Fund are to be used to prevent, prepare for, and respond to coronavirus, and shall reimburse the recipient for health care rela ted expenses or lost revenues attributable to coronavirus and not required to be repaid, provided the recipients attest to and comply with the terms and conditions. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services ' distributions from the Relief Fund includ e general distribution and targeted distributions to support hospitals in high impact areas and rural providers. For the year ended June 30, 2020, the Corporation received and recognized as other operating revenue, approximately $ 199,600 in relief funding. Amounts recognized as revenue could change in the future based on evolving compliance guidance provided by HHS, among other factors, as discussed further in Note 21. In April 2020, the Corporation requested Medicare advanced payments under the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' Accelerated and Advanced Payment Program designed to increase cash flow to Medicare providers and suppliers impacted by COVID -19. The Medicare advanced payment program allows eligible health care facilities to request up to six months of advance Medicare payments for acute care hospitals or up to three months of advance Medicare payments for other health care providers. The Corporation received approximately $641,300 of advanced payments with repayment to occur based upon the terms and conditions of the program . Amounts received represent contract liabilities under Topic 606 and are recorded in advances from third party payors within the accompanying co nsolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2020.

As MMCIP is not an insurance provider, transactions with MMCIP are recorded under the deposit method of accounting. Accordingly, the Corporation accounts for its participation in MMCIP by carrying limited -use assets representing the amount of funds contributed to MMCIP and recording a liability for claims, which is included in other current and other long- term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

Operating leases are included in other assets, other current liabilities, and other long -term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. Finance leases are included in pro perty, plant and equipment, other current liabilities, and other long -term liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

The ROU asset is derived from the lease liability and also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives and initial direct costs incur red. Certain lease agreements for real estate include payments based on actual common area maintenance expenses and others include rental payments adjusted periodically for inflation. These variable lease payments are recognized in other operating expenses, net, but are not included in the right- of-use asset or liability balances. Lease agreements may include one or more renewal options which are at the Corporation' s sole discretion. The Co rporation does not consider the renewal options to be reasonably lik ely to be exercised, therefore they are not included in ROU assets and lease liabilities. Lease expense for minimum lease payments is recognized on a straight - line basis over the lease term for operating leases. In accordance with ASC 842, the Corporation has elected to not recognize ROU assets and lease liabilities for short- term leases with a lease term of 12 months or less. The Corporation recognizes the lease payments associated with its short -term leases as an expense on a straight -line basis over the lease term. Variable lease payments associated with these leases are recognized and presented in the same manner as all other leases.

The reimbursement obligations with respect to the letters of credit are evidenced and secured by the respective bonds. To provide liquidity support for the timely payment of any bonds that are not successfully remarketed, the Corporation has entered into letter- of-credit agreements with three banking institutions. These agreements have terms that expire in 2021 through 2022. If the bonds are not successfully remarketed, the Corporation is required to pay an interest rate specified in the letter -of-credit agreement, and the principal repayment of bonds may be accelerated to require repayment i n periods ranging from 20 to 60 months from the date of the failed remarketing. The Corporation has reflected the amount of its long- term debt that is subject to these short- term remarketing arrangements as a separate component of current liabilities in its consolidated balance sheets. In the event that bonds are not remarketed, the Corporation maintains available letters of credit and has the ability to access other sources to ob tain the necessary liquidity to comply with accelerated repayment terms. All variable rate demand bonds were successfully remarketed as of June 30, 2020 and 2019.

Investments are diversified across classes, sectors, and manager style to minimize the risk of loss. The Corporation uses investment managers specializing in each asset category, and regularly monitors performance and compliance wit h investment guidelines. In developing the expected long- term rate of return on assets assumption, the Corporation considers the current level of expected returns on risk -free investments, the historical level of the risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested, and the expectations for future returns of each asset class. The expected return for each asset class is then weighted based on the target allocation to develop the expected long- term rate of return on asse ts assumption for the portfolio. The Corporation 's pension plans ' target allocation and weighted average asset allocations at the measurement date of June 30, 2020 and 2019, by asset category, are as follows: Target Percentage of Plan Assets as of June 30 Asset Category Allocation 2020 2019 Cash and cash equivalents 0-10% 8% 4% Fixed income securities 20-40 29 28 Equity securities 30-50 38 41 Global assets allocation 10-20 16 17 Hedge funds 5-15 9 10 100% 100% Upper Chesapeake Medical Center, Inc. 52-1253920140 5/17/2021 1:10:02 PMUniversity of Maryland Medical System Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) (In Thousands) 2005 -3486109 56 (11) Retirement Plans (continued) Equity and fixed income securities include investments in hedge fund of funds that are categorized in accordance with each fund 's respective investment holdings.

Net assets associated with endowment funds are classified and reported based on the existence or absence of donor -imposed restrictions. (a) Interpretation of Relevant Law The Corporation has interpreted the Maryland Uniform Prudent Management of Institutional Funds Act (MUPMIFA) as requiring the preservation of the fair value of the original gift as of the gift date of the donor -restricted endowment funds absent explicit donor stipulations to the contrary. As a result of this interpretation, the Corporation classifies as perman ently restricted net assets (a) the original value of gifts donated to the permanent endowment, (b) the original value of subsequent gifts to t he permanent endowment, and (c) accumulations to the permanent endowment made in accordance with the direc tion of the applicable donor gift instrument at the time the accumulation is added to the fund. The remaining portion of the donor -restricted endowment fund are classified in net assets with donor restrictions until those amounts are appropriated for expenditure by the organization in a manner consistent with the standard of prudence prescribed by MUPMIFA. In accordance with MUPMIFA, the Corporation considers the following factors in making a determination to appropriate or accumulate donor- restricted endow ment funds: 1. The duration and preservation of the fund 2. The purposes of the Corporation and the donor -restricted endowment fund 3. General economic conditions Upper Chesapeake Medical Center, Inc. 52-1253920144 5/17/2021 1:10:02 PMUniversity of Maryland Medical System Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) (In Thousands) 2005 -3486109 60 (12) Net Assets with Donor Restrictions (continued) 4. The possible effect of inflation and deflation 5. The expected total return from income and the appreciation of investments 6. Other resources of the Corporation 7. The investment policies of the Corporation. Endowment net asse ts are as follows: Without Donor Restrictions With Donor Restrictions Total June 30, 2020 Donor -restricted endowment funds $ 43 $ 67,165 $ 67,208 June 30, 2019 Donor -restricted endowment funds $ 39 $ 65,433 $ 65,472 Donor restricted endowment funds within net assets with donor restrictions whose use is restricted in perpetuity were $50,243 and $48,826 as of June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Funds with Deficiencies From time to time, the fair value of assets associ ated with individual donor -restricted endowment funds may fall below the level that the donor or MUPMIFA requires the Corporation to retain as a fund of perpetual duration. The Corporation does not have any donor -restricted endowment funds that are below the level that the donor or MUPMIFA requires. Upper Chesapeake Medical Center, Inc. 52-1253920145 5/17/2021 1:10:02 PMUniversity of Maryland Medical System Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) (In Thousands) 2005 -3486109 61 (12) Net Assets with Donor Restrictions (continued) Investment Strategies The Corporation has adopted policies for corporate investments, including endowment assets that seek to maximize risk -adjusted returns with preservation of principal. Endowment assets include those assets of donor -restricted funds that the Corporation must hold in perpetuity or for a donor -specified period(s).The endowment assets are invested in a manner that is intended to hold a mix of investment assets designed to meet the objectives of the account. The Corporation expects its endowment funds, over time, to provide an average rate of return that generates earnings to achieve the endowment purpose. To satisfy its long- term rate -of-return objectives, the Corporation relies on a total return strategy in which investment returns are achieved through both capital appreciation (realized and unrealized) and current yield (interest and dividends). The Corporation employs a diversified asset allocation structure to achieve its long- term return objectives within prudent risk constraints. The Corporation monitors the endowment funds ' returns and appropriates average returns for use. In establishing this practice, the Corporation considered the long- term expected return on its endowment. This is consistent with the Corporation' s objective to maintain the purchasing power of the endowme nt assets held in perpetuity or for a specified term , as well as to provide additional real growth through new gifts and investment return. (13) Economic and Beneficial Interests in the Net Assets of Related Organizations The Corporation is supported by se veral related organizations that were formed to raise funds on behalf of the Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries.

Upper Chesapeake Medical Center, Inc. 52-1253920152 5/17/2021 1:10:02 PMUniversity of Maryland Medical System Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) (In Thousands) 2005 -3486109 68 (18) Business and Credit Concentrations The Corporation provides healthcare services through its inpatient and outpatient care facilities located in the State of Maryland. The Corporation generally does not require collateral or other security in extending credit; however, it routinely obtains assignment of (or is otherwise entitled to receive) patien ts' benefits receivable under their health insurance programs, plans , or policies (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid, Blue Cross, workers' compensation, health maintenance organizations (HMOs) , and commercial insurance policies). The Corporation maintains cash acco unts with highly rated financial institutions, which generally exceed federally insured limits. The Corporation has not experienced any losses from maintaining cash accounts in excess of federally insured limits, and as such, management does not believe th e Corporation is subject to any significant credit risks related to this practice. The Corporation had receivables from patients and third -party payors as follows at June 30, 2020: Medicare 27% Medicaid 32 Commercial insurance and HMOs 20 Blue Cross 14 Self-pay and others 7 100% The Corporation recorded net patient service revenues from patients and third- party payors as follows: Year Ended June 30 2020 2019 Medicare 37% 37% Medicaid 24 24 Commercial insurance and HMOs 24 24 Blue Cross 10 10 Self-pay and others 5 5 100% 100% Upper Chesapeake Medical Center, Inc. 52-1253920153 5/17/2021 1:10:02 PMUniversity of Maryland Medical System Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) (In Thousands) 2005 -3486109 69 (19) Certain Significant Risks and Uncertainties The Corporation provides general acute healthcare services in the state of Maryland. The Corporation and other healthcare providers in Maryland are subject to certain inherent risks, including the following: Dependence on revenues derived from reimbursement by the federal Medicare and state Medicaid programs; Regulation of hospital rates by the State of Maryland Health Services Cost Review Commission; Government regulation, government budgetary constraints , and proposed legislative and regulatory changes; and Lawsuits alleging malpractice and related claims. Such inherent risks require the use of certain management estimates in the preparation of the Corporation 's consolidated financial statements, and it is reasonably possible that a change in such estimates may occur. The Medicare and state Medicaid reimbursement programs represent a substantial portion of the Corporation 's revenues, and the Corporati on's operations are subject to a variety of other federal, state, and local regulatory requirements. Failure to maintain required regulatory approvals and licenses and/or changes in such regulatory requirements could have a significant adverse effect on the Corporation. Changes in federal and state reimbursement funding mechanisms and related government budgetary constraints could have a significant adverse effect on the Corporation. The healthcare industry is subject to numerous laws and regulations from f ederal, state, and local governments. The Corporation' s compliance with these laws and regulations can be subject to periodic governmental review and interpretation, which can result in regulatory action unknown or unasserted at this time. Management is aw are of certain asserted and unasserted legal claims and regulatory matters arising in the ordinary course of business, none of which, in the opinion of management, are expected to result in losses in excess of insurance limits or have a materially adverse effect on the Corporation' s financial position.

Recent federal initiatives have prompted a national review of federally funded healthcare programs. In addition, the federal government and many states have implemented programs to audit and recover potential overpayments to providers from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The Corporation has implemented a compliance program to monitor conformance with applicable laws and regulations, but the possibility of future government review and enforcement a ction exists. (20) Maryland Health Services Cost Review Commission Effective July 1, 2013, the Health System and the Health Services Cost Review Commission (HSCRC) agreed to implement the Global Budget Revenue (GBR) methodology for the following hospitals: Medical Center, ROI, UM Midtown, UM Baltimore Washington, UM Charles Regional, UM St. Joseph, UM Memorial , UM Dorchester, UM Chester River, Shore Emergency Center, UM Upper Chesapeake, UM Harford Memorial , UM Prince George' s, and UM Laurel . The agreements will continue each year and on July 1 of each year thereafter ; the agreements wil l renew for a one-year period unless it is canceled by the HSCRC or by the Corporation. The agreements were in place for the years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019. The GBR model is a revenue constraint and quality improvement system designed by the HSCRC to provide hospitals with strong financial incentives to manage their resources efficiently and effectively in order to slow the rate of increase in healthcare costs and improve healthcare delivery processes and outcomes. The GBR model is consistent with the C orporation' s mission to provide the highest value of care possible to its patients and the communities it serves. The GBR agreements establish a prospective, fixed revenue base \" GBR cap \" for the upcoming year. This includes both inpatient and outpatient re gulated services. Under GBR, a hospital 's revenue for all HSCRC regulated services is predetermined for the upcoming year, regardless of changes in volume, service mix intensity, or mix of inpatient or outpatient services that occurred during the year. The GBR agreement allows the Corporation to adjust unit rates, within certain limits, to achieve the overall revenue base for the Corporation at year -end. Any overcharge or undercharge versus the GBR cap is prospectively subtracted from the subsequent year 's GBR cap. Although the GBR cap is fixed each year, it does not adjust for changes in volume or service mix. The GBR cap is also adjusted annually for inflation, and for changes in payor mix and uncompensated care. The Corporation will receive an annual adjustment to its cap for the change Upper Chesapeake Medical Center, Inc. 52-1253920155 5/17/2021 1:10:02 PMUniversity of Maryland Medical System Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) (In Thousands) 2005 -3486109 71 (20) Maryland Health Services Cost Review Commission (continued) in population in the Corporation' s service areas. GBR is designed to encourage hospitals to operate efficiently by reducing excess utilization and managing patients in the appropriate care delivery setting. The HSCRC also may impose various other revenue adjustments , which could be signif icant in the future.

On October 1, 2020, a new law was signed that included mo difications to the CMS Accelerated and Advance Payment Program. These modifications included an extension to the previous terms discussed within Note 2. The changes in payments terms are considered a non -recognized subsequent event in accordance with ASC 855. On October 22, 2020, HHS released additional reporting requirements for health care entities that received distributions from the Provider Relief Fund. The Post -Payment Notice of Reporting Requirements (the Notice) supplements the previous notice issue d on July 20, 2020, and amended on August 14, 2020 and September 19, 2020. The Corporation considered the effects of the changes included in the Notice and concluded these changes represent non -recognized ( i.e., Type II) subsequent events in accordance wit h ASC 855, Subsequent Events , since the reporting requirements included in the Notice provide evidence about conditions that did not exist at the balance sheet date but instead are conditions that arose after that date but before financial Upper Chesapeake Medical Center, Inc. 52-1253920156 5/17/2021 1:10:02 PMUniversity of Maryland Medical System Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) (In Thousands) 2005 -3486109 72 (21) Subsequent Events (continued) statements were issued.
