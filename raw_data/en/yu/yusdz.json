Comprehensive searc hes conducted on four databases to identify relevant studies published between January 1996 and February 2016 yielded 2855 articles . 19 RCTs (2790 patients) that fulfilled i nclusion criteria were included in the review. A systematic review with meta -analys is was performed on 18 studies using a random -effects model. Quality of the evidence was determined by the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing ROB. Subgroup analyses were conducted and funnel plots used to examine publication bias. The mean red uction in HbA1c in participants using an mHealth intervention involving clinical feedback compared with a control was 0.4 5% (95% CI -0.66, -0.24) with a moderate quality of evidence. Data were heterogeneous (I2 = 66%). Subgroup analysis indicated that mHea lth interventions are more effective for type 2 diabetes than for type 1 diabetes , and studies of type 2 diabetes with shorter follow -up yielded larger effect sizes compared to studies with six months or more of follow -up. Reductions in HbA1c were found to be more pronounced in interventions that used automatic versus manual data entry. Studies with weekly provider feedback were found to have the largest effect on HbA1c but feedback on as needed basis also saw a significant effect. There was insufficient ev idence to determine whether mHealth viii SUMMARY (continued) interventions based on behavioral change theories are more effective. Visual inspection of funnel plots suggested a publication bias. These findings are consistent with clinically relevant improvements and demonstrate that mHealth interventions may be an effective strategy to he lp control HbA1c, particularly with respect to type 2 diabetics. While the functionality and use of this technology n eeds to be standardized, mHealth represents a promising approach to the self -management of diabetes. 1 I. INTRODUCTION A. Statement of the Problem Diabetes mellitus is a chronic medical condition that occurs when the pancreas does not produce insulin or w hen the body cannot use the insulin it produces resulting in blood glucose levels that are higher than normal (hyperglycemia) .1 Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas that helps glucose in the bloodstream enter body cells where it is transformed into energy. 2 Hyperglycemia is a common feature of poorly controlled diabetes and over time leads to significant damage to many of the body's organs, especially the nerves and small blood vessels .3 This forms the basis of the complications of diabetes including an increased risk of stroke and heart disease, neuropathy (nerve damage), foot ulcers, increased risk of lower extremity amputation, blindness, and kidney failure .2, 3 People with type 1 diabetes mellitus, previously known as insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) or juvenile -onset diabetes, produce little to no insulin and require insulin injections to control the level of glucose in their blood. 2, 4 Type 1 diabetes mellitus is most frequently diagnosed in children and young adults and accounts for 5% of all diagnosed cases of diabetes.1, 4 Type 2 diabetes mellitus, once known as non -insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) or adult -onset diabetes, accounts fo r 90% of all cases of diabetes and is characterized by the body's ineffective use of insulin. 2, 3 This form of the disease , which is largely the result of excess body weight and inactivity , can be diagnosed at any age .3 Initial management of the condition involves diet and exercise but over time most people will require oral drugs and/or insulin.2 2 According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the number of people with diabetes has quadrupled from 108 million in 1980 to 422 million in 201 4; that number is projected to increase to 642 million by 2040.2, 3 The prevalence in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes has been rising rapidly in middle - to low -income countries and highlights the effects of rapid urbanization, sedentary lifestyles, and inc reasing obesity.3, 5 In the U.S., there are more than 29 million people with diabetes with another 89 million living with pre -diabetes, a serious condition that increases a person's risk of developing type 2 diabetes.1 The International Diabetes Federation (IDF) estimates that there were five million deaths worldwide due to diabetes in 2015 and WHO projects that diabetes will be the 7th leading cause of death worldwide in 2030.2, 3 Diabetes is currently the 7th leading cause of death in the U.S.6 Globally, the direct annual cost of diabetes has reached $825 billion, with China ($170 billion), the U.S. ($105 billion), India ($73 billion), and Japan ($37 billion) having the highest costs.7, 8 Costs related to diabetes increase over time and with dis ease severity, indicating that efforts directed towards prevention and effective disease management may be particularly worthwhile.8 Primary care physicians are often the main providers of diabetes care, particularly in resource -limited countries , since they are the main source of general medical care.9 Approximately 90% of the diabetic patients in the U.S. are treated by primary care physicians.10 Patients treated by endocrinologists are either newly diagnosed type 1 diabetics or type 2 diabetics who are having difficulty controlling their blood glucose or experiencing complications.11 3 Improved blood glucose control as part of a self -management strategy for type 1 and type 2 diabetics has been shown to reduce diabetes -related complications and death.5 Successful diabetes self-management can be a challenge since patients may have difficulty initiating and sustaining behavioral changes that involve adopting new approaches to diet, physical activity, and medication compliance.12, 13 Helping patients reconc ile these issues can be time -consuming and labor -intensive for healthcare providers ; however , mobile health holds the promise of innovative solutions that can improve the management of diabetes. 13, 14 B. Potential Role of mHealth in the Self-Management of Diabetes Mobile health, or mHealth, has been defined as the use of mobile computing and communication technologies for health services and information.15, 16 Mobile technologies include cellphones/smartphones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), handheld tablets, and other wireless devices.17, 18 These technologies offer new ways to a pproach remote patient monitoring and delivery of clinical advice , namely through the use of text messages (SMS), mobile phone applications (\"apps\"), and multiple me dia (MMS) interventions.17, 18 It is unlikely that traditional models of diabetes care , such as those consisting of face -to-face clinic appointments and 'diabetes logbooks' , can be sustained given the rising prevalence of diabetes and increasingly limited health resources .19 However, the estimated 5 billion mobile phones worldwide make a powerful platform that can be leveraged to improve diabetes care and reduce costs.19, 20 The popularity of mobile phones and advances in consumer mobile technology make mHealth attractive for chronic disease management, particularly for the self -monitoring of 4 blood glucose (SMBG) in diabetes.20, 21 Regular SMBG is associated with improved metabolic control and a decrease in glycolated Hb (HbA1c).21, 22, 23 mHealth can f acilitate SMBG by downloading, aggregating, and identifying blood glucose data patterns for the patient's healthcare provider (HCP) , who can provide timely clinical feedback based on the transmitted data and intervene in the event of worsening blood gluco se control, averting further deterioration in the patient's condition. People carry their mobile phones with them wherever they go which allows for temporal synchronization of the transmission of data with the delivery of clinical feedback such that f eedback can be delivered within the relevant context where it can have maximum impact.17 For example, those with type 1 diabetes can receive timely advice regarding insulin adjustment during an episode of hyperglycemia. mHealth offers potential economies of scale since it is relatively easy to deliver low -cost interventions to a large population.17 For example, a diabetes app can be quickly downloaded for free or text messages can be delivered to large numbers of people at low cost.17 Mobile technology is especially promising for developing countries who can take advantage of the robust mobile market to provide adequate healthcare to underprivileged communities.24 There is a strong global interest in developing mHealth interventions as evidenced by the 20 09 WHO survey that reported 83% of the 112 participating member countries had at least one mHealth intervention in place.16 The growing interest in the potential impact of mobile technology -based interventions to improve the management of diabetes has led to an increasing number of published studies investigating their effectiveness. Healthcare policy makers, providers, patients, and researchers interested in the use of mHealth interventions for diabetes management are confronted with 5 unmanageable amounts of data from numerous clinical trials and observational studies; they need systematic reviews to efficiently integrate existing information and provide data for rational decision making.25 A current, comprehensive systematic review of mHealth interventions that adheres to available methodological guidelines is lacking and can provide a valuable overview of the existing evidence.17 Such a review can be used to support evidence - based health policy and ensure that the mHealth interventions used for diabetic pa tients are based upon the best available empirical data. C. Objectives of this Review This systematic review aims to assess the effects of mHealth interventions on HbA1c in diabetes self -management. Secondary objectives include the assessment of medication adherence, compliance with the intervention, patient satisfaction with the interventi on, quality of life, and the cost effectiveness of the intervention. 6 II. REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE A. Methodological Quality of Prior Systematic Reviews Systematic reviews (SRs) are an extremely efficient method of summarizing the findings from a body of evidence with minimal bias, providing reliable findings that can inform evidence - based decision making.18,26 However, available SRs vary in quality and can yield flawed findings as a result of methodological issues and risk of bias, compromising th eir utility for decision making.18 A recent overview of SRs18 identified five SRs 27-31 with an explicit focus on the effectiveness of mHealth interventions for glycemic control in diabetes and all were found to have important methodological limitations a ccording to AMSTAR criteria. None were found to be of high quality (a score of 8 or more on the 11 -point AMSTAR scale); two of the five SRs were of moderate quality, scoring between 4 and 7 points.30, 31 The remaining three SRs were of low quality, scoring less than 4 points.27-29 As shown in Table I, all of the SRs performed poorly in several domains. None of the five SRs provided evidence of a published a priori protocol or provided a list of excluded studies with reasons for exclusion of each study (Q1, Q5). Three of the five reviews did not provide details regarding the number of reviewers involved in data extraction, the selection of studies, or the procedure for resolving disagreements, which raises concerns about the potential subjectivity of decisions at these stages (Q2).18, 32 The majority (80%) did not search the grey literature (e.g. dissertations or conference proceedings) and restricted their search t o only English articles which increases the risk of publication and language bias (Q4). All five SRs failed to assess the sources of support or conflict of interest in their included studies (Q11). 7 TABLE I .

B. Health Behavior Theoretical Frameworks Existing health behavior theories, such as the Health Belief and Self -Efficacy Models described below, have served as the basis for web and computer health interventions and have informed how they can be tailored to an individual's baseline status .33 However, mHealth interventions allow individuals to interact with technolo gy over time, generating complex data that has the potential to deliver health behavior interventions not only at baseline but in the context of changing behaviors and environmental contexts .33,34 While mHealth intervention development stands to benefit fr om a greater application of health behavior theories , these theories need to evolve to better guide the dynamic process of frequent iterative adjustments made during the course of these interventions .33, 35 Current theories have been criticized as 8 being static and linear, rendering them incapable of guiding the dynamic, adaptive interactions that are possible with mobile interventions .33, 36 1. Health Belief Model The Health Belief Model (HBM), one of the first theories of health behavior and one of the most widely applied, was developed in the 1950s to explain the adoption of health behaviors in the US .37 This model theorizes that people's beliefs about whether they are at risk for a disease or health problem, and their perceptions of the benefits of taking action to avoid it, influence their readiness to take action .38 The HBM has been applied most often to health concerns that are prevention -related or asymptomatic where beliefs are at least as import ant as overt symptoms. The HBM posits that six key constructs impact health behaviors37, 39: 1. Perceived susceptibility: A person's opinion regarding their chances of developing a condition. 2. Perceived severity: A person's opinion regarding the seriou sness of a specific condition and its consequences. 3. Perceived benefits: The person's belief that a particular course of action would reduce the susceptibility or severity or lead to other positive outcomes. 4. Perceived barriers: The impediments to ado pting a health -related behavior. 9 5. Cues to action: These can be either internal or external, ranging from experiencing symptoms of an illness to exposure to a media campaign or education about a disease, that compel a person to act. 6. Self-efficacy : An individual's judgement of their capabilities to organize and execute courses of action despite considered barriers. The HBM provides a means to better understand the attitudes, behaviors, and educational needs of populations, making it a practical tool to develop effective interventions .40 MHealth can utilize this model to effect changes in patients' HBM constructs, leading to improved self -care behavior. Consider an mHealth intervention that acts as an external cue by providing educational information a bout diabetic foot care which increases the perceived susceptibility of patients to disease -related complications; this information can result in better foot care rendered by the patients themselves .40 2. Self-Efficacy Model Self-efficacy is a person's belief that he or she is capable of performing a particular task successfully; it can be thought of as a kind of self -confidence .41, 42 One's sense of self efficacy can play a major role in how one approaches goals, tasks, and challenges .41 For example, we rarely attempt a task if we expect to be unsuccessful .42 The self -efficacy model has three dimensions43 : 1. Magnitude: How difficult a person finds it to adopt a specific behavior. 2. Strength: How certain a person feels about performing a sp ecific task. 10 3. Generality: The extent to which self -efficacy is generalized; it can be limited to either a specific behavioral situation or it can be generalized across many situations. Consider a diabetic patient with a low sense of self -efficacy in d iabetes management behavior who avoids difficult tasks such as monitoring BG levels which he views as a personal threat. In contrast, another diabetic patient with a high sense of self -efficacy approaches the task of BG monitoring as a challenge to be mast ered rather than something to be avoided .43 A well -designed mHealth intervention can increase a patient's self -efficacy by increasing his or her ability to successfully approach difficult self -care tasks. An app with useful interactive self -management stra tegies and feedback can result in a more engaged patient, improved BG control, and enhanced patient self -efficacy .44 C. Summary The HBM and self -efficacy model are two health behavior theories that have the potential to inform mHealth development , but in their present form are inadequate since these interventions are becoming increasingly sophisticated .33 The adoption of more dynamic models is needed, however this does not require discarding the current theories . These theories should evolve to better capture the intra -individual dynamics of mHealth interventions .33 11 III. METHODS A. Eligibility Criteria for Including Studies in this Review 1. Types of studies This review includes parallel, cluster, and cross -over randomized controlled trials (RCTs) only. Eligible for inclusion are studies reported as full -text and those published as abstract only. 2. Participants Participants were patients diagnosed with e ither type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus, regardless of age, sex, ethnicity, or duration of disease. 3. Intervention MHealth interventions included in this review involved the use of cellular phones, smartphones, personal digital assistants, tablets, a nd/or other mobile devices that enabled patient monitoring and the delivery of clinical feedback through a wide range of functions and applications (e.g. text messaging, internet, and email) with the aim of improving self-care practices, lifestyle modifica tions, and adherence to treatment plans .45 One-way communication interventions, such as those that involved \"push - forward\" text messages from the clinician to the patient for either educational or motivational purposes were excluded. Other excluded interventions were those that did not involve tran smission of disease -related data via a mobile device from the patient to the clinician and 12 those that were exclusively focused on peer -to-peer support. Studies that used Skype, interactive voice systems, mixed interventions, home -based monitoring, use of modems or laptops, and provider -to-provider communications were also excluded. 4. Comparison The comparison group included standard diabetes care as well as other types of non-mobile technology -based interventions. B. Types of Outcomes Measures 1. Primary Outcome The primary outcome assessed in this systematic review was the mean difference in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c, %) between the control and intervention groups pre - and post -intervention. 2. Secondary Outcomes Secondary outcomes include m edication adherence, patient compliance with the intervention, patient satisfaction with the intervention, quality of life, and cost effectiveness of the intervention. C. Search Methods for Identification of Studies 1. Electronic Searches Comprehensive searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and CINAHL for articles published between January 1996 to February 2016 were performed using a 13 combination of MeSH terms, keywords, and clinical query filters to identify all relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The search strategies used a comprehensive list of MeSH terms including \"diabetes Detailed search strategies for each database search can be found in Appendix A. 2. Searching other Sources Relevant journals, conference proceedings, and abstracts were hand searched for additional references. Reference lists of identified trials were reviewed to identify any relevant studies th at were not captured by the original search strategy. Authors of primary studies were contacted to identify additional relevant published or unpublished studies .46 D. Selection of Studies The search strategies were conducted and all retrieved references were imported to a specialized systematic review management software, namely EPPI -Reviewer 4 (http://eppi.ioe.ac.uk/cms/, University of London, UK). Duplicate studies were automatically identified and merged using the EPPI software. To assess studies for inclusion, a single review author (RK) independently screened the title and abstract of every record retrieved. The full text of all potentially relevant articles was independently assessed by two reviewers. Both reviewers evaluated the inclusion of each paper based on the reported inclusion criteria; reasons for exclusion were recorded. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion .26 14 E. Data Extraction RK and SK developed and piloted an electronic data extraction form and spreadsheet. Data were extracted by one reviewer (RK) and verified for accuracy by the second reviewer (SK). Study designs were classified as parallel, cluster, or cross -over randomized controlled trials. Extracted data included the study population (Type 1 or Type 2 DM), study setting, sample size, study duration, age range, gender, race, description of the mHealth intervention, frequency of data transmission and feedback, mechanism of feedback delivery, unadjusted HbA1c data and standard deviations.30 Studies that reported unad justed HbA1c data were included in the meta -analysis.30 F. Risk of Bias Assessment Two review authors (R.K. and S.K.) independently assessed risk of bias (ROB) in the included studies using t he Cochrane Collaboration criteria outlined in Higgins and Green .26 Disagreements were resolved through discussion.46 The Cochrane ROB tool uses seven domains to address specific features of each study and recommends the explicit reporting of sequence generation; allocation concea lment; blinding of participants, personnel, and outcome assessors; incomplete outcome data; selective outcome reporting; and other sources of bias .26, 46, 47 Potential sources of bias in each of the seven domains were graded for each study as high, low, or unclear, following the guidelines of the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool. 26, 46 15 G. Quality of Evidence The quality of evidence in the included studies was determined by the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias.26 Results are reported in a standard Cochrane \"Risk of bias graph\" and \"Risk of bias summary\" table.26 H. Data Analysis and Synthesis The changes in HbA1c at follow -up were compared between intervention and control groups using a mean difference (MD). Mi ssing data was investigated by contacting the study authors. If there was no response, imputation of the missing SDs was performed using the Within Groups formula from the Cochrane Handbook26 or the study was not included in the meta -analysis . A meta -analysis of the MDs was Review Manager software, version 5.3 (http://community.cochrane.org/tools/review -production -tools/revman - 5/revman -5-download). The effect sizes of each study with 95% confidence intervals are repres ented graphically by RevMan forest plots.26, 48 This review assumed a random -effects model based on the assumption that there is a degree of clinical heterogeneity between studies.49 Statistical heterogeneity between studies was examined with the I2 stati stic.26, 49 16 IV. RESULTS A. Description of the Included Studies The literature search yielded 2855 citations after removal of duplicates (Figure 1). After completion of the screening process, 19 RCTs were identified as eligible for inclusion .50-68 (Table II). All studies employed mobile phone -based interventions with exception of a single study56 that used tablet computers. Most of the studies (n=13) were published in 2011 and after, with 5 published in 2014 alone. The duration of the interventions ranged from one to 12 months. The majority of RCTs (n=12) focused on type 2 diabetes and 5 RCTs targeted type 1 diabetes. The remaining RCTs (n=2) included studies of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. The majority (63%) of studies were conducted in primary settings, 16% were conducted in diabetes clinics, and 11% were conducted in tertiary hospitals. Four of the five studies which focused on type 1 diabetes were undertaken in Europe51-53, 64 and one in the USA .57 Of the 12 studies which focused on type 2 dia betics, five were conducted in Europe54, 58, 60, 61, 65 and five in the U.S.A.55, 56, 62, 63, 67 Of the remaining two studies, one was conducted in Africa66 and the other in Japan .68 17 Figure 1.

Population There is a total of 2790 patients from the 19 RCTs included in this review. Five RCTs51-53, 57, 64 involved 337 patients with type 1 diabetes and 12 RCTs54-56, 58, 60-63, 65-68 involved 2235 patients with type 2 diabetes. Two studies50, 59 involved both type 1 and type 2 diabetics (218 patients) but neither study specified the type of diabetes of the participants. The mean age across all studies was 48.43 years. The mean age of the type 1 patients in the five RCTs was 24.02 years and the mean age of the type 2 diabetics in the 12 RCTs was 57.04 years. The mean age of patients in the two studies involving both type 1 and type 2 diabetics was 57.75 years. C. Comparison Group s 17 of the 19 included studies compared an mHealth intervention to usual care. The remaining two studies52, 57 which focused on type 1 diabet es used a different type of non - mHealth comparator group. 1. Usual Care Participants randomized to usual care attended in -person clinic appointments for routine diabetes treatment. Holmen ( 58) reported that patients in this group received diabetes care per national guidelines. Three studies53, 62, 64 reported that participants in the usual care groups recorded their BG values in paper logbooks which were brought to clinic appointments for review. Baron ( 50) was a mixed study that included both type 1 and type 2 diabetics; the participants in the usual care group had one to two semi -annual appointments with a diabetes 21 educator to promote self -management education and support . Greenwood ( 56) stated that the participants in usual care received diabetes educational booklets and formal diabetic education . Participants in usual care groups also received annual check -ups and preventive guideline - based laboratory tests and screening s.61, 67 2. Other Comparison Groups Bowes ( 52) used patients randomized to BERTIE, a structured educational program for type 1 diabetics, as the comparison group to the mHealth intervention Diabetes Interactive Diary, a software program installed on a patient's mobile phone. BERTIE is a comprehensive educational program that consists of four six -hour group sessions that focus on carbohydrate counting and insulin dose adjustment. A second study57 used email reminders as the comparison group to a cell ph one text messaging intervention. Email reminders or cell phone text messages were sent from the Computerized Automated Reminder Diabetes System (CARDS) at preset times telling participants to check their blood glucose. Once a BG value was received, CARDS s ent positive feedback to the user regardless of the result. D. Types of mHealth Interventions Included in this Review Nineteen diabetes apps were identified and examined in this review, with five domains of functionality (Table III). 22 TABLE III.

Type 1 Diabetes Apps Five apps were used by participants with type 1 diabetes. Two apps52, 53 used by participants with type 1 diabetes aimed to help patients calculate the most appropriate insulin dose based on blood glucose levels . Three apps52, 53, 64 helped patients track their carbohydrate intake , e.g., one app52 featured a photographic datab ase of foods in different portion sizes with corresponding carbohydrate counts. Three of the apps51, 53, 64 allowed participants to track their physical activity. Special functionalities included an app51 with risk monitoring that featured automated alarm messages in the event of abnormal BG readings and another53 that offered patients specific plasma glucose targets. Data for all apps w as manually entered. The frequency of healthcare provider feedback ranged from as needed to weekly. 2. Type 2 Diabetes Apps Twelve apps were used by participants with type 2 diabetes. In eight of the apps, BG data was automatically transferred. Six apps featured personalized feedback on other self - monitoring data such as blood pressure, weight, carbohydra te intake, and physical activity, with these data being manually entered. One exception was the DialBetics app which automatically transferred blood pressure, weight, and pedometer counts in addition to blood glucose .68 Two apps65, 68 featured alarms for a bnormal BG readings. Graphical feedback was provided by six apps56, 58, 60, 61, 66, 68 to promote self -management through awareness of BG trends. The Care Innovations Guide app56 provided virtual health sessions for patient education in the style of a Powe rPoint slide or short video clip. The Few Touch Application intervention58 offered food habit, physical activity, and personal goals registration systems in which the user entered 27 information manually. Eight apps provided feedback as long as blood glucose data was abnormal; the frequency of feedback in the other apps ranged from weekly to once every two to three months. 3. Type 1 and 2 Diabetes Apps There were two apps used by participants with eith er type 1 or type 2 diabetes. One app provided personalized feedback on health data in addition to blood glucose ,50 the other app provided reminders when a blood glucose measurement was due .59 E. Risk of Bias Assessment of the Included Studies The results of the risk of bias assessment are presented in a summary table and graph (Figure 2, Table IV). Figure 2. Risk of bias graph: Review authors' judgements about each risk of bias item presented as percentages across all included studies. 28 TABLE IV . RISK OF BIAS SUMMARY : REVIEW AUTHORS' JUDGEMENTS ABOUT EACH RISK OF BIAS ITEM FOR EACH INCLUDED STUDY Nine studies50, 56, 58, 59, 61, 63, 65, 67, 68 used adequate sequence generation methods (e.g., computer generated random num bers or a random numbers table) , the other ten studies did not specify the method of randomization. Only four of the 19 studies demonstrated adequate allocation concealment .56, 58, 65, 67 Three studies explicitly addressed the lack of blinding of participants and study personnel .56, 58, 65 Though not stated, it was assumed that blinding did not take place in the other studies due to the nature of the intervention. Two studies explicitly addressed the blinding of outcome assessors .65, 67 One study reported the use of the same outcome assessors in both study groups with potential for bias in the intervention effects .56 Hanauer (57) stated that only 15% of the study participants remained at t he conclusion of the study. In three studies all those who were randomized completed the study .60, 64, 66 Study 29 protocols were available for only two studies to make fully informed inferences on selective reporting .50, 58 There were no other potential sour ces of bias identified. F. Analysis of Effect Size The effect size of the analysis was calculated as the mean difference in the change of HbA1c from baseline to post -intervention, between the intervention and comparison group. Eighteen studies provided enough data about glycemic control to use HbA1c in a meta -analysis. Pooled results from these studies (17 34 patients) showed a statistically significant reduction in HbA1c of -0.45% (95% CI -0.66, -0.24; P < 0.0001) (Figure 3). This was associated with substantial heterogeneity (I2 = 66%) indicating variability in the intervention effect due to differences in both magnitude and direction of effect. Figure 3. Impact of mHealth interventions on HbA1c for patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes 30 Subgroup analysis demonstrated a statistically insignificant reduction in HbA1c of 0.33% in patients with type 1 diabetes (95% CI -0.96, 0.2 9; I2 = 74%; studies = 4: participants = 2 27) and a statistically significant reduction in HbA1c of -0.46% in patients with type 2 diabetes (95% CI -0.71, -0.22; I2 = 67%; studies = 12; participants = 1350) (Figures 4 and 5 ). Figure 4. Impact of mHealth interventions on HbA1c for patients with type 1 diabetes (Subgroup analysis: Follow -up period <6 months vs. 6months) 31 Figure 5. Impact of mHealth interventions on HbA1c for patients with type 2 diabetes (Subgroup analysis: Follow -up period <6 months vs. 6months) Two studies involving both type 1 and type 2 diabetes patients showed a statistically significant reduction in HbA1c of 0.47% (CI -0.88, -0.05; P = 0.81; I2 = 0%) (Figure 6). Figure 6. Impact of mHealth interventions on HbA1c in studies involving both type 1 and type 2 diabetes 32 Subgroup analysis by follow -up duration for type 1 diabetes showed that studies with a longer duration ( 6 months) displayed a larger but insignificant reduction in HbA1c than studies with a shorter duration (< 6 months) ( -0.60%, 95% CI to 0.59 , respectively) (Figure 4, Table V). Studies of type 2 diabetes with a follow -up duration of less than six months reported a larger , statistically significant reduction in HbA1c compared to studies with a follow -up duration of six months or more ( -0.89%, 95% , respectively) (Figure 5, Table IV).

Impact of mHealth interventions on HbA1c (Subgroup analysis: Manual BG data entry vs. Automatic BG data entry) Subgroup analysis of frequency of feedback showed that three studies with weekly feedback showed a statistically significant reduction of HbA1c of -0.76 % (95% CI -1.15, -0.38) versus daily feedback (- 0.56 %, 95% CI -1.44, 0. 32) (Figure 8). Feedback on an as needed basis also showed a statistically significant reduction in HbA1c but not as great as weekly feedback (-0.41 %, 95% CI -0.66, -0.15). Monthly feedback showed a statistically insignificant reduction in HbA1c of -0.08% (95% CI -0.55, 0.38). 35 Figure 8.

Publication bias could not be properly assessed with funnel plots for type 1 diabetes due to the small number of studies. 38 Figure 10. Funnel plot of mHealth studies involving patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes Figure 11. Funnel plot of mHealt h studies involving patients with type 2 diabetes 39 G. Secondary Outcomes Thirteen of the 19 studies reported at least one secondary outcome (Table VII). Patient satisfaction with the intervention was assessed in 62% of studies, of which 78% reported that patients were satisfied with this type of intervention. Quality of life was reported as an outcome in 26% of studies, with improvements reported in three studies. Patient compliance with the intervention was good in both studies that reported this as an outcome. A single study reported medication adherence as an outcome and also saw improvement. None of the studies examined the cost effectiveness of the int erventions. TABLE VII.

DISCUSSION A. Summary of Main Results This review demonstrates that mHealth interventions involving clinical feedback improve HbA1c compared to usual care or other non -mHealth approaches by an average of 0.45% (95% CI -0.66 , -0.24) , but it appears that they are more effective for patients with type 2 diabetes. The estimated 0.4 5% reduction is modest but evidence suggests that this difference is clinically relevant and large enough to reduce the risk of development and progression of diabetic microvascular complications.70 The improvement in glycemic control found in this study is similar to the effect seen in previous reviews analyzing the effect of mHealth technologies on glycemic control in diabetes self -management.30, 69 Studies of type 2 diabetes with shorter follow -up yielded larger effect sizes compared to studies with six months or more of follow -up. These findings are consistent with th ose found elsewhere30 and may indicate that the effect of the intervention decreases over time. It may be necessary to intensify provider contact and implement motivational strategies to maintain gains made in glycemic control.71 Another consideration is t he natural history of diabetes which can impact the effectiveness of mHealth interventions in certain patients. The sensitivity of receptors to medication may decline over time so despite compliance with the treatment regimen the effect of the intervention on glycemic control is reduced.31 This review found that r eductions in HbA1c were more pronounced in interventions that used automatic data entry. One of the barriers to diabetes self -management is the burden of tracking and collating BG data.73 mHealt h interventions that automatically transfer BG data 42 from a glucometer to an app streamline the BG testing process and facilitate compliance with treatment . Additionally, patients with little technology experience find such interventions very easy to use.62 Studies with weekly provider feedback were found to have the largest effect on HbA1c but feedback on as needed basis also saw a significant effect. These findings suggest that regular provider feedback may not be necessary for intervention success. The p rocess of recording and tracking BG data could be the key factor that increases patients' awareness, understanding, and motivation to self -manage their condition.50 Knowledge that the data are accessible to a provider may also be an incentive for patients to follow a treatment regimen. Interventions that provide graphical and automated feedback, e.g. Mobil Diab51 and Monica61, might also be effective incentives by engaging patients and helping them identify relationships between lifestyle and BG patterns.50 The findings of this review indicate that there is insufficient evidence to determine whether mHealth interventions based on behavioral change theories are more effective . Four RCTs in this review specified the use of a behavioral theory in the design o f the intervention. It should be noted that even when interventions are said to be guided by theory, in practice often they are not or only minimally so.74 However, two 58, 61 of the four studies did attempt to explain the impact of the theory -based interv ention on clinical outcomes. mHealth interventions c an benefit from a greater application of health behavior theories in their design.33 Interventions are often designed without sufficient knowledge about the target behavior and without a theoretical frame work.74 Therefore, those designing mHealth interventions for diabetics must know how to support and motivate this population's readiness for behavior al change. Future 43 research must include patients as part of the team when developing appropriate interventi ons tailored to their needs.58 B. Overall Completeness and Applicability of the Evidence The use of information and communication technologies to track and transmit BG values in adults with type 2 diabetes is increasing and has been found to be highly acceptable to patients in several studies .75-78 Patient feedback indicated that acceptance was facilitated by ease of use, perceived usefulness, and practicality .79 However, type 2 diabetes is more common in older adults and compared to younger adults, the se patients report greater anxiety and less confidence in their technological abilities .71 A previous stud y54 found a lack of intervention effect with increasing age while other s have suggested that compliance may be higher in older patients .30, 58 These conflicting results should compel researchers to identify which sub - populations of type 2 diabetics would benefit most from mHealth interventions. The incorporation of patient education into type 2 mHealth interventions should be explored in future studies to assess the impact on patient understanding of their illness and ability to perform self -care .58, 61 Future trials should also explore the use of social media for patient support and as a low -cost approach to maintain behavior change . 56 Diabetologists consider adolescents a difficult -to-treat age group .64 The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) showed that adolescents had the worst glycemic control of all age groups and it remains unacceptably high despite close monitoring and patient education programs . 53, 64, 80, 81 It is critical to establish a regular BG monitoring regimen for 44 patients in this age group since it has been shown that poorly controlled type 1 diabetics carry such behaviors into adulthood, placing them at gre ater risk for complications .57, 82 The reasons for poor BG control include coping with the constraints of the disease, competing social and developmental needs, hormonal fluctuations, resistance to parental and healthcare provider involvement, and difficul ty determining the correct dose of insulin .18, 5 3, 57, 64 As a result, mHealth interventions that simply perform BG monitoring functions may have a limited impact on glycemic control. Young patients with type 1 diabetes likely require more sophisticated interventions that offer features such as decision -support aids that have the capacity to effectively contextualize a BG result and then take appropriate action to optimize glycemic control .75 Other strategies to improve patient engagement, such as gamific ation and social media, should be systematic ally explored in future studies.18 All of the type 1 diabetes interventions in this review employed manual data transmission ; future interventions should include automatic data transmission to facilitate data tra nsfer and improve patient compliance .64 C. Overall Quality of the Evidence Quality of evidence refers to the extent which one can be confident that the estimate of effect approaches the true value for an outcome and depends upon the validity of the included studies.26 An assessment of validity of the included studies should emphasize the ROB in their results and indicate the extent to which they overestimate or underestimate the true intervention effect.26 Using the Cochrane Collaboration criteria for ROB as outlined in Higgins and Green26, it was determined that the body of evidence supporting the use of mHealth 45 interventions in diabetes was of moderate quality for the outcome of HbA1c , mainly due to defic its in sequence generation and allocation concealment. Half of the included studies did not describe a method for sequence generation and only four studies reported allocation concealment. Blinding of participants and study personnel was not feasible in an y of the studies due to the nature of the intervention , but this is expected to have a minimal impact on the effect size given the objective methods used to determine changes in HbA1c. Visual inspection of the funnel plots (Figures X and XI) reveals a gap in the lower right -hand section of both graphs. This suggest s publication bias towards larger studies with positive and statistically significant results.49, 72, 73 D. Limitations of this Review This systematic review has several limitations. Non -English papers were not reviewed which may introduce language bias. There is no clear definition of what constitutes a diabetes app, and study authors defined their interventions in different, unique ways.69 There was an attempt to identify unpublished studies but no unpublished RCTs satisfied the inclusion criteria, thus this review contains published data only. There is no gold standard of calculating missing standard deviations, so there may be random errors in the imputations.30 Finally, small stud y sizes and the heterogeneity of findings make it difficult to determine the true effect size of the intervention.31 E. Implications for Future Research Future randomized controlled trials should consider adequately powered sample sizes of patients with longer duration s of follow -up (> 12 months) to improve the generalizability of 46 findings. 18, 31 These studies should include features such as adequate sequence generation and allocation concealment to reduce the impact of bias on internal validity.69 Futu re research should identify those patient characteristics that predict intervention success; these findings can then be used to infer which populations would benefit most from mHealth interventions.27, 29 Especially for the younger type 1 diabetes patients , future studies should examine the role of caregivers in the context of mHealth interventions as it is likely that the majority of the patient's healthcare is still monitored by a patient or other primary caregiver.28 Future research should also explore the impact of behavioral change theories and gamification elements on BG control and the compliance of patients using diabetes apps.69 Importantly, future studies should examine healthcare providers' acceptance and intention to incorporate mHealth interv entions into their practices.18, 29 Future research should clarify the actual long -term and overall impact of these interventions on providers' workloads, since that will influence the extent to which this technology is accepted and used in healthcare.18 Future studies also need to examine the impact of mHealth interventions on the utilization of healthcare services.18 Healthcare organizations are under intense pressure to reduce costs and as a result are shifting care from hospitals to ambulatory care ce nters and home settings which are lower cost, more accessible alternatives.74 mHealth represents a promising approach to care in these settings but requires further study to evaluate whether its widespread adoption is warranted. None of the included studie s in this review provided information about the cost of the interventions nor did they include evaluations of cost effectiveness. Without this information, it is impossible to confirm whether implementing mHealth interventions are economically viable.18, 27 47 CITED LITERATURE 1.

Excluded were patients a) with previous experien ce with mobile telehealth; b) regular extended travel ( 3 weeks) outside the UK; c) home visits by a nurse for blood glucose monitoring and/or insulin administration; d) kidney failure: e) sickle cell disease; f) pregnancy; g) dexterity or visual problem s Intervention Participants in the Intervention group received mobile telehealth equipment: BG meter, BP monitor, mobile phone, Bluetooth cradle, and training on the equipment. Patient data was stored in the mobile phone and transmitted via Bluetooth to the Web server. Participants followed their usual routine of BG self -monitoring. The data display is color -coded and is automatically displayed after each data transfer. Nurses access the patient data on the server via a Web portal (which was also acces sible to patients). The nurses provided feedback on out -of-range clinical readings as needed, education on lifestyle changes (for a total of 6 weekly educational calls), and supported insulin titration. If more substantial support was required, participant s were instructed to follow up with a diabetes specialist nurse (DSN) in clinic. Participants in the control group received usual care with face -to-face clinic appointments every 3 -4 months and 1 -2 semi -annual appointments with diabetes consultants. Outco me Primary outcome: Glycemic control, assessed by HbA1c Notes 63 Risk of bias Bias Author's judgement Support for judgement Random sequence generation (selection bias) Low risk Quote: \"Randomisation was carried out by a (selection bias) member of the research team upon receipt of the completed baseline questionnaire, and independently of DSNs, using an online sequence generator that generated randomised block allocations (blocks of 20).\" Comment: All ocation sequence was genuinely randomized. Allocation concealment (selection bias) Unclear risk No details are provided regarding how the allocation sequence was implemented. Blinding of participants and personnel (performance bias) High risk Not feasible to blind the participants or study personnel in these types of trials.

Charpentier 2011 Study design & duration RCT (3 arm, study duration 6 months) Participants Adult Type 1 diabetes patients, diagnosed with diabetes for at least one year, treated with basal bolus insulin regime for at least 6 months, and HbA1c values 8.0% the year before and at study entry (n=180). Excluded were patients who participated in a diabetes education program in the 3 months prior to the study or those patients with a health condition that required follow up more frequently than the quarterly visits scheduled. Intervention Participants randomized to Group 3 (electronic logbook and teleconsultation) received a smartphone with Diabeo software. The Diabeo software is a bolus calculator; personalized insulin doses are entered into the system for each patient. If BG results do no t meet target levels, the system can suggest adjustments for carbohydrate ratio, insulin dose, or pump rates. No follow up hospital visits were scheduled until the endpoint at month 6. Participant BG data, diet, and insulin treatment data were automatica lly uploaded by the smartphone to a secure website where they were available to investigators. Teleconsultations were conducted with patients and doctors using computers or phones displaying last week's data and focused on insulin dose adjustments and moti vational support. Participants in Group 2 (electronic logbook alone) received a smartphone loaded with Diabeo software, did not use teleconsultations. Clinic visits were scheduled for months 3 and 6. Participants in Group 1 (control group, usual paper logbook) were asked to attend two clinic visits, after 3 and 6 months.

Allocation concealment (selection bias) Low risk Quote: \"...block randomization was used, with an allocation sequence being generated by means of a table of random numbers.\" Comment: Allocation concealment was achieved. Blinding of participants and personnel (performance bias) High risk Quote: \"...given the nature of the intervention, it could not be blind to participating physicians.\" Com ment: Blinding not possible due to the nature of the intervention. Blinding of outcome assessment (detection bias) Low risk Quote: \"...analytical determinations required during the study were also made in the same reference laboratories. Therefore, all an alytical measures were blind.\" Incomplete outcome data (attrition bias) Low risk Quote: \" 328 patients...were included in the study sample and randomly assigned to the study groups: 161 to the intervention group and 167 to the control group. During the trial seven patients died, and another 24 were lost to follow -up; therefore, in 1 year we followed 146 patients (91%) from the intervention group and 151 (90%) from the control group.' Comment: Only 9% attrition (31/328) and loss balanced between the 2 com parator groups. Selective reporting (reporting bias) Low risk No differences found between methods and reported results. All missing participants were accounted for. 84 Other bias Low risk Quote: \"The authors declare that Emminens, the company that finances the research on which this article is based, does not use the work system described in the mentioned article, and therefore there is no duality of interest.\" Comment: There does not appear to be any publication bias in this study. The sponsor does not own the data or require screening of the manuscript. Takenga 2014 Study design & duration RCT (2 -arm, 2 month duration) Participants Adults between the ages of 35 -75 years diagnosed with type 2 diabetes (n = 40). Intervention The Mobil Diab system enables diabetic patients to self -manage their condition using their mobile device. Clinicians access patient data through a web portal. Patients enter their data via intuitive screens; data is automatically synchronized so providers can receive da ta in real time. Feedback from the clinician is received directly in the mobile app. Outcome One of the main outcomes in this study was HbA1c (%). Notes No SDs or p values given. Risk of bias Bias Author's judgement Support for judgement Random sequence generation (selection bias) Unclear risk Quote: \"Patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and aged between 35 and 75 years were recruited randomly. A total of 40 patients were included in the trial phase. For classification and evaluation purpose, the cohort was divided into a control group (conventional therapy without the use of telemedicine system) and an intervention group (treatment with the use of telemedicine system Mobil Diab).\" Comment: No details provided regarding the actual randomization sequence. Allocation concealment (selection bias) Unclear risk Quote: \"The randomization of all the 40 patients in control and intervention group was successful.\" Comment: No details provided regarding method of concealment and if participants or investigators could 85 foresee assignments. Blinding of participants and personnel (performance bias) High risk Not feasible to blind the participants or study personnel in these types of trials. Blinding of outcome assessment (detection bias) Unclear risk Not clear if outcome assessors were blinded. Incomplete outcome data (attrition bias) Low risk All 40 patients completed the study. Selective reporting (reporting bias) Low risk No evidence of reporting bias, results from all participants reported. Other bias Low risk No evidence of other bias. Tang 2013 Study design & duration RCT (2 -arm, 12 month duration) Participants Adults 18 years of age diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, HbA1c 7.5%, and seen within the last 12 months (n = 415). Excluded were patients with an initial diagnosis of diabetes within the last 12 months, inability to read or speak English, lack of internet access, unwillingness to perform self -monitoring, terminal illness, pregnancy or breastfeeding, currently enrolled in a care management program at the Palo Alto Medical Foundation (PAMF), family member enrolled in already enrolled in the study (the EMPOWER -D study), resident of a long -term care facility, plans to discontinue care at PAMF, and the uninsured. Intervention Glucometers were fitted with a Bluetooth adapter that wirelessly transmitted blood glucose readings to a smartphone. The smartphone then uploaded the data to the PAMF HER. Clinicians were able to view patient data and provide timely feedback v ia secure messaging regarding blood glucose levels, food intake, and medication doses. Outcome The primary outcome in this study was blood glucose as measured by HbA1c (%). Notes Intervention patients achieved greater decreases in HbA1c at 6 months than usual care, but the differences were not sustained at 12 months. More intervention patients than usual care patients achieved improvement in HbA1c (> 0.5% decrease). 86 Risk of bias Bias Author's judgement Support for judgement Random sequence generation (selection bias) Low risk Quote: \"Randomization was performed by -patient. An analyst sequestered from the research assistants entered the participants into a randomization program based on Pocock's 'minimization' procedure, which assures better - than -chance group balance for the following key variables: primary care site, age, gender, A1C levels, systolic blood pressure, low -density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and pre -enrollment use of our portal.\" Comment: Method of randomization speci fied. Allocation concealment (selection bias) Low risk Quote: \" Participants were then sent letters about study assignment (intervention (INT) vs usual care (UC))...\" Comment: Appears that adequate allocation sequence concealment achieved, however no mention of use of sealed, opaque envelopes. Blinding of participants and personnel (performance bias) High risk Not feasible to blind the participants or study personnel in these types of trials. Blinding of outcome assessment (detection bias) Low risk Quote: \"Clinical measurements, adverse event reports, and online questionnaires were collected from all participants at 6 and 12 months by a research assistant blinded to randomization status.\" Comment: Low risk of bias due to blinding of research assistan t and objective measure of HbA1c. Incomplete outcome data (attrition bias) Low risk 193/213 (91%) in UC and 186/202 (92%) INT completed the study. Attrition low and balanced between groups. Selective reporting (reporting bias) Low risk No evidence of selective reporting. Other bias Low risk No evidence of other bias. Waki 2014 Study design & duration RCT (2 -arm, 3 month duration) Participants Adult diabetic patients with type 2 diabetes with no severe complications such as proliferative retinopathy, a serum Cr < 1.5 mg/dL, and who were able to exercise (n = 54). Intervention Each participant in the intervention group received a smartphone and wireless -enabled glucometer which transmitted data wirelessly to the DialBetics server. Abnormal readings were reported as a \"Dr. Call\" meaning a physician would check the data and follow -up with the patient via text 87 message or phone. Outcome The primary outcome in this study was the change in HbA1c (%). Notes Risk of bias Bias Author's judgement Support for judgement Random sequence generation (selection bias) Low risk Quote: \"Participants were randomly divided into a DialBetics group and non -DialBetics group using a computer -generated list of random numbers.\" Comment: Study used a randomized sequence of assignments. Allocation concealment (selection bias) Unclear risk No deta ils provided regarding the method of concealment of study group assignments. Blinding of participants and personnel (performance bias) High risk Not feasible to blind the participants or study personnel in these types of trials. Blinding of outcome asses sment (detection bias) Unclear risk Not stated if outcome assessors were blinded. Incomplete outcome data (attrition bias) High risk Quote: \" ...the study's dropout rate was relatively high (9.3%): 3 DialBetics and 2 non -DialBetics group members. One in the DialBetics group (and both in the non - DialBetics group) dropped out for hospitalization. The other 2 DialBetics dropouts cited unwi llingness to continue constant measurements as their main reason. Although interpretation should be cautious given the small sample size, dropout rate is a potential source of bias in the current study. \"Comment: Could be biased in favor of the Dialbetic g roup since 2/3 participants who left that groups did not want to use the intervention, possibly making Dialbetics appear more useful than it truly is. Selective reporting (reporting bias) Unclear risk No details provided regarding how missing data was handled. Table 2 shows n=27 for both groups even though 5 participants could not or did not complete the study. Other bias Low risk No evidence of bias from other sources. 88 VITA NAME: Rebecca K.
