Vetenskapsakademien Background to KVA (=RSAS) initiative on homeopathy for EASAC Science community had concerns regarding widespread use of implausible, irrational and non- scientific alternative medicine. Science community had concerns regarding handling of homeopathic anthroposophical products in Sweden since 1993.\u00a9 Kungl. VetenskapsakademienHomeopathic products in Sweden must not state indication (purpose) be used for injection Why focus on homeopathy? Homeopathy is one of the must implausible alternative medicine methods. Yet, anthroposophical homeopathic products are exempt from these restrictions in Sweden since 1993. The EU requested in 2013 that this exemption should be discontinued.\u00a9 Kungl. Vetenskapsakademien Anthroposophy Founded by Rudolf Steiner (1861- 1925) Includes homeopathy, astrology, doctrine of signatures (symbolic interpretations), etc. Anthroposophical medicine Founded in early 1920s by Steiner and Ita Wegman (1876- 1943) \u00a9 Kungl. science institutions: KVA, Karolinska Institute, Uppsala University, Swedish Pharmaceutical Society, etc. Report 2014 from Swedish Medicinal Products Agency: Four suggestions how to incorporate anthroposophical homeopathic products in the medicinal products legislation. Exemption has now been discontinued with a transition period of five years: Anthroposophy has to comply with general homeopathy regulations.\u00a9 Kungl. VetenskapsakademienKVA wrote in Sweden' s largest newspaper (Dec 2015): \"Homeopathic products cannot be called medicinal products \" (signed by four Nobel laureates) \"The term is misleading\" Reactions in Sweden The debate was most intense in 2015 regarding anthroposophical homeopathy.\u00a9 Kungl. Journal of Internal 2013\"There is no ethically acceptable justification for excepting homeopathic the consumers' right to know.\" \u00a9 Kungl. VetenskapsakademienReactions had already happened in 2015. Reactions in Sweden to EASAC statement 2017 Not much... Homeopathy and anthroposophy are very minor in Sweden. No pharmacies sell 'anthroposophical medicinal products '. They hardly ever used the word homeopathy. They never acknowledged the implausibility of homeopathy. \u00a9 Kungl. Vetenskapsakademien \"The Center for Inquiry (CFI) is a nonprofit educational organization. Its primary mission is to foster a secular society based on science, reason, freedom of inquiry, and humanist values.\"CVS is the largest drug retailer in the U.S. with approximately 10,000 stores.\u00a9 Kungl. VetenskapsakademienHow can we get decision- makers to realize the implausibility of homeopathy and stop this deception of consumers?Probably most decision- makers and consumers are unaware of the scientific facts that undermine the concept of homeopathy.\u00a9 Kungl. Vetenskapsakademien \"For our descendants \"If we do not point out the implausibility of homeopathy now,future historians of science will wonder how we could this continue for more than 200 years. Now is the time "}
