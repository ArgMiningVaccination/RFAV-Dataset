LIBERTYVILLE, IL \u2014 A suburban chiropractor has been indicted on federal fraud charges for accusations he billed a private insurer for services he never performed. Between 2016 and 2019, Seung Han Lim owned and operated Movement Health and Rehab in Libertyville, also known as Motu Chiropractic and Motu Chiromassage, and submitted fraudulent claims to Blue Cross Blue Shield of Illinois for purported health care services that Lim knew were not actually provided, according to an indictment unsealed today in U.S. District Court in Chicago. Lim, 40, faces 14 counts of health care fraud, and could face up to 140 years in prison if convicted on all of the federal charges.

Some of the claims were submitted for services that happened on dates when either Lim, 40, of Lincolndshire, or the patient were not in Illinois, the indictment states. Other claims submitted by Lim were for services purportedly rendered by another chiropractor to Lim and Lim's family members, even though Lim knew that those services were not actually provided by the other chiropractor. Blue Cross Blue Shield would have denied the claims had Lim been identified as the rendering provider because the insurer prohibited claims from providers for services rendered to the provider or their immediate family members, the indictment states.
