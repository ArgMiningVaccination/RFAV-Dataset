We do this through a long-term recovery program, a non-medical detox and an emergency shelter. We make it our mission to see the potential that exists in each person, even when they are at their lowest point. We're here for all people, under the influence or not, and regardless of readiness for change. Because everyone needs a glimpse of hope to believe life can get better. And even one encounter with someone in our village (whether participant, alumni or staff) might just save their lives. So, whatever brings them here, and however long they're willing to stay, our doors are always open. No matter what. "}
