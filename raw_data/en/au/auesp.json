This IV contains a three amino acid blend with the addition of zinc, lysine and minerals. If you are starting to come down with a cold or fighting any infection this IV therapy can help reduce the severity and duration especially when administered within the first 24 hours of the onset of symptoms. Highlighted Ingredients Vitamin C Vitamin C, also known as ascorbic acid, is a water-soluble vitamin. Unlike most mammals and other animals, humans do not have the ability to make their own vitamin C. Therefore, we must obtain vitamin C through our diet. Vitamin C is required for the synthesis of collagen, an important structural component of blood vessels, tendons, ligaments, and bone. Vitamin C also plays an important role in the synthesis of Neurotransmitters, which are critical for brain function. In addition, vitamin C is involved in the process of transporting fat into cellular organelles called mitochondria, where the fat is converted to energy. Vitamin C is also a highly effective antioxidant and in small amounts can effectively protect important cells from free radical damage. Tri Amino (Ornithine, Arginine and Citrulline) Tri Amino contains the essential amino acids ornithine, arginine, and citrulline, which are known for producing antioxidant effects and increasing protein synthesis. Tri Amino can decrease blood pressure, increase vasodilation (widening of blood vessels), increase the synthesis of nitric oxide, improve cardiovascular health as well as improve erectile function. The use of this supplement also promotes wound healing and improves kidney function/disease. It is known to enhance the release of key hormones, such as Human Growth Hormone, and reduce exercise-induced accumulation of plasma lactate and ammonia which is essential for the urea cycle. Multitrace (zinc, copper, manganese, chromium, selenium) Multitrace helps to maintain plasma levels of zinc, copper, manganese, selenium, and chromium and to prevent deplete stores of these trace elements and subsequent deficiency symptoms. L-Lysine Lysine is an essential amino acid, which means that it is essential to human health but cannot be manufactured by the body. For this reason, lysine must be obtained from food. Lysine helps to fight Herpes outbreaks, increases growth hormone production, and helps to regulate hormone levels. Also, it aids in the production of antibodies and supports the immune system. Methylcobalamin (B12) The natural form of B12 is better absorbed than Cyanobalamin and has been used to treat pernicious anemia and diabetic and peripheral neuropathy. Vitamin B12 is an essential component for proper digestion, absorption of foods, and for normal metabolism of carbohydrates and fat. It aids in maintaining healthy nerve cells and red blood cells and is needed to make DNA. Vitamin B12 is also involved in homocysteine metabolism and plays a critical role in proper energy metabolism, immune function, and nerve function. Ingredients - Tri Amino (Arginine, Citrulline, Ornithine) - Methylcobalamin (B12) - L-Lysine - Vitamin C - Trace Minerals (zinc, copper, manganese, chromium, selenium) Precautions People may experience a feeling of warmth or mild discomfort when receiving an IV. Rare complications that can occur during intravenous therapies include phlebitis (inflammation of the vein) and fluid infiltration (leaking of fluid into the surrounding tissues). Indications - Immune Support - Reduce severity and duration of colds - General Nutrition - Seasonal Allergies - Post Surgery - Wound Therapy Support "}
