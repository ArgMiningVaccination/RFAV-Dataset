Get your [Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B vaccinations](/node/135542): You've got one viral infection your liver has to deal with. Prevent other viral infections that are known to harm the liver and are vaccine preventable. Eliminate Harmful Chemicals From Your Body: A. ALL alcohol, in any amount, is harmful to your liver. Eliminate all alcohols from your diet. B. ALL illicit drugs are harmful to your liver. Studies have shown that the use of marijuana can cause the liver to progress to scarring sooner. It doesn't make any difference on how the drug is used (injecting, smoking, eating, inhaling), they are all harmful to your liver. Eliminate all illegal drug use. Talk with your provider or a counselor to identify ways to help you stop the use of any illegal drugs. C. Decrease polluted air that you breathe, such as: 1) Second-hand cigarette smoke 2) Car exhaust 3) Agricultural pesticides 4) Smog Get a Prescription Review: Have your doctor or pharmacist review all your prescribed medications to ensure that none of your medications are toxic for your liver. Ask your provider about alternatives to any medications that may harm your liver. Use Over The Counter Medications Properly: Always follow the directions on the package, unless told otherwise by your medical provider. Be Careful With Vitamins, Herbs and Mineral Use: A. Some of the \"Fat Soluble\" vitamins can build up in your system and be toxic to your liver. Check with your provider before taking more than the daily recommendations. B. Before taking any herbal supplement, research it and make sure that it doesn't have the potential to damage to your liver, such as Kava, Valerian Root and Sassafras. Check with your doctor before adding any herbal supplements to your diet. C. The liver has to store all the excess iron that you take in during a day. It's important not to eat more iron in a 24 hour day than what your body actually uses. Extra iron stored in the liver can cause your liver to begin scarring sooner. Talk with a dietician or your doctor to find out how much iron you should eat in a day. Modify Your Diet: A. Decrease the amount of fatty foods and cholesterol that you eat. Extra fat stored in the liver can cause a liver to begin scarring sooner. B. Increase the amount of actual water that you drink during a 24 hour day. Water helps flush the chemicals and poisons out of your body. To find out how much water you should drink in a 24 hour period: take your body weight in pounds and divide it by 2. This equals how many ounces of water you should drink each day. Light Daily Exercise: Light daily exercise such as walking will help boost your immune system as well as help decrease excess fat stored in your liver. Talk to your provider about what the best form of exercise would be for you. Symptoms That Need to be Reported to Your Provider: A. \"White\" or \"Gray\" colored stools B. \"Coca-Cola\" colored urine C. Increased amount of time before a cut or wound stops bleeding D. The white part of your eyes turning yellow. Courtesy: Hepatitis Prevention Program, Nebraska Department of Health & Human Services.
