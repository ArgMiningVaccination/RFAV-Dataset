Hit-to-lead optimization of endochin lead to 4(1H)-quinolones ELQ-300 and P4Q-391, which target the liver, the blood as well as the transmitting stages of the parasite (Sci. Transl. Med. 2013, 5, 177ra37). However, poor aqueous solubility severely limits absorption and oral bioavailability and therefore impedes preclinical development of this class of antimalarials Herein, we disclose a general prodrug approach that converts promising lead compounds, such as antimalarial 4(1H)-quinolones, into aminoalkoxycarbonyloxymethyl (amino AOCOM) ethers that display solubility and enhanced oral bioavailability. The prodrug is autarkic, independent of biotransformations, were shown to possess pharmacokinetic and efficacy profiles significantly improved relative to the corresponding parent compounds (> 50-fold improvement of Cmax and AUC). One of the most promising 3-aryl-4(1H)-quinolone preclinical candidates was further shown to provide single-dose cures in a rodent malaria model at an unprecedentedly low oral dose of 3 mg/kg, without the use of an advanced formulation technique.

Pharmacology Department, Ankara Yildirim Beyazit University, Turkey Rapid antigen testing (RAT) has started to encourage the use of rational antibiotics in primary health care (family medicine department) in February 2017 in Turkey. The RAT is a practical test used to determine the presence of antigens of A group beta hemolytic streptococcus (AGS). This study aims to observe whether there is a difference in the rate of antibiotics prescription between years of 2016 and 2017, in which RAT was not used in the former and used in the later. The most frequent bacterial agents of acute pharyngitis (AP) and tonsillopharyngitis (AT) are AGS. It is quite difficult to distinguish between viral or bacterial agents according to anamnesis, clinical and physical examination findings. Since the result of throat cultures requires 24-48 hours, various methods have been developed for fast determination the factors in AP and AT cases. The RAT test is one of them. The use of RAT is of great importance in reducing the use of irrational antibiotics and the cost of antibiotics. A statistically significant difference was found in the antibiotic prescription of family physicians due to the use of RAT in the selected family medicine departments between the years of 2016 and 2017 (p<0.05). The RAT is a rapid and reliable method for the diagnosis of streptococcal AP and AT in outpatient. When RAT is positive, it indicates streptococcal AP and AT. However, negative detection of the testing does not remove it from the diagnosis. It is also observed that the use of RAT creates an important pharmacoeconomic awareness in physicians.

Arab Academy for Science, Technology and Maritime Transport, Egypt Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common human malignancies. Lack of efficient therapy for advanced HCC is a pressing problem worldwide. Dasatinib is an oral dual BCR/ABL and Src family tyrosine kinase inhibitor approved for use in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). The main targets of dasatinib, are BCRABL, SRC and GFR. NFB is one of widely recognized positive regulator of cancer cell proliferation. It could be worthy to combine multikinase inhibitor with NFB inhibitor for targeting of multiple signaling pathways involved in carcinogenesis. This study aimed to evaluate the potential anticarcinogenic effects of either dasatinib and/or sulfasalazine on HEPG2 cell line as a model of HCC. The current study was conducted on 4 groups. For determination of the specific doses for the selected drugs MTT assay was done. While for laboratory investigations; cell lysates and nuclear extracts were subjected to ELISA and QRT-PCR. Both drugs have modulated RAF/ERK, BCR/ABL and NFB effects by lowering cyclin-D1, its apoptotic effect by improving the level of caspase-3, and its antiangiogenic effect by lowering VEGF level in a pattern similar to that of dasatinib. On the molecular level, dasatinib and sulfasalazine downregulated the gene expression level of c-MET. On almost all the parameters, the sulfasalazine effects were more superior when compared to that of dasatinib, while the combination regimen showed the best effects. The author present study showed for the first time the beneficial anticarcinogenic effects of dasatinib and sulfasalazine coadministration on HCC cells.

Department of pharmacology, Jamia Hamdard University, India The well-characterized associations between type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) are twofold. First, CVD is the underlying cause of more than 60% deaths in diabetic patients. Second, the hyperglycaemia of T2DM, as measured by the percentage of glycosylated haemoglobin, is believed to increase the risk of coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction (MI). Given this relationship, physicians managing T2DM must remain aware of the cardiovascular effects of their therapeutic choices. Unfortunately, most oral antidiabetic therapies made available to date have not resulted in reduced incidences of MI, stroke or cardiovascular death in diabetic subjects. While metformin appears to be safe, it may lead to lethal lactic acid acidosis, especially in patients of recent MI or heart failure. An increased risk of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular related mortality has been associated with sulfonylureas and their combination with metformin. Meglitinides effects are similar to those of sulfonylureas, due to their analogous mechanism of action. Glitazones are unsafe in NYHA class III or IV due to weight gain and oedema. The cardiovascular safety outcome trials conducted with dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, saxagliptin and alogliptin showed an increase in hospitalization due to heart failure, while sitagliptin demonstrated no such effect. Evidence for cardiovascular benefits of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists has been similarly heterogeneous, with liraglutide and semaglutide reducing the risk of composite cardiovascular outcomes, but lixisenatide having no reduction or increase in cardiovascular risk. The trial conducted with sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, empagliflozin found it to be superior in reducing major cardiac events. However, there was a non-significant increase in silent MI with empagliflozin. While the FDA regulatory mandate to demonstrate the cardiovascular safety in order to approve new antidiabetic drugs, the quest for cardio friendly antidiabetics continues.

As well, these hormones can be manufactured and administered to the body aiming to treat different pathological conditions. Anabolic steroids are forms of these manufactured androgens which are excessively used by body builders aiming to gain excessive muscle weight and strength. However, the abuse of anabolic steroids is associated with variety of catastrophic complications. This dose-dependent effect especially with the differences in the prevalence and prognosis of androgen related diseases between different sexes, can indicate to dose and sex-dependent paradoxical effects of these hormones. Our group focus on studying the effect of wide range of androgen (sustanon) dosages/ concentrations on the differential expression of well-known neurotrophins, so called; BDNF, NGF, NT3 and NT4/5. This expression is studied at the level of the heart, skeletal muscles and gastrointestinal wall (muscles) of either male/ female rats or chickens. Exploring this relationship will strengthen our understanding regarding the paradoxical effect of androgen usage among athletes. On the other hand, it may identify possible pharmacological targets and modulators for variety of pathological conditions related to what we call \"androgen-neurotrophins axes\".

Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Israel Introduction: Accumulating data suggests that inflammation plays a role in the pathogenesis and treatment of mood disorders. Consistently, classic anti-inflammatory drugs exerted beneficial effects in randomized clinical trials of mood disorders patients. Moreover, psychotropic drugs possess anti-inflammatory effects. However, despite these supporting findings, many contradicting results have also been reported. Aims: (1) We investigated the effects of chronic treatment with psychotropic drugs on bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation in rats; (2) we tested the efficacy of mechanistically-different anti-inflammatory compounds in behavioral models in rats. Materials and Methods: (1) Rats were treated with psychotropic drugs (carbamazepine, lithium, haloperidol, and imipramine) for 4 weeks through a daily intraperitoneal (ip) injection. On day 29, rats were injected with vehicle or LPS. At 2 hours later, rats were sacrificed, blood was collected and different brain regions were excised. Levels of inflammatory constituents in plasma and brain were examined by ELISA. (2) Rats were treated (ip) for 2 weeks with one of the following anti-inflammatory compounds: dexamethasone, a and, JSH-23, a selective inhibitor of nuclear factor-k B. At the end of drug treatment, animals were subjected to a battery of behavioral tests. Results: Psychotropic drugs treatment resulted in both anti- and pro-inflammatory effects. Some of the drugs prominently affected the levels of particular inflammatory mediators in the plasma and specific brain regions. Similarly, the various anti-inflammatory compounds differently affected the behavioral phenotypes of rats, showing both therapeutic and negative effects. Conclusions: Our results add to the ambiguity regarding the role of anti-inflammation as a therapeutic strategy for mood disorders. It is important to elucidate the therapeutic potential of mediator/pathway-specific anti-inflammatory compounds in randomized clinical trials. Biography: Dr. Azab completed his Ph.D. in pharmacology in the Department of Clinical Pharmacology in Ben-Gurion University of the Negev (Israel), focusing on the study of anti-inflammatory drugs.

Currently, Dr. Azab is an assistant professor in Ben-Gurion University of the Negev. Major research projects in his lab: 1) Studying the role of inflammation in the pathophysiology and treatment of mood disorders; 2) searching for novel therapeutic strategies for mood disorders. University of Leuven, Belgium Voltage gated sodium channels constitute an integral component of electrical conduction in the heart and the nervous system. By depolarizing cardiomyocytes or neurons, they initiate action potentials that underlie the electro-mechanical coupling and neuronal firing. Changes in cardiac NaV function or expression levels can have severe consequences. For example, patients with loss-of-function or gain-of-function mutations in the SCN5A gene, which decodes cardiac NaV1.5, are at risk of suffering sudden cardiac death due to ventricular arrhythmias. However, it has not been possible to measure NaVs in vivo due to lacking molecular probes or techniques. To fill this gap and enhance our understanding of in vivo NaV function, we have developed the first positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer for NaVs -radiocaine. In this talk, I will present the development and in vivo characterization of radiocaine and discuss steps towards future translational perspectives.

Quest International University Perak, Malaysia In ancient times, the pharmacist practiced side-by-side with the doctor in treating a patient giving the impression of equal responsibility bearing. The two professions were legally separated in the 13th century in Europe. The pharmacist retreated to the pharmacy and compounded medication according to the prescription received and dispensed to the patient carrying out instructions of the doctor. Compounding was the independent area of practice. With mass production of pharmaceutical dosage forms, the need for compounding became less and the pharmacist focused on dispensing of prescriptions expanding into prescription screening. Three main areas of practice evolved - community pharmacy, hospital/clinical pharmacy and industrial pharmacy. Community pharmacy evolved to a place where medicines are dispensed and became discount centers, shops selling items not related to healthcare and moving away from evidencebased pharmacy. Countries vary in the extent of empowerment on the range of controlled medicines the pharmacist can deal without a prescription. Hospital/Clinical pharmacy evolved with the pharmacist being heavily involved in direct pharmaceutical care of patients while retaining custodianship of the medicine supply chain. Value creation and recognition continue to be a problem. The prescriber bears virtually the full responsibility. Prescribing by pharmacists has taken hold as well as expanded roles in administration of medicines and in medicine management. The challenge is how to develop independent areas of practice leading to responsibility bearing, value creation and recognition. Another challenge is to develop worldwide commonality of practice. The focus of training of pharmacists should be to create fullfledged practitioners rather than advisors.

It is widely expressed in cancer cell lines and primary tumour of breast, endometrium, ovaries, thyroid, lung, prostate, testicular germ cells and the brain. The high level expression of GPER-1 in breast cancer, ovarian cancer and endometrial cancer has shown association with poor survival. Due to its significant association with numerous physiological functions and breast cancers, it is emerging as a potential therapeutic target. In the search of GPER ligands, a variety of classical ER ligands have been noted to be able to interact with GPER-1 with differences in binding affinities. Some of the traditionally known ER antagonists have shown agonistic activity with GPER protein. As X-ray crystal structure GPER protein is not available, it has been a challenge in designing of GPER ligands. In this project, we studied the molecular structure requirement of GPER-1 ligands using homology model of GPER. We reported here approaches that have been used in homology modeling of GPER protein and synthesis of potential GPER ligands.

Pharmacology Department, Ankara Yildirim Beyazit University, Turkey Vascular smooth muscle (VSM) and endothelium (ET) activities are the important determinants of vascular tone. This presentation evaluates the regulatory functions of VSM and ET in human internal mammary artery (IMA) and rat aorta (RA). Potassium (K+) channels contribute to the regulation of the membrane potential in VSM cells. Membrane hyperpolarization due to efflux of K+results from the opening of K+channels and consequently vasodilation takes place. Various endogenous and exogenous substances, which form contraction and relaxation, alterthe vascular tone by interacting with their receptors in the VSM and ET. The contraction and relaxation responses of the IMA and RA can be analyzed in vitro organ baths. Acetylcholine (ACh) produces endothelium-mediated relaxation while produce vessels do not relax sufficiently by acetylcholine. ACh relaxes the ET-intact IMA and RA, it does not relax the ET-denuded IMA and RA. The KCl-induced contractions aremore stable and they last longer than those ofthe PE and 5-HT. However, the percentage of the PE and 5-HT induced contractionsare greater than that of KCl. ET and VSM play an important role in the relaxation and contractions mechanisms of the IMA and RA. The physiological characteristics of IMA and RA in the formation of vascular tone are similar to each other. Different substances, which induce the relaxation and contraction in these vessels, also causevariedresponses.

Methods: Twenty male Wistar rats were divided into two groups (n=10) and treated as follows:1-st group (Controls) - aqua destillata, p.o.; 2nd group-Bulgarian propolis in a dose 100 mg/kg bw, i.p. Two hours after single administration of the substances blood samples were analyzed by flowcytometry for CD34+ and white blood cells differential were performed using hematology analyzer. Peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) and Mouse lymphoma cell line L5178Y were cultivated in 96 well plate in culture medium RPMI-1640 with 100 U/mL Penicillin and 100 mg/mL Streptomycin. 10% Fetal bovine serum was added to the L5178Y cell line. The cells were grown in an incubator at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 for 24 hours and were treated with increasing propolis concentrations - 0, 01; 0, 1; 1, 0 and 10 mg/L. To analyze the effect of the natural product on cell viability, a cytotoxic MTT-test was used. Results: Propolis mobilized significant amount of hematopoietic stem cells in the blood stream versus controls. It also caused a significant increase in the number of leukocytes and lymphocytes in rats in comparison to controls. In human PBMC cells treated with propolis in concentrations 0, 01; 0, 1; 1, 0 and 10 mg/L the cell vitality was higher in comparison with the control cells. The percentage of living cell was increased from 106 to 135% with increasing of the propolis concentrations. In propolis treated tumor cells L5178Y the percentage of living cells decreased with increasing of propolis concentrations. The results of 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazolyl-2)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MMT) showed that concentration 0, mg/L leads to 73% cell survival, 1, 0 mg/L to 69%, and the highest concentration-10 mg/L decreased the percentage of surviving cells to 40%. Conclusion: Bulgarian propolis has no effect on the stem cells maturation but mobilize the rats stem cells in peripheral blood. In human PBMC the proliferative activity after treatment with propolis suppose the ability to influence cell differentiation. From the other side the cytotoxic effect of propolis on the tumor cell line determines its potential in anti-tumor therapy. Keywords: CD34+ cells, cell lines, proliferation, rats, Bulgarian propolis.

The acetylation rate may differ depending on N-Acetyltransferase-2 (NAT-2) activity. The aim of this research was to determine INH acetylation rate on Melanesia ethnicity from Papua, Indonesia. The rate of acetylated INH was determined based on the ratio of AcINH and INH levels in human plasma which was analysed using HPLC. The chromatographic separation was conducted using Reliant\u00ae C18 column (250x4.6mm)with temperature of 30\u00b0C, a 20 mM hexane sulphonic acid pH 2.47-methanol (65:35) as mobile phase with a flow rate of 1 mL/mins, detected at 265 nm, and vitamin B6 as an internal standard. The participants in this study were healthy subjects from Papua and 102 subjects completed the study. The blood was collected at pre-dose and 3 hours after administration of 300mg INH. The results showed that 70.59% of subjects were slow acetylators, it means that the Melanesia ethnic from Papua need more dosages to achieve the therapeutic concentration of INH.

Herein, the development of kinetic Target-Guided Synthesis (TGS) and its implementation for the identification of small molecules modulating protein-protein interactions will be presented. In kinetic Target-Guided Synthesis (TGS), the biological target is actively engaged in the irreversible assembly of its own inhibitory bidentate ligand from a pool of smaller reactive fragments. The screening method can be as simple as determining whether or not the inhibitory product has been formed in a given test mixture. To date, kinetic TGS has exclusively been applied to enzymatic targets and these TGS applications have been successful because of a unique combination of (a) the slow nature of the chemical reaction combining the two fragments into a single molecule and (b) the use of reactive fragments showing moderate to high affinity towards binding pockets of the enzyme. Compared to kinetic TGS screening of enzymes, however, the discovery of inhibitory compounds against \"undruggable\" targets is more challenging and thus requires major modifications over the existing kinetic TGS approaches. The Manetsch laboratory demonstrated that the sulfo-click reaction, an amidation reaction between thio acids and sulfonyl azides, is suitable for a kinetic TGS approach targeting the proteins of the Bcl-2 family. Furthermore, the use of a triple quadrupole mass analyzer improved the data quality and increased the throughput by approximately 200-fold rendering the platform industrial robustness.

Scaffolds based on nanofibrous membranes could allow protecting chronic skin lesion them from microbial contamination and optimal wound hydration and gas exchanges, crucial for healing, and should be a substrate able to induce cell adhesion and growth, speeding up the healing process. Given this premises the aim was the development of electrospun nanofibers based membranes as scaffolds to enhance cutaneous wound healing of chronic lesions and burns. The nanofibers were prepared starting from aqueous polymeric solutions to obtain insoluble membranes in aqueous fluids able to act as a support for cell growth, migration and proliferation. Nanofibers were loaded with either silver nanoparticles ornorfloxacin, as antimicrobial agents. Chitosan and a glycosaminoglycan or chondroitin sulfate)wereselected as biomaterials. The developed scaffolds based on biopolymers are characterized by flexible area and shape with suitable elasticity and mechanical properties, are able to maintain optimal hydration and to absorb excess of fluids, to form barrier against microbial contaminations and to release antimicrobial agents. The presence of antimicrobials agents do not impair cell adhesion (fibroblasts and endothelial cells) and proliferation in an in vitro models. The in vivo evaluation in murine burn model suggests that scaffolds are effective to enhance wound closure without signs of inflammation and adverse effects.

Department of Drug Sciences, University of Pavia, Italy This presentation proposes an overview of the development and testing of effective treatment for nail disorders, in particular onychodystrophy that is an alteration of the tropism of the nail, due to systemic and local causes. Topical treatment avoids adverse effects associated with systemic therapy. However, the effectiveness of topical therapies is limited because of the poor permeability of the lamina to the therapeutic agents applied. In fact, it must be borne in mind that the nail is basically a tortuous twist of crystalline and amorphous fibrous proteins in which only small molecules pass through. In recent years the research has mainly focused on improving transdermal permeability by chemical treatments, penetration enhancers, mechanical and physical methods. For this purpose, several \"ex vivo\" methods have been studied, including the use of bovine membranes as a human nail substitute for penetration studies. The aim of recent works was to evaluate whether and to what extent such in vitro tests can correctly predict the in vivo fate of nail lacquers. In the application of pharmaceutical lacquers used to treat nail alterations and fungal infections, the location of the film on the nail lamina and the transungueal passage of the active substance are the key factors. Hence the importance of developing topical products with appropriate formulation both in terms of medical treatment and associated cosmetic treatment. In fact, the constant use of an inappropriate cosmetic formulation can severely compromise the effectiveness of medical treatment.

New data are on derivatives (III, IV) that have a better specific capability if compared with (I) to stimulate spinal marrow recovery after trauma [2], improve bodys adaptation under physical stress [3,4], as well as demonstrate hepatoprotective properties [5-7]. We observed the most pronounced hepatoprotective properties of derivative (III) [6], because the compound results to minimum liver injury of steatosis and necrosisand normalize of biochemical parameters in rats with toxic hepatitis induced by CCl4. It was revealed the effect of the compound (III) on the antioxidative system and on the cytokines level in liver during toxic influence of CCl4. The number of pathological changed hepatocytes as fatty, balloon and hydropic dystrophy were decreased if injected with (III). The derivative (III) is more effective in comparison with other derivatives of Xymedon as well as with Xymedon, L-ascorbic acid, their mix and their co-administration and the drug Thiotriazolinum. The research was financed by Russian Science Foundation grant number 14-50-00014.

Department of Pharmaceutical and Biomedical Sciences, Ohio Northern University, USA Camptothecin (CPT) is a promising anti-cancer agent with high efficacy against a variety of solid tumors. The lactone ring of CPT is essential for the anti-tumor activity but is unstable in vivo. A pro-drug of CPT, CZ48, has been developed is enzymatically hydrolyzed in vivo to active CPT. For its anti-cancer activity, CPT levels need to be sustained and maintained over a period of time, which means the requirement for a continuous delivery of CZ48. It has been demonstrated that I.V. bolus injection of CZ48 provided higher concentrations of the active CPT compared to direct dosing of CPT at the same dosing level in Sprague-Dawley rats. Also, it was shown that CZ48 dosing resulted in sustained plasma levels of CPT for five hours in this animal model. Therefore, if we extrapolate these observations to man, we would expect to see this pattern of sustained CPT levels upon administration of the pro-drug, CZ48. This means delivery of CZ48 can achieve a continuous, therapeutically relevant drug concentration of CPT for anti-neoplastic indications. Transdermal delivery satisfies the requirement for continuous CZ48 delivery since it allows for predictable and controlled drug permeation through the skin. A promising approach to deliver drug molecules transdermally is through a microemulsion formulation. Our in vitro permeation data through excised rat skin as well as in vivo data upon topical application in Swiss-nude micedemonstrate the feasibility of achieving sustained plasma levels of CPT, required for anti-tumor activity, upon transdermal application of the pro-drug, CZ48.

In skin inflammatory diseases, immune cells are the main key actors and thus the target of therapeutic treatments. Targeting of certain cell populations like dendritic cells may be achieved by means of biocompatible nanocarriers that can translocate to the skin viable layers. Thermoresponsive polyglycerol-based nanogels (tNGs) have been shown to penetrate very efficiently the outermost skin barrier and to be valuable tools for delivery of drugs to skin. In order to develop new types of formulations for anti-inflammatory dermatotherapy, tacrolimus, a high molecular weight, poorly skin penetrating drug, was loaded on thermoresponsive nanogels. Compared toa commercial formulation (Protopic 0.1%), the water-based nanogel formulation had comparable effects on an inflammatory skin model. On the other side, in the case of skin and wound infections, high local concentrations of the active material are necessary to eradicate the invading microorganism and avoid the development of resistances. At this purpose, we used PVP-based foils and nanofibers to deliver antimicrobial drugs in an infected wound model based on ex vivo human skin. Different delivery profiles were achieved depending on the used drug delivery system. Nanocarriers efficiently delivered drugs across the skin barrier with significant inhibitory effects on immune cells where as nanofibers and foils provided a sustained drug concentration within the skin tissue as well as very efficient antimicrobial effects. We conclude that nanotechnology-based drug delivery systems offer attractive alternatives to conventional drug formulations.

The cause of IPF is still unknown but it is a heterogeneous condition in which the aberrant deposition of extracellular matrix leads to extensive lung remodeling. This remodeling is a consequence of inflammatory responses, but the mechanisms involved are poorly understood. In this study, we first analyzed a bleomycin-induced mouse model, which showed that higher expression of IL-1, but not IL-18, was correlated to pulmonary cell infiltration and fibrosis. Then, we found that peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from IPF patients released higher levels of IL-1 and IL-18 in a NLRP3- and calpainin-dependent manner after LPS\u00b1ATP. Instead, the activation of the AIM2 inflammasome induced the release of IL-1 in a caspase-1/-8 independent manner; whereas IL-18 release was caspase-1-dependent. These effects correlated with the release of the pro-fibrotic TGF-, which was induced by AIM2 activation in a caspase-1- and TLR4-independent manner, but dependent on IL-1. In this context, the activation of AIM2 induced the release of caspase-4 from IPF-derived PBMCs, which correlated with the mRNA levels of this caspase that was higher in IPF than in healthy PBMCs. In conclusion, our findings identify a novel molecular mechanism whereby the activation of AIM2 could lead to the activation of the non-canonical inflammasome (caspase-4-dependent), that induces the release of IL-1 responsible for the release of TGF- from PBMCs of IPF patients.

Department of Mechanical Engineering, Technical University of Denmark, Denmark Mucus represents \"first defense line\" of all mucosal surfaces, such as gastrointestinal, cervical, ocular, respiratory lines against chemical, enzymatic, microbial, and mechanical insult. While pathogenic colonization by microbes starts from adhesion on mucus surface, they have to overcome the mechanical integrity of mucus gels in order to reach the apical surface of epithelial cells. Ironically, this defensive behavior of mucus gels acts as physical barrier when it is needed to deliver drug molecules or functional foods to target cells or tissues. Mucoadhesive polymers have been proposed as one of potent ways to enable the traverse of drugloaded particles through mucus gel layers based on strong entanglement with mucin network. Nevertheless, it is often not sufficient to reach ultimate goal, i.e. delivery of drugs to target cells, due to relatively short turnover time and frequent clearance of mucus gels. It is thus necessary to develop more effective means to engineer particles that can efficiently \"penetrate through\" the barrier for this purpose. In this study, we have employed atomic force microscopy (AFM) as an experimental approach/model to characterize the nanomechanical properties of mucus gels and the interaction with microbes and drug/function nutrients. Mucus was acquired by scraping from a freshly slaughtered pigs stomach and intestine, and was further cleaned according to a standard procedure. Polyethylene (PE) or silica (SiOx) colloidal particles were attached to AFM probes, representing model microbes or drug molecules interacting with mucus layers. Youngs moduli of both mucus samples were determined to be in kPa range. In-depth discussion on the mechanical properties of pig intestine mucus, the influence of size and surface chemistry of the colloidal probe on the compression/penetration, as well as the force/energy required for a micro-sized particle to overcome and penetrate through the mucus layers will be provided.

Department of Synthetic Chemistry and Biological Chemistry, Graduate School of Engineering, Kyoto University, Japan Many successful applications reported in the literature speak well for the power of the flow-microreactor method in chemical synthesis. The reaction time in a flow microreactor is defined as the residence time between a reagent inlet and the quencher inlet, which can be controlled precisely and reduced to millisecond order by adjusting the length between these positions and the flow speed. Such a feature of flow microreactors enables the use of short-lived highly reactive intermediates for synthesis. Various intermediates can be rapidly generated and transferred to another location in the flow system for use in subsequent reactions before they decompose. Protecting-group-free synthesis has received significant recent research interest in the context of ideal synthesis they decompose. Protecting-group-free synthesis has received significant recent research interest in the context of ideal synthesis and green sustainable chemistry. In general, organolithium species react with electrophilic functional groups very rapidly, and therefore such functional groups should be protected before an organolithium reaction, if they are not involved in the desired transformation. If organolithium chemistry could be free from such a limitation, its power would be greatly enhanced. A flow microreactor enables such protecting-group-free organolithium reactions by choosing the appropriate residence time and the reaction temperature. Organolithium species bearing alkoxycarbonyl, nitro, ketone and aldehyde carbonyl groups can be generated by lithiation of the corresponding organic halides and reacted with various electrophiles using a flow microreactor system. In this presentation, we report that a flow microreactor system enables the generation of various unstable organolithium compounds.

University of Pancasila, Indonesia The aim of this study was to compare the antibacterial activity of the pathogenic bacterias. The method to formulate the nanoparticles extract was ionic gelation using chitosan and sodium tripolyphosphate. The resulting nanoparticles were evaluated for particle size, zeta potential and morphology. The nanoparticle showed a good result, as the particle size was 53.25 nm and polydispersity index was 0.442, with the zeta potential value of + 31.5. The antibacterial activity result showed that the extract could inhibit the growth of Salmonella thypi, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus subtilis in concentration of 500 ppm. However, the extract could not inhibit the growth of Escherichia coli in all tested concentrations. The nanoparticles showed an antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella thypi in the concentration of 250 up to 500 ppm where as Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis in concentration of 500 ppm. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the extract against Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis were 400 ppm and against Salmonella thypi in concentration of 500 ppm. n addition, the MIC of Escherichia coli was more than 500 ppm. The MIC of the nanoparticles against Staphylococcus aureus was 300 ppm while against Bacillus subtilis and Salmonella thypi 400 ppm and against Escherichia coli 500 ppm. Accordingly, the nanoparticles have a promising strategy to formulate the extracts to improve the antibacterial activity.

Howard University, USA Brusatol has been reported to possess a unique potential to target two distinct pathways that are important in the progression of cancers by its specific action on nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and as a global protein synthesis inhibitor. Due to its non-selective mechanisms of action, it is unlikely that brusatol can be administered as a therapeutic agent without substantial host toxicity. The oil-in-water emulsification solvent diffusion method was modified to prepare brusatol-loaded, polyethylene glycol-coated polylactide-co-glycolide nanoparticles. Scanning electron microscopy revealed the formation of nanoparticles and average size was determined by dynamic light scattering. Drug content of the nanoparticle formulation was determined by high performance liquid chromatography. The in vitro release isotherm showed a biphasic and sustained release of the encapsulated drug. Toxicity of the brusatol-loaded nanoparticles in prostate cancer cell lines was evaluated over 120 hours using the Cell Titer 96\u00ae Non-Radioactive Cell Proliferation Assay. In vitro cytotoxicity data revealed that both brusatol-loaded nanoparticles and the control brusatol solutions at the same concentrations exhibited dose-dependent toxicity to PC-3 and LNCaP prostate cancer cell lines at the concentrations used in this study with the nanoparticle formulation showing more toxicity to both cell lines. Cellular uptake of nanoparticles was evaluated using confocal microscopy after a 6-hour rhodamine-123-loaded cells. Data showed internalization of the nanoparticles. This study shows that the nanoparticle formulation of brusatol can overcome delivery challenges and facilitate the clinical translation of the compound for the treatment of cancers.

Kazan Scientific Center of Russian Academy of Sciences, Russia Currently, the drugs used in chemotherapy do not have a desired effect, due to their low selectivity and bioavailability, as well as high toxicity, which causes many side effects. It is known that compounds containing uracil fragment can exhibit biological activity through binding to different substrates. It is also found that the introduction of azole heterocycles leads to increased antimicrobial activity of compounds. Previously it was shown thatthe derivatives of 1, 3-bis(alkyl)-6(5)-substituted uracil containing onium groups exhibit antimicrobial activity and low cytotoxicity in experiments on mammalian cells [1]. We have studied antimicrobial and anticancer activity, cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of new 1, 3-bis(alkyl)-6-methyluracil with 1, 2, 3- and 1, 2, 4-triazolium moieties. The studied compounds have been tested for antimicrobial activity in relation to standard test strains of bacteria and fungi. Minimal Inhibitory Concentration of the leader compounds against Gram-positive bacteria is 0.4-4.0 mg/l and against Gram-negative bacteria - 8.0-31.3 mg/l. Antifungal activity of the investigated drugs in concentrations of 0.9-4.0 mg/l was shown. Then the mechanism of DNA damaging effect in the SOS-lux test was investigated. The given compounds do not have genotoxic properties and showed no DNA-damaging effect. The study of cytotoxic effect was carried out using the Cytell Cell Imaging system (GE Helthcare Life Science, Sweden). The compounds exhibiting high activity against tumor cell lines (MCF-7, A549, M-HeLa) and possessing low toxicity on normal human cell lines (WI-38 VA 13 subline 2RA, Chang liver) were identified. The results of this work show that the investigated compounds can be considered as potential antimicrobial agents and used as key components for new drugs.

Her main research topic is the development of new antimicrobial and anticancer drugs using new chemical compounds.\" Kazan Scientific Center of Russian Academy of Sciences, Russia The urgency of the problem of new antimicrobial drugs development is determined by constant appearance of multi resistant micro organisms. Previously it was shown that 1, 3-bis(alkyl)-6(5)-substituteduracilcontaining onium groups have a wide range of antimicrobial activity and low cytotoxicity in experiments on mammalian cells [1, 2 ]. We have studied antimicrobial activity, mechanism of action, cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of new macrocyclic and acyclic derivatives of 1, 3-bis(alkyl)-chinazoline-2, 4-dione. The studied compounds have been tested for antimicrobial activity in relation to standard test strains of several pathogenic bacteria andfungi. The most active compoundswere investigated against resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus. It has been found that the main structural factor influencing antimicrobial activity of compounds is atype of an alkyl radical in the onium group. It is shown that the macrocyclic and acyclic derivatives of 1, 3-bis(alkyl)-chinazoline-2, 4- dione have a high antibacterial activity against S. aureus strains resistant to ciprofloxacin and ammoxicillin. Antimicrobial activity against standard test strains of bacteria and fungi is manifested at the level of well-known drugs. The investigated compounds do not exhibit genotoxicity, show low cytotoxicity to mammalian cells andinhibite the glucose dehydrogenases activity of Staphylococcus aureus 209P and Candida albicans 855-653. Thus, a new class of biologically active compounds, which may be of significant interest for the development of new promising antimicrobial agents, was investigated.

Indicaxanthin is a betalain pigment from cactus pear fruit, capable of modulating specific redox-driven pathways involved in the inflammatory reaction in vitro (1). Interestingly, indicaxanthin is bioavailable and exerts strong anti-inflammatory effects when orally administered at nutritionally-relevant doses in rats (2). A causative link between inflammation and melanoma has recently been explored. In line with this, we investigated the antitumor potential of indicaxanthin vs melanoma both in vitro and in in vivo mouse model. Indicaxanthin inhibited proliferation of human A375 melanoma cells. The inhibition measured at 24h was concentrationdependent in the range between 50 and 200 \u00b5M, with a maximum of 52% at the highest concentration. Indicaxanthin induced cell apoptosis as cytofluorimetrically revealed by double AnnexinV/PI staining. Moreover indicaxanthin time-dependently inhibited the activation of NF-kB, a transcriptional factor conferring tumor survival capacity and escape from apoptosis. In addition, the expression of Bcl-2 and c-FLIP, two inhibitors of apoptosis the expression of which is modulated by NF-kB, was decreased. More importantly, indicaxanthin (3.2 mg/kg) orally-administered for 15 days to mice when the injected tumor had reached an average 3-4 mm diameter, induced a reduction of tumor volume (86%) and weight (83%).

Department of Pharmacy, University of Salerno, Italy Glycosaminoglycans are polysaccharides of the extracellular matrix supporting skin wound closure. Mesoglycan is a mixture of glycosaminoglycans such as chondroitin-, dermatan-, heparan-sulfate and heparin. Glycosaminoglycans may contribute to the re-epithelialization in the skin wound healing, as components of the extracellular matrix. Here we describe, for the first time, the effects of mesoglycan in vitro cultures of adult epidermal keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts. Once confirmed the lack of cytotoxicity by mesoglycan, we have shown the increase of S and G2 phases of fibroblasts cell cycle distribution. We further report the strong induction of cell migration rate and invasion capability on both cell lines, two key processes of wound repair. In support of these results, we found significant cytoskeletal reorganization, following the treatments with mesoglycan, as confirmed by the formation of F-actin stress fibers. Additionally, together with a significant reduction of E-cadherin, keratinocytes showed an increase of CD44 expression and the translocation of ezrin to the plasma membrane. Furthermore, as showed by immunofluorescence assay, fibroblasts treated with mesoglycan exhibited the increase of Fibroblast Activated Protein and a remarkable change in shape and orientation, two common features of reactive stromal fibroblasts. Finally, we show the in vitro effects of mesoglycan in the new vessels formation by endothelial cells, since angiogenesis represents a key moment in wound healing. We found a strong increase of migration and invasion rates of these cells treated with mesoglycan, which mediate the activation of the pathway triggered by CD44 receptor. Interestingly, endothelial cells form longer capillary-like structures with a great number of branches, in the presence of the same treatments. Thus, the device, thanks to the mesoglycan, leads the cells to the Endothelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition, suggesting the switch to a fibroblast-like phenotype, as shown by immunofluorescence assays. In conclusion, based on these findings we suggest that mesoglycanmay be able to accelerate the healing process in venous skin ulcers, principally enhancing re-epithelialization granulation processes.

Results: The results of phytochemical screening using Farnsworth method showed the ethanol extract containing secondary metabolite of tannin compound, polyphenol, steroid, triterpenoid, quinone, monoterpenoid and sesquiterpenoid. The results of hair fertilizer testing using Tanaka method showed that ethanol extract and water extract with 20%, 15%, 10% concentration significantly could fertilize hair with test for 18 days. Extracts of ethanol with levels greater than 10% showed better results. Water fraction of 10% appeared to show the best result for rabbit hair growth overcome minoxidil. Conclusions: This work found that the concentration of 10% ethanol extract of S. coccinea and its water fractions were affective for hair growth on male rabbits. It was suggested, however, for further study to determine the compound which was responsible by using elucidation methods and being tested to volunteers.
