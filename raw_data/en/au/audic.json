This plant pigment, found in deeply colored fruits and vegetables, is one of the most-studied and prevalent antioxidant flavonoids.REF#568 REF#569 Red wine, berries, or tea's health benefits are all superfoods that contain Quercetin. Since its discovery, [Quercetin](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/herbs/quercetin) has been studied for a wide range of health benefits\u2014from heart health and exercise recovery to aging and inflammation, and it's a popular ingredient in supplements and [skin care](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/how-to-use-herbs-for-skincare).* In this article, we break down the science behind the health benefits of [Quercetin](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/herbs/quercetin). Including: - What it is - How it works - 9 demonstrated health benefits - The best food sources - How to choose a quality Quercetin supplement or skin care product. What is Quercetin? [Quercetin](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/herbs/quercetin) is a flavonoid antioxidant in various types of deeply colored fruits, vegetables, and herbs, such as berries and leafy green vegetables. What is a flavonoid antioxidant, exactly? Let's break this down, starting with flavonoids. Flavonoids are a diverse group of natural substances found in fruits, vegetables, herbs, nuts, wine, and seeds. As previously mentioned, flavonoids are plant pigments that give plants their color.REF#570 [Quercetin](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/herbs/quercetin) is an important of 6 sub-classes of flavonoid compounds.REF#571 Antioxidants are man-made or natural substances that may prevent or delay cell damage from excess free radicals (unstable molecules).REF#572 Free radical damage can lead to oxidation of the cells resulting in premature aging, pain, and various ailments.. Antioxidants can be found in fruits, vegetables, herbs, wine, meats, and other foods. Some antioxidants, like glutathione, are manufactured by our bodies. Some examples of antioxidants include vitamins C, and E, selenium, carotenoids such as Lycopene, and flavonoids such as [Quercetin](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/herbs/quercetin). 9 Incredible Benefits of Quercetin As an antioxidant, [Quercetin](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/herbs/quercetin) has demonstrated beneficial effects on cell health and supporting normal inflammation.* These antioxidant properties can produce a cascade of beneficial effects on various organs, systems, and various health concerns. Let's explore how [Quercetin](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/herbs/quercetin) helps support histamine function, heart health, endurance, weight, inflammatory response, and more.* #1: Quercetin May Support Normal Histamine Function & Skin Inflammatory Response Quercetin supplements are right up there, with raw, local honey as a popular go-to during pollen season. And according to research, if you suffer during pollen season, [Quercetin](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/herbs/quercetin) may be worth a try. Studies have demonstrated that Quercetin may provide relief by promoting normal immune response and histamine secretion.REF#573 REF#574 [Quercetin](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/herbs/quercetin) has also demonstrated efficacy in [supporting skin health](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/natural-botox-alternatives) during an allergic reaction. In a study titled: \"Quercetin Is More Effective than Cromolyn in Blocking Human Mast Cell Cytokine Release and Inhibits Contact Dermatitis and Photosensitivity in Humans\"REF#575, researchers found Quercetin worked by supporting normal inflammatory levels in mast cells. This led to a reduction of symptoms that would typically occur during a contact- [allergy](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/supporting-your-health-during-allergy-season) reaction. Herbalists and integrative health experts often recommend taking Quercetin, and other respiratory- and sinus-support herbs and foods like Nettles or local honey, proactively to prevent pollen-related symptoms.* Get more tips for a healthier pollen season in [Breathe Easy with Tips and Herbs for Respiratory Health.](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/breathe-easy-with-tips-and-herbs-for-respiratory-health) Additionally, check out Gaia Herbs Quercetin May Aid Exercise Endurance & Immunity If you're looking for a helpful nutrient to support your workouts, Quercetin may provide some endurance and immune benefits for athletes and novices.* A review published in Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise found [Quercetin](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/herbs/quercetin) provided a statistically significant benefit in human endurance exercise capacity and endurance exercise performance.REF#576 The authors noted that larger groups needed more research to draw a more concrete consensus. Regarding immunity during intense exercise, a randomized control trial published in Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise tested the effects of Quercetin and ECGS supplementation on exercise performance, mitochondrial muscle biogenesis, and changes in measures of immunity and inflammation before and after three days of heavy exertion in cyclists. The results showed that supplementing 1000 mg of quercetin alone three weeks before, during, and two weeks after three days of 3 hours of cycling in the winter supported immunity and upper respiratory health.REF#577 The research on Quercetin and exercise is in its infancy. However, these early studies suggest a potential benefit for supporting a healthier and more effective workout. Interested in incorporating herbal supplements into your workouts? Gaia Herbs [Turmeric Supreme\u00ae Joint](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/products/turmeric-supreme-joint) with [Turmeric](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/herbs/turmeric), [Quercetin](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/herbs/quercetin), and herbs is a great place to start. #3: Quercetin May Support a Healthy Heart It's not news that antioxidants in foods like red grapes, leafy greens, and other superfoods can support heart health. However, flavonoids like Quercetin have demonstrated specific and promising [benefits for cardiovascular health](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/recognizing-resveratrol).* According to a scientific paper titled: \"Therapeutic potential of Quercetin as a cardiovascular agent\" published in the European Journal of Medicinal Chemistry Quercetin has demonstrated a variety of supportive effects on cholesterol, inflammatory response, nitric oxide, and endothelial function under conditions of oxidative stress, platelet function, and protection from oxidative damage.REF#578 The authors went on to say, \"The role of quercetin and its derivatives may go beyond their existence in food and has potential as a lead molecule in drug development programs.\" This explains why doctors, dietitians, nutritionists, and integrative healthcare practitioners emphasize the importance of \"eating the rainbow.\" Plant pigment-flavonoids offer potentially powerful support for your heart and cardiovascular system. Gaia Herbs [Turmeric Supreme\u00ae Heart Health](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/products/resveratrol-150) contains Quercetin and other heart-supportive organic herbs such as Coleus, Ginger, Hawthorn, Japanese Knotweed, and Turmeric (with Black Pepper for absorption).* #4: Quercetin May Support the Gut Microbiome We hear a lot about the importance of the gut microbiome these days. That's because this vast and complex ecosystem significantly influences digestion, brain health, the nervous system, oral health, the immune system, the liver, reproductive organs, inflammatory response, the heart and cardiovascular system, and the metabolic system.*REF#579 REF#580 REF#581REF#582 REF#583 REF#584 REF#585 In other words, our gut health has the potential to impact every other organ and system in our bodies. The gut microbiome has also been linked to various chronic conditions, with many experts re-visiting Hippocrates' famous theory that \"all disease begins in the gut.\"REF#586 The bottom line is, tending your gut microbiome is essential to creating optimal physical, mental, and emotional well-being. When it comes to nurturing your gut microbiome, the Quercetin found in gut-healthy plants packs a friendly one-two punch: #1: Quercetin is one of the few molecules known to support mast cell stabilizing in the gut via its antioxidant effects (mast cells are a type of immune cell) and provide protective benefits to the gastrointestinal lining.*REF#587 These actions help promote intestinal integrity of the gut mucosa (a protective substance in the gut lining), which sets the stage for a healthy and diverse microbiome. #2: Quercetin has [prebiotic benefits](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/prebiotics), meaning it helps feed beneficial gut bacteria. This has been shown beneficial for supporting healthy gut microbiota balance and benefitting the gut-liver axis.REF#588 Getting more Quercetin is one of many ways to tend your gut microbiome.

For this reason, it's been studied as a potential drug-free option for occasional pain. According to a review published in the journal Current Neuropharmacology, the studies reviewed showed Quercetin \"exerts potent analgesic effects\" by supporting normal inflammation and its role in regulating oxidative stress caused by free radicals. It's also demonstrated supportive benefits on modulation of synaptic plasticity (changes in the brain), the GABAergic system (a regulator of cognitive and emotional processing), and the opioidergic system (a pain control system).REF#589 For occasional aches, pains, and joint mobility Gaia Herbs offers [Turmeric Supreme\u00ae Joint](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/products/turmeric-supreme-joint) with Turmeric, Ginger, Quercetin, and Black Pepper for absorption.* To learn more about natural alternatives, check out: [7 Best Herbs for Everyday Pain to Support Additional Pain Relief and Restore Balance.](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/herbs-for-pain) #6: Quercetin + Turmeric Promote Wound Healing We've previously written about [the evidence supporting Turmeric and Curcumin's benefits for skin health and wound healing](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/turmeric-benefits-skin).* Evidence also suggests Quercetin combined with Turmeric may create a similar effect. In a 2022 study published in the International Journal of Molecular Science entitled: \"Effects of Quercetin and Curcumin Combination on Antibacterial, Antioxidant, In Vitro Wound Healing and Migration of Human Dermal Fibroblast Cells,\" researchers found a mixture of Quercetin and curcuminoids [ (the active plant compounds in Turmeric)](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/curcumin-vs-turmeric) at a 3:1 ratio applied topically was effective at promoting wound healing. The scientists believe the combination supports dermal bacterial balance, cell migration (skin cell migration is an essential part of wound healing), and its antioxidant actions.REF#590 Learn more about the power of Turmeric in [Turmeric: The Essential Guide.](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/turmeric) #7: Quercetin May be Helpful for Weight Management Polyphenols, like Quercetin, [Resveratrol](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/recognizing-resveratrol) (found in wine and red grapes), and [curcumin (found in Turmeric](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/curcumin-vs-turmeric)), have shown great potential for supporting various aspects of health.* However, few people are aware of their potential benefits for weight management.* In a review entitled: \"The Beneficial Effects of Quercetin, Curcumin, and Resveratrol in Obesity,\" researchers studied the effects of various polyphenols/antioxidants on weight management. After reviewing several published studies, they concluded that current research suggests polyphenols such as Quercetin, Curcumin, and [Resveratrol](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/recognizing-resveratrol) can benefit weight management via their antioxidant effects on cell health, inflammatory response, and the production of fat and fatty tissue.REF#591 This is one of many reasons foods and beverages like [green tea](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/herbs/green-tea), berries, and colorful vegetables are recommended for weight loss. - They are high in [high water and fiber](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/where-can-i-find-quercetin-foods), which make them filling. - They're low in calories and dense in nutrients. - They're a rich source of naturally occurring and potentially slimming polyphenols.* Gaia Herbs offers several products Healthy Joints Joints can take a beating as we age, resulting in aches, pains, or even severe mobility challenges. This is especially true for former athletes or those who have lived a very active lifestyle. Fortunately, there are [natural options to help support joint health and mobility](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/4-ways-to-support-joint-health) so you can maintain an active and healthy lifestyle. Once again, Quercetin and Turmeric have demonstrated a beneficial symbiotic relationship for promoting healthy joints. According to a study published in The Journal of Nutritional Biochemistry, the combination of Curcumin and Quercetin works by suppressing the expression of enzymes that degrade cartilage over time.REF#592 Curcumin and Quercetin have also been shown effective for supporting normal inflammatory response, immune response, synoviocyte proliferation (synoviocytes are a type of cell that lines the inner surface of joints tendons), and angiogenesis (the process in which new blood vessels are formed to deliver oxygen and nutrients to tissues). [[](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16807698/)REF#593 If you're interested in trying Quercetin and Curcumin for joint health, check out with Turmeric, Devil's Black Pepper for absorption. #9: Quercetin Promotes Normal Immune Function The immune system is typically viewed as a first line of defense against unwanted pathogens. However, the immune system also plays an essential role in the inflammatory process by releasing pro-inflammatory chemicals like cytokines. Quercetin's antioxidant properties support normal immune function by promoting normal levels of inflammation. It's also been shown effective for supporting normal bacterial levels, histamine production and gut health (as discussed earlier), and blood cell health.REF#593 In other words, Quercetin provides potentially diverse support for our immune system.
