Homoeopathy is based on the principle that like cures like. If you are feeling unwell or unhappy, homoeopathy recognises that your symptoms may be evidence of disharmony within your body. Homoeopathy uses minute quantities of natural substances. Homoeopathic remedies are non-toxic, they do not cause side effects, and they aim at stimulating your body's own healing powers. Homoeopathy can safely be used in combination with conventional medicine - but if you have any concerns, do check with your GP. Papers in the Lancet and the British Medical Journal have confirmed homoeopathy's effectiveness. How Could it Help Me? Homeopathy is used for an extremely wide range of health conditions. Many practitioners believe it can help with any condition. Among the most common conditions that people seek homeopathic treatment for are: - asthma - ear infections - hay fever - mental health conditions, such as depression, grief,trauma, stress and anxiety - allergies, such as food allergies - dermatitis (an allergic skin condition) - arthritis - Hormonal problems What to Expect? We need to know all about you, so during our consultations with you we'll ask you a wide range of questions about your lifestyle, diet, likes and dislikes, and medical history. These will be useful pointers towards a final diagnosis. Only when we have built up a complete picture of you will we prescribe a safe, gentle homoeopathic remedy. FAQ's How long is a session? Depending upon your symptoms a session could range from 30 minutes to 60 minutes. Is Homeopathy Safe? Homeopathy is perfectly safe. This is because homeopathic medicines are made from a very small amount of the active ingredient. Are there any Side Effects to Homeopathy Medicine? Unlike some conventional drugs, homeopathic medicines are non-addictive and have no dangerous side-effects. Homeopathy is safe to use for babies, children and pregnant or breastfeeding women. And we always recommend that children and babies are also seen by your GP. "}
