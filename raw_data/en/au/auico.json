The causes for ADHD are multifactorial and requiring a multifaceted treatment approach. Dietary modification and some nutrients play a major role in the management of ADHD and should be considered as part of the treatment protocol. Objectives: To formulate and standardize a nutritious cookie with emphasis on omega\"3, zinc and magnesium rich food sources and to evaluate the outcome (reducing the symptoms of hyperactivity, inattentiveness and impulsivity) of supplementation. Materials and methods: The Purposive random sampling technique was conducted on 16 children in the age group of 4\"8 years (boys) diagnosed with ADHD. They were segregated as study and control group (eight children in each group). The study group was supplemented cookies rich with omega\"3, zinc and magnesium rich food sources over a period of 8 weeks + 4 days. Behavior was assessed at the baseline and at the end of the supplementation period using Child behavior checklist (CBCL). Results: Following 8 weeks+ 4 days of supplementation, the study group children showed a significant reduction in symptoms such as inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity (p<0.001). Though there was a reduction in the total and ADHD scores in the control group but still, it was not statistically significant. Conclusion: The results conclude that omega\"3, zinc and magnesium enriched snack has a beneficial effect in reducing ADHD symptoms in study group children and long term consumption of foods rich in these nutrients can bring about a greater change in their behavior and can improve the quality of life.", "sitename": "Journal of Indian Dietetics Association", "date": "2021-06-07", "cleaned_text": "The Effect Of Supplementation Of Omega\"3, Zinc And Magnesium Rich Snack In Reducing The Neurobehavioral Symptoms In Children With Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)\" A Pilot Study [Jump To Scoring, micronutrients, disorder by impulsivity and hyperactivity.
