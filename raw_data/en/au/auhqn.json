What is \"integrative medicine\"? [Watch this 2 minute video in which Dr. Andrew Weil answers the question \"What is Integrative Medicine?\"](https://youtu.be/4pXsm3qaFIk) Integrative medicine is a model of patient-centered care that involves not just the body and mind of a person seeking medical services but also their spirit, environment, community, and relationship they have to their sense of self. The job of the integrative medicine physician is to provide expert guidance and counseling on a patient's path to wholeness, balance, and stability by using evidence-based alternative and conventional approaches to treatment alongside health promotion and prevention of illness. Vital to this endeavor is the physician's own state of wellness that allows them to serve others with the utmost dignity, presence, and care. Integrative medicine physicians also collaborate interprofessionally with healers from other traditions such as Traditional Chinese Medicine and Ayurveda. The Osher Center at Vanderbilt University created the following visual to illustrate an integrative approach to patient wellness.
