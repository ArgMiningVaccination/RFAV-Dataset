Herbal therapy is a form of holistic treatment that has been used for thousands of years. It involves relying on the therapeutic properties of various herbs and plants to promote healing. While most often encapsulated in a pill, herbs can be used in oils, tinctures, granular extracts, lotions, and creams. The herbs can either be used alone or as part of a formula. When treatment is successful, herbal therapy can: - Eliminate pain - Support the immune system - Reduce inflammation - Improve blood flow - Promote the aging of cancer cells - Eliminate the need for medication As with any kind of veterinary treatment, you should never begin treatment without a diagnosis. Treatment recommendations can be made by one of our veterinarians who will then oversee your pet's individual case.
