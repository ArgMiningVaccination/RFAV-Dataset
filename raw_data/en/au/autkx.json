Flagler sat cross-legged on the floor of Taylor's bathroom as they chatted away. But when Taylor's assistant Tim Mendelson walked in and told them that a friend of a friend had passed away from AIDS-related causes that day, the mood in the room changed dramatically. \"He really doesn't have anyone and he has no money,\" Mendelson told them. There was no money even to bury him. Taylor told Mendelson to get her business manager on the phone, because she wanted to arrange for his burial. Mendelson called his office and was told that it would have to wait until Monday. When he relayed the message to Taylor, she threw the brush she was using down on the bathroom counter and her eyes went wild. \"We will not fucking wait until Monday. We will do it right now. Get him on the phone again. I want to talk to him. No mother's son is going to lay on a cold, hard slab for the weekend when I can do something to stop it.\" When Mendelson called him back and handed her the phone, Taylor made her message crystal clear: \"I don't care what time it is! Get that money over to the funeral home. Now.\" She was just as furious as she had been in 1985, 13 years earlier, when she became the most high-profile and most dedicated celebrity to shine a spotlight on a virus that was ravaging the gay community and further isolating people who were already ostracized by society. She had been fighting against injustice most of her life. \"The most awful thing of all,\" she famously said, \"is to be numb.\" In 1944, when she was 12 years old, Taylor played the lead in National Velvet and became a heroine to girls around the world. She was the last star created by the Hollywood studio system, and her global fame is rivaled only by a handful of other women: Jackie Kennedy, Marilyn Monroe, and Queen Elizabeth II. Kennedy (who was fascinated by Taylor) withdrew into a private world, Monroe collapsed under the pressure, and the queen was buffered by the walls of Buckingham Palace. Taylor, by contrast, flourished. In 1963, when Taylor was just 31 years old, The New Yorker magazine's film critic Brendan Gill noted that she was \"less an actress by now than a great natural wonder, like Niagara or the Alps.\" She made 56 films and 10 television movies over nearly 60 years, but her lust for life has eclipsed her professional accomplishments. She is famous, even infamous, for her eight marriages to seven different men. By the time she was 26, she was twice divorced and once widowed. Her stardom was organic and so much a part of who she was. Long after she stopped acting, the drama surrounding her personal life was on display on magazine covers at every supermarket checkout counter in the world. But beneath the psychic clutter of her own mythology was a bawdy woman, quick to laughter and self-deprecation. What is most remarkable about Taylor is not how she maintained a stratospheric level of celebrity, it is the way that she singularly turned it into a force for change that saved countless lives and inspired so many others to follow her lead. \"I resented my fame,\" she once said, \"until I realized I could use it.\" It is impossible to overstate the fear and bigotry surrounding HIV and AIDS in the 1980s. Crosses were burned in front of AIDS patients' houses; postal workers refused to deliver mail to people with AIDS, fearful that any human contact could spread the virus; a government worker burned her dress after handling an application touched by a person with AIDS; people would not eat at restaurants if the waiter was gay; children with AIDS were being cast out of their communities. People living with HIV and AIDS were being denied jobs and life insurance, and they were completely alienated and ostracized. The disease confounded the medical community; it was a mystery that in its earliest years was ravaging the bodies of previously healthy young men. On July 3, 1981, The New York Times published an article, \"Rare Cancer Seen in 41 Homosexuals.\" By the end of that year, 337 cases of the lethal disease thought to be a rare cancer called Kaposi's sarcoma were diagnosed. In 1982, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention referred to the virus for the first time as acquired immune deficiency syndrome, or AIDS. In 1984, 130,400 new HIV infections were reported globally. At first, no one knew how the disease was transmitted. The July 1985 cover of Life declared: \"Now No One Is Safe From AIDS.\" President Ronald Reagan did not utter the name of the disease until that September, and then it was only to respond to a reporter's question. In 1987, US surgeon general C. Everett Koop called for the use of condoms and sex education to prevent the spread of the virus, which cripples the body's immune system. But it was not until the spring of 1987 when Reagan gave a major speech about AIDS\u2014at Taylor's urging. By the end of the year, 40,809 Americans had died. Almost at the exact time, a reactionary backlash rose, led by figures like Anita Bryant and Jerry Falwell Sr., whose Moral Majority fought against recognizing the rights of gay people. Homophobia was rampant, and AIDS became known as the \"gay plague.\" The virus devastated the entertainment community and spread to hemophiliacs and injection-drug users. Taylor was watching helplessly as many of her friends were dying. The word empathy comes from the German einf\u00fchlung, or \"in-feeling\"\u2014translated first as \"empathy\" in 1909. It means mingling your own feelings and consciousness with someone else's experience, which had always come naturally to Taylor. She possessed what her stepdaughter Carrie Fisher called \"rampant empathy.\" And she was feeling powerless until she found what became her life's calling. Bill Misenhimer was the director of AIDS Project Los Angeles, and he knew that he needed Taylor's help; there was no one who commanded as much respect within the entertainment community, and he knew that she had many close gay friends. In 1985, he met with Taylor's assistant Chen Sam and asked if Taylor would agree to chair a fundraising dinner called Commitment to Life to benefit APLA. The dinner would be the first major celebrity fundraiser in the world for AIDS. Taylor was constantly being asked to help raise money and draw attention to different causes, and she wanted to make sure that everything she did had a clear purpose. In the end, Misenhimer said, he had to present a note from the philanthropist Wallis Annenberg, who was working with APLA, to prove to Taylor that they were a legitimate organization committed to helping AIDS patients. Once she was convinced that APLA was an honest organization in need of her help, she was on board completely. Unlike today, there were very few celebrity activists, and Taylor was among a handful of other actors and musicians who championed causes and drew attention to issues. Among them were Jane Fonda, who had been the most vocal and high-profile celebrity antiwar activist during the Vietnam War; Harry Belafonte, who helped organize the Selma to Montgomery march for voting rights in 1965 and who still works on behalf of civil rights and social justice causes; Eartha Kitt, who fought for civil rights and LGBTQ+ rights; Audrey Hepburn, who was an ambassador for UNICEF; and Paul Newman, who was a Democratic activist and philanthropist. In the early days it was a lonely battle. Studio heads whom Taylor had made lots of money for hung up on her. Worst of all, her friend and former lover Frank Sinatra turned her down when she first asked for his help. Michael Jackson was also hesitant. So many people made excuses not to help that it shocked her. Some of her friends and advisers told her to stay away from HIV and AIDS because it could end her career. \"Who gives a goddamn about careers,\" she told them, \"when the people, without whom we wouldn't have a career, are dying?\" Taylor fired the first and most audible shot in the long ongoing war to eradicate AIDS when she hosted the dinner and raised $1.3 million for APLA on September 19, 1985. Eventually more than 2,500 people showed up, including Shirley MacLaine, Sammy Davis Jr., and Carol Burnett. There were also AIDS patients at the dinner who could be easily identified because their tuxedos hung loosely on their bodies. \"She was very, very sweet,\" Burnett said. \"She cared for people. Yes, she was rich; yes, she was beautiful; yes, she was famous. But it did not go to her head.\" While she was waging her battle, Taylor must have been thinking of her close friends Montgomery Clift, James Dean, and Rock Hudson. \"If it weren't for homosexuals, there would be no culture,\" she said. \"The idea that God should choose his children [to suffer]\u2014his geniuses to whom he had given the talent to make it a different, more beautiful place for us mere mortals\u2014made me so angry.\" She was definitely thinking of Hudson. While she was planning the Commitment to Life dinner, Taylor learned that he had AIDS. Publicly she said that she found out when the world did, on July 25, 1985, two months before the September dinner. But in reality, she'd learned days before. \"I thought Rock had cancer. Then one of his doctors called me and said, 'Listen, I shouldn't be telling you this, but I know how much you love him, and I'm going to because I'm not sure how much longer [he has].... Rock has AIDS.' \" Hudson's announcement helped mobilize Hollywood's elite into action because one of their own was sick. It helped make the dinner such a success that the venue had to be moved from the Century Plaza Hotel to the Westin Bonaventure because they needed a bigger ballroom. Taylor, an optimist, started to become cynical. Why, she thought, do people care more now just because someone who's rich and famous has it? \"When I found out that the ban had been lifted because of Rock, everybody could hardly wait to come [to the dinner], to show that they were broad-minded,\" Taylor reflected later. Hudson bought $10,000 worth of tickets, but he was too ill to attend and instead sent a telegram that was read aloud that evening. \"I am not happy that I am sick,\" he wrote. \"I am not happy that I have AIDS. But if that is helping others, I can, at least, know that my own misfortune has had some positive worth.\" Hudson's doctor, Michael Gottlieb, said that he was told by his bosses at UCLA, where he had been treating Hudson, that Hudson would be discharged. \"Rock Hudson will die at home,\" they told him. \"He will not be readmitted.\" Gottlieb knew the reason why: They did not want UCLA to be known as an AIDS hospital. And Hudson did die at home on October 2, 1985. He was 59 years old. Since there were no effective treatments in the early and mid-1980s, APLA used the money from the dinner to focus on patient care. Taylor's love and support was necessary during the early dark days of the epidemic. Misenhimer said that at APLA he and his colleagues would do interviews outside their office because television reporters were too afraid to come inside. AIDS patients would sometimes be discharged from the hospital to APLA because they had nowhere else to go. Misenhimer and his staff would put them up in a hotel nearby. \"I do know that she comforted me in tears often,\" Misenhimer said of his friendship with Taylor. \"She was so passionate and so compassionate. I've never been starstruck. I respected the legend of Elizabeth Taylor, but I loved the woman.\" In the summer of 1985, while working on the Commitment to Life dinner, Taylor thought about creating a national foundation to improve patients' lives and raise money for a cure. She met with Gottlieb, Misenhimer, and Chen Sam at an inconspicuous French restaurant in Santa Monica. Misenhimer picked Taylor and Sam up in his brown Honda Accord and chauffeured them to dinner. \"We were an unlikely group,\" Gottlieb recalled. \"Me, a doctor who's spent his life in laboratories; Bill Misenhimer, a Xerox executive turned activist who was openly gay; and the greatest living movie star in the world. But that night it all gelled. \" Misenhimer told Taylor how hard their path ahead would be, and she took his hand in hers and said with tears in her eyes, \"Don't worry, I've been through a lot.\" This was the moment that led to the creation of AmFAR, the Foundation for AIDS Research, the first major nonprofit organization dedicated to supporting research on AIDS. AmFAR's first incarnation was the West Coast-based National AIDS Research Foundation that Taylor, Gottlieb, Misenhimer, and Sam created that evening. Rumors of the foundation reached Dr. Mathilde Krim in New York. Krim was a well-respected and fiercely dedicated research scientist who was married to movie executive Arthur Krim, a friend of super-producer Mike Todd, who was Taylor's third husband until his death in 1958. Krim had created the AIDS Medical Foundation, which needed money. She reached out to inquire about a merger. In his will, Hudson left $250,000 to Taylor's National AIDS Research Foundation, and two days after the Commitment to Life dinner, representatives from the National AIDS Research Foundation and the AIDS Medical Foundation met in Los Angeles to try to find a way to join forces. When they announced the creation of their new foundation\u2014AmFAR\u2014at a press conference, the power struggle between the two groups was already evident. It was to be based on both coasts. Taylor was the national chairman (she did not want to be called \"chairwoman\"), and Krim and Gottlieb were chairs. Krim admired Taylor's commitment and her dedication to treating AIDS patients with dignity and respect, but her ultimate goal was always to find a cure. When Taylor could get on the phone and make an impact, or travel for an AIDS fundraiser, she did. \"People always ask, 'Does Elizabeth Taylor work hard?' \" said Misenhimer, who became the first director of AmFAR. \"You've got to put it in perspective, because what's hard work for Elizabeth isn't necessarily what everybody else would call hard work.... Once, we had a board meeting at the Bank of Los Angeles. Afterward she said, 'So this is what a bank looks like.' She'd never been in one.\" Sally Morrison, who held top positions at AmFAR for 13 years and worked closely with Taylor, said that Krim and Taylor were powerful women who had a common goal but different ways of getting there. \"Dr. Krim was very empathetic, but to her it was so clear we needed to address this problem through science,\" said Morrison. \"I think for Elizabeth it was very difficult not to address food and housing and patient services. She had a lot of friends who were sick.\" The war was only beginning with the creation of AmFAR. In 1986, the conservative author and longtime friend of Reagan William F. Buckley Jr. wrote an op-ed in The New York Times calling for people with AIDS to be tattooed on their buttocks and arms as a means of \"private protection\" in order to \"identify all the carriers.\" Buckley said that Taylor was no hero, but a living example of \"self-indulgence.\" But Taylor could not care less what Buckley\u2014or anyone else\u2014thought of her. In 1987 she gave a speech at the National Press Club in Washington, DC, and reflected on what had made her become an activist. \"I became so incensed and personally frustrated at the rejection I was receiving by just trying to get people's attention. I was made so aware of the silence, this huge, loud silence regarding AIDS, how no one wanted to talk about it and no one wanted to become involved. Certainly no one wanted to give money or support, and it so angered me that I finally thought to myself, Bitch, do something yourself. Instead of sitting there getting angry. Do something.\" In 1987, Taylor launched her first perfume, Passion, and followed it up in 1991 with White Diamonds, another enormous hit. She traveled around the country visiting the department stores that sold her perfume, and she vowed to visit AIDS hospices in every city that she could. But there were two caveats: She did not want any press to interrupt those private visits, and the perfume company and the department store would have to donate money to each of the hospices she visited. She vowed to match their contributions. At the Coming Home Hospice in San Francisco's Castro District, nurses were told in hushed tones that Taylor was on her way. She stopped in each of the hospice's 15 small rooms, and she spent several minutes talking with each patient. She asked them if she could arrange to have their dogs walked; she asked if she could call their mothers for them or write letters for them. Some patients cried when they saw her, said Guy Vandenberg, a health care worker and AIDS activist who was at the Coming Home Hospice when she visited. After she met with patients, he said, Taylor sat with the handful of staffers in their tiny kitchen and asked them how they were taking care of themselves. \"How do you support each other?\" she wanted to know. They averaged three deaths a week in the 15-bed hospice, he said. \"Sometimes I would get off my three-to-midnight shift and I would come back the next day, and one or two people might have died during the night,\" Vandenberg said, his voice cracking. \"The need was so great that the bed would not be empty more than a day at most; sometimes the bed would be filled right away. We didn't have time to process the volume of death.\" Even amid all the darkness, there was joy. \"A majority of our patients, as they were dying, were quite capable of laughter and gallows humor, and to an outsider that often felt really strange or inappropriate. When the hospice was taken over by a more corporate hospital, we got disciplined for too much laughter, and we were eating with the patients and that was not allowed,\" Vandenberg said through tears. \"She fit right in, she knew that was good. She joked with them. She hugged and kissed every single one of us, the patients and the staff.\" After one of her hospice visits, a patient woke up and said, \"I had a vision that Elizabeth Taylor came to me in my sleep!\" \"No, she was actually here,\" a nurse told him. Taylor wanted to look perfect for every visit (\"I hope I haven't overdone it!\" she'd joke), so she always arrived with full hair and makeup and the famous 33.19-carat Asscher-cut Krupp diamond on her left ring finger. She wanted the patients to see her the way they had imagined her to be. She told her assistant Jorjett Strumme, who would get emotional, that she could not come into hospices with her because she would start to cry if Strumme cried. She had to keep things light and happy, she said, but she'd get back in the car and she would bury her head in her dog's soft white fur and be unusually quiet for a while. Ed Wolf was a counselor in San Francisco General Hospital's Ward 5B in the 1980s. San Francisco was second only to New York in the number of AIDS cases, and 5B was the world's first revolutionary inpatient unit for people with AIDS. It was created in 1983 and run by registered nurses who specialized in caring for AIDS patients. In 5B patients were treated with compassion. In the beginning nurses and doctors wore so much protective gear that they looked like astronauts. Food trays piled up outside of hospital rooms because no one wanted to touch them. But in 5B things were different. Nurses were not allowed to wear protective medical gear, including gowns and masks. They believed that physical touch was an important way to honor each patient's humanity. They did seemingly little things, like re-creating the decor of patients' living rooms in their hospital rooms, allowing their pets to visit them, and, of course, allowing their partners to stay with them. They even used Champagne glasses for water. \"We couldn't cure people, but there was a possibility to heal,\" Wolf said. \"We held weddings for people on their deathbeds years before it would ever become legal. In five minutes families would find out that their son is gay and he has AIDS. One conservative family from a small town came every single day for two weeks until their son died. They saw all these gay people taking care of him and they did a one-eighty. They went back to their homes and started a support group for people whose kids had AIDS. In other cases, people would bring ministers to get their children to atone. It was a terrible and a beautiful place all at once.\" Cliff Morrison created 5B, and he remembered one visit when Taylor stayed for several hours. After she spent time with each patient, she asked if there was a lounge area so that she could meet with a larger group. Patients who were feeling well enough to leave their beds came and sat in a circle around Taylor. She told them to feel free to ask her anything. One patient asked her, \"What kind of grief and sorrow have you had in your life and who was the love of your life?\" \"I was married to Richard Burton twice, and he was the most passionate love of my life. Nobody fought more or loved more than we did,\" she said. \"But Mike Todd was my first true love.\" Morrison remembers it feeling like sharing a cocktail with old friends, but in this case it was coffee and cigarettes. \"I couldn't believe how comfortable she was,\" he recalled. They named the lounge after Taylor. In 1986 someone she had never met before wrote her a letter telling her that one of his friends who had done some work on her house was in the hospital dying of AIDS. She had a note delivered with a purple orchid\u2014purple was her favorite color and her eyes looked violet in a certain light\u2014to his hospital bed: \"My whole house needs redoing.... This time in deep purple and lavender\u2014so you have to get out in a hurry and help me. All my love, ET.\" From [Elizabeth Taylor: The Grit & Glamour of an Icon](https://cna.st/affiliate-link/qsSkLvaohicBdx2q6SwBz1kdDkbPfBAy6nuCJZpcKUZpAtSqCgpMUqFosDP2f3DKMMNkjA1xLeG72VeY5zTKjHQtNPKbCcShrjQz5oW6H5XUdx4GbuwWDq6ZHWDonkgmZJ3KSKHojLx31gaqhyx2FFcGPMrfScsm2xygr74iGvZdUWsRQyznqWax) by Kate Andersen Brower.
