Omega fatty acids help support joint, cardiovascular, and brain health, and support healthy immune function. A daily dose of xEO Mega provides 900 milligrams of marine lipids (providing 300 mg of EPA, 300 mg of DHA, and 70 mg of other omega 3s), and a blend of 250 mg of plant- sourced fatty acids. xEO Mega also includes 800 IU of natural vitamin D, 60 IU of natural vitamin E, and 1 mg of pure astaxanthin, a powerful antioxidant carotenoid harvested from microalgae. xEO vegetarian-friendly softgel. CONCEPT Essential Fatty Acids (EFAs) are nutrients required for many key functions in the human body, including cell growth, brain development, muscle activity, immune function, joint health, and many others. While some fatty acids can be produced inside the body, \"essential\" fatty acids cannot be produced by our bodies; therefore, we rely on the food we eat to supply these important nutrients. The most common of the essential fatty acids are omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids. Modern science suggests that for optimal health, humans should consume a one-to-one ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 essential fatty acids. Unfortunately, due to the abundance of omega-6 fatty acids in vegetable oils and their availability, a typical modern diet includes omega-6 fatty acids in an approximate ration of 20:1! While our diets must include some omega-6 fatty acids as essential nutrients for life, the disproportionate consumption of omega-6 fatty acids and other unhealthy hydrogenated or trans fats has been linked to poor health. Studies also link low intake of omega-3 fatty acids to reduced mood and cognitive function. Conversely, there is an enormous body of scientific evidence supporting the health benefits of increasing the dietary intake of omega-3 fatty acids. Studies have shown that increasing omega-3 fatty acid consumption has a positive effect on cardiovascular health and brain function, and promotes healthy immune function. Increased consumption of omega-3 fatty acids has also been shown to have a positive impact on joint health and mobility, and skin health.xEO Mega\u00ae Essential Oil Omega Complex 2 dTERRA Enterprises Singapore Pte. Ltd. PIP SG 072517CONCEPT (CONTINUED) Restoring the balance between omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids is an important step in keeping your body healthy. This can be done by decreasing your intake of unhealthy foods high in omega-6 fatty acids and increasing your intake of foods that are rich in omega-3 fatty acids. Fish is an excellent source of dietary omega-3 fatty acids, but omega-3s can also be found in canola oil and the oils of some nuts and seeds. Because of growing anxiety over the levels of toxins and heavy metals present in the world's oceans, daily fish consumption as a source of omega-3 fatty acids is not acceptable to some consumers. In fact, many nutritional experts warn against frequent fish consumption to prevent exposure to these toxic pollutants. One daily dose of xEO Mega\u00ae provides 900 milligrams of pure, micro- filtered marine lipids with 300 mg of EPA, 300 mg of DHA, and 70mg of other omega-3s. Added to this is 200 mg of plant-based, omega-3 rich, Echium seed oil, along with 50 mg of pomegranate seed oil. CPTG\u00ae xEO Mega also contains a proprietary blend of dTERRA\u00ae CPTG essential oils that work in harmony with the omega-3 fatty acids in xEO Mega. Clove oil and the constituent thymol in Thyme oil are powerful antioxidants that work to enhance the overall efficacy of xEO Mega by delivering protection against oxidation. The essential oil blend also supports healthy cellular response to oxidative stress and healthy immune function and has digestive calming effects, which makes taking xEO Mega as pleasant as it is healthful. The essential oils in xEO Mega also function as a natural preservative system that protects the omega-3 fatty acids and lipid-soluble vitamins from oxidizing and going rancid. Marine-Sourced Oils dTERRA uses the best quality marine omega-3 oils in the world. Both fish oils are tested for over 250 contaminants, and both oils are certified sustainable by the prestigious Friend of the Sea organization in Europe.Echium Seed Oil xEO Mega delivers a unique source of land- based oils derived from the Echium ( Echium plantagineum ) seed. Our cold-pressed Echium seed oil provides a concentrated source of both ALA and SDA, which the body can convert more easily to EPA. ALA and SDA are produced by many plants, but because of the low amount of vegetables consumed in the standard American diet, they are often not consumed in adequate amounts. Our Echium seed oil also delivers GLA. Astaxanthin and Vitamin E Omega-3 fatty acids are important for circulatory and brain health. The brain is made up of essential lipids that, as with the free lipids traveling in the circulatory system, are prone to degradation through free-radical oxidation. xEO Mega includes the antioxidant carotenoid astaxanthin that helps protect against lipid oxidation in the brain and throughout the circulatory system. Astaxanthin provides antioxidant and circulatory benefits, supports eye health, improves muscle strength and endurance, aids the liver and digestive system, supports skin health, and promotes healthy immune function. The astaxanthin used in xEO Mega is a standardized extract of microalgae cultivated in a pure water system and activated by light. In response to exposure to light, the microalgae produces astaxanthin as a defense mechanism against oxidation. The microalgae changes from a light green to a deep crimson red. The astaxanthin is then extracted from the microalgae, microfiltered, and standardized for potency. The astaxanthin is coupled with natural vitamin E to provide additional circulatory and systemic benefits as powerful antioxidant additions to the antioxidant essential oils in xEO Mega.3 dTERRA Enterprises PIP D xEO Mega\u00ae also includes 800 IU of natural vitamin D. Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin present in a limited number of foods such as fish, beef liver, cheese, egg yolks, and fortified dairy products. It can also be synthesized in the body when triggered by exposure to sunlight. Vitamin D plays an essential role in bone health and growth. As with the omega-3 fatty acids in xEO Mega, vitamin D also plays an important role in promoting healthy immune function and a healthy response to oxidative stress. xEO Mega Essential Oil Omega Complex xEO Mega is a revolutionary approach to supplementing our diets with omega-3 fatty acids and other fat-soluble nutrients that help support circulatory health, brain health, and optimal immune function among many other systemic benefits. This unique formula of lipid-soluble nutrients is packaged in small, vegetarian-friendly softgels. xEO Mega is formulated to be used daily with Microplex MVp\u00ae as a comprehensive dietary supplement foundation for a lifetime of vitality and wellness. PRIMARY BENEFITS Promotes heart and circulatory health Supports healthy joint function and comfort Provides immune-boosting nutrients Protects against lipid oxidation and supports healthy function of the brain, eyes, and nervous system Promotes healthy skin Delivers 900 mg of pure, concentrated, molecularly filtered fish oil with 300 mg of EPA and 300 mg of DHA per daily serving, and 70 mg of other omega-3s Provides a wide range of omega-3 fatty acids including EPA, DHA, ALA, and SDA from marine and plant sources to help maintain a healthy balance of these vital nutrients Includes the powerful antioxidant carotenoid, astaxanthin Formulated with a proprietary blend of dTERRA\u00ae CPTG\u00ae essential oils of Clove, Frankincense, Thyme, Cumin, Wild Orange, Peppermint, Ginger, Caraway, and German Chamomile Includes 800 IU of natural vitamin D and 60 IU of natural vitamin E Does not contain milk or wheat products Specially formulated to be used daily with Microplex MVp as a comprehensive dietary supplement foundation for a lifetime of vitality and wellness STORAGE: Sunlight and other light sources can oxidize carotenoids if not stored in a dark, cool, dry environment. DIRECTIONS FOR USE Adults, take up to 4 capsules per day with food; maximum of 4 capsules per day. xEO Mega is formulated to be used daily with Microplex MVp. Both products can be found in one convenient pack\u2014Daily Nutrient Pack. FAQS Q: Does xEO Mega need to be refrigerated? A: xEO Mega is designed to be stable at room temperature throughout its shelf life. However, refrigeration is recommended to extend shelf life, or to maximize the potency of the fragile omega-3 fatty acids. Q: Does xEO Mega need to be taken with food? A: xEO Mega should always be taken immediately before or right at the beginning of a full meal. Q: Is there a vegetarian version of xEO Mega (no fish)? A: vEO Mega\u00ae is available for those that do not wish to consume any animal-sourced ingredients. Q: Can my kids take xEO Mega instead of the IQ Mega? A: xEO Mega is safe for children and the dose can be cut in half. However, IQ Mega provides a higher dose of omega-3 fatty acids, which are critically important for the development years. Q: If I take the IQ Mega, do I need to take xEO Mega\u00ae too? A: No, one or the other should sufficient.4 dTERRA Enterprises Singapore Pte. Ltd. PIP SG 072517Q: What fish is utilized in the Marine Omega blend and what is the country of origin? A: Though the fishing ground may vary, the Marine Omega blend comes primarily from anchovy, sardine, and mackerel from the waters off the coast of Peru. Q: Why do I need the Marine and Land Omega blends? A: Each provides reliable and consistent sources of omega-3 fatty acids. The body can convert ALA and SDA (land based) into EPA and DHA; however, this conversion is variable among different individuals. EPA and DHA are extremely important to every cell in our body, and marine based oils deliver a concentrated source of these important omega-3 fatty acids. With xEO Mega you get the benefits of both land and sea, with its multi-targeted approach to improving the internal balance of these vital nutrients. Q: Is this product halal certified? A: Yes, this is certified through IFANCA.

Ltd. Alpha CRS+ PIP SG 072517PRODUCT DESCRIPTION dTERRA Alpha CRS+ Cellular Vitality Complex is a proprietary formula combining potent levels of natural botanical extracts that support healthy cell function with important metabolic factors of cellular energy. Alpha CRS+ is formulated to be used daily with xEO Mega\u00ae or vEO Mega\u00ae and Microplex MVp\u00ae as a comprehensive dietary supplement foundation for a lifetime of vitality and wellness. CONCEPT Cells are the basic building blocks of all life. Healthy tissues, organs, and, ultimately, healthy organisms depend on cellular reproduction and specialized function, energy production, and timely cell death when cells are not functioning at optimal levels. As we age, cellular function can deteriorate and we gradually begin to experience decreased energy and performance. Additionally, cellular stressors, including oxidative stress to cellular DNA and other key cell structures, challenge cellular heath. Providing cells with essential nutrients and metabolic factors of cellular energy and protecting our cells from toxic stressors supports healthy cell function, vitality, and wellness. DNA and Cellular Function The human body is made up of millions of specialized cells that are in constant communication with each other through complex chemical pathways. All activity in and between cells is regulated by the DNA in the nucleus of each cell. Healthy cells reproduce, perform specialized functions, and set in motion a sequence of self-destruction when their usefulness declines, making way for new, healthy cells. If cellular DNA or other critical cell structures are damaged, this process of renewal can be compromised. Mitochondria and Cellular Energy DNA also regulates the proliferation of mitochondria in cells. Mitochondria are cellular structures in which oxygen and food nutrients are metabolized to create energy for life. Healthy mitochondria function like well-tuned engines, producing efficient power with less exhaust (metabolic waste). As we age, the number and efficiency of cellular mitochondria can decrease, resulting in decreased energy and performance. Unhealthy mitochondria also put out more toxic exhaust in the form of free-radical molecules that can damage cellular DNA, setting off a cascading oxidative chain reaction that can damage critical cell structures and disrupt healthy cell function.Alpha CRS\u00ae+ Cellular Vitality Complex Made with SLS-free vegetable capsules 2 dTERRA Enterprises Singapore Pte. Ltd. Alpha CRS+ PIP SG 072517Free-radical Molecules Free-radical molecules are unstable molecules with one or more unpaired electrons. When free-radical molecules come in contact with stable molecules, they steal electrons from them turning stable molecules into unstable free- radical molecules that, in turn, steal electrons from other stable molecules. This cascading process of free-radical damage is called oxidation. Free-radical damage to cells can come from external and internal sources, but the primary free-radical or oxidative stress to cellular DNA comes from cellular metabolism of energy. When cellular DNA and other critical cell structures are damaged by free-radical molecules, cells do not function optimally. Antioxidants and Polyphenols Cells are equipped to defend against oxidative damage by employing electron-rich molecules called antioxidants to neutralize free-radical molecules. Cells use antioxidants derived from the foods we eat and manufacture other antioxidants to keep oxidative stress in check. Reducing oxidative damage to cellular DNA and other important cell structures will support healthy cell function. Antioxidants are found in great variety and abundance in plants and are plentiful in colorful fruits and vegetables. Polyphenols are a particularly powerful group of antioxidants that provide protection against free-radical damage to cellular DNA. They have a very high capacity (Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity or ORAC) to neutralize free-radical molecules and have been studied for a number of longevity health benefits. Endogenous Antioxidant Protection The antioxidants we consume in food are called exogenous antioxidants. The body is also capable of creating other antioxidants called endogenous antioxidants. Endogenous antioxidants often have very short life cycles and are used very rapidly in metabolic processes. In addition to providing exogenous antioxidant protection against free- radical damage to cells, polyphenols also support the endogenous production and recycling of antioxidants made in the body. Healthy Oxidative Stress Left unchecked, exposure to high levels of free radicals can leave the body more vulnerable to the oxidative damage of free radical molecules. Lowering oxidative stress in cells can help maintain healthy cellular function. Certain food nutrients also have been demonstrated to help the body recover from occasional high exposure to free radicals. Alpha CRS\u00ae+ Cellular Vitality Complex dTERRA Alpha CRS+ Cellular Vitality Complex is a proprietary dietary supplement formulated with potent levels of powerful polyphenols that support healthy cell function by providing antioxidant protection to cellular DNA and other critical cell structures. The polyphenol blend found in Alpha CRS+ includes concentrated extracts from scutellaria turmeric root, and silymarin from milk to support the body's internal production of endogenous antioxidants such as glutathione. The blend also includes a proprietary blend of boswellic acid and bromelain protease enzyme that support healthy cellular function. Alpha CRS+ also includes a cellular energy blend of important metabolic factors of cellular energy, including coenzyme Q10, quercetin, alpha-lipoic acid, and acetyl-L-carnitine. Alpha CRS+ also includes a botanical extract of Ginko biloba to help support mental clarity and energy. Combining potent levels of polyphenol antioxidants with metabolic factors of cellular energy production not only supports healthy proliferation of mitochondria in cells, it also supports efficient energy production and management of free-radical by-products of energy metabolism. Alpha CRS\u00ae+ is formulated to be used daily with xEO Mega\u00ae or vEO Mega\u00ae and Microplex MVp\u00ae as a comprehensive dietary supplement foundation for a lifetime of vitality and wellness. Coupled with dTERRA CPTG\u00ae essential oils and a commitment to the dTERRA Wellness Lifestyle of eating right, exercising, resting and managing stress, reducing toxic load, informed self care, and proactive health care, Alpha CRS+ will help support you and your goals to look, feel, and live younger.3 dTERRA Enterprises Singapore Pte.
