The number o f applications received has grown every year, thus increasing the competition for awards and making the criteria and point system even more important . All the articles paid for and published so far have been placed in the KU ScholarWorks institutional repository under \"Open Access .\" Included in this report are the statistics for FY 20 21 in the following tables: Table 1. Numbers of applications and awards Table 2. Total amount spent and a break down by campus We've also included appendices covering the fund from Inception (Oct. 2012) through June 2021: Appendix A A Short History of the First Six Years of the Open Access Author Fund Appendix B Cumulative Statistics Appendix C Trends Appendix D Full List of Published Papers Funded by the OAAF Appendix E Applications Received by Unit 2 KU Open Access Author Fund Annual Report, FY 2 1 Table 1. Statistics for FY 20 21 When compared to the figures from the previous fiscal year (July 201 9-June 20 20), there was a 31% increase in the number of applications received , which led to an increase in applicants rejected due to limited funds . The number of awards that were offered and paid were similar. FY2 1 FY20 1. Applications Received 77 67 2. Applications Rejected * 46 32 3. Awards Offered 31 35 4. Awards Paid ** 19 25 Note: Eight of the authors who were offered awards in FY 21 haven't used them as of July 14, 2021, so the number of \" Awards Paid\" may still increase. The numbers in Lines 2 and 3 above add up to the total number of applications received (Line 1). Line 4 is a sub- set of Line 3. * Main r easons why applications were r ejected 1. Other applications received higher point totals and there wasn't enough money to fund all eligible applicants during that month's competition. (By far the most common reason.) 2. The au thor, journal, or publisher did not meet the OAAF criteria. ** Main r easons why awards were not u sed 1. The manuscript was rejected by the editor / editorial board of the journal. 2. The author did not use the award before it expired (4 months from the award notification date). 3 Table 2. Financial Statistics for FY 20 21 Amount allocated for FY 21 $25,000 Awards not redeemed in FY 20 $7,221 Total amount available in FY 21 $32,221 As of the end of FY 2 1, we had $ 765.9 6 remaining in the fund, which was rolled over to FY 22. As of July 14, 20 21, there are $8,346 in rese rve for awards made during FY 21 for articles still in the submission process. The portion of those funds not used before the four -month expiration date will be retur ned to the OAAF for use in FY 22. Awards by C ampus (as of July 14, 202 1) KU Medical Center (All Locations) $16,100 69.7% KU Lawrence / Edwards $7,010 30.3% Total Expenditures $23,110 Note: Total does not include $ 8,346 for awards offered but not used. Dollar amounts have been rounded to the nearest whole dollar. Amount Paid per Award in FY2 1 (as of July 14, 20 21) Highest $1,500 Lowest $650 Average / Mean $1,216 Median $1,260 What Publishers Charge Authors In FY21 , the amount of money publishers charged authors applying for awards this year ranged from a high of $ 3,650 to a low of $30 0. Forty of the seventy -seven charges were over our $1500 maximum award amount. Highest $3,650 Lowest $300 Average / Mean $1,924 Median $1,980 4 Appendix A A Short History of the Open Access Author Fund at KU The One University Open Access Author Fund (OAAF) at the University of Kansas is administered by the OAAF Review Team comprised of academic and biomedical librarians at the KU campus in Lawrence and at the KU Medica l Center's Dykes Library in Kansas City. Oversight is provided by the sponsors who support the fund - KU's Provost, KU's Vice Chancellor for Research, and the KU Medical Center's Vice Chancellor for Research. Detailed criteria and eligibility standards, an online application form, a list of awards made, and additional information is available at this URL: http://library.kumc.edu/authors -fund.xml . The OAAF began its first two -year pilot program in Octob er of 2012 with $50,000 allocated equally by the Lawrence campus and the Medical Center. During that first pilot, which closed at the end of June 2014, applications were reviewed on a first -come, first -served basis. This resulted in the entire years' worth of funds being dispersed within four to six months of the opening of the fund. To ensure that money would be available for an entire fiscal year during the second pilot phase (2014- 2016), the OAAF Review Team solicited the advice of the members of the Faculty Consultation Group. Additional criteria, new eligibility standards, and different review periods were developed. In the redesigned competitive process, all the applications received during one month are now r eviewed within the first seven business da ys of the next month. Various levels of weighted priority are now assigned as follows: A. Author 's status (graduate student, pre -tenured faculty, early career research staff, etc.) B. Author's access to grants or other funding C. Author's record of previous OA aw ards received This second phase of the pilot began in November 2014 with a new allocation of $50,000 to cover 2014- 2016. Awards were made using the new criteria and procedures. The fund has subsequently received $50,000 in July 2016, J uly 2018, and July 2 020. The fund will continue to distribute awards through June 20 22. The number of fund applications has ranged between two and nine each month, out of which an average of one to three are approved. In March 2021 there was a record of 14 applications increasing the total for FY21 to 77. All of the articles that are paid for (at least in part) by the OAAF are now available for viewing at the OAAF website here - http://library.kumc.edu/oa - fund- awards.xml . The same articles are also added to the KU ScholarWorks Open Access community at: https://kuscholarworks.ku.edu/handle/1808/11673 . Analyzing the 126 OAAF funded articles that have received an Altmetrics score shows that these articles have been cited in 1669 tweets, 26 Wikipedia articles, 148 mainstream media sources, and 7 patents. The 148 OAAF funded articles found in a Web of Sci ence citation report have been cited 1698 times. The OAAF is marketed to faculty and graduate students through our website, social media, email, and group presentations. 5 Future Plans The current OAAF cycle expires June 30, 2022. Funding renewal decisions will need to be considered by our sponsors in order to continue the Open Access Author Fund in FY23. An increase in the current $25,000 from each campus to cover a two - year cycle would provide for a raise in the $1500 cap per article processing fee that the OAAF has awarded since 2012. Since the fund predominantly awards graduate students and because the average cost of an APC in FY21 was $1,924, an increase in the fund would benefit applicants. 6 Appendix B Cumulative Statistics Totals, Inception - June 20 21 The following tables document the outcomes of the OAAF applications and awards process from the inception of the fund ( Oct. 2012 ) through the end of the ninth year ( June 20 21).

FY2 1 recorded 77 applicants , the largest single -year total to date. Figure C-1. Increasing number of applications What the Publisher s Charge Authors Over the course of the fund's existence, the amount of money publishers charged authors applying for the OAAF awards has ranged from a low of $ 180 to a high of $5,200 . Amounts Authors Applied For Authors have applied for amounts of money ranging from the OAAF's maximum of $1500 to a minimal $180, with the maximum amount bein g the one most often requested.
