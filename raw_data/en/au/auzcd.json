Focusing on the root cause of your symptoms rather than simply suppressing them can lead to long term healing and improved quality of life. Naturopathic medicine can be particularly effective in treating long standing illnesses that have been unresponsive to conventional medical interventions. We view our patients as unique, complex individuals. Each patient's interrelated physical, emotional, mental, genetic and spiritual characteristics are considered when creating an individualized treatment plan. The practice of naturopathic medicine is rooted in six fundamental principles of healing: | | First Do No Harm Naturopathic doctors utilize methods and medicinal substances which minimize the risk of harmful side effects, using the least invasive methods necessary to diagnose and treat. Our doctors develop individualized plans to meet each patient's needs. | | Identify and Treat the Causes The naturopathic doctor seeks to identify and remove the underlying causes of illness rather than to merely eliminate or suppress symptoms. If underlying causes are not addressed, symptoms will return and illness will persist. | | Healing Power of Nature Naturopathic medicine recognizes an inherent self-healing process in people that is ordered and intelligent. Naturopathic doctors act to identify and remove obstacles to healing and recovery, and to facilitate and augment this inherent self-healing process. | | Doctor as Teacher Naturopathic doctors educate their patients and encourage self-responsibility for health. An important aspect of our doctors' practice is to teach our patients to nurture themselves - to eat well, manage stress and strive to achieve optimal wellness. | | Treat the Whole Person Naturopathic doctors treat each patient by taking into account individual physical, mental, emotional, genetic, environmental, social, and other factors. Since total health also includes spiritual health, naturopathic doctors encourage individuals to pursue their personal spiritual development. | | Prevention Naturopathic doctors are proactive in their approach and emphasize the prevention of disease by assessing risk factors, heredity and susceptibility to disease. | | Hours Office hours: Monday-Friday 9am-5pm Saturdays by Appointment Only After hour supplement pickups can be arranged | | Telephone Colorado Springs T: 719-551-5282 Colorado Springs T: 719-426-9637 Colorado Springs F: 719-639-2054 T: 303-269-4860 | | Address 122 E.
