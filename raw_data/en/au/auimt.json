The combination of these three products is the start of a gentle detoxification process. Scroll photos for lists of ingredients. Included in your detox bundle is a brochure with guidelines to support whole body detox as well as dosing. Detox & Move (ingredients listed in first image) Detox & Move is always my first product used in the detoxification process. This organic beet concentrate with antioxidants and enzymes helps thin the bile. This moves the bile through the liver with ease and allows for a more efficient removal of toxins. Beet fiber acts as a pre-biotic to feed the essential probiotics in the intestine. Proper function of bile helps the digestion of fats and fat soluble vitamins, as well as insuring regular bowel movements and excretion of waste products. Detox & Clear (ingredients listed in last image) The liver cleanses the blood in two phases. Both phases must be functioning correctly for our pets' bodies to eliminate toxins acquired from the outside world and from normal metabolic functions. These phases are dependent on simple vitamins such as A, C, E, B's, amino acids, glutathione, and antioxidants. Our Detox & Clear provides these nutrients along with botanical support for the liver and kidney including Milk Thistle, Lycium berries, Cleavers, Burdock, and Red Clover. Detox & Protect (ingredients listed in middle image) When used in our Detox Protocol, this product helps the body neutralize the harmful free radicals created by toxicants and is a mild but powerful support for our pets. Free radicals cause biological damage, generally by oxidative processes. Our Detox & Protect is a proprietary product high in the free radical scavengers superoxide dismutase and catalase. These natural plant-based products complement each other and support the cellular antioxidant defense mechanism. And by virtue of this function, these compounds play a role in moderating the aging process too! Why your dog or cat needs to detox... Studies have shown that our animals are impacted by hundreds more toxicants at much higher rates than humans. Generally speaking, animals metabolize drugs at a slower rate than human beings\u2014even slower than the fetus, infants, or the elderly. Your animals are exposed to chemicals and substances which greatly impede their metabolism. These disruptive toxicants are hormone disruptors causing thyroid imbalance as well as affecting all the other endocrine organs. Many caring pet parents choose better species specific diets, but see no results in their overweight or hypothyroid animals. They diligently give their pets the medications and supplements prescribed by trusted veterinarians with no noticeable results. Why is nothing happening in this scenario? Because toxicants are clogging up the works, so to speak. Toxicants create inflammation throughout the body and damage the hormones which regulate appetite. As an example, the hormone leptin, which communicates to the brain when the tummy is full, can be blocked by heavy metals. So, the appetite is never satiated, balanced or complete. Excess weight is the result, further hindering overall health. "}
