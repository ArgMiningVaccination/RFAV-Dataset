This guideline provides practice recommendations for the early screening and detection of hip instability and dysplasia and also highlights gaps in the published literature that should stimulate additional research. This guideline is intended towards appropriately trained practitioners involved in the early examination and assessment of typically developing children for hip instability and dysplasia. GOALS AND RATIONALE The purpose of this clinical practice guideline is to improve the ability of practitioners to detect and manage hip instability and hip dysplasia in typically developing children less than 6 months of age based upon the current best evidence. Current evidence-based medicine (EBM) standards call for physicians to use the best available evidence in their clinical decisions. This clinical practice guideline includes a systematic literature review of treatment and diagnostic articles related to developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) published in or after 1966 and incidence/natural history articles published in or after 1950. This review demonstrates where there is good evidence, where evidence is lacking, and what topics future research must target in order to improve early screening, detection and the treatment of typically developing children less than 6 months of age with developmental dysplasia of the hip. AAOS staff and an interdisciplinary clinician work group systematically reviewed the available literature and wrote the following recommendation based upon a rigorous standardized process. Many different providers may provide musculoskeletal care in many different settings. We created this guideline as an educational tool to guide qualified practitioners through a series of treatment decisions in an effort to improve the quality and efficiency of care. This guideline should not be construed as including all proper methods of care or excluding methods of care reasonably directed to obtaining the same results. The ultimate judgment regarding any specific procedure of treatment must be made in light of all circumstances presented by the patient and the needs and resources particular to the locality or practice setting. INTENDED USERS This guideline is intended for use by appropriately trained practitioners involved in the medical evaluation of typically developing children less than 6 months of age. This would include pediatricians, family physicians, qualified mid-level practitioners with appropriate physician oversight, radiologists who perform diagnostic imaging of children, and orthopedic surgeons. Typically physicians will have completed medical training, a qualified residency in their specialty area and some may have completed additional sub- specialty training. Mid-level providers would have completed a qualified training program in their specialty and would have additional training in the assessment of 6 pediatric patients with appropriate supervision by a qualified physician pursuant to the laws of their practice environment. The early diagnosis and management of DDH is based upon the assumption that shared and informed decisions are made by the patient's guardians and the practitioner based upon a mutual communication and understanding of the available treatments and procedures applicable to the individual patient. Practitioner input based upon experience and knowledge of interpretation of clinical and imaging findings, conservative and surgical management options, and of additional accessible expertise increases the probability of optimally matching the right intervention to the right patient at the right time. This guideline is not intended for use as a benefits determination document. PATIENT POPULATION This clinical practice guideline is applicable to the detection and management of DDH in typically developing children less than 6 months of age. It is not intended for use for children who have teratologic hip abnormalities or hip abnormalities associated with neuromuscular, genetic, or acquired complex musculoskeletal or developmental abnormalities. BURDEN OF DISEASE/INCIDENCE AND PREVALENC E DDH is a spectrum of anatomic abnormalities of the femoral head and acetabulum of the hip joint. There is inconsistent terminology used to describe these abnormalities and a lack of clarity around which recognized abnormalities of the hip in the newborn and early infancy periods are progressive and pathologic versus self-resolving and potentially within a range of normal development. While clinical terms such as \"click, clunk, dislocatable, subluxatable, reducible, dysplastic, asymmetric thigh folds, and limited hip abduction \" are common in papers related to this topic, no clear or widely accepted clinical definitions exist by which to compare patient populations to each other. In particular, the term \"click\" has been problematic as it has been used in screening literature as a term describing a range of situations from a normal snapping sensation to a surrogate for clinically detectable hip instability. Similarly, discussion of risk factors for terms such as \"foot deformities, talipes, family history, first born, female, and intrauterine crowding/oligohydramnios \" have been applied in a retrospective manner without specificity and without consideration of other variables. Imaging criteria are similarly vague. Included papers for this review demonstrated consistency of use of the Graf criteria for grading severity of sonographic hip dysplasia, but consistent radiographic criteria for defining dysplasia or dislocation were lacking. Early detection and early management of DDH must take into account the early natural history of physiologic hip development. As a part of the development of this clinical practice guideline, the workgroup included a search for articles that defined the natural history of early clinical instability and early hip dysplasia as determined by either ultrasound or radiograph. 7 An estimation of the true incidence of the disorder is therefore uncertain. The reported incidence ranges are as high as 1:100 newborns for clinically detectable hip instability to 1-28:1000 newborns for clinically and/or r adiographic hip dislocation that prompted an intervention I-1, I-2. Recent large ultrasound screening studies place the incidence of ultrasound detectable abnormalities leading to intervention at 5 -7% of all newborns I-3, I-5. In the United States, there were approximately 3,952,940 live births in 2012 I-6 suggesting a potential impact from 4,000 up to 276,700 newborn children/year in the United States. The true prevalence of adult hip pathology attributable to DDH is unknown. It is widely believ ed that DDH is a condition that can lead to impaired function and quality of life for children and adults I-2, I-8, I-10 and that detection of this condition in early childhood may allow interventions that can alter this. It is also believed that earlier treatment creates less potential harm to the child than later treatment with the aggregate risk of those harms being less than the risk of impaired function and quality of life of the untreated condition I-4, I-11, I-18. Current and evolving practice stan dards call for a musculoskeletal evaluation of all newborn children and also demand that practitioners be good stewards of health care resources in making such assessments and decisions for management. These methods may involve both clinical and imaging resources. In clinically normal hips imaging evaluation would be the only viable method to assess for hip problems that could have a potential to evolve into a future pathologic condition with adverse impact upon an individual's quality of life . Populatio n screening using ultrasound has been practiced in Europe I-3, I-10, I-19, I-20 and with an uncertain role in North America I-1. I-2, I-8. NATURAL HISTORY Published works on the topic of DDH have used inconsistent terminology to describe abnormalities and have not clarified which recognized abnormalities of the hip in the newborn and early infancy are progressive and pathologic versus self -resolving and potentially within a range of normal development. As a part of the development of this clinical practic e guideline, the workgroup attempted to identify as best as possible, the natural history of clinically unstable or ultrasound or radiographically abnormal hips detected in infancy with the natural duration of self -correction. The details of the review are listed in the natural history of DDH appendix within this CPG. The long -term natural history of DDH appears to be related to the type and severity of the hip abnormality. Mild dysplasia may never manifest clinically or become apparent until adult life, whereas severe dysplasia can present clinical ly with functional limitations during childhood. Interventions to alter the long - term natural history of DDH have included early bracing and a progressive range of manipulative and surgical options with adva ncing age of the child I-31 to I -43. In this review, included articles were examined specifically for information related to the resolution of clinical instability or ultrasound and radiographic hip dysplasia in untreated infants. All of the studies iden tified for this review indicate that m ost DDH discovered during the newborn period appear to represent hip laxity and immaturity . Approximately 60% -80% of abnormalities identified by physical examination and more than 90% identified by ultrasound (US) appear to resolve 8 spontaneously in early infancy raising significant questions about whether or not such hips should be treated with bracing and at what age such treatment should be optimally applied. ETIOLOGY The etiology of DDH in typically developing children is unknown. Both genetic and environmental influences appear to play a role in the development of this condition I-10, I- 21. Absence of a femoral head from within an acetabulum and alteration of proximal femoral anatomy has been linked to progre ssive changes of the acetabulum over time I-22. Risk factors for the development of progressive hip abnormality have been reported in observational series and are reported in the next section. RISK FACTORS The terminology used in defining risk factors for the presence of DDH is not precise in the published literature. Hip physical examination findings associated with DDH have semantic challenges, limited knowledge of normal ranges, and knowledge that the examination findings change over time. Case con trol and observational studies have suggested that \"breech positioning at delivery, family history of DDH, limited hip abduction, talipes, female gender, swaddling, large birth size, and first born\" have been associated with a higher probability of finding DDH I-2, I-8, I-23. EMOTIONAL AND PHYSIC AL IMPACT The emotional impact upon a family of detecting a non -apparent musculoskeletal problem in a newborn is unknown. There may be emotional impact upon parents who are given false positive screening inform ation I-24. POTENTIAL BENEFITS, HARMS, AND CONTRAIND ICATIONS Most treatments are associated with known risks. In the case of screening and early intervention programs, potential harms may be related to either over diagnosis with increased rates of furt her evaluation and treatment that may be unnecessary and to under diagnosis that can lead to a late diagnosis with progression of deformity. Clinician input based upon experience decreases the probability of harms in both scenarios. Intervention with s plintage devices, more frequent visits to providers and increased rates of imaging occur in observational and case control series where the diagnosis of DDH is given I-11, I-20, I-25, for DDH has been associa ted with varying rates of avascular necrosis that represent a possibility of harm to individual patients. Observational and case control studies suggest that the management of children who present with DDH at walking age or older has greater risk of bei ng managed by open surgical hip reduction with its attendant risks of avascular necrosis, infection, hip stiffness, and early onset osteoarthritis as an adult I-1, I-4, I-8, I-9, I-18, I-30, I-31. The harms diagnosis with no treatment are not esta blished. This guideline only addresses children up to six months of age. 9 III. METHODS The methods used to perform this systematic review were employed to minimize bias and enhance transparency in the selection, appraisal, and analysis of the available evidence . These processes are vital to the development of reliable, transparent, and accurate clinical recommendations for treating developmental dysplasia of the hip. This clinical practice guideline and the systematic review upon which it is based evaluate the effectiveness of treatments for developmental dysplasia of the hip. This section describes the methods used to prepare this guideline and systematic review, including search strategies used to identify literature, criteria for selecting eligible articles, determining the strength of the evidence, data extraction, methods of statistical analysis, and the review and approval of the guideline. The AAOS approach incorporates practicing physicians (clinical experts) and methodologists who are free of potential conflicts of interest as recommended by guideline development experts.M-1 The AAOS understands that only high -quality guidelines are credible, and we go to great lengths to ensure the integrity of our evidence analyses. The AAOS addresses bias beginning with the selection of work group members. Applicants with financial conflic ts of interest (COI) related to the guideline topic cannot participate if the conflict occurred within one year of the start date of the guideline's development or if an immediate family member has, or has had, a relevant financial conflict. Additionally, all work group members sign an attestation form agreeing to remain free of relevant financial conflicts for two years following the publication of the guideline. This guideline and systematic review were prepared by the AAOS Developmental Dysplasia of th e Hip guideline clinician work group (clinical experts) with the assistance of the AAOS Evidence -Based Medicine (EBM) Unit in the Department of Research and Scientific Affairs (methodologists) at the AAOS. To develop this guideline, the work group held an introductory meeting on June 11 -12, 2011 to establish the scope of the guideline and the systematic reviews. The clinical experts defined the scope of the guideline by creating preliminary recommendations (Questions) that directed the literature search. Wh en necessary, these clinical experts also provided content help, search terms and additional clarification for the AAOS Medical Librarian. The Medical Librarian created and executed the search(s). The supporting group of methodologists (AAOS EBM Unit) revi ewed all abstracts, recalled pertinent full -text articles for review and evaluated the quality of studies meeting the inclusion criteria. They also abstracted, analyzed, interpreted, and/or summarized the relevant evidence for each recommendation and prepa red the initial draft for the final meeting. Upon completion of the systematic reviews, the clinician work group participated in a three -day recommendation meeting on October 4 -6, 2013. At this meeting, the clinician experts and methodologists then evaluat ed and integrated all material to develop the final recommendations. The final recommendations and rationales were edited, written , and voted on at the final meeting. The draft guideline recommendations and rationales received final review by the methodolo gists to ensure that these recommendations and rationales were consistent with the data. The draft was then completed and submitted for peer review on 4-14-14. 10 The resulting draft guidelines were then peer -reviewed, edited in response to that review and s ubsequently sent for public commentary, where after additional edits were made. Thereafter, the draft guideline was sequentially approved by the AAOS Committee on Evidence -Based Quality and Value, AAOS Council on Research and Quality, and the AAOS Board of Directors (see Appendix II for a description of the AAOS bodies involved in the approval process). All AAOS guidelines are reviewed and updated or retired every five years in accordance with the criteria of the Nationa l Guideline Clearinghouse. Thus the process of AAOS guideline development incorporates the benefits from clinical physician expertise as well as the statistical knowledge and interpretation of non - conflicted methodologists. The process also includes an ext ensive review process offering the opportunity for over 200 clinical physician experts to provide input into the draft prior to publication. This process provides a sound basis for minimizing bias, enhancing transparency and ensuring the highest level of a ccuracy for interpretation of the evidence. FORMULATING PRELIMIN ARY RECOMMENDATIONS The work group began work on this guideline by constructing a set of preliminary recommendations. These recommendations specify [what] should be done in [whom], [when], [w here], and [how often or how long]. They function as questions for the systematic review, not as final recommendations or conclusions. Preliminary recommendations are almost always modified on the basis of the results of the systematic review. Once establi shed, these a priori preliminary recommendations cannot be modified until the final w ork group meeting. FULL DISCLOSURE INFO RMATION Each preliminary recommendation developed by the work group is addressed in this guideline. This is of critical importance because it ensures full disclosure of all the data the work group considered. It also prevents bias that could result from failure to make such disclosure. STUDY SELECTION CRIT ERIA We developed a priori article inclusion criteria for our review. These criteria are our \"rules of evidence\" and articles that did not meet them are, for the purposes of this guideline, not evidence. To be i ncluded in our systematic reviews (and hence, in this guideline) an article had to be a report of a study that: Study must be of Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip Article must be a full article report of a clinical study Study must appear in a peer -reviewed publication Study must be published in English Study must be published in or after 1950 Study must be of humans 11 Study must not be an in vitro study Study must not be a biomechanical study Study must not have been performed on cadavers Study should hav e 10 or more patients per group All study follow up durations are included Study results must be quantitatively presented For any given follow -up time point in any included study, there must be 50% patient follow -up Retrospective non -comparative case s eries, medical records review, meeting abstracts, historical articles, editorials, letters, and commentaries are excluded Case series studies that give patients the treatment of interest AND another treatment are excluded Case series studies that have non -consecutive enrollment of patients are excluded All studies of \"Very Low\" strength of evidence are excluded Quantitatively presented results When a study's \"duration of symptoms\" is not the same as those examined by the work group (i.e. 0 -2 weeks, 2 -6 weeks, etc.) the study will be assigned to the appropriate \"duration of symptoms\" group based upon the mean duration of symptoms. If a range rather than mean is provided, the higher end of the range will dictate which \"duration of symptoms\" group the study will be assigned to. For example, a study reporting patient symptoms of 0 -4 weeks would be included in the time frame \"2 -6 weeks\" created by the work group. We did not include systematic reviews or meta -analyses compiled by others or guidelines developed by other organizations. These documents are developed using different inclusion criteria than those specified by the AAOS work group. Therefore they may include studies that do not meet our inclusion criteria. We recalled these documents, if the abstract s uggested they might provide an answer to one of our recommendations, and searched their bibliographies for additional studies to supplement our systematic review. BEST EVIDENCE SYNTHE SIS When determining the best available evidenc e, we first include the hi ghest -strength studies available for the outcomes examined. If there are two or more high -strength studies, the recommendation grade is strong. In this case, moderate - and low - strength evidence do not influence the grade of the recommendation. If there is one high - or at least two moderate - strength studies, the recommendation grade is moderate. If there is one moderate - or at least one low- strength studies, the recommendation grade is limited. Consensus based recommendations are established only when the rules for consensus recommendations apply (Table 8) . A sum mary of the evidence that met the initial inclusion criteria, but was not best available evidence was created for each recommendation and can be viewed by recommendation in Appendix XII. MINIMALLY CLINICALLY IMPORTANT IMPROVEMEN T Wherever possible, we consider the effects of treatments in terms of the minimally clinically important difference (MCI I) in addition to whether their effects are statistically 12 signific ant. The MCI is the smallest clinical change that is important to patients, and recognizes the fact that there are some treatment -induced statistically significant improvements that are too small to matter to patients. However, t here were no occurrences of validated MCID outcomes in the studies included in this clinical practice guideline. When MCID values from the specific guideline patient population are not available, we use the following measures listed in order of priority: 1) MCID /MID 2) PASS or Impact 3) Another validated measure 4) Statistical Significance LITERATURE SEARCHES We begin the systematic review with a comprehensive search of the literature. Articles we consider were published prior to September 2013 in four electronic databases; PubMed, EMBASE, CIN AHL, and The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. The medical librarian conducts the search using key terms determined from the work group's preliminary recommendations. We supplement the electronic search with a manual search of the bibliogra phies of all retrieved publications, recent systematic reviews, and other review articles for potentially relevant citations. Recalled articles are evaluated for possible inclusion based on the study selection criteria and are summarized for the work group who assist with reconciling possible errors and omissions. The study attrition diagram in Appendix III provides a detailed description of the numbers of identified abstracts and recalled and selected studies that were evaluated in the systematic review of this guideline. The search strategies used to identify the abstracts are contained in Appendix IV. METHODS FOR EVALUATI NG EVIDENCE STUDIES OF INTERVENTION/PREVENT ION QUALITY As noted earlier, we judge quality based on a priori research questions and use an automated numerical scoring process to arrive at final ratings. Extensive measures are taken to determine quality ratings so that they are fr ee of bias. We evaluate the quality of evidence separately for each outcome reported in every study using research design domains suggested by GRADE work group members and others.M2, M3 The GRADE evidence appraisal system is used in the Cochrane Collabor ationM4 and has been developed for studies evaluating matched control groups. We incorporate a coding scheme adaptable to all research designs that involves incremental increases or decreases based on the following criteria : 13 The study was prospective (with prospective studies, it is possible to have an a priori hypothesis to test; this is not possible with retrospective studies.) The statistical power of the study The assignment of patients to groups was unbiased There was sufficient blinding to mitigate ag ainst a placebo effect The patient groups were comparable at the beginning of the study The treatment was delivered in such a way that any observed effects could reasonably be attributed to that treatment Whether the instruments used to measure outcomes w ere valid Whether there was evidence of investigator bias Each of the above quality domains is rated for possible flaws based on up to four indicator questions that define them. See Appendix V for a discussion of the AAOS app raisal system. Domains are considered \"flawed\" if one indicator is coded \"No\" or at least two defining questions are \"Unclear.\" The Statistical Power domain is considered flawed if sample size is too small to detect at least a small effect size of 0.2. If there are flawed domains then the evidence quality is downgraded according to the reductions shown in Table 1. As an example, the evidence reported in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) for any given outcome is rated as \"High\" quality if zero or one dom ain is flawed. If two or three domains are flawed, the rating is reduced to \"Moderate.\" If four or five domains are flawed, the quality of evidence is downgraded to \"Low.\" The quality of evidence is reduced to \"Very Low\" if six or more domains are flawed. As indicated above, very low quality evidence is not included in this AAOS guideline. Table 1. Relationship between Quality and Domain Scores for Interventions Number of Domains With No More Than One \"Unclear\" Answ er Strength of Evidence 0 High 1-2 Moderate 3-4 Low >5 Very Low Some flaws are so serious that we automatically term the evidence as being of \"Very Low\" quality if a study exhibits them. These serious design flaws are: Non-consecutive enrollment of patients in a case series Case series that gave patients the treatment of interest AND another treatment Measuring the outcome of interest one way in some patients and measuring it in another way in other patients Low Statistical Power 14 Conversely, the quality of research articles may be upgraded if the research is of high applicability or if providing the intervention decreases the potential for catastrophic harm, such as loss of life or limb. The criteria, based on the G.R.A.D.E. method ology, which can be used to upgrade the quality of a study, are as follows: The study has a large (>2) or very large (>5) magnitude of treatment effect: used for non -retrospective observational studies; All plausible confounding factors would reduce a demo nstrated effect or suggest a spurious effect when results show no effect; Consideration of the dose -response effect. Quality is one of two dimensions that determine the strength of the final recommendations. APPLICABILITY The applicability (also cal led \"generalizability\" or \"external validity\") of an outcome is one of the factors used to determine the strength of a recommendation. We categorize outcomes according to whether their applicability is \"High\", \"Moderate\", or \"Low.\" As with quality, we sepa rately evaluate the applicability for each outcome a study reports. The applicability of a study is evaluated using the PRECIS instrument .M5 The instrument was originally designed to evaluate the applicability of randomized controlled trials, but it can al so be used for studies of other design. For example, the existence of an implicit control group in a case series (see above) make it useful for evaluating outcomes from these latter studies. This instrument is comprised of the 10 questions that are briefly described in Table 2. All 10 questions are asked of all studies, regardless of design. The questions are divided into four domains. These domains and their corresponding questions are given in Table 2. Table 2. Brief Description of the PRECIS Questions and Do mains Question Domain All Types of Patients Enrolled Participants Flexible Instructions to Practitioners Interventions and Expertise Full Range of Expt'l Practitioners Interventions and Expertise Usual Practice Control Interventions and Expertise Full Range of Control Practitioners Interventions and Expertise No Formal Follow -up Interventions and Expertise Usual and Meaningful Outcome Interventions and Expertise Compliance Not Measured Compliance and Adherence No Measure of Practitioner Adherence Compliance and Adherence All Patients in Analysis Analysis Each study is assumed to have \"High\" applicability at the start, and applicability is downgraded for flawed domains as summarized in Table 3. 15 Table 3. Relationship between Applicability and Domain Scores for Studies of Treatments Number of Flawed Domains Applicability 0 High 1, 2, 3 Moderate 4 Low A study's applicability is \"High\" if there is only one \"Unclear\" answer in one domain and the answers to all of the questions for all other domains is \"Yes.\" A study's applicability is low if there is one \"Unclear\" answer in one domain and the answers to a ll of the questions for all other domains is \"No.\" A study's applicability is \"Moderate\" under all other conditions. STUDIES OF SCREENING AND DIAGNOSTIC TESTS QUALITY As with our appraisal of the quality of studies of intervention, our appraisal of studie s of screening and diagnostic tests is a domain -based approach conducted using a priori questions and scored by a computer program. The questions we used are those of the QUADAS instrumentM6 and the six domains we employed are listed below: 1. Participants (w hether the spectrum of disease among the participants enrolled in the study is the same as the spectrum of disease seen in actual clinical practice) 2. Reference Test (whether the reference test , often a \"gold standard,\" and the way it was employed in the st udy ensures correct and unbiased categorization of patients as having or not having disease) 3. Index Test (whether interpretation of the results of the test under study, often called the \"index test\", was unbiased) 4. Study Design (whether the design of the study allowed for unbiased interpretation of test results) 5. Information (whether the same clinical data were available when test results were interpreted as would be available when the test is used in practice) 6. Reporting (whether the patients, tests, and s tudy protocol were described well enough to permit its replication) We characterized a study that has no flaws in any of its domains as being of \"High\" quality, a study that has one flawed domain as being of \"Moderate\" quality, a study with two flawed doma ins as being of \"Low\" quality, and a study with three or more flawed domains as being of \"Very Low\" quality ( Table ).We characterized a domain as \"flawed\" if one or more questions addressing any given domain are answered \"No\" for a given screening/diagnostic/test, or if there are two or more \"Unclear\" answers to the questions addressing that domain. We considered some design flaws as so serious tha t their presence automatically guarantees that a study is characterized as being of \"Very Low\" quality regardless of its domain scores. These flaws are: 16 The presence of spectrum bias (occurs when a study does not enroll the full spectrum of patients who a re seen in clinical practice. For example, a diagnostic case control study enrolls only those known to be sick and those known to be well, a patient population quite different from that seen in practice. Because diagnostic case control studies enroll only the easy to diagnose patients, these kinds of studies typically overestimate the abilities of a diagnostic test.) Failure to give all patients the reference standard regardless of the index test results Non-independence of the reference test and the inde x text Table 4. Relationship Between Domain Scores and Quality of Screening/Diagnostic Tests Number of Flawed Domains Quality 0 High 1 Moderate 2 Low 3 Very Low APPLICABILITY We judged the applicability of evidence pertinent to screening and diagnostic tests using a modified version of the PRECIS instrument, implying that the questions are determined a priori . As before, scoring was accomplished by a computer. The applicability domains we employed for screening and diagnostic tests were: 1. Patients (i.e., whether the patients in the study are like those seen in actual clinical practice) 2. Index Test (i.e., whether the test under study could be used in actual clinical practice and w hether it was administered in a way that reflects its use in actual practice) 3. Directness (i.e., whether the study demonstrated that patient health is affected by use of the diagnostic test under study) 4. Analysis (i.e., whether the data analysis reported i n the study was based on a large enough percentage of enrolled patients to ensure that the analysis was not conducted on \"unique\" or \"unusual\" patients) We characterized a domain as \"flawed\" if one or more questions addressing any given domain are answere d \"No\" for a given screening/diagnostic/test, or if there are two or more \"Unclear\" answers to the questions addressing that domain. We characterized the applicability of a screening/diagnostic test as \"High\" if none of its domains are flawed, \"Low\" if all of its domains are flawed, and \"Moderate\" in all other cases ( Table 5) . 17 Table 5. Relationship Between Domain Scores and Applicability for Studies of Screening/Diagnostic Tests Number of Flawed Domains Applicability 0 High 1,2, 3 Moderate 4 Low STUDIES OF PROGNOSTI CS QUALITY Our appraisal of studies of prognostics is a domain -based approach conducted using a priori questions, and scored by a computer program for the questions we used and the domains to which they apply). The five domains we employed are: 1. Prospective (A variable is specified as a potential prognostic variable a priori . This is not possible with retro spective studies.) 2. Power (Whether the study had sufficient statistical power to detect a prognostic variable as statistically significant) 3. Analysis (Whether the statistical analyses used to determine that a variable was rigorous to provide sound results) 4. Model (Whether the final statistical model used to evaluate a prognostic variable accounted for enough variance to be statistically significant) 5. Whether there was evidence of investigator bias We separately determined a quality score for each prognostic re ported by a study. We characterized the evidence relevant to that prognostic variable as being of \"High\" quality if there are no flaws in any of the relevant domains, as being of \"Moderate\" quality if one of the relevant domains is flawed, as \"Low\" quality if there are two flawed domains, and as \"Very Low\" quality if three or more re levant domains are flawed (Table 5 ). We characterized a domain as \"flawed\" if one or more questions addressing any given domain are answered \"No\" for a given prognostic variable , or if there are two or more \"Unclear\" answers to the questions addressing that domain. Table 6. Relationship Between Quality and Domain Scores for Studies of Prognostics Number of Flawed Domains Quality 0 High 1 Moderate 2 Low 3 Very Low APPLICABILITY We separately evaluated the applicability of each prognostic variable reported in a study, and did so using a domain -based approach for the relevant questions and the domains they address) that involves predetermined questions and computer scoring. The domains we used for the applicability of prognostics are: 18 1. Patients (i.e. whether the patients in the study and in the analysis were like those seen in actual clinical practice) 2. Analysis (i.e., whether the analysis was conducted in a way that was likely to describe variation among patients that might be unique to the dataset the authors used) 3. Outcome (i.e., whether the prognostic was a predictor of a clinically meaningful outcome) We characterized the evidence relevant to that prognostic as being of \"High\" applicability if there are no flaws in any of the relevant domains, as being of \"Low\" applicability if all three domains are flawed, and as of \"Moderate\" applicability in all other cases ( Table 6 X). We characterized a domain as \"flawed\" if one or more questions addressing any given domain are answered \"No\" for a given prognostic variable, or if there are two or more \"Unclear\" answers to the questions addressing that domain. Table 7. Relationship Between Domain Scores and Applicability for Studies of Prognostics Number of Flawed Domains Applicability 0 High 1,2 Moderate 3 Low FINAL STRENGTH OF EV IDENCE To determine the final strength of evidence for an outcome, the strength is initially taken to equal quality. An outcome's strength of evidence is increased by one category if its applicability is \"High\", and an outcome's strength of evidence is decreased by one category if its applicability is \"Low.\" If an outcome's applicability is \"Moderate\", no adjustment is made to the strength of evidence derived from the quality evaluation. DEFINING THE STRENGT H OF THE RECOMMENDAT ION S Judging the strength of evidence is only a stepping stone towards arriving at the strength of a guideline recommendation. The strength of recommendation also takes into account the quality, quantity, and the trade -off between the benefits and harms of a treatment, the magnitude of a treatment's effect, and whether there is data on critical outcomes. Strength of recommendation expresses the degree of confidence one can have in a recommendation. As such, the strength expresses how possible it is that a recommendation will be overturned by future evidence. It is very difficult for future evidence to overturn a recommendation that is based on many high quality randomized controlled trials that show a large effect. It is much more likely that future evidence w ill overturn recommendations derived from a few small case series. Consequently, recommendations based on the former kind of evidence are given a high strength of recommendation and recommendations based on the latter kind of evidence are given a low stren gth. To develop the strength of a recommendation, AAOS staff first assigned a preliminary strength for each recommendation that took only the final strength of evidence (including quality and applicability) and the quantity of evidence (see Table 8). 19 Table 8. Strength of Recommendation Descriptions Strength Overall Strength of Evidence Description of Evidence Strength Strength Visual Strong Strong Evidence from two or more \"High\" strength studies with consistent findings for recommending for or against the intervention. Moderate Moderate Evidence from two or more \"Moderate\" strength studies with consistent findings, or evidence from a single \"High\" quality study for recommending for or against the intervention. Limited Low Strength Evidence or Conflicting Evidence Evidence from two or more \"Low\" strength studies with consistent findings or evidence from a single study for recommending for against the intervention or diagnostic or the evidence is insufficient or conflicting and does not allow a recommendation for or against the intervention. Consensus* No Evidence There is no supporting e vidence. In the absence of reliable evidence, the work group is making a recommendation based on their clinical opinion. Consensus recommendations can only be created when not establishing a recommendation could have catastrophic consequences. WORDING OF THE FINAL RECOMME NDATIONS To prevent bias in the way recommendations are worded, the AAOS uses specific predetermined language stems that are governed by the evidence strengths . Each recommendation was written using language that accounts for the final strength of the recommendation. This language, and the corresponding strength, is shown in Table 9. Table 9. AAOS Guideline Language Stems Guideline Language Strength of Recommendation Strong evidence supports that the practitioner should/should not do X, because... Strong Moderate evidence supports that the practitioner could/could not do X, because... Moderate Limited evidence supports that the practitioner might/might not do X, because... Limited In the absence of reliable evidence, it is the opinion of this work group that...* Consensus* 20 *Consensus based recommendations are made according to specific criteria. These criteria can be found i n Appendix VI . APPLYING THE RECOMMENDATIONS TO C LINICAL PRACTICE To increase the practicality and applicability of the guideline recommendations in this document, the information listed in Table 10 provides assistance in interpreting the correlation between the strength of a recommen dation and patient counseling time, use of decision aids, and the impact of future research Table 10. Clinical Applicability: Interpreting the Strength of a Recommendation Strength of Recommendation Patient Counse ling (Time) Decision Aids Impact of Future Research Strong Least Least Important , unless the evidence supports no difference between two alternative interventions Not likely to change Moderate Less Less Important Less likely to change Limited More Important Change possible/anticipated Consensus Most Most Important Impact unknown VOTING ON THE RECOMM ENDATIONS The recommendations and their strength were voted on by the work group members during the final meeting. If disagreement between the work group occurred , there was further discussion to see whether the disagreement(s) could be resolved. Up to three rounds of voting were held to attempt to resolve disagreements. If disagreements were not resolved following three voting rounds, no recomm endation was adopted. Lack of agreement is a reason that the strength for some recommendations can be labeled \"Limited.\" STATISTICAL METHODS ANALYSIS OF DIAGNOST IC DATA Likelihood ratios, sensitivity, specificity and 95% confidence intervals were calcul ated to determine the accuracy of diagnostic modalities based on two by two diagnostic contingency tables extracted from the included s tudies. When summary values of sensitivity, specificity, or other diagnostic perfo rmance measures were reported, estimates of the diagnostic contingency table were used to calculate likelihood ratios. Likelihood ratios (LR) indicate the magnitude of the change in probability of disease due to a given test result. For example, a positive likelihoo d ratio of 10 indica tes that a 21 positive test result is 10 times more common in patients with disease than in patients without disease. Likelihood ratios are interpreted according to previously published values, as seen in Table below. Table 11. Interp reting Likelihood Ratios Positive Likelihood Ratio Negative Likelihood Ratio Interpretation >10 <0.1 Large and conclusive change in probability 5-10 0.1-0.2 Moderate change in probability 2-5 0.2-0.5 Small (but sometimes important change in probability) 1-2 0.5-1 Small (and rarely important) change in probability ANALYSIS OF INTERVEN TION/PREVENTION DATA When possible, we recalculate the results reported in individual studies and compile them to answer the recommendations. The results of all statistical analysis conducted by the AAOS Clinical Practice Guidelines Unit are conducted using STATA 12. STATA was used to determine the magnitude, direction, and/or 95% confidence intervals of the treatment effect. For data reported as means (and as sociated measures of dispersion) the mean difference between groups and the 95% confidence interval was calculated and a two-tailed t -test of independent groups was used to determine statistical significance. When published studies report measures of dispe rsion other than the standard deviation the value was estimated to facilitate calculation of the treatment effect. In studies that report standard errors or confidence intervals the standard deviation was back -calculated. In some circumstances statistical testing was conducted by the authors and measures of dispersion were not reported. In the absence of measures of dispersion, the results of the statistical analyses conducted by the authors (i.e. the p -value) are considered as evidence. For proportions, we report the proportion of patients that experienced an outcome along with the percentage of patients that experienced an outcome. The variance of the arcsine difference was used to determine statistical significance.M7 P-values < 0.05 were considered stati stically significant. We performed meta -analyses using the random effects method of DerSimonian and Laird.M8 A minimum of four studies was required for an outcome to be considered by meta -analysis. Heterogeneity was assessed with the I -squared statistic. M eta-analyses with I -squared values less than 50% were considered as evidence. Those with I -squared larger than 50% were not considered as evidence for this guideline. All meta -analyses were performed using STATA 1 2 and the \"metan\" command. The arcsine diff erence was used in meta -analysis of proportions. In order to overcome the difficulty of interpreting the magnitude of the arcsine difference, a summary odds ratio is calculated based on random effects meta -analysis of proportions and the number needed to t reat (or harm) is calculated. The standardized mean difference was used for meta -analysis of means and magnitude was interpreted using Cohen's definitions of small, medium, and large effect. 22 PEER REVIEW Following the final meeting, the guideline draft un dergoes peer review for additional input from external content experts. Written comments are provided on the structured review form (see Appendix VII). All peer reviewers are required to disclose their conflicts of interest . To guide who participates, the work group identifies specialty societies at the introductory meeting. O rganizations , not individuals , are specified. The specialty societies are solicited for nominations of individual peer reviewers approximately six weeks before the final meeting. The peer review period is announced as it approaches and others interested are able to volunteer to review the draft. The c hair of the AAOS committee on Evidence Based Quality and Value reviews the draft of the guideline prior to dissemination. Some specialty societies (both orthopaedic and non -orthopaedic) ask their evidence - based practice (EBP) committee to provide review of the guideline. The organization is responsible for coordinating the distribution of our materials and consolidating their comments onto one form. The chair of the external EBP committees provides disclosure of their conflicts of interest (COI) and manag es the potential conflicts of their members. Again, the AAOS asks for comments to be assembled into a single response form by the specialty society and for the individual submitting the review to provide disclosure of potentially conflicting interests. T he peer review stage gives external stakeholders an opportunity to provide evidence -based direction for modifications that they believe have been overlooked. Since the draft is subject to revisions until its approval by the AAOS Board of Directors as the f inal step in the guideline development process, confidentiality of all working drafts is essential. The manager of the evidence -based medicine unit drafts the initial responses to comments that address methodology. These responses are then reviewed by th e work group chair and vice -chair, who respond to questions concerning clinical practice and techniques. The director of the Department of Research and Scientific Affairs provides input as well. All comments received and the initial drafts of the responses are also reviewed by all members of the work group. All changes to a recommendation as a result of peer review are based on the evidence and undergoes majority vote by the work group members via teleconference. Final revisions are summarized in a detailed report that is made part of the guideline document throughout the remainder of the review and approval processes. The AAOS believes in the importance of demonstrating responsiveness to input received during the peer review process and welcomes the critiques of external specialty societies. Following final approval of the guideline, all individual responses are posted on our website http://www.aaos.org/research/guidelines/guide.asp with a point -by-point reply to each non -editorial comment. Reviewers who wish to remain anonymous notify the AAOS to have their names de -identified; their comments, our responses, and their C OI disclosures are still posted. 23 Review of the Management of Developmental dysplasia of the hip guideline was requested of 25 organization s and 27 external content experts were nominated to represent them. Fifteen individuals returned comments on the str uctured review form (see Appendix VIII ). PUBLIC COMMENTARY After modifying the draft in response to peer review, the guideline was subjected to a thirty day period of \"Public Commentary.\" Commentators consist of members o f the AAOS Board of Directors (BOD), members of the Council on Research and Quality (CORQ) , members of the Board of Councilors (BOC), and members of the Board of Specialty Societies (BOS). The guideline is automatically forwarded to the AAOS BOD and CORQ s o that they may review it and provide comment prior to being asked to approve the document. Members of the BOC and BOS are solicited for interest. If they request to see the document, it is forwarded to them for comment. Based on these bodies, over 200 com mentators have the opportunity to provide input into this guideline. Of these five members returned public comments. THE AAOS GUIDELINE A PPROVAL PROCESS This final guideline draft must be approved by the AAOS Committee on Evidence -Based Quality and Value , the AAOS Council on Research and Quality, and the AAOS Board of Directors. These decision -making bodies are described in Appendix II and are not designated to modify the contents. Their charge is to approve or reject its publication by majority vote. REVISION PLANS This guideline represents a cross -sectional view of current treatment and may become outdated as new evidence becomes available. This guideline will be revised in accordance with new evidence, changing pra ctice, rapidly emerging treatment options, and new technology. This guideline will be updated or withdrawn in five years in accordance with the standards of the National Guideline Clearinghouse. GUIDELINE DISSEMINAT ION PLANS The primary purpose of the pre sent document is to provide interested readers with full documentation about not only our recommendations, but also about how we arrived at those recommendations. This document is also posted on the AAOS website at http://www.aaos.org/research/guidelines/guide.asp . Shorter versions of the guideline are available in other venues. Publication of most guidelines is announced by an Academy press release, articles authored by the work group and p ublished in the Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, and articles published in AAOS Now. Most guidelines are also distributed at the AAOS Annual Meeting in various venues such as on Academy Row and at Committee Scientific Exhibits. Selected guidelines are disseminated by webinar, an Online Module for the Orthopaedic Knowledge Online website, Radio Media Tours, Media Briefings, and by distributing 24 them at relevant Continuing Medical Education (CME) courses and at the AAOS Resource Center . Other dissemination efforts outside of the AAOS will include submitting the guideline to the National Guideline Clearinghouse and distributing the guideline at other medical specialty societies' meetings . 21 IV.

Strength of Recommendation: Moderate RATIONALE There is moderate evidence to not do universal screening of all infants for DDH. Two moderate strength studies showed no statistical difference between universal and selective ultrasound screening of the infant hip for diagnosis of late presenting DDH.1,2 Holen augmented clinical screening with either universal or selective (risk) ultrasound. The rate of late cases in Holen's study was 0.13/1000 with universal ultrasound sc reening and 0.65/1000 with selective (risk) screening. The difference in late detection was not statistically significant. Rosendahl used three matched study groups: general ultrasound screening, risk factor screening and only clinical screening. Late case s identified by group were 0.3/1000, 0.7/1000 and 1.3/1000 respectively and these differences were not statistically significant. Screening of all infants with ultrasound has the potential to lead to over -treatment. Rosendahl's study found that general ultrasound screening resulted in a higher treatment rate (3.4%) than either selective ultrasound screening (2.0%) or clinical screening (1.8%). The higher rate with universal screening is statistically significant. Universal ultrasound screening requires considerable diagnostic and therapeutic effort and these studies which involve large numbers of newborns indicate that such a commitment of resources will not significantly impact the prevalence of late cases. Risks and Harms of Recommendation There is a potential to miss a case of DDH in an infant with a normal clinical examination and no risk factors.

Strength of Recommendation: Moderate RATIONALE If the risk factors of family and/or breech presentation are present, there is moderate evidence to support selective ultrasound screening between 2 -6 weeks of age for infants who otherwise have a normal clinical hip examination or an AP radiograph at 4 mo nths of age. There were two studies of moderate strength that confirm significance for selective prospective screening by ultrasound in infants with history of possible clinical instability and /or risk factors: breech and family history to prevent late dislocations and need for surgery.16, 17 Of the 10 studies of low strength the various risk factors included were: breech, family history, sex, combination of sex and breech, combination of sex and family history, hip click, first born, s waddling, and talipes. Breech literature included six studies all of low study strength . The results of these studies were meta -analyzed and the meta -analysis overwhelmingly supported breech presentation as a risk factor for neonatal instability. The liter ature terminology on breech is: breech at birth, breech delivery , and breech position at the third trimester ; there is no literature to substantiate a particular duration of breech positioning as a risk factor. Family histo ry: four articles of low strengt h all showing statistical significance for family history as a risk fac tor for DDH. 4, 5, 13, 18 There was one study which showed no statistical significance. 3 One study compared treatment for dislocatable hips (at age less than one week) with no treatment for stable hips with positive family history. 8 The outcome was residual dysplasia at five months and was noted to be significant for the no treatment category. The authors further treated these patients from th e no treatment category at age five months and compared them with the original cohort of Barlow positive patients treated at age less than one week. This time around, the outcome parameter was residual dysplasia at two years and was again noted to be signi ficant. Other outcome measures included AVN at two years, which was not significant, and treatment failure, which was noted to be significant. This study did not have a true comparative group for analysis. There was a combination of dislocated and dislocat able hips in the Barlow positive category, which confounds the analysis. The literature definitions of family history of DDH range from unspecified hip disorders to hip dislocation and from first degree relative (parents and siblings), to any relative (even if distant or vague) with hip problems or DDH (all other articles). Three articles listed family history, but did not specify the relationships or specific hip problems.3, 5, 7 30 One study compared ultrasound screening in infants who had risk factors alone with those who had \"doubtful\" clinical instability.17 Rate of detection of dislocation as confirmed by ultrasound was 13/1000 (7 to 24) vs 87/ 1000 (57 to 126/1000) respectively. There is no substantiation in the literature of the optimal age for imaging studies in these infant s with risk fa ctors .8 One study performed hip radiographs at 4 months of age. Two studies14, 15 performed ultrasound between 2 -6 weeks of age. Examination of other quoted risk factors was done. Evidence was not found to include foot abnormalities, gender, oligohydramnios, and torticollis as risk factors for DDH. Risks and harms There is a potential risk of over diagnosis and treatment. 23 SUPPORTING EVIDENCE QUALITY AND APPLICAB ILITY Table 14.

Meta -Analysis of the Breech Risk Factor 51 Figure 3. Meta -Analysis of the Female Risk Factor 52 IMAGING OF THE UNSTA BLE HIP Limited evidence supports that the practitioner might obtain an ultrasound in infants less than 6 weeks of age with a positive instability examination to guide the decision to initiate brace treatment. Strength of Recommendation: Limited RATIONALE If faced with an unstable hip examination, there is limited evidence to support the use of sequential ultrasound to aid in determining when to initiate brace trea tment for infants up to 8 weeks of age. Fewer children may undergo brace treatment with no difference in the occurrence of late dysplasia. One moderate strength study showed fewer children in the ultrasound group had abduction splinting in the first two years than did those in the no ultrasound group (0\u00b778; 0\u00b765 -0\u00b794; p=0\u00b701). 19 The primary outcome was the ap pearance on hip radiographs by two years. Secondary outcomes included surgical treatment, abduction splinting, level of mobility, resource use, and costs. Analysis was by intention to treat. Protocol compliance was high, and radiographic information was available for 91% of children by 12 -14 mo nths and 85% by 2 years. By age 2 years, subluxation, dislocation, or acetabular dysplasia were identified by radiography on one or both hips of 21 children in each of the groups (relative risk 1\u00b700; 95% CI 0\u00b756 -1\u00b780). Surgical treatment was required by 2 1 infants in the ultrasound group (6\u00b77%) and 25 (7\u00b79%) in the no -ultrasound group (0\u00b784; 0\u00b748 -1\u00b747). One child from the ultrasound group and four from the no -ultrasound group were not walking by 2 years (0\u00b725; 0\u00b703 - 2\u00b753; p=0\u00b737). Initially this study was graded as high strength, but was downgraded to moderate strength because the rate of splint treatment was not the primary outcome. Additionally , it is unclear that all subjects were normal infants with DDH and no confounding diagnoses . In this study infan ts with hips that had minor instability were not immediately treated. Experienced doctors performed the clinical examinations. Even though there is even distribution between the groups in terms of number of history of instability, subgroup analysis of disl ocated versus dysplastic hip results were not available. Harms There is a p otential delay of necessary treatment . 53 SUPPORTING EVIDENCE QUALITY AND APPLICAB ILITY Table 34.

pelvis radiograph instead of an ultrasound to assess DDH in infants beginning at 4 months of age. Strength of Recommendation: Limited RATIONALE There is limited evidence that an AP pelvis radiograph is preferred to the use of ultrasound to assess for DDH in infants from 4 -6 months of age. This evidence does not distinguish between children with normal or abnormal physical examinations or between children with and without risk factors for DDH. One moderate -strength study investigated the radiographic assessment of every ultrasound positive hip in children four to six months of age. 20 Seventy -four infants with ultrasound positive hips for acetabular dysplasia who met criteria for treatment received an AP pelvis radiograph. Of these 74 infant s, 30 were found to have satisfactory acetabular indices and did not receive treatment. Limitations of this study include the lack of long -term follow -up of the infants to determine if the radiographic assessment altered outcome and failed to address the optimal time of conversion from ultrasound to radiographic assessment in infants with DDH. Risks and Harms of Recommendation: Radiographs involve exposure to ionizing radiation. 65 SUPPORTING EVIDENCE QUALITY AND APPLICAB ILITY Table 36.

Strength of Recommendation: Limited RATIONALE If faced with a child who has a normal physical examination, there is limited evidence that performing subsequent hip physical examination screening of children up to 6 months of age will detect additional c hildren with DDH. The reviewed literature does not include the screening of children up to walking age when other examination findings such as gait abnormalities may allow for detection of additional children with DDH. One low strength study presented evi dence that repeated studies at three months were productive in identifying late diagnosed DD H. 22 Another low strength study noted that exams at eight months of age had a high rate of false positives, but no yield of true positives.21 There is no literature to define the optimal frequency or duration of follow -up surveillance. Risks and Harms There is a potential risk of over diagnosis and treatment. 68 SUPPORTING EVIDENCE QUALITY AND APPLICAB ILITY Table 38.

Strength of Recommendation: Limited RAT IONALE For an infant with a normal physical examination and ultrasound abnormalities, there is limited evidence to support observation without treatment of that infant with serial ultrasound evaluation up to 6 weeks of age. One low -strength study evaluated a group of at-risk patients who were evaluated by ultrasound between two and six weeks of age with clinically stable hips showing ultrasonographic abnormalities that were randomized to treatment with Pavlik harness or observation.23The two primary outcome measures were the acetabular coverage on ultrasound and acetabular index on radiograph. While acetabular coverage, measure d ultrasonographically, improved in both groups, and was statistically better in t he splinted group at the final, three month follow -up, there was no difference in acetabular index. Risks and Harms The risk of implementing this recommendation is that nece ssary treatment could be delayed. 71 SUPPORTING EVIDENCE QUALITY AND APPLICAB ILITY Table 40.

Strength of Recommendation: Limited RATIONALE For infants with a positive hip instability exam, there is conflicting evidence about whether a period of observation or immediate brace treatment leads to a difference in later dysplasia or persistent hip instability leading to later brace treatment. One moderate strength and three low strength studies looked at radiographic differences between an early versus late brace treatment group. 24, 25(follow -up), 26, 27, 28 None of these studies differentiate dislocated from dislocata ble hips. Gardiner found a significant difference in the radiographic appearance of the femoral capital epiphysis and delayed iliac indentation at 6 months for a no treatment group compared to a brace group.25 Twenty -nine percent of the non -treatment group had cross - over and were treated at two weeks. Limitations were not defining the femoral capital epiphyseal ossification subcategories and iliac indentation and not explaining the relevance of either. Molto compared Von Rosen splinting immediately after birth to splinting after two weeks. 26 The outcome criterion was acetabular index. They noted a significant improvement in the acetabular index at 15 months in the immediate treatment group (76 patients) as compared to the 27 patients in the sec ond group treated after two weeks . Paton repor ted on 75 hips in 2 groups, including 37 patients (59 hips) in the early splint treatment group versus 11 patients (16 hips) in the late splint treatment group.27 Outcome measures included continued instability that requir ed late splint treatment after six weeks, radiographic abnormality, AVN, or surgical intervention at walking age. Authors noted no significant differences when treatment started at l ess than one week in the early treatment group versus nine weeks on average in the delayed treatm ent group.

Strength of Recommendation: Limited RATIONALE There are no high quality comparative effectiveness studies between different types of braces for the treatment of DDH. Limited evidence suggests that rigid braces may have higher rates of resolution of hip dysplasia than non -rigid braces. Two low strength studies compared rigid bracing to soft bracing for initial treatment of uns table hips in infants. 29, 30 Heikkila compared the Frejka pillow with the von Rosen splint.29There were 920 patients treated with Frejka pillow and 180 patients treated with von Rosen splint. Fifty - five of 920 from the Frejka pillow group had treatment fa ilure, while 1 out of 180 from the von Rosen splint group failed treatment. These differences were significant. A limitation of this study is that it was a historical comparative study of two cohorts over two time periods. AVN rates were inadequately repor ted. The authors did not differentiate between dislocated and dislocatable hips. Three splints were compared in the Wilkinson study: Craig, Pavlik, and von Rosen.30 Four of 28 in the Craig splint group, 13 of 43 in the Pavlik group, and 0 of 26 in the von Rosen group required further treatment in the form of plaster or operation. This recommendation is based on the braces that were studied, but other similar fixed - position braces may or may not work as well as the braces mentioned in the evidence. Risks and Harms Nineteen percent of the patients in the rigid brace group experienced skin irritation29. There is a potential risk of AVN with all bracing; the relative risk is unknown between rigid and soft bracing. 86 SUPPORTING EVIDENCE QUALITY AND APPLICAB ILITY Table 45.

evidence supports that the practitioner perform serial physical examinations and periodic imaging assessments (ultrasound or radiograph based on age) during management for unstable infant hips. Strength of Recommendation: Limited RATIONALE If brace treatment is initiated, there is limited evidence that episodic serial physical and imaging reassessments during the treatment cycle can lead to changes or duration of the treatment plan. Two low strength studies report monitoring of brace treatment using physical exam, ultrasound, and radiography following the appearance of the ossific nucleus.31, 32 Both studies identified failure of reduction or persistent dysplasia in patients undergoing brace treatment. These findings necessitated a change in treatment plan or duration. No parameters for optimal timing or frequency of imaging were established by research protocol. Risks and Harms: Radiographs involve exposure to ionizing radiation. 100 SUPPORTING EVIDENCE QUALITY AND APPLICAB ILITY Table 47.

FUTURE RESEARCH This clinical practice guideline is focused on early detection by the clinical and imaging screening of populations of infants and on the early management of DDH. The grades of recommendations for this clinical practice guideline range from limited to mod erate strength. Of 3990 citations on the topic of DDH, 42 articles were ultimately included as evidence related to the recommendations in this guideline and 18 articles met our inclusion criteria for an assessment of the natural history for DDH in infancy . It has a large potential impact due to the size of populations to be screened and the functional limitations that can be created by late diagnosis and management of individuals with this condition. We found significant gaps in the evidence that can be used to derive practice guidelines for the early diagnosis and management of DDH. There is considerable confusion related to the terminology and definitions that have been used in research related to DDH and about what defines a pathologic condition vers us an expected developmental variation based upon the age and status of a child is needed. There are additional gaps in knowledge of the basic pathophysiology of DDH, understanding of the long term impact of DDH upon the health status and well -being of af fected individuals, the appropriateness of DDH for public health screening programs as they are practiced today, the optimal diagnostic tools to be used to detect the condition, and the relative efficacy and value of recommended interventions. Additional research is needed to create clarity in these areas. The large numbers of patients who need to be assessed and the severity of functional limitations that can be created by late diagnosis and management of individuals with this condition suggests that re search inclusive of comparative effectiveness research design would be of great advantage. Specifically, future research areas should attempt to: Establish clear, widely accepted, reproducible criteria and definitions for: o Clinical terms that describe h ip stability o Radiographic and ultrasound criteria for dysplasia and dislocation based upon age. o Historical and clinical risk factors to be assessed for all children that are related to DDH. o What constitutes \"standard\" brace treatment of DDH o What are o utcomes criteria that define successful or failed treatment for DDH Establish universally accepted and reproducible ranges of normal values across ages for sonographic and/or radiographic hip measures or any future surrogates for normal hip development. Establish clear relationships between these surrogates for hip development and demonstrate long -term functional limitations that are correlated to surrogate values that fall outside of the normal ranges. Define the benefits and harms of late diagnosis of DDH Define the harms of early diagnosis and treatment of DDH 105 Standardize follow -up times after bracing to improve objective testing of outcomes Provide research design that is applicable to routine practice situations and allows for comparison of alternat ive methods of diagnosis and treatment. 106 VI.

They vary according to the rigor of a study's research des ign. Different questions are asked depending on if a study us es a controlled design with a no -treatment comparison group, is a crossover or historically controlled study, or case series. A total of 20 questions are asked for each type of research design and are des cribed below: Quality Questions and Domains for Fou r Designs of Studies of Interventions Domain Question: Parallel, Contemporary Controls Crossover Trials Historical Controls Case Series Group Assignment Stochastic Yes Yes No No Group Assignment Quasi -random Assignment No No No *NA Group Assignment Matched Groups No No Yes No Group Assignment Consecutive Enrollment NA NA NA Yes Prospective Prospective Yes Yes Yes Yes Blinding Blinded Patients Yes Yes No No Blinding Blinded Assessors Yes Yes No No Blinding Blinding Verified Yes Yes No No Group Comparability Allocation Concealment Yes Yes No No Group Comparability >80% Follow -up Yes Yes No Yes Group Comparability <20% Completion Difference Yes Yes No No Group Comparability Similar Baseline Outcome Values Yes NA Yes No Group Comparability Comparable Pt.

We characterize this domain as free from flaws if any one of the following is true: The results of a statistical test on the outcome of interest are statistically significant (statistical significance is indicative of adequate statistical power). The results of a statistical test of th e outcome of interest are not statistically significant (or it is unclear whether the results are statistically significant), and the study is either an uncontrolled study in which data from 34 or more patients are included in the statistical analysis of t he outcome of interest OR a controlled study in which data from 128 or more patients are included in the analysis of the outcome of interest. The study's results for the outcome of interest are used in a meta -analysis. We make this assumption because one reason for performing a meta -analysis is to compensate for the low statistical power of individual studies. Implicit in this assumption is a second assumption; that the power of the meta -analysis will be sufficient to detect an effect as statistically sign ificant. We term the power domain as flawed if all of the following are true: The results of a statistical test on the outcome of interest are either not statistically significant or it is unclear whether the results of statistical test on the outcome of interest are statistically significant. The study is an uncontrolled study in which data from fewer than 15 patients are included in the analysis of the outcome of interest OR the study is a controlled study in which data from fewer than 52 patients were included in the analysis of the outcome of interest. The results on the outcome of interest will not be used in a meta -analysis. The numbers used to determine whether a study is of sufficient power are based on Cohen's134 definitions of small, medium, and large effects. To compute the number of patients needed for an uncontrolled study using a pretest/posttest design, we consider a two-tailed paired samples t -test. We then determine whether or not sample size is sufficient to detect a large effect (defined as a standardized mean difference of 0.8) with alpha = 0.05 significance level and power = 80%. If a study does not have the ability to detect even a large effect as statistically significant, we characterize it as underpowered and the domain flawed. To compute the number of patients needed for a controlled study, we consider a two - tailed independent samples t -test with equal size groups, and then determine if sample size is adequate for detecting a large effect, again with alpha = 0.05 and power = 80%. Similar to the above, we term a study as underpowered and the domain flawed if it does not enroll enough patients to detect a large effect size. It is viewed as adequately powered if it enrolls enough patients to detect a small effect. 119 Quality Domains for Incidence and Prevalence studies # Domain Relationship between Quality and Domain Scores for Incident and Prevalence studies 1 Outcome: Whether the study is measuring the incidence/prevalence of a clinically meaningful event. 0 Flawed Domains = High Quality Study 1 Flawed Domain = Moderate Quality Study 2 Flawed Domains = Low Quality Study 3 Flawed Domains = Very Low Quality Study 2 Measurement: Whether the study measured the disease/disorder/condition in a way that would lead to accurate estimates of incidence or prevalence. 3 Participant: Whether those who were studied were representative of the population of interest. 4 Investigator Bias: Whether author biases could have prejudiced the results.

The domains that each question applies to are shown in the table below.

The EBQV expanded the above criteria based on the G.R.A.D.E. methodolog y, so that it now includes the following: The study has a large (>2) or very large (>5) magnitude of treatment effect: used for non -retrospective observational studies; All plausible confounding factors would reduce a demonstrated effect or suggest a spuri ous effect when results show no effect; Consideration of the dose -response effect. Reference: GRADE handbook for grading quality of evidence and strength of recommendation. The GRADE Working Group; 2009. 124 APPENDIX VI OPINION BASED RECOMMENDATIONS A guideline can contain recommendations for which there is no evidence. Work groups might make the decision to issue opinion -based recommendations. Although expert opinion is a form of evidence, it is also important to avoid liberal use in a guideline since research shows that expert opinion can be incorrect. Opinion -based recommendations are developed only in instances where not establishing a recommendation would lead to catastrophic consequences for a patient (e.g . loss of life or limb) . To ensure that an opinion -based recommendation is absolutely necessary, the AAOS has adopted rules to guide the content of the rationales that are based on those outlined by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF). (Petitti et al. 199 -205) Specificall y, rationales based on expert opinion must: o Not contain references to or citations from articles not included in the systematic review. o Not contain the AAOS guideline language \" the practitioner should/should not \", \"the practitioner could/could not \" or \"The practitioner might /might not .\" o Contain an explanation of the potential preventable burden of disease. This involves considering both the incidence and/or prevalence of the disease, disorder, or condition and the associated burden of suffering. To paraphr ase the USPSTF, when evidence is insufficient, provision of a treatment (or diagnostic) for a serious condition might be viewed more favorably than provision of a treatment (or diagnostic) for a condition that does not cause as much suffering. The AAOS und erstands that evaluating the \"burden of suffering\" is subjective and involves judgment. This evaluation should be informed by patient values and concerns. It is not appropriate for a guideline to recommend widespread use of a technology backed by little da ta and for which there is limited experience. Such technologies are addressed in the AAOS' Technology Overviews. o Address potential harms. o Address apparent discrepancies in the logic of different recommendations. If there are no relevant data for several r ecommendations and the work group chooses to issue an opinion -based recommendation in some cases but not in other cases, the rationales must explain why. o Consider current practice. The USPSTF specifically states that clinicians justifiably fear not provid ing a service that is practiced on a widespread basis will lead to litigation. (Petitti et al. 199 -205) Not providing a service that is not widely available or commonly used has less serious consequences than not providing a treatment accepted by the medical pr ofession that patients expect. The patient's \"expectation of treatment\" must be tempered by the treating physician's guidance about the reasonable outcomes that the patient can expect. 125 o Justify when applicable why a more costly device, drug, or procedure i s being recommended. Work group members write the rationales for opinion based recommendations on the first day of the final work group meeting. When the work group reconvenes on the second day, members approve the rationales. If the work group cannot adop t a rationale after three votes, the rationale and the opinion -based recommendation will be withdrawn . Sometimes work group members change their views. At any time during the discussion of the rationales, any member of the work group can make a motion to w ithdraw a recommendation 126 APPENDIX VII STRUCTURED PEER REVI EW FORM Peer reviewers are asked to read and review the draft of the clinical practice guideline with a particular focus on their area of expertise.
