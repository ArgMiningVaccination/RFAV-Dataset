He will marshal the combined forces of 71 institutions across the globe in establishing the world's largest cohort of subjects facing the earliest stages of a rare, inherited neurodegenerative disorder, spinocerebellar ataxia. Spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) is characterized by degeneration of the brain and spinal cord with progressive clumsiness and difficulty balancing, typically leading to total disability and death. It causes loss of neurons in the cerebellum, which controls coordination, and leads to progressive uncontrollable irregularity of hand, speech and eye movement. The degeneration process mimics that of Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).FROM THE PRESIDENT Cover Houston Methodist Readies 71 Sites for Neuroregenerative Clinical Trials .................................... 1 Research Highlights History-Making Gift Transforms the Future of Innovation ............................ 4 New Blood Pressure Guidelines ....... 6 Tiny, Time-release Beads Fight Infection After Joint Replacement ....8 Bioengineered \"Asteroids\" ............ 10 Type 2 Diabetes Shows Potential to Propagate Similar to Prions ......12 Immunology Team Takes Aim at T-Cells ......................................... 14 Cultivating the Healing Power of Nature ......................................... 16 Comparison of Surgeons Favors Females Over Males-Slightly ........ 18 Awards & Accolades ............................ 19 Education News LCME Approves EnMed to Recruit Inaugural Class ..................................... 20 China's Top Science Advisory Think Tank ....................................... 21 Expanding the Reach of Research-Based Education ............ 22 Of Interest A Birds-Eye View: Collaboration within the Texas Medical Center ...24 New Faculty Recruits ........................... 26 Upcoming Events ................................. 28ContentsFocused on translation and collaborative by design\u2014this is the driving spirit of the Houston Methodist Research Institute. Our cover story demonstrates how this approach can change the world. Dr. Tetsuo Ashizawa is coordinating an international Spinocerebellar Ataxia clinical trial readiness consortium of over 71 sites in the U.S. and Europe \u2014and is expected to continue to expand. These connections create a network with local, national and international institutions dedicated to advancing treatments for SCA. We also believe that having physicians and scientists working in the same physical space fosters a culture of translational collaboration. In this issue, you will read about the historic philanthropic gift from Paula and Joseph C. \"Rusty\" Walter that cultivates this approach. The visionary gift supports two funds that help physicians bring their new ideas to life in collaboration with scientists. Read on and you will learn about more collaborations like a study rated as one of the Journal of Experimental Medicine 's ten most exciting discoveries of 2017 . Drs. A. Osama Gaber and Omaima Sabek worked with others in the Texas Medical Center to find unexpected parallels between the genesis of type 2 diabetes and prion diseases. In another neuroscience study, colleagues at the University of California, San Francisco and the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke worked with Dr. Robert Krencik to create miniature 3-D mini brain models that closely mimic brain microenvironments. I hope you enjoy reading about these collaborations that are advancing research and helping patients live healthier lives. Together we are changing the future of medicine.

FROM PAGE ONE Over the next five years, Ashizawa and colleagues will establish the world's largest list of study participants at the earliest disease stages, when they are most likely to benefit from treatment. The study will incorporate MRI biomarkers to detect disease onset and early progression\u2014even in pre-symptomatic individuals. By consolidating the findings of over 70 institutions, researchers will collect enough clinical, imaging and biochemical data about this rare disease to allow them to design clinical trials that generate the most conclusive results on effective treatment. The multi-site project will include well-established ataxia physicians and scientists in approximately 20 U.S. locations and two European ataxia consortia comprised of 58 investigators from 23 institutions across Europe. Ashizawa, a neurologist in the Houston Methodist Neurological Institute, led the previous NIH-funded study of spinocerebellar ataxias from 2009-2013, and still serves on the Medical Research Advisory Committee of the National Ataxia Foundation. His goal is to bring these investigational therapies to patients within the next several years.- Tetsuo Ashizawa, MD Harriet and Joe B. Foster Distinguished Chair in Neurosciences, Stanley H.

The first recruit for the neurorestoration program has already joined the Houston Methodist neurosurgery department. Dimitry Sayenko, PhD, a scientist from the University of California, Los Angeles, studies mechanisms to restore neurological control of movement and balance. The gift's largest component establishes two seed funds, one dedicated to collaborative innovation and the second to expand the Translational Research Initiative. Together they create an entrepreneurial platform for physicians with new ideas they are developing for clinical use, while promoting collaboration between scientists and physicians to design new solutions for clinical challenges that require knowledge from multiple disciplines. Future of Innovation History-Making Gift Transforms the Houston Methodist has received a rare gift from Paula and Rusty Walter and the Walter Oil & Gas Corporation. The $101 million philanthropic gift\u2014the largest in the institution's nearly 100-year history\u2014will expand translational research and establish a neurorestoration research program. Through a matching fund that will increase the number of endowed chairs to 100 in recognition of Houston Methodist's 100-year anniversary in 2019, the total impact of the gift will reach $167 million. Paula Walter and Rusty WalterRusty Walter has unique insight into the value of this research. After suffering a stroke in 2013, he enrolled in two clinical trials at Houston Methodist during his recovery. The experience showed him first-hand how close the field of neurology is to making significant breakthroughs with the right kind of support. \"As I continue to recover from my stroke, Paula and I thought we could help make a difference by supporting research through the Walter Neurological Restoration Initiative. \" Rusty has served on the Houston Methodist Board of Directors since 2006. His father, Joseph C. Walter Jr., was a devoted hospital board member for more than 30 years and underwent a lifesaving heart transplant at Houston Methodist. In mid-2018, The Paula and Joseph C. \"Rusty\" Walter III Tower opens in the Texas Medical Center to provide 366 patient beds and high-tech operating room suites for neurosurgery and cardiovascular surgery, two intensive care floors, six acute care floors and a helipad. This 954,705-square-foot tower will serve Houston Methodist's growing patient population. 5The Walters are treasured members of our Houston Methodist family. This gift will fund some of the world's best physicians and scientists, bringing important cures and treatments to our patients.\"\" - Marc Boom, MD President and CEO Houston Methodist- Rusty Walter Paula and Joseph C. \"Rusty\" Walter III Tower6RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS Among the nation's leading cardiologists, Robert A. Phillips, MD, PhD, collaborated with numerous colleagues to investigate the impact of new guidelines that redefine high blood pressure. Issued in November 2017 by the American Heart Association, American College of Cardiology and nine other professional health organizations, the guidelines classify hypertension as a reading of 130/80 mm Hg, compared to the standard since 1993: 140/90 mm Hg. Under the new tightened rules, 46 percent of U.S. adults are considered hypertensive, up from 32 percent. The new guidelines also recommend treating all hypertensive patients with a risk greater than 10 percent, based on a standardized formula, but without considering a patient's individual health issues. The change has increased the number of Americans with high blood pressure from 72 million to 103 million, or from 32 percent of adults to 46 percent. The number of Americans under 45 with the condition has doubled. Phillips, an expert in hypertension and cardiovascular disease, is concerned that while patients at higher risk for cardiovascular disease benefit from the stricter guidelines, those with lower risk may face more harm than benefit from the intensive treatment recommendations\u2014 potentially causing kidney damage, dizziness, falls and other adverse reactions. He recommends a more patient-centered approach. The new rules were written by a panel of 21 scientists and health experts who reviewed more than 900 published studies. Their call for more aggressive treatment was based largely on data from the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial, or SPRINT, a large-scale study of more than 9,000 people, sponsored by the National Institutes of Health's National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute. Robert A. Phillips, MD, PhD, FACC New Blood Pressure Guidelines: What's Good for Some May Not Be Best for All by Lisa Merkl Houston Methodist's Chief Medical Officer is challenging the new guidelines for hypertension\u2014with the goal of sparing 10 million people from unnecessarily aggressive blood pressure treatments.Based on the same data, Phillips and his colleagues performed a secondary analysis and suggest a different strategy that places on medication only a subset of patients with blood pressure between 130/80 and 140/90\u2014those who have at least an 18.2 percent risk of a cardiovascular event in the coming 10 years, according to information doctors plug into a commonly used formula. That formula recommends forestalling medication and instead relying on healthier lifestyles, including diet and exercise, to reduce their numbers.\"Classifying patients by degree of future risk might be the best way to identify who could benefit most from intensive treatment,\" Phillips said. \"We developed a model using the 10-year cardiovascular disease risk and found that aggressive treatment of patients with a risk greater than or equal to 18.2 percent would result in more benefit than harm, while those with a risk of less than that would fare better under a standard blood pressure management approach.\" Phillips shared his findings in The Journal of the American College of Cardiology. His co-authors include Jiaqiong Xu, PhD, Leif E. Peterson, PhD, MPH, and Ryan M. Arnold, MPH, from Houston Methodist; Joseph A. Diamond, MD, from the Department of Cardiology of Hofstra Northwell School of Medicine in Hempstead, New York; and Adam E. Schussheim, MD, with Cardiac Specialists of Northeast Medical Group at Bridgeport Hospital with Yale New Haven Health in New Haven, Connecticut.

Philips, MD, PhD, FACC Chief Medical Officer and Chief Quality Officer Professor of Cardiology, Institute for Academic Medicine Center for Outcomes Research Houston MethodistWhile it's estimated that 107,500 deaths could be averted annually in the United States by implementing more aggressive treatments, that may be accompanied by other serious, adverse events. This presents clinicians and patients with a dilemma, potentially trading one clinically significant condition for another.\"\"8 Tiny, Time-Release Beads Fight Infection After Joint Replacement RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS While the risk of infection is present with any surgery, infections after a joint replacement are harder to treat: The metal implants are not connected to the body's bloodstream, so the white blood cells sent to fight the infection cannot reach the implant and kill the bacteria. To reduce this infection risk, a Houston Methodist orthopedic surgeon created small antibiotic beads that are implanted with the new joint to slowly release medicine for several weeks following surgery. Terry Clyburn, MD, developed the antibiotic microspheres that are as small as grains of salt and designed to release enough antibiotics to kill infections for three to six weeks\u2014the timeframe when an infection is most likely to develop. Currently, most joint replacement patients are given intravenous antibiotics before and after surgery to help stave off an infection. By coating the implant in the antibiotic microspheres before placing More than 1 million people undergo total joint replacements each year, and nearly 10,000 will develop infections. Terry Clybum, MD, holds a hip replacement implant that has been coated with the antibiotic microspheres that will resist infection over several crucial weeks while the body adjusts to the new joint. by Hannah Pietsch- Jenny Chang, M.D. Emily Herrmann Chair in Cancer Research & Director, Houston Methodist Cancer CenterThese microspheres have several layers of antibiotics that slowly dissolve as they release the medication on the implant and surrounding tissues, leaving nothing behind in the joint that could lead to future problems for the patient. \"\" Dave B, Gonzalez DD, Liu ZB, Li X, Wong H, Granados S, et. al.

In studies to determine the efficacy of the microspheres, Clyburn and his colleagues contaminated two metal implants with staphylococcus aureus bacteria and coated one in the microspheres before inserting them in animal models. Zero infections developed in the model that received the microspheres. Clyburn, who has been working for 15 years to develop these microspheres, is currently seeking FDA approval and hopes to see them used widely in three to five years.RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS 10A team of researchers led by Houston Methodist neuroscientist Robert Krencik, PhD, is the first to specifically engineer this type of 3-D mini brain. Their success is partly due to the groups of specialized neurons they study: star-shaped cells known as \"astrocytes\"\u2014coined \"asteroids\" by Krencik. Involved in most neural diseases and responsible for maintaining a healthy nervous system, astrocytes are key because they boost the neurons' ability to communicate by increasing the number and strength of neuronal connections in the brain and spinal cord. \"Our system can generate mature astrocytes that interact intimately with neurons to a greater extent than has been done before,\" Krencik said. \"Unlike other cells in the brain and in the rest of the body, astrocytes have unique properties in humans. They may be partly responsible for the unique cognitive functions of humans and also may underlie aspects of human diseases, such as Alzheimer's and autism spectrum disorders.\" The team's systematic process for putting together the cells creates a model that more closely resembles the complex interactions within the brain, in contrast with the way cells are broken apart in traditional lab practices. The result is accelerated maturation for both the astrocytes and their surrounding neurons. Krencik foresees using induced pluripotent stem cells, or iPS cells, from any disease or patient to form these mini brains to study the disease process, or to screen therapeutic compounds to aid in the development of drugs. Ultimately, the asteroids may be used to form functional neural circuits that researchers can experimentally manipulate for developing treatments and deciphering what makes diseases tick.The next generation of brain research is underway, with a new model that quickly grows 3-D mini brains from stem cells. The model puts researchers on a fast track to exploring what's behind disease- causing mutations and repairing the nervous system after injury or disease of the brain and spinal cord.

Since this revelation in 1982, the unusual ability of prions (short for \"proteinaceous infectious particle\") to unfold and effectively damage normal proteins in the brain has been much studied.Propagate Similar to PrionsType 2 Diabetes Shows Potential to by Laura NilesRESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS 12Now researchers have discovered another type of protein that behaves similar to prions\u2014and appears to be linked to the infectious spread of type 2 diabetes. Osama Gaber, MD, J.C. Walter Jr. Presidential Distinguished Chair and director of the Houston Methodist J.C. Walter Jr. Transplant Center, and Omaima Sabek, PhD, are part of the team that investigated this protein, called \"islet amyloid polypeptide\" (IAPP). Like prions, the IAPP protein can prompt abnormal folding of normal cellular proteins. When they misfold in certain ways, they accumulate, or \"aggregate,\" in deposits. In turn, this clustering prompts even more misfolding. In this way, the misfolded IAPP can self-propagate similarly to infectious prions. To gain a better understanding of the role IAPP protein plays in type 2 diabetes, the researchers seeded pre-formed IAPP aggregates through a prion-like mechanism in isolated islet cultures and also in a transgenic mouse model. They found that when misfolded IAPP was injected into mice expressing human IAPP, the mice began to express type 2 diabetes-like symptoms, such as hyperglycemia and impaired glucose tolerance. A similar outcome occurred in seeded pancreatic tissue. Both outcomes suggested that transmission of type 2 diabetes could follow a process of infectious transmission similar to that of prion diseases. Importantly, this study showed that IAPP misfolding\u2014on its own\u2014can produce symptoms of type 2 diabetes without being affected by other known processes of the disease, such as a high-fat diet. This suggests that the prion-like mechanism plays a key role in spreading the disease from cell to cell or islet to islet. Further studies are needed to understand the extent to which IAPP aggregation may contribute to the spread of diabetes, and its full impact on public health. 13These findings were published in a paper that was included in Journal of Experimental Medicine's 10 most exciting discoveries in 2017.

Inactive of Misfolded ProteinsMisfolded Protein Proteinby Lisa MerklRESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS 14Now the team is aiming to inhibit only T-cells that have already been exposed to antigens, without activating the so-called \"na\u00efve T-cells\"\u2014those that have never seen antigens and therefore produce no or little IRF4. The team's initial studies are promising. By inhibiting IRF4 expression for 30 days, the typical time required for transplant patients to remain infection free, they see hope for prolonging patients' tolerance of transplanted organs. Immunology Team T-Cells Takes Aim at Over-protective T-cells are the culprits when it comes to autoimmune diseases and transplant rejection. To understand the mechanisms involved, a team led by Wenhao Chen, PhD, in the Immunobiology & Transplant Science Center, identified a critical switch that controls T-cell function\u2014and dysfunction. And they have discovered a pathway to target it. The team began systematically deleting different molecules in T-cells, which led to identifying a crucial molecule for controlling gene expression: the transcription factor IRF4. \"When we delete IRF4 in T-cells they become dysfunctional,\" Chen said. \"However, you need them to remain functional to control infection. If we can find an IRF4 inhibitor, then those issues would be solved\u2014that's big.\" Understanding Autoimmunity May Transform Transplants Wenhao Chen, PhD - Wenhao Chen, PhD Assistant Professor, Transplant Immunology in Surgery Houston Methodist\" How to therapeutically inhibit IRF4 is the Nobel-prize winning question. If we can find a way to inhibit IRF4 as desired in activated T-cells, then I think most autoimmune diseases and transplant rejection will be solved. \"T-cells, a type of white blood cell that plays a central role in helping the body fight infection, can be a threat when they \"over-protect\" the body. For instance, autoimmune diseases occur when T-cells cause the immune system to attack itself. But new discoveries by faculty in the Immunobiology & Transplant Science Center have cracked codes that could make T-cells' unwanted attacks a thing of the pas t.15The Journal of Experimental Medicine , one of medicine's oldest journals, recently published a study that explains what causes the lungs' airways to close during asthma attacks. Written by Xian C. Li, MD, PhD, and his team at Houston Methodist's Immunobiology & Transplant Science Center, the breakthrough study is leading them to develop a class of drugs that offers hope for treatment that is radically different from the steroids currently used and could change the lives of 300 million asthma sufferers worldwide. Asthma's small airways and blocked airflow are caused by overproduction of mucin, a sticky protein secreted by the mucous membranes in the lungs. When healthy, the lungs' inner lining, made of epithelial cells that keep their surface moist, secretes mucin to protect the airways. But mucin causes damage when it's over-produced. Li and his team discovered that T-cells, which aim to fight foreign toxins, communicate with mucin- producing cells in the lungs by secreting a small protein called interleukin 9 (IL-9). The hyperactive T-cells also express a molecule called OX40, which organizes super-enhancers\u2014regions of DNA that control which genes become active\u2014and cause T-cells to over-produce IL-9. Li's team is using chemical inhibitors to find a new way to stop this assembly of IL-9 gene super- enhancers to prevent the production of IL-9. With new possibilities for treatment, asthmatic patients can start breathing a little easier.Insight into Super-Enhancers Brings a Breath of Fresh Air Xian C. Li, MD, PhD - Xian C.

While serving as First Lady, she championed preservation of natural spaces and heritage by serving as Honorary Chair of the National Park Foundation and helping to found Preserve America. When she left the White House, she was determined to continue advancing conservation and connecting people to the great outdoors. In 2011, she founded Texan by Nature to spur conservation in her home state with public and private partnerships. Four years later, she saw an opportunity to tap another great Texas resource, the Texas Medical Center, to explore how nature positively impacts health. On September 12, 2016, Texan by Nature and Houston Methodist convened a diverse audience for a one-day symposium on a shared interest: the influence of nature on health. The state of the field was reviewed by keynote speaker Howard Frumkin, DRPH, MPH, MD, former dean and professor of environmental and occupational health sciences at the University of Washington School of Public Health. He presented the current evidence linking exposure to nature to lower blood pressure, improved recovery from surgery, better birth outcomes, lowered need for pain management, and lower rates of specific conditions related to diabetes, weight, eyesight, allergies, cancer and autoimmune disorders. The symposium also clarified the gaps in our understanding of the underlying biological mechanisms, exposure science and implementation science\u2014all requiring rigorous, randomized, controlled studies of what interventions work. Seeing the need for more research, Texan by Nature board member and nature enthusiast Cynthia Pickett-Stevenson convened leaders from Houston Methodist, Texas A&M University and Texan by Nature to develop evidence- based and actionable recommendations for incorporating nature into public policy, clinical care and wellness plans. They had a plan in place by fall 2017 to establish the tripartite Center for Health & Nature.Everyone agrees that nature has the power to heal. But ask how it heals\u2014and answers are in short supply. Leaders of the three founding organizations announced the Center for Health & Nature on May 2: President & CEO Marc Boom, MD, of Houston Methodist, Founder Laura Bush of Texan by Nature, and Chancellor John Sharp of Texas A&M University System.Healing Power of NatureCultivating the The Center was announced on May 2, 2018, by Laura Bush, Houston Methodist President & CEO Marc Boom, MD, and Texas A&M Chancellor John Sharp. The Center will conduct science and provide guidelines for using nature-based interventions, initially under the guidance of interim director, Bita Kash, PhD. Kash is the director of the joint Center for Outcomes Research for Houston Methodist and Texas A&M. As part of the announcement, Texas A&M landscape architecture students presented designs for healing gardens at Houston Methodist Hospital. The new center is currently creating a $2.5 million Health & Nature Innovation Fund to support projects that develop evidence-based applications of nature to health and wellness. Current randomized and controlled pilot projects focus on stress, clinician burnout and heart health. One project will identify protocols for reducing physician and nurse burnout with greenspace exposure in the workplace. Another will measure the ability of natural environments to lower blood pressure and reduce stress levels in cardiology patient waiting rooms. The results of pilot projects and new research ideas in related fields will be presented at the second annual Health & Nature Research Symposium in 2019. 17We've only just begun to understand the depth of the connection between health and nature through scientific research....The question is not if nature provides those health benefits but how it delivers those benefits. - Laura Bush Founder, Texan by Nature\"\" To support the center's plans to promote healthy green space, Texas A&M University's Landscape Architecture Department held a competition to select an evidence-based design of healing gardens in urban settings.

A timely study published in late 2017 by Raj Satkunasivam, MD, assistant professor in the Department of Urology, compared surgical outcomes between males and females and found a small but statistically significant edge in favor of female surgeons. After controlling for age and experience, Satkunasivam and colleagues found that patients of female surgeons had lower rates of 30-day mortality.Although patients of female surgeons were only four percent less likely to die, the study garnered a good deal of attention. It was picked up by Time magazine, and The New Yorker 's Health, Medicine & the Body Issue featured an animated cover of four female surgeons, which served as the impetus for the #ILookLikeASurgeon social media campaign. by Laura Niles Wallis, CJ, Ravi, B, Coburn, N, Nam, RK, Detsky, AS, Satkunasivam, R.
