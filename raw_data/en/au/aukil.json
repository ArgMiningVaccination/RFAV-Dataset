Couple this with the regular winter flu viruses and other sicknesses out there, and it may seem like a mission impossible to get through this winter well. Although the best way to prevent falling ill with COVID-19 is by vaccination, you may be wondering if there's anything else you can do to boost your immune system naturally. Can you boost your immune system naturally? This is a tricky question to answer. Technically no, you actually can't boost your immune system. Your innate immune system is what you are born with. It includes your skin, saliva, and non-specific cellular defenses. Your adaptive immune response-the specific response of immune cells-can be \"strengthened,\" but only after exposure to new pathogens. So, in all technical sense, the only way to \"boost\" your immunity is either by vaccination or by exposure to new viruses. Yet, we're all concerned about having a strong immune system so that we don't fall sick in the first place. A strong immune system relies on a generally healthy body. And vice versa. Health looks different from person to person, but you can bet keeping stress as low as possible, getting consistent sleep, eating well, and exercising are all vital pieces. Without all of these elements together, your immune system will be taxed trying to defend you from even the most harmless pathogens. So, in the case of exposure to the seasonal flu, or a more novel virus, your defenses won't be at their full strength, and you will fall ill more easily. With this important point out of the way, we can talk about some of the natural ways to support your immune system, with a focus on food. Key Nutrients to Support Immunity You've likely heard of products like Emergen-C, and the like, that are marketed to give consumers a megadose of Vitamin C to boost your immune system when you feel a cold coming on. Well, I have to burst their bubble. This won't actually \"boost\" your immune system. In fact, there is [no evidence](https://www.health.com/condition/cold/does-emergenc-work) that megadosing on any nutrient (or just consuming a lot of orange juice) will boost your immunity and prevent you from getting sick, especially if you've already been exposed to a virus. But don't get it wrong, there are a few nutrients that play direct roles in supporting your immune system. Vitamin C Vitamin C is an antioxidant that helps scavenge and eliminate potentially harmful compounds, thereby reducing work for your immune system. It is also directly related to the immune response by facilitating the production of antibodies, as well as the activity of adaptive immune cells. So, what this means is you need to consume adequate amounts of Vitamin C daily to keep your immune system in optimal condition. It's recommended to consume at least 90 mg of Vitamin C per day for adults and 45 mg for children. This isn't very hard to reach, considering a standard orange contains roughly 50 mg of Vitamin C. Keep in mind, though, many other foods have much more Vitamin C than oranges. For example, yellow bell pepper has 137 mg, kiwi has 71 mg, strawberry has 89 mg, and cooked kale can have as high as 80 mg. Vitamin D Vitamin D is an important nutrient for many bodily functions, particularly bone mineral density, but has received a lot of attention in relation to the COVID pandemic. Vitamin D is an immune-supporting nutrient, involved with regulating the production of adaptive immune cells and their activity. Scientists don't yet fully understand Vitamin D's role in immunity when it comes to all viral diseases. Still, more and more evidence of deficiency correlating to acute respiratory illness is becoming prevalent. There is also [some evidence](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/vitamin-d/) that poor Vitamin D status could increase the risk of contracting COVID-19. The most active form of Vitamin D is found in the skin of fatty fish, egg yolk, cheese, beef liver, and fortified in dairy products. The less active form can be found in mushrooms. However, the best way to obtain adequate Vitamin D is with direct sun exposure. Humans can synthesize greater than 90% of active Vitamin D just from approximately thirty minutes of direct sun exposure to the arms and legs. Those most at risk for Vitamin D inadequacy live in generally cloudy regions, those who don't spend enough time outside in the sun, or vegetarians and vegans. Those most at risk for Vitamin D deficiency include those with inflammatory bowel disease, those who have undergone gastric bypass surgery, and those who are significantly overweight/obese (due to the adipose tissue sequestering the nutrient.) Zinc Zinc is a trace mineral important for the production of most cell types, but particularly for skin cells and the cells lining our organs. This makes it an important nutrient to prevent pathogens from entering our bloodstream in the first place. But zinc is also directly required for immune cell function as well. Zinc is found in many foods, but most prevalently in oysters and shellfish, red meat, chicken, legumes, dark leafy greens, and dairy. Those most at risk for lacking adequate zinc are infants, pregnant and lactating mothers, and vegetarians/vegans. The most important takeaway here is that megadosing on any of these nutrients has no immediate \"boosting\" effect on your immune system. Consuming adequate amounts of these nutrients (as well as all vitamins and minerals) every day will ensure that your body has the nutrients it needs to keep your immunity in optimal condition. Consuming a large quantity of fruits and vegetables daily is the simplest way to do this. However, if your diet prevents you from doing this easily, or you have a hard time-consuming fruits and vegetables for other reasons, consulting your doctor or dietitian for nutrient assessment and supplementation is a good idea. Immune Supporting Foods Although eating a wide variety of fruits and vegetables is key to supporting your immune system, there are a few foods that can be beneficial in upkeeping your immunity. Garlic Garlic has been used as a natural immune support for centuries, and there may be merit to it. Compounds in garlic have demonstrated some antimicrobial properties, primarily in the way of inhibiting the replication of pathogens in the body. There is [some evidence](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/garlic-fights-colds-and-flu) that consuming garlic can help prevent the onset of sickness, like the common cold, as well as to shorten its duration. However, the microbial compounds in garlic are mostly active in raw garlic, which is often not as palatable. Supplements of raw garlic extract can be consumed for immune support instead. Medicinal Mushrooms The world of mushrooms and fungi is diverse and mysterious, but one of the most mysterious things about them is how beneficial many types of mushrooms are to our health. Particularly, maitake, shiitake, reishi, and turkey tail, are four types that contain specific compounds that have demonstrated [effects](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1160565/) in preventing viral replication, as well as immune cell activation. However, the exact mechanisms behind the effect of these mushrooms are not yet entirely known. These mushrooms can be eaten in their whole form, but due to their difficulty in sourcing, they can be difficult to find. Not to mention, for therapeutic dosing of the active compounds, it may be more beneficial to consume larger quantities by way of concentrated supplements or tea. Probiotics Probiotics have been a hot topic for the past decade and change. Generally, when we talk about probiotics, we think about gut health and digestion. These are very important functions of the gastrointestinal tract that can pay dividends to your general health. But did you know upping your probiotic intake can help your immunity too? The classification of \"probiotics\" refers to the beneficial bacteria that can inhabit the human digestive tract and aid in the digestion of food. But these microorganisms can also help fight off foreign bacteria that make their way into the G.I. tract not only from food but what gets trapped in your mucus. This means a lot less potential work that your immune system has to handle every day to keep you well! There is also [evidence](https://www.karger.com/Article/FullText/496426) that probiotics can increase antibody production, as well as potentially increase immune cell activity over time. The most effective way to increase the probiotic cultures in your gut is through food sources. In the western diet, yogurt is generally considered the only source of probiotics. But I'm here to tell you there are many more. Buttermilk, soft cheese, sour cream, kefir, unpasteurized milk, miso, tempeh, sauerkraut, kimchi, pickled vegetables, kombucha, and unfiltered vinegar all contain different beneficial probiotic strains and should be consumed with regularity for improved digestion and immune system support. Though it is not possible to \"boost\" one's immunity, as we so often hear with the marketing of wellness supplements, there are still natural ways to support your immunity. As mentioned previously, the best means to ensure your immune system is in its best condition during the flu season or through this pandemic is to stay on top of your stress, sleep, diet, and exercise.
