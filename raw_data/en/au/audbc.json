If it seems to readers that Nickell has expertise in almost everything, they may be right. In this case his PhD in English literature and his experience with claims about literary fraud serve him well. But this is no stuffy academic paper. It's a fresh, readable, and fun look at how anti-Strat- fordian pseudoscholars examine data \"through the looking glass,\" twisting all reason, logic, and evidence to see what they want to see. Sound familiar? The processes have much in common with the other kinds of pseudoknowledge we examine regularly in these pages. Nickell then joins with astronomer and retired military pilot James McGaha to solve\u2014I don't think that is too strong a word\u2014a classic UFO case going back forty-five years, the \"Exeter\" incident in New Hampshire. Michael Mauser gives us an informed and fascinating look at vision phenom- ena\u2014mostly processes right inside our eyes\u2014that people sometimes misinter- pret as paranormal. We also continue three-part series \"Civilizations Lost and Found: Fabri- cating History\" that began in our previous issue. Archaeologists Ken neth L. Feder (a longtime CSI fellow and author of two fine books on archaeological frauds) and Bradley T. Lepper (lead author of this issue's segment, \"False Mes- sages in Stone\"), historian Terry A. Barnhart, and anthropologist Deborah A.Bolnick are providing an extraordinary examination of notorious claims that Egyptians, Hebrews, and Celts, among others, left their mark in pre-Columbian North America. In doing so our authors correct numerous distortions, includingsome outright fraudulent claims, presented in the DVD The Lost Civilizations of North America. And they give us a nicely nuanced look at how real archaeol- ogists evaluate evidence about the real people who populated North Americabefore Columbus. * * * Robert Sheaffer has compiled a book of the firsttwo decades of his \"Psychic Vibrations\" columnsfrom the S KEPTICALINQUIRER .I am pleased to report they are graced by more than a hundred ofthe delightful drawings our longtime illustratorRob Pudim has drawn for SI over the years.

Climatechange, evolution, vaccines, AIDS, the9/11 attacks, the Holo caust\u2014they've all attracted powerful denialist movementsthat, from the viewpoint of most science- oriented people, seem especially resistant to scientific evidence. Why has denialism become such a big obstacle to scientific understanding? What is responsible for its rise and stay-ing power? What, if anything, can be done about it? And what is the role of the science journalist in confronting it? Like skeptics and scientists, science journalists find themselves continually facing denialist arguments from their audiences and the public. The problemsdenialism raises are increasingly trouble- some, and if research cited at a re cent panel discussion on the topic is any guide, the situation may be virtually in- tractable. Nevertheless, some positive suggestions did emerge, among them to tell better stories\u2014compelling true sto-ries dramatizing the scientific facts. These were among the conclusions of a provocative consideration of \"Jour- nalism in the Age of Denial\" at the World Conference of Science Journal- ists in Doha, Qatar, June 27-29, 2011. The panel was organized and moder- ated by Cristine Russell, president of the Council for the Advancement of Science Writing, former Washington Post science reporter, and senior fellow at Harvard's Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs. Like scientists and educators (andskeptics), science journalists operate under the basic assumption that more and better information is always prefer- able. They provide accurate scientific in- formation to the public and hope it will inform scientific understanding about important public issues. With denialism, it doesn't work that way. As I somewhat plaintively titled my editorial in our September/October 2011 issue (written before this conference), \"Who Really Wants Reliable Sci en tific Information?\" \"Telling people with strong partisan beliefs that something is not true rarely convinces them,\" science journalist Shan - kar Vedantam, author of The Hid den Brain, told the audience. \"In fact, refuta- tion causes the belief to go up.\" And there you have it. Providing peo- ple who hold strong beliefs reliable infor- mation that might undermine those be- liefs causes them to cling to those beliefseven more strongly. Vedantam, who recently moved from the Washington Post to National Public Radio (see his SI piece, \"Difficulty in Debunking Myths Rooted in the Way Mind Works,\" January/February 2008), gave an informed tutorial on denialism via Skype from his home in the United States (at 4 AMhis time) when a family illness kept him from traveling to Qatar. He described research showing that rather than being formed by evidence, our beliefs are tied to our loyalties to ideas and causes. Emotional ties predict what one is willing to believe. \"We de- velop friendships and loyalties that shape our beliefs. This process largely happensat an unconscious level. Most of us don't stray far from the beliefs of our friends.\" When facts contradict beliefs, cognitive dissonance then leads us to deny the facts. \"We will selectively filter out the facts that counter our views.\" Debora MacKenzie, a writer in the Brussels office of New Scientist and au- thor of a 2010 cover article \"Living in Denial,\" reinforced that point. \"Mostdenialists simply think the way mostpeople think\u2014in terms of feelings, fa- miliar stories, and their own group identity,\" she emphasized. When they hear a conflicting claim, cognitive dis-sonance takes over. \"It is far easier todeny the science than to accept thatyour whole worldview is wrong.\" Yves Sciama, a freelancer from France, wondered whether the honeymoon be-[ NEWS ANDCOMMENT Providing people who hold strong beliefs reliable information that might undermine those beliefs causes them to cling to those beliefs even more strongly. SI Nov. Dec 11_SI new design masters 9/27/11 12:43 PM Page 56Volume 35 Issue 6 | Skeptical Inquirertween science and society earlier in the twentieth century is now coming to an end. \"Scientist-bashing is becoming morecommon,\" Sciama noted, whereas it wasalmost unheard of decades earlier. The main concern of Philip Hilts, head of the Knight Science JournalismFellowships at MIT, is the \"deliberatemisuse of nonsense.\" He said tactics usedby the tobacco companies from 1953 to1994 to try to counter the evidence thatsmoking causes cancer are now beingused by oil companies to try to counterthe evidence of climate change. The to-bacco companies tried to assert that therewas always doubt. If necessary, theywould \"buy a scientist to say so.\" Now, with climate change, Hilts said, the vested interests are again \"deliberatelymanipulating for gain.\" He said the roleof science journalists is to \"chase down the folks\" who are misusing and misrep- resenting the scientific evidence. Vedantam likewise reserved his harsh- est judgments for those who \"actively and actually disbelieve\" what they know to be true, the tobacco industry again being the leading example. Yet Vedantam noted that denialism is not monolithic. He called for a slightlymore nuanced, \"granular\" analysis. In fact he said using the term denialism can be name-calling. (But what else to call it? I ask.) Denialism comes in different de- grees, and the levels shouldn't always be conflated. Stage one is disbelieving the evidence by trusting only what our sensesreveal to us (his example: the Sun seems to go round Earth; my example: green- house gases being added to the atmos- phere are invisible and so are easily ig-nored). A second stage relates to the complexity of scientific evidence, espe- cially about predicting the future. He sug- gests that much of the doubt about climate change is a different kind of \"skepticism\" (about prediction) thanthat exhibited, for instance, by Holo -caust deniers. (\"Skepticism\" is itself another mis- leading term in this context. Science-oriented, evidence-based skeptics prefer to call those who don't accept good sci- entific evidence doubters or deniers.) He and the others seemed to agree that denialism is worsening. \"It is hard to believe that denialism is not expand- ing,\" Vedantam said. He noted that in regard to global climate change, disbe-lief in the United States is going up. (Will this summer's prolonged record high heat across much of the United States change that perception? Not likely, if Texas Governor Rick Perry'sstrange anti-global warming\u2014and anti- evolution\u2014comments just days after announcing he was a candidate for pres- ident are any guide.) Sciama raised the interesting issue of differing national attitudes toward cli- mate change. Surveys show that in Brazil, 92 percent of the people say global warm-ing is taking place, and only 5 percentthink mankind is not contributing to global warming. \"In the developing countries trust in science is comparable to that in the U.S. in the 1950s,\" Sciamasaid. Still, why denial of global warming dominates \"in Anglo-Saxon countries\u2014 U.S./U.K./Australia\u2014re mains to be ex - plored.\" If reliable scientific facts don't have any positive effect in changing the views of deniers\u2014and in fact cause them to cling to their beliefs even more strongly\u2014 where does that leave us? It's a rather bleak picture. It is discouraging not only for science journalists but also for every- one concerned that we lack well-in-formed citizens in modern de moc racies where scientific and technical questionsaffect virtually every national issue. The panelists did offer a few sugges- tions. Science journalists' job is to com- municate the science effectively, Mac - Kenzie noted. That being the case, and if facts don't sway denialists and others who hold strong views, she suggests we \"speak the language of anecdotes, feel- ings, and group identity.\" She was seri- ous. Stories have a much stronger im- pact on people than facts and evidence,and therefore effective science commu-nication should employ these same tools to get across the science. She called forusing \"familiar narratives\"; for instance, the fact that families have actually lost children to diseases that could have been prevented by vaccinations. That's a nar-rative that is not only powerful but true. Science-oriented, \"just the facts, please\" people may feel that tactic is be- neath them, but MacKenzie said it isnot. \"It may be uncomfortable, but if stories help communicate the science, then do it.\" Still another constructive suggestion came from an audience member and risk-communications expert, David Ro - peik of Harvard. (He spoke at another panel session on risk reporting.) Ropeik, in his comments to the panel and in a brief conversation afterward with the S KEPTICALINQUIRER ,said denialism is a very real thing, but it can and should be quantified, and then managed, like any risk-versus-perception gap. Dealing with it in this straightforward way is an effective and rational approach. He elaborates in his 2010 book How Risky Is It, Really? Why Our Fears Don't Al- ways Match the Facts. Science journalists will no doubt keep writing their good science stories. Per - haps the S KEPTICALINQUIRER's experi- ence in dealing with the paranormal and pseudoscience has something to offer here. We have no illusions that our eval- uations will persuade hardcore paranor-malist believers. But opinion leaders in science, education, and media\u2014and a vast segment of the public who do want good, reliable information\u2014tell us they find them useful. Some even express deep appreciation. Denialism won't dis- appear, but good information still has athirsty audience. Shankar Vedantam, author of The Hid den Brain SI Nov.

This is not altogether surprising, considering that science journalists, asthe intermediaries between scientistsand the public, encounter the samekinds of public misunderstanding andmisperceptions (plus outright distor- tions) about science and the natural world that skeptics combat. More than seven hundred science journalists from ninety countries\u2014halfof them from Africa, Asia, and the Middle East\u2014met in a sprawling new university/academic research complex of the Qatar Foundation on the out-skirts of Doha to consider issues theyencounter in their professional lives. It was the first such conference outside the Western world. I participated in a session on \"Investi - gating Pseudoscience\" with other skeptics and science journalists from Russia, Hungary, and Argentina. Moderator Ta- tiana Puchigina, who works in Moscow for the online news site Science andTechnology in Russia, told an interviewer afterward that she arranged the session after seeing how severe of a problem pseudoscience is in Russia. (Nine years ago SI devoted most of an entire issue to \"Science and Pseudoscience in Rus- sia,\" July/August 2002, and it is clear that the situation hasn't improved much since then.) Alexander Sergeev, science editor of the popular Russian magazine Vokrug Svetaand science observer for Russian Radio Liberty, agreed with her bleak as- sessment. He reported that after three well-known Russian physicists, all mem- bers of the Russian Academy of Sciences and its commission on pseudoscience and science fraud, publicly exposed the activities of a pseudoscientist close to the leaders of Russia, they were hit with a$50 million lawsuit. Among the three is Eduard Krug lyakov, who wrote one ofthose 2002 SI articles. Sergeev emphasized that in Russia much pseudoscience is not just annoy- ing misconceptions and misunderstand-ings but \"also a new kind of criminal ac-tivity dangerous for science and society.\"It is carried out for profit, and it involves corruption of public officials and other criminal acts. It is a highly troublingissue. In Russia, he lamented, \"pseudo-science is developing dynamically, counter-actions against it arenow ineffective.\"Another speaker, Istv\u00e1n V\u00e1g\u00f3, former head of the Hungarian skeptics group and a prominent Hungarian television host, sees some of the same problems in Hungary. After scientific socialism was banned, faith in science declined and the population's new freedoms resulted in a rise of pseudoscience and scandals.

He also la - mented that un healthy people waste somuch money on worthless and bogus pseudo-medical treatments. Alejandro Agostinelli, a freelance sci- ence journalist in Argentina, de scribed his experiences in active skepticism. From 1990 to 1994 he was a member of CAIRP (the Argentinian Center for In-vestigation and Refuta tion of Pseudo- science), the first Latin Amer ican organ-ization with the same goals as theAmerican CSICOP, now our Commit-tee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSI). The group worked closely with the localmedia in examining alternative medicine, folk healing, astrology, mental control,mystic healing powers, and UFOs.

I treated anti-science as a spe- cial case that is especially virulent inpublic policy today, in which propo- nents are actively hostile to scientificideas\u2014or at least to those perceived toyield answers incompatible with their ideology and beliefs. I urged science journalists to consider investigative ar- ticles about pseudoscience as an oppor- tunity not only to expose bogus claims but also to inform people in an enter- taining way about real science and how it differs from pseudoscience. That session was followed by a re lated one with the intriguing title \"WarriorsAgainst Claptrap: Are Myth-Busters theNew Generation of Civic Scientist?\" New myth-busting groups and efforts are spring ing up all over. This panel ad-dressed the impact ofsome widely pub- licized myth-busting campaigns thathave captured the public imagination.The popular U.S. television show Myth-Busterswas just one of the forums de- scribed. Julia Wilson and Leonor Sierra of Sense About Science, a U.K. group that promotes public myth-busting by young people, headed that discussion along with science journalists YlannSchemm of Elsevier in the Nether lands, Alaa Ibrahim of American University in Cairo, and Pallab Ghosh of the BBC in the United Kingdom. Wilson de scribed an effort in which a group of young peo- ple in the United Kingdom decided to challenge companies' claims about \"detoxing.\" They asked what evidence supported the detox claims; when thecompanies admitted they had none, the group publicized that fact (with tran- scripts of the responses) and gained wide attention. Veteran BBC science broadcaster Ghosh concluded with some philosophical wis-dom about the nature of the profession. Science journalists' prime responsibility is to act in the interests of their audience. Sometimes they need to be brave andtake on important stories, and they have a role and responsibility to bust myths. He called it \"kick-ass journalism.\" That session was followed by a ple- nary on \"Evolution and the Evolving World of Science Journalism.\" Scien tific AmericanEditor Mariette DeChristina, past president of the National Associa - tion of Science Writers, moderated a panel whose members came from South Africa, Argentina, and the United States.But the lead talk was by our Committee for Skeptical Inquiry colleague Eugenie C. Scott of the National Center for Sci-ence Education. She noted how the jour- nalistic principle of \"balance\" can be a problem in reporting on evolution. As she says, fairness and balance apply to opinion. \"It is not an opinion that the Earth goesaround the Sun. ... It is not a matter of opinion that living things have ancient ancestors.\" (The \"balance\" problem is well un- derstood by science journalists, but it re-mains a serious issue in general journal- ism, where non-expert reporters frequently feel they must give cre- ationist views equal weight to the long-accepted scientific facts ofevolution.) Scott forthrightly condemned a 2009 incident in which a noted sciencemagazine, the British weekly New Sci- entist, published a cover announcing in large print, \"DARWIN WAS WRONG.\" (The article itself wasabout horizontal gene transfer and, says Scott, wasn't the real problem.) \"The New Scientistcover is simply wrong,\" Scott bluntly told the assem- bled journalists. \"This cover was ex - tremely irresponsible.\" She noted that just two days later opponents of evo- lution on the Texas Board of Educa- tion cited the cover as evidence that evolution is wrong. New ScientistEd- itor Roger Highfield lamely re-sponded at the time cre- ationists would probably \"take it outof context.\" This was hardly any sur-prise to Scott, who wondered why he then did it. \"Cover the science,\" she said, \"but don't make it easy for cre- ationists to take it out of context.\"Committee for Skeptical Inquiry fellow and frequent S KEPTICALINQUIRERcon- tributor David Morrison is the subject of the newsmaker interview article in the August 19 Science\"as the scientific com- munity's unofficial defender of reasonagain the onslaught of ...

Dec 11_SI new design masters 9/27/11 12:43 PM Page 8Skeptical Inquirer | November / December 2011 9[ NEWS ANDCOMMENT The ABC television network aired a one-hour Primetime Nightline special on August 17, \"Beyond Belief,\" inwhich psychics failed test after test. Tothe skeptic, the psychics' demonstra-tions were weak, including the usualcold reading techniques, guessing, div-ination, suggestion, and telling peoplewhat they want to hear. Much of theunsuspecting public, however, might find this deception believable. Of par-ticular acclaim was the superb perform-ance of Banachek\u2014a magician and the administrator of the James Randi Ed-ucational Foundation's Million DollarParanormal Challenge. The network used an unusual three- host format. The host of the first segment was Good Morning America anchor Josh El- liot. He received a reading from \"medi - um\" James Van Praagh. Van Praaghstarted with the usual cold reading tech-niques, such as telling Elliot about hischildhood, \"There's a sense of beingwanted.\" Van Praagh proceeded to sup-ply one accurate insight after another\u2014and far more specifically than when cold reading. But Elliot skeptically reportedthat all information connected to VanPraagh's apparent \"hits\" was available onthe Internet. Chalk this one up to re- search and homework. In the next segment, presented by Juju Chang, several contenders tried tosnare James Randi's million dollarprize, including a medium who failedto divine the only dead person's photo(Elvis) in a series of envelopes, and a tarot card reader who failed to match live subjects with their biographies. Even though the failed mediums agreed to the protocol, ABC disap- pointingly elected to include their com- plaints regarding testing conditions. As usual, Randi did a good job explaining flim-flam with his no-nonsense ap- proach with the media. David Wright hosted the next seg-ment, which began with \"house healers\" in Oakland, California, performing anexorcism of sorts at the request of a realestate agent. The house in question ap- parently wouldn't sell because of \"badenergy\" from the previous owners. Theproperty still did not sell\u2014even after mediums (trained at the Berkeley Psy- chic Institute) \"cleansed\" the house.This segment was basically devoid of askeptical perspective. The next segment was presented again by Juju Chang. Twenty psychic de-tectives had claimed to be able to find a missing child. Sixteen months later, the child was still missing. Credit Chang for asking very skeptical questions to some of the psychics. Banachek returned for this segment and did an excellent job of explaining how psychics waste authori- ties' time and resources with their \"wildgoose chases.\" ABC had a retired FBI agent ex plain that in his thirty-year career he never saw a psychic help find a single missingperson. Then the program described the cruelty of Sylvia Browne's most horrific failed prediction of her career, when shetold the parents of missing child Shawn Hornbeck in 2004 that their son was dead\u2014only to have him found alive andwell in 2007. Banachek called Browne's actions \"horrible\" and \"disgusting.\" In this segment, Banachek did a brilliant job of demonstrating to Chang how to duplicate the effects of alleged psychic ability. Asked about people who claim to communicate with the dead, Ba- nachek replied, \"I think those people are scum. I really, really think they're scum.\" David Wright did the final segment on \"psychic moms\" such as Allison Du - Bois (from The Real Housewives of Bev- erly Hills ), who inspired the television show Medium , and Rebecca Rosen. These mediums emphasize the subject's mother in their readings. This was clearly the program's weakest segment because it made no attempt to provide a skeptical perspective of the medium's reading ofWright. In fact, Wright claimed their readings were accurate and revealed \"de- tails that don't pop up on Google.\" But after the show's conclusion, the pertinentdetails from the reading were discovered in an earlier New York Times wedding an- nouncement, which was posted on Twit- ter by a user. Overall, ABC did a decent job of fair presentation, and there was adequateskeptical representation. Bana chek'smagic, coupled with his critical thinking approach, made for the perfect educa- tional tool. He was brilliant. Removingthe segments by Wright, who was too quick to believe, would have made for an even more skeptical program. The day after the program aired, the James Randi Educational Foundation challenged the show's psychics to be tested for the million dollar prize under randomized, controlled conditions with - out the use of cold reading. Said Chal- lenge director Banachek, \"We're issuing a challenge to these fakers. ...\" We'll all anxiously await their re- sponses, but don't hold your breath.

According to an article intheNew York Times, The New Jersey Supreme Court, ac- knowledging a \"troubling lack of re- liability in eyewitness identifications,\" issued sweeping new rules ... making it easier for defendants to challenge such evidence in criminal cases. The court said that whenever a defendant presents evidence that a witness's identification of a suspect was influ- enced, by the police, for instance, a judge must hold a hearing to consider a broad range of issues. These could include police behavior, but also fac- tors like lighting, the time that had elapsed since the crime or whether the victim felt stress at the time of theidentification.The chief justice, Stuart J. Rabner, wrote in a unanimous decision that the legal system had to catch up with scien- tific evidence in order to ensure justice: Study after study revealed a troubling lack of reliability in eyewitness iden- tifications.... From social science re- search to the review of actual police lineups, from laboratory ex periments to DNA exonerations, the record proves that the possibility of mis- taken identification is real. In deed, it is now widely known that eyewitnessmisidentification is the leading cause of wrongful convictions across the country. The idea that people often incorrectly see, remember, and report what they ex- perience is not merely theory but a proven fact; there are over two thousand published scientific studies demonstrat-ing it. By some estimates, as many as one-third of eyewitness identifications in criminal cases are wrong, and nearly two hundred people who were convicted ofcrimes based on positive eyewitnessidentifications were later exonerated through DNA evidence. The problem of eyewitness unreliabil- ity (and memory unreliability) has been known in academia for years; psycholo-gists such as Elizabeth Loftus have longdocumented how sincere, honest people make important mistakes when report- ing what they have seen. But it's only re- cently that the legal system has recog- nized\u2014and taken steps to mitigate\u2014the problem of eyewitness mis identification. The research also has implications for other types of eyewitness reports. The bulk of evidence for \"unexplained\" re-ports is eyewitness accounts. Many peo- ple who believe in the existence of Big- foot or extraterrestrials, for example, do so based on the disproven premise that sincere, honest eyewitnesses can't be mis- taken.New Jersey Supreme Court Overhauls Eyewitness ID Rules BENJAMIN RADFORD Hilary Evans, a leading British For tean author and researcher of \"marginal hu -man experiences,\" died on July 27, 2011.He was the author of many books, in- cluding Visions, Apparitions, Alien Visitors (1984) and Gods, Spirits, Cosmic Guar - dians(1987) . Evans was a founder of what is called the \"psychosocial hypoth- esis.\" It attributes the perception of anomalous phenomena such as UFOs, apparitions, and so forth to a sort of psychodrama occurring inside the per- cipient's head that is shaped by society's expectations and beliefs. It is very in - fluential today among British Forteans, many of whom are quite skeptical of the literal truth of paranormal claims. Evans and his late wife, Mary, oper- ated the Mary Evans Picture Library inLondon, a major repository of over onemillion images. The Evans' private col- lection of esoteric books and Vic toriana was legendary, and Hilary's knowledgeof \"anomalistic\" subjects was extraordi- nary. He met frequently with colleagues and was responsible for much sharing ofinformation. I met Evans at the Encoun- ters at Indian Head conference in New Hampshire in 2000, which was organ-ized to scrutinize the Betty and BarneyHill UFO abduction story. He compared the Hills' (at the time novel) narrative to earlier accounts of otherworldly beings and religious visions, finding many com- mon themes and formulations in both and suggesting that a \"life crisis\" of the percipient was likely the cause. When- ever the trite phrase \"a gentleman and a scholar\" is used, there can be no better il- lustration of that ideal than Hillary Evans.Fortean Author Hilary Evans (1929-2011) ROBERT SHEAFFER SI Nov.

SensaSlim is advertised as a mirac- ulous weight-reducing oral spray. Its manufacturer claims it is the result of twenty years of research and that its ef- ficacy has been proven in a large-scale clinical trial involving over eleventhousand people from over one hun- dred countries. This trial has not been published in any peer-reviewed med- ical journals, however, and critics who have looked into the matter are unable to locate the Swiss research institutethat supposedly performed the study. They allege that the institute's website, in a page claiming to list its staff, instead features images of doctors grabbed from the website of a lung clinic in the United States. Allegations have come to light from the Australian Competition and Con - sumer Commission (ACCC) of a rela- tionship between SensaSlim and a con- victed felon and con artist named Peter Foster. Foster is known to have perpe-trated illegal schemes in the past, in- cluding the creation of several fraudu- lent slimming products such as the Cho Lo and Bai Lin slimming teas and Trimmit diet pills, among others.

Dec 11_SI new design masters 9/27/11 12:43 PM Page 12Skeptical Inquirer | November / December 2011 13[ NEWS ANDCOMMENT Budd Hopkins (1931-2011): Pioneering UFO Abductionist ROBERT SHEAFFER The famous UFO abductionist Budd Hopkins succumbed to cancer in New York City on August 21 at the age of eighty (www.intrudersfoundation.org/ inside.html). The \"UFO abduction\"scenario changed significantly after the publication of Hopkins's book Missing Time in 1981. Prior to that, UFO ab - ductions were said to occur only when people ventured out to lonely, de serted places late at night and en countered aliens (see, for example, the cases of Betty and Barney Hill and Travis Wal- ton). Hopkins's contribution en tirely severed the connection between UFO sightings and UFO abductions. Hop- kins wrote of a new \"abduction sce- nario that is, if anything, even moredisturbing to contemplate. Many peo- ple have simply been taken from their homes while they were either asleep, orengaged in some quotidian activity, like watching television or reading\" ( Miss- ing Time , p. 79). Often the aliens, and their helpless prey, simply float through closed windows or even walls. In such cases, the law of gravity and all of Newton's Laws of Motion seem to besuspended. To ex plain why nobody ever sees or photographs someone else being abducted, Hopkins suggested that the aliens have the ability to makethemselves and their abductees invisi- ble during this process. Hopkins was a member of the fa- mous troika of UFO abductionists, along with John Mack, MD, and David Jacobs (who is now the sole survivor), during abductology's heyday in the early 1990s. Hopkins was the founder and executive director of the Intruders Foundation, taking its name from his 1987 best-selling book Intruders , which in 1992 was made into a primetime miniseries on CBS-TV. Hopkins wasone of the organizers of the 1992 Abduc tion Study Confer ence at MIT sponsored by physicist David Pritchard, which I attended. Each of the several times I met Hop kins I attempted to engage him ina substantive discussion. He would have none of it, and his attitude toward me(and likely toward all skeptics) was al- ways hostile. Hopkins was not one withwhom to have a discussion or de bate.He was right, you were wrong, and you were probably stupid as well; it was that simple. Hopkins concealed flaws in cases he was proclaiming to the worldwere ironclad proof of abductions. His ex-wife Carol Rainey be came disillu- sioned with his careless research andduplicity and became one of his most severe critics. For more about Rainey contra Hopkins, especially the Brooklyn Bridge Abduction (\"Lev in my \"Psychic Vibra tions\"column in the Spring 1993 SI, which has been reprinted in the new book Psy- chic Vibrations: Skeptical Giggles from the Skeptical Inquirer (2011).

He was right, you were wrong, and you were probably stupid as well.Skeptic's Dictionary for Kids GURMUKHMONGIA The growth of the skeptics commu-nity has resulted in an increase in on-line resources, but most of them have been created with a specific audiencein mind: most often a well-educated, older one.

Itwas bin Laden's hope that our fearful responsesto the attacks might result in more costly repercussions, which in - deed have occurred and continue eventoday; he hoped they would under mineour economy and society. We arguedthat rational skepticism could mitigate (not eliminate) our irrational, self-dam- aging behavior. We claimed that our nation was not facing an existential cri-sis; rather, our leaders were enabling theterrorists to win by playing into theirhopes that we would respond to the at- tacks with exaggerated fear. To our surprise, many SI readers dis- agreed. Letter writers (SI Reader's Fo - rum, January/February 2003, pp. 61-65) argued that the barbarians were indeed at our gates, that the future of our coun- try was actually imperiled. More than one suggested that the attacks were the first salvo in a sure-to-escalate war, like Hitler's first invasions or Pearl Harbor. Some believed there would be an in- creasing frequency and magnitude of terrorist attacks. National polls in 2002 (New York Times/CBS Poll 2002) show -ed that 25 percent of Americans be- lieved that \"another terrorist attack inthe United States\" was \"very likely\"within the next few months; another 45 percent felt it was \"somewhat likely.\"Widespread but plainly irrational wor-ries that \"you or your family will be a vic- tim of a terrorist attack\" have abated littleduring subsequent years (over one-third of Amer icans responded as recently as2009-2011 [AP-Gfk Poll 2011] that they were either \"somewhat\" or \"very\" worried about personally becoming vic- tims of terrorism). In short, common perceptions about the terrorist threat were nearly as dis- torted from reality as beliefs in astrol-ogy, the foreign birth of President Obama, haunted houses, and other top- ics treated in these pages, including conspiracy theories about 9/11 itself (covered extensively in the July/August 2011 issue of SI). Meanwhile, we havefaced very real perils during the past decade as a society (e.g., the economiccrisis), as regions (e.g., hurricanes inNew Orleans and the Gulf Coast), and as individuals (e.g., heart disease). Of course, a major terrorist attack remains a slight possibility, as does the impact of a huge asteroid or a nuclear power-plant meltdown. As the Japanese have recently experienced, a low-probability tsunami and nuclear disaster canhap- pen. But as individuals and as a society, we literally cannot afford the massive expenditures that would be required totry to eliminate all low-probability threats. We must respond rationally to the likelihood and objective seriousness of each threat. The last decade has demonstrated that our fears of terrorism were indeed exaggerated, despite occasional terrorist incidents (at levels similar to terrorism inthe decades preceding 9/11). Considerthe resulting economic impacts. The stock market immediately fell about 15 percent, involving a loss of market capi- talization of several trillion dollars, athousand times the loss of the buildings.Other impacts during the year followingthe attacks included severe downturns for the airline and hospitality industries and the expensive establishment of secu- rity operations at public buildings around the country. Concerns about terrorism, in the context of 9/11, were the stated rea- sons for initiating the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, although otherconsiderations were also at work. A re- cent estimate (Belasko 2011) of the U.S. government appropriations, so far, for the \"War on Terrorism\" (narrowly defined as the Afghanistan and Iraq wars) is $1.3 trillion. Since the expensive wars were not \"paid for,\" or rather they were paid forby increasing the national debt, some argue that our national response to ter- rorism is at least one significant cause\u2014 though there are of course others\u2014of the economic crisis of the past few years. In this sense, the al-Qaeda goal of enticing the United States to enter wars of attri- tion was partly achieved.9/11: Perspectives from a Decade Later CLARK R. CHAPMAN and ALAN W. HARRIS[COMMENTARY Ayear after the terrorist attacks of 2001, we wrote in a SKEPTICALINQUIRERcover story (Chapman and Harris 2002) that the resulting damage to our society was largely self-inflicted. Not that we, the victims, were re- sponsible for the attacks: al-Qaeda and the late Osama bin Laden were accountable, of course, for killing three thou - sand people and destroying billions of dollars worth of property, notably the World Trade Center. Yet the damage to our society has been vastly greater. (For comparison SI Nov.

Of course, these areintertwined with political and religious attitudes, so we cannot know the degree to which other causes of such cultural and societal shifts were also at work. But the clich\u00e9 that we are now \"living in a post-9/11 world\" documents the mag- nitude of our irrational, fear-induced augmentations to the objective damageof the 9/11 attacks. We are disappointed and puzzled that, a decade after the attacks, there hasbeen minimal return to the status quo ante. The Homeland Security in fra -structure continues to grow.

Polls show fears ofterrorism barely retreating, even after years of zero civilian deaths by jihadis on U.S. soil (according to a RAND report [Jenkins 2010]). Over-reaching provi- sions of the post-9/11 Patriot Act have been recently extended. It seems that we as a society, and many of us as individuals, are incapable of returning to our pre- 9/11 existence. Day after day, year after year, the government, driven by perceived public pressure, persists in advancing the terrorists' goals. Our disproportionate individual and societal responses to 9/11 exemplify the \"perception gap,\" which Harvard risk an-alyst David Ropeik discusses in his book How Risky Is It, Really? (Ropeik 2010). Human beings meld the objective \"facts\"about relative risks with their own affec- tive feelings and subconscious fight/flee responses to hazards. Ropeik argues that the perception gap is a dangerous hazardin and of itself. Ropeik quotes estimates that during the few fearful months fol- lowing 9/11, about one thousand addi-tional deaths oc curred on U.S. highways because people chose to drive rather than fly. Even more profound damage was done to American values and economic health by our societal, rather than just in- dividual, perception gap. Ropeik is not optimistic that we can largely avoid such responses, due to innate human traits that underlie the affective aspects of our risk response.However, he argues that better risk com -munication by our leaders and com - mentators could adjust the balance be-tween rational and affective re sponses.We suggest that many negative repercus- sions from 9/11 could have been miti-gated\u2014however imperfectly\u2014had weindividually and collectively behaved dif- ferently in the aftermath of 9/11, trying to take rational, conscious responsibility for our behavior. Journalists, educators,bloggers, politicians, and other opinion leadershave a responsibility to avoid feeding terrorist fears and to promote rational evaluation of our national pri- orities. In particular, the community of skeptics is especially knowledgeable about the battle between objectivity and irrationality and has special expertiseand opportunities to try to close the perception gap concerning terrorism. About once in a generation, a major \"game changing\" event occurs: the eco-nomic crash of 1929, Pearl Harbor, the launch of Sputnik, and now 9/11. Each of these events has spawned dramatic changes in how we live\u2014some good,some bad, some equivocal. The Great Depression led to \"New Deal\" social pro- grams, including Social Security; Pearl Harbor and World War II and the ColdWar that followed led to the massivegrowth of the of which Eisen hower famouslywarned us; and Sputnik launched the space program, along with major reforms of the U.S. education system and in- creased appreciation of science and tech- nology, arguably leading to the revolutionin electronics and computers. What is the legacy of 9/11? Sadly, it is a wastelandof fear and hate, expensive professionalarmies fighting endless wars, and a brand new bureaucracy of Homeland Security (in cluding the TSA), which promotes its own continued existence and is unlikely to go away. n References AP-Gfk Poll. 2011.

A policeman cruising on Route 101 came upon a woman parked beside the road. She told him excitedly that a flying object with red flashing lights hadchased her for some distance. She pointed to a bright light on the horizon.The policeman, Eugene Bertrand, watch - ed it fora short time and, unimpressed, left after reassuring the woman there was nothing to worry about. Then at 2:24 AM, eighteen-year-old Norman Muscarello burst into the Ex- eter police station, \"white, and shaking.\" He had been hitchhiking along Route 150 toward his home in Exeter when he saw what he called \"the Thing,\" as big as or bigger than a house (Fuller 1966, 11). As Muscarello (1965) later described it in a signed statement: A group of five bright lights ap peared over a house about a hundred feet from where I was standing. The lights were in a line at about a sixty-degreeangle. They were so bright, they lighted up the area. The lights then moved out over a large field and acted at times like a floating leaf. They would go down behind the trees, be- hind a house and then reappear. Muscarello then described what would prove to be a powerful clue to the UFO's identity: [The lights] always moved in the same sixty-degree angle. Only one light would be on at a time. They were pulsating: one, two, three, four, five, four, three, two, one. They were so bright I could not distinguish a form to the object. I watched these lights for about fifteen minutes and they finally disappeared behind some trees and seemed to go into a field. At one time while I was watchingthem, they seemed to come so close I jumped into a ditch to keep from being hit. Bertrand drove with Muscarello to the site just before 3 AM. The two walked into the field, and Bertrand himself witnessed the lights Muscarello had described. He stated, \"At one timethey came so close I fell to the ground and started to draw my gun.\" The offi- cer stated that there were \"five bright red lights\"; indeed they were \"extremelybright and flashed on one at a time.\" He added that \"The lights were so bright, I was unable to make out any form\" (Ber -trand 1965). The pair ran to the police car. Bertrand radioed Patrol man David Hunt, who arrived and also witnessed the lights, which finally moved away, east- ward, toward the ocean (Fuller 1966, 14). Over the next several weeks, some sixty reports of UFOs followed in thearea around Exeter. The case resulted in an article in Lookmagazine (Febru ary 8, 1966), the book by Fuller (expan- sively subtitled The Story of Unidentified Objects over America Today), and a host of articles, entries in UFO encyclope- dias (e.g., Clark 1998, 364- 67), and dis- cussions in books (e.g., Hynek 1977, 154-66), as well as lectures, radio shows, and television documentaries. J. Allen Hynek\u2014the astronomer who began as an admitted \"outright 'de- bunker'\" but became, by the late 1960s, a true believer in the reality of \"the UFO phenomenon\"\u2014considered the case \"a fine example of a Close Encounter of the First Kind\" (1977, 1, 154), terminol- ogy he created. Hynek observed that the Pentagon was unable to explain the Sep- tember 3, 1965, Exeter phenomenon and that \"the scientific establishment\" (a phrase dear to true believers) \"in failing to deal with the evidence\" was, like the Penta gon, \"actually admitting that it no explanation\" (Hynek 1977, 165-66).[SPECIAL REPORT 'Exeter Incident' Solved! A Classic UFO Case, Forty-Five Years 'Cold' One of the great unsolved UFO cases\u2014which provoked endless controversy between True Believers and Doubting Thomases\u2014has at long last succumbed to investigation. The 1965 Exeter mystery is now explained. JAMES MCGAHA and JOE NICKELL It has been considered \"one of the best-documented UFO accounts on record\" ( APRO Bulletin 1965) and \"one of the most spectacular and best-corroborated UFO close encounters of all time\" (Davenport and Geremia 2001). What journalist John G. Fuller would sub- sequently relate in his book Incident at Exeter (1966) began in the early hours of a September morning in 1965 near a small town in southeastern New Hampshire. It has never been satisfactorily explained\u2014until now.SI Nov. Dec 11_SI new design masters 9/27/11 12:43 PM Page 16Skeptical Inquirer | November / December 2011 17In short, the object was still an uniden- tifiedflying object, implying that the mystery indicated something momen- tous. Skep tics were, of course, skeptical. 'Solutions' Not surprisingly, the Exeter incident provoked many speculations as to whatthe UFO might have been. Here aresome of the proposals: Astronomical bodies. As shown by a folder in the files of Project Blue Book (the U.S. Air Force's UFO evaluationoperation, 1952-1969), the Pentagon considered\u2014and rejected\u2014the possibil-ity witnesses seen \"stars andplanets twinkling\" due to a temperatureinversion (a meteorological phenome- non in which a layer of warm air is trapped above cold night air and thus is capable of causing visual distortions)(Clark 1998, 365). The totality of evi-dence was incompatible with that hy-pothesis, leading Hynek (1977, 154) todeclare, \"The astronomical evaluation iscompletely untenable.\" Glare of airport landing lights. One air force officer hypothesized that the Exeter sighting merely resulted fromthe glare of landing lights at nearbyPease Air Force Base, a Strategic AirCommand (SAC)/North American AirDefense Command (NORAD) bomb erbase. This possibility was tested by hav- ing both the runway marker lights andthe approach strobes turned off and on during a fifteen-minute period, but ob- servers saw no effect from the Exeter site (UFO Phenomenon 1987, 103-104). An Air Force Operation. Blue Book suggested the incident might have been caused by planes from a SAC/ NORAD training exercise dubbed \"BigBlast,\" which occurred on Sep tember 2- 3, 1965. Blue Book noted that \"the town of Exeter is within the traffic patternutilized by Air Traffic Control in the re- covery of these aircraft at Pease AFB[Air Force midnight and 2 AM.However, Ber trand noted that he and young Muscarello had witnessed the flashing UFO \"nearly an hour after two a.m. which wouldeliminate the Air Force Operation BigBlast\" as an explanation (qtd. in Clark1998, 366). Hynek (1977, 154) con- curred. Advertising plane. Newspapers in the Exeter area ascribed the lights to \"a fly-ing billboard\"\u2014an ad plane\u2014owned by the Sky-Lite Aerial Adver tisingAgency of Boston. The Ames bury (Massachusetts) Newsthus claimed the UFO \"has finally been identified!\" But alas, that plane was on the ground be-tween August 21 and September 10,and furthermore it bore no red flashinglights, instead having \"a rectangular signcarrying white flashing lights\" (Fuller 1966, 51). Corona discharge from power lines. The late UFO skeptic Philip J. Klass agreedthat the eyewitnesses had indeed seen something unusual, but he speculated that \"the Exeter UFOs\" (including theone seen by Muscarello and the two po-lice officers) might have been \"power- line coronas,\" that is, clear-weather plas-mas (luminous clouds of ionized air)that were generated by electrical charges emanating from high-tension power lines (Klass 1968, 12-25). This clearly did not explain the original Exeter inci-dent, and Klass later backed away fromhis \"plasma UFOs\" theory (see Clark1998, 366). Prank with lighted kite. Skeptical UFO buff Martin Kottmeyer (1996)weighed in with the notion that a prankster flew a kite, most likely \"alarge box kite\" kite-line than a tail\" (thus ac-counting for the observed sixty-degree angle). However, not only is the kite hy- pothesis cut from whole cloth, but the imagined prankster seems to have goneto considerable effort for such a de- serted place and time. Figure 1. A U.S. Air Force KC-97 refueling tanker like this one became an unintentional UFO, sparking the \"Exeter Incident\" of Sep tember 3, 1965.SI Nov.

Still other possible candidates were proposed\u2014helicopter, balloon, civilian plane\u2014but nothing seemed likely. As Jerome Clark summed up in his The UFO Encyclopedia (1998, 366) after noting the case had received much notoriety, \"The attention en sured that this particular close en counter of the first kind would be remembered in a way few have been. Still, by any stan- dard the sighting remains puzzling and impressive.\" Perceptions People misperceive\u2014especially when they suddenly encounter something that is unknown, is seen under adverse conditions, and frightens them. Recall that at Exeter the un identified lights were so bright that witnesses could notmake out the shape of the UFO. Not knowing the craft's size, its altitude, or itsdistance from the viewer\u2014 that is, with multiple un-knowns\u2014a witness has nobasis for estimating any ofthese factors. And Exeterwitnesses were indeed afraid: a woman who felt she wasbeing chased by a UFO had pulled off the road; a teenagewitness arriving at the policestation was white and shak-ing; and one officer admittedhe almost shot at the bright lights. Consider that even some- thing as distant as a meteorhundreds of miles away, pass- ing out of sight behind trees, can seem to have landed in anearby woodland\u2014a com- mon illusion. The brightness of the Exeter UFO's lights(greater than that of a mere airplane and ultimately pro-viding a clue to its identity) probably made the craft seem much closer than it re-ally was. Consider, too, that some- thing that is frighteningtends to loom large in one's consciousness. Chad Marsolek of theUniversity of Minnesota, an expert in memory distortion, describes a \"weapon- focus effect.\" This may cause an eyewit- ness who is focusing on something frightening (such as the barrel of a gun) to lose focus on other elements. As ithappens, when people view a disturbing image they tend to be confident of their accuracy\u2014even when their memory iswrong (Mar solek 2010). All of these issues apply to the Ex- eter incident. However, much of whatthe eyewitnesses described was still ac-curate, as we shall see presently. Solved! For forty-five years the incident at Ex- eter remained unsolved. Then, while we were working together on some ongo- ing UFO research, one of us (Joe Nick-ell), an investigator and science writer, recalled the cold case to the other (James McGaha), an astronomer and former military pilot. We brainstormed the case,shared sources, and discussed details\u2014soon agreeing that one particular element held the key to the solution. We might call it (with homage to Hardy Boys' mys- teries) \"The Clue of the Sequencing Lights.\" As it happens, the military pilot of our team has actually docked with a craft like the UFO at Exeter, and he recognized the sequencing lights for what they surely were: those on a U.S. Air Force KC-97 refueling plane. To check his memoryand obtain photos (figures 1-3), he vis- ited an aerospace museum. Like seeing an old friend, he gazed on a mothballed KC-97 tanker (figure 1) whose fuselageis arrayed with a row of five red sequenc- ing lights (figure 2). These would reflect onto the refueling boom (figure 3), which (according to the flight manual) whenlowered is inclined at sixty-four degrees. Just this type of craft operated out of Strategic Air Command bomber bases like that of Pease AFB and, in deed,would surely have been involved in a SAC/NORAD training exercise like that dubbed \"Big Blast\" of Sep tem ber 2-3, 1965. But what about the \"fact\" that this exercise\u2014which was ongoing in the skies over Exeter at the time of the first sightings\u2014had supposedly ended about an hour before Muscarello and officer Bertrand had their \"close en- counter\"? 1It seems quite apparent that, although the particular exercise was re- portedly over, there were still planes in the sky. Bertrand and Hunt, in fact, wit- nessed a B-47 jet at about the time the UFO disappeared (Fuller 1966, 67). Perhaps it had just refueled. The airborne refueling process of the KC-97 is both interesting and rel- evant. Briefly, it involved the KC-97 making long circuits of the rendezvous area. As the jet to be refueled began to approach, the boom was lowered and the receiver (sequencing) lights were turned on. However, when the jet was in very close proximity, the receiver lights were turned low; otherwise their extreme brightness would temporarily Figure 2. On the underbelly of the KC-97 are (closest to the camera) a set of three high-intensity lights and (farther from the viewer) the five red panels of sequencing lights. (These were described by eye- witnesses as \"five bright red lights\" that \"flashed on one at a time,\" specifically \"pulsating: one, two, three, four, five, four, three, two, one.\")SI Nov.

There would be some jockeying asthe two planes connected, and all of thiscould look exceedingly strange to anobserver on the ground. Thus, on one of its long passes the slow-moving KC-97 could have seemedto be \"chasing\" the first eyewitness onRoute 101. It was subsequently seen by young Muscarello and, later still, Ber -trand, with its boom down at its charac- teristic angle. This boom, which bore its own small wings (again, see figure 3),would actually flutter in the air currents (except when specifically being con-trolled by the boom operator), which no doubt explains eyewitness Muscarello'sstatement that the UFO \"acted at times like a floating leaf.\" Most notable werethe tanker's five red lights, which wereflashing\u2014in the sequence accuratelydescribed by the two witnesses\u2014one,two, three, four, five, four, three, two, one.The extreme brightness of the lights,rendering other features of the object in- distinguishable from the ground, is fur-ther corroborative evidence of the UFO'sidentification as a KC-97 refueling plane. Why did the Pentagon not solve the case at the time? Perhaps in the welterof paperwork the clue we found so sig-nificant went unseen by anyone whocould fully grasp its import and whohad time to devote to the case. Natu-rally, everything is much clearer inhindsight. We believe this solves the so-called incident at Exeter. As to the weeks ofsubsequent UFO reports in the vicinity,they were beyond the scope of our in- vestigation. (See Fuller 1966; Sheaf fer 1986, 111-19.) As our work shows, \"cold cases\" may be solvable with per- severance and some luck, keeping in mind that luck is most likely to come to those who go looking for it. n Acknowledgments The authors wish to thank James Stemm, curator of the Pima Air and Space Museum, and Tim Binga, director of the Center for Inquiry Libraries, for their help with this in- vestigative project.Note 1.

Would I call myself a card- carrying skeptic? No. I didn't know of the wholeskeptical community until Istarted doing research forthe show. I hadn't been in- volved in it previously, so for me to say \"Yeah, I'm askeptic too\" seemed disin-genuous. I know what itmeans to be a scientist be-cause that's what I've beentrained to be. I don't have agood sense of what itmeans to be a \"skeptic.\" What is the scientist's role on the show? My goal is to get people tothink more deeply about what they believe withoutthreat or disrespect. The target audience is not ex- actly on \"my side,\" and so I have to walk a very fine line. When I talk to people, I try to assess whether their stories are backed up by other evidence. I realizepeople are very susceptibleto all kinds of memory fail- ures. Misremembering things that happened, whileat the same time conflatingmemories from similar butseparate events, is verycommon. Of course, mostof us are not very good atresisting the temptation toinfer causality when two events follow each other closely in time. What's it like to do an episode and a whole season? The shooting schedule was grueling. It was a twelve- hour day on camera. We'd shoot for twelve hours and then return to the hotel room, where I'd still have to do a diary cam session (talking about your feelings into the camera) and re- search for the following day. Also, I'd be preparing for the next week's case at the same time, so if I got six hours of sleep a night that was great. It was nonstop. I would do so much back- ground research on each case, downloading and read- ing papers from PubMed, calling up colleagues, talking about the case with my hus-band, and so on. For the interviews [with experts and witnesses], I didn't always have enough preparation time, and sometimes I didn't knowwhat to expect. That's part of the challenge on a show like this. How do you go about inter- viewing witnesses who have a story about a miracle? How do you use that information? I look to question witnesses in a way that gets around them just telling the storyin the same way they've told it before. Instead, we try to access other informa- tion they might not sharein the regular telling. They might have told this story a'Getting People to Think More Deeply' An Interview with Miracle Detectives Scientist Indre Viskontas Miracle Detectives is a new television series that examines miracle claims via a team of investigators\u2014one a believer, the other a sci- entist. The show premiered with the launch of the Oprah Winfrey Network (OWN) in January 2011. The believer of the show's team is Randall Sullivan, journalist and author of the book The Miracle Detective (Grove Press, 2005). Sullivan reportedly experienced his own personal religious event in Medjugorje, Bosnia. He is an avowed believer in the existence of miracles. The adept foil for Sullivan is neuroscientist Indre Viskontas . Broadly trained in psychology, specifically in cognition, at UCLA,Viskontas specializes in the neural basis of memory and creativity.She is affiliated with the University of California, San Francisco,Memory and Aging Center and edits the journal Neurocase. (She is also an accomplished opera singer, having obtained a master of music degree at the San Francisco Conservatory of Music.) At least two miraculous claims are highlighted in each episode. The miracle detective team of Sullivan and Viskontas (a setup akin to Mulder and Scully in The X-Files ) travels to the location of the event to interview witnesses and also consult with various experts. Questioning witnesses who believe a miracle has taken place is as much of an art as a science. Viskontas employs both to examinethe claims made by people who believe these events are miracu- lous communications from God. In this interview, she shares withSharon Hill strategies and some insights into working in television. SI Nov. Dec 11_SI new design masters 9/27/11 12:43 PM Page 20hundred times before. When you start to ask them questions about theevent\u2014things they aren't used to talk-ing about, other aspects they aren'tused to recalling\u2014you can find out ifwhat they are saying makes sense or ifthey are conflating multiple incidents orcoloring the past with their knowledgeof what happened after the incident. I assume that people are telling me honestly what they remember, butwhen there is something out of theordinary [such as an event they mayattribute to paranormal causes] thereare other ways in which I can corrob-orate their story. For example, I canlook at a police report and at specificdetails of the account. Then I can geta sense of how accurate a memory isand to what extent the person's recol- lection is faulty. How does editing for television affect the presentation of the investigation? Haveyou been pleased with the editing? For the most part I've been pleased. When you have a television show, youneed to make a story out of [the con-tent]. There was one episode about amedical intuitive where I felt that . .. [the editors] left out some criticalcomponents. We picked a subject withone salient complaint. The intuitivecame back with a very long list of po- tential problems but no mention ofthat complaint. Many items men- tioned on that list were cut out to savetime, and the editors decided to keepthe relevant bits in\u2014that is, the onesthat the subject felt actually did applyto him. They edited out stuff thatseemed superfluous. But in the case ofan intuitive, this is really problematic!When listing every possible symptomthat a person could experience, you'regoing to get some hits, but what's im-portant is the ratio of hits to misses\u2014not simply the hits. The editing is not designed to show that the skeptic is wrong andRandall is right. The goal is to makegood television. Especially given thetarget audience, [the editors] do a \"My goal is to get people to think more deeply about what they believe without threat or disrespect. The target audience is not exactly on 'my side,' and so I have to walk a very fine line.\" SI Nov. Dec 11_SI new design masters 9/27/11 12:43 PM Page 2122 Volume 35 Issue 6 | Skeptical Inquirergood job. If I felt they were really skewing it, I wouldhave left the show midway.But we have to rememberthat the target audiencewon't watch a show de-bunking miracles, andwhat's important here is toengage that audience, notsimply to preach to thechoir. Is it hard to explain the sci- ence in a one-hour show? It's very hard; it's one of the biggest challenges. What Isay is, \"The evidence sug-gests it's most likely thisthing over the other.\" That'snot very satisfying to manypeople but it's the truth. Tosay that God did that or itwas some supernaturalthing requires such amountain of evidence. What has been the viewer reaction? The feedback has been mixed. I get emails frompeople who say they likemy point of view. They'llsay, \"Most of the time I find myself siding with Randall,but you've made me think about things that I hadn'tbefore.\" Other times they'll say, \"Wow, I never reallythought about that possi-bility. It's changing the way I think about my relation-ship with God becausemaybe he acts in ways Inever considered before.\" It can also be hard to hear the criticisms from theskeptical community, to do it.But I did the best I could,since one of my goals wasto engage the audience, notbe dismissed outright bythem. I think in most casesI did a pretty good job ofbringing things to the tablethat people hadn't thoughtabout. To me, it's not exciting to say, \"This is not a mira-cle.\" It's exciting to say,\"There is something here we hadn't thought about before that's worth investi- gating further,\" or \"Look how interesting the brain is that it can do this.\" That's what fascinates me. How do you think skeptical/ra- tional advocates can success- fully promote their viewpoint? I'd say don't simply discounta person's belief but find what it is that interests you both. For example, a Big-foot print: Instead of dis- missing it by stating that's not what you think it is, bring up another discussion point. Find something in- teresting [to discuss] that doesn't rely on the existence of a mythical creature or supernatural explanation.Perhaps you can find some-thing in common that you can start out with: \"Isn't it odd that there is one foot- print here and nothing else around it? How do youthink it got there? What are possible explanations? Let's explore and keep talk- ing.\" Once you dismissthem, you've lost them.They don't want to talk toyou anymore. When you ask people questions that force themto come up with answers,they are much more likely to change their belief sys- tem if they realize these questions are unanswerablewithin their viewpoint. They also want to talk about the experience. So, ifyou question and try to un-derstand what they base their beliefs on, you can lead them in a direction toshow them that their beliefs might be fiction, and you can also develop a rapportwith them that will encour-age them to trust you. What are your future plans? My goal in the future, through this show or other means, is to share my pas- sion for life and to illumi- nate what I can about the human experience.

Dec 11_SI new design masters 9/27/11 12:43 PM Page 22While in Hungary from Septem - ber 16-22, 2010\u2014initially to participate in the fourteenth Euro pean Skeptics Congress (held inBudapest September 17-19)\u2014I foundtime for some interesting investigations. Massimo Polidoro and I explored the great labyrinth beneath Buda Cas-tle, a network of caves and rock vaultscreated by hot water springs and used as refuge by prehistoric man; it was later linked by cellars, dungeons, and military store rooms into a complex that runs for 1,300 yards ( Eye witness2007, 65) and is billed as \"one of the seven undergroundwonders of the world\" (\"The Labyrinth\" n.d.). Poli doro and I also went in searchof a fabled statue of the Virgin. Legend says it was enclosed in the wall of M\u00e1ty\u00e1s Church during the Turkish occupation, and when the edifice was all but de - stroyed in 1686, the statue miraculously appeared ( Eyewitness2007, 62). Alas, however, it would not reappear for us: it was in a part of the church undergoing renovation, and we could not beg or buy our way in. Another investigation had me ac - companying scholar Benedek Lang to the Library of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences to assist him in studying a most mysterious manuscript, the Ro - honc Codex. This\u2014like the famed Voynich Manuscript (Schmeh 2011)\u2014 is written in an unknown language. Using techniques from my book Pen, Ink, and Evidence (Nickell 1990), I pro- vided information relating to the codex's authenticity, date of composition, and other issues. Still another excursion took me to the purported birthplace of Harry Houdini at No. 1 Csengery Street, Dis- trict 7, Budapest. The remainder of my investigative work in Hungary\u2014which relates moreor less to the field of parapsychology\u2014 was conducted with the untiring assis- tance of Gabor Hrasko (who negotiatedarrangements, drove, took photographs, and much more), and Veron Eles (whohas a definite talent for undercover work). Here is a very brief account of each of four excursions. Experiencing Healing Energy Our first visit was to a site called Attila Domb (Attila Mound), part of a com- mercialized Kincsem Horse Park nearthe village of T\u00e1pi\u00f3szentm\u00e1rton. Thesite's supposed connection with Attila the Hun is tenuous, but the name Kinc- sem (\"My Treasure\") was that of a\"wonder mare\" of the nineteenth cen- tury who never lost a race. The 37.5- acre site was said to have an energy em- anation that attracted horses andendowed them with better health and a greater foaling rate than elsewhere. A \"seriously ill\" horse was reportedly alsohealed there (\"Attila\" 2011; Olsen 2007, 128-29). From this folklore grew ru- mors that the site was a \"healing mound\" that could cure sick people. The owner (and local mayor), Kocsi J\u00e1nos, graciously hosted us and gave usa demonstration of the site's supposedmagical energy. He sat Eles and me down in his on-site restaurant and sug- gestedthat our hands, placed flat on a table, would mysteriously rise and a warmth or tingling or other effect would spread from our fingers through- out our bodies. Eles followed my lead asI played along, and she did so againwhen J\u00e1nos took us just outside and sug- gestedthe energy could cause us to fall backward\u2014much the same as at an American Pentecostal healing service where people supposedly \"go under the power\" of the Holy Spirit but actuallyare role-playing in response to sugges- tion and expectation (Nickell 2002). J\u00e1nos played catcher as we fell backward on cue (see figure 1). Hrasko, Eles, and I then walked to the mound, a gentle knoll where \"geo- mancers,\" or dowsers claim to detect the crossing of \"a strong ley line\"\u2014leys are imagined lines of \"earth energy\" that supposedly connect ancient mounds,churches, legendary trees, and other al- leged mystical 12; Olsen This mix of su-perstition and pseudoscience will have no medical benefit of course, althoughthe site can take advantage of the same factors that are behind the touted suc- cesses of faith healing: misdiagnosis,prior medical treatment, psychosomatic conditions, spontaneous remissions, the Skeptical Inquirer | November / December 2011 23[ INVESTIGATIVE FILES J O E N I C K E L L Joe Nickell is CSI's senior research fellow.

As always, be- lievers emphasize any supposed suc- cesses while ignoring the numerous failures. Across the top of the mound is a ditch where an archaeological dig took place in 1924 in a search for traces of Attila the Hun's wooden palace. (His grave is also located at the site, accord- ing to legend.) Nothing was discovered relating to Attila, but of several un - earthed objects, one, attributed to the Scythians and now reposing in Hun - gary's National Museum, is descrip-tively called the Golden Stag. Its name-sake is J\u00e1nos's restaurant, and thewonderful lunch to which he treated usthere\u2014beginning with palinka(an al- coholic peach drink) and includingKincsem ragout (a stew named for thefamous racehorse) along with many other treats\u2014was the most magical part of our visit. Hanging Up on Phone Psychics We three investigators next met with Jeno Torocsik, a Hungarian mathemati- cian who operates a number of in - teractive television shows. These in cludegame shows that, critics complain, are essentially gambling enterprises (sincethey depend more on chance\u2014the win- ning caller being picked randomly\u2014 than skill) (\"TV\" 2006). Torocsik alsooperates several psychic telephone net-works\u2014in Spain, Romania, and theUnited States, as well as Hungary. (Dothe psychics know who will win on the game shows? Apparently not.) We skeptics had a debate with Toroc - sik over the evidence for and against psy-chics and psychic phenomena. He was opposed to his \"psychics\" being tested by famed magician and psychical investiga- tor James Randi, whose James RandiEducational Foun da tion (JREF) offersone million dollars to anyone who can, under scientific test conditions, demon-strate genuine psychic ability. Torocsikasserted that Randi is not impartial(when in fact JREF protocols eliminatetester bias), and he claimed that \"psi\" (psychical phenomena) is too elusive tobe tested effectively! When I attemptedto make the case for the necessity of sci-entific testing, pointing out that it was he who appeared not to be impartial, he became rather impatient. Nevertheless, he did permit me to photograph an operator who handles psychic-seeking callers (figure 2). Using a computer screen, she matches callers with at-home fortunetellers who, he in-sisted defensively, were at least effective counselors, if not actually psychic. (In a S KEPTICALINQUIRERex pos\u00e9 of tele- phone psychics, C. Eugene Em ery, Jr. [1995] describes how some admittedly phony psychics attempted to gently provide traditional counseling as a sub s - titute for supernatural in sights. But callers resisted. For example, one wo - man wondered if her husband was going to beat her but rejected the advice to call 911 or turn to available sources of assistance. Indeed, only after the \"psychic\" concocted a tarot-card read- ing to support her commonsense rec- ommendation did the caller seem in- clined to accept the advice.) Tapping My Telepathic Powers I was much intrigued by our visit to Bu- dapest's Esoteric University and its Psi Lab, where researcher Paulinyi Tam\u00e1s gave us an overview of the ex periments he and his colleagues are conducting.They gave a demonstration (not an ac- tual experiment of record) using me as a test subject for a ganzfeld experiment. This involves parapsychologists creating an environment of sensory deprivation to supposedly stimulate the subject's recep- tivity of ESP (Guiley 1991, 225-26). This particular laboratory has claimed quite significant results, in contrast to others that have reportedly gotten only average or low scores. For the experiment, a random num- ber generator was used to select one of a set of four pictures. I was then sub- jected to mild sensory deprivation (in- volving diffuse light and white noise) in a soundproofed test room (figure 3)where Tam\u00e1s joined me. Unknown to me, Eles was chosen as \"sender\"\u2014that is, one tasked with looking at the target picture and attempting to convey it to me telepathically. On request, I made verbal descrip- tions and later a sketch of what I hadenvisioned in my mind's eye, then was Figure 2. An operator connects hopeful callers with work-at-home telephone \"psychics.\" Figure 3.

As it happened, my selection wasthe one Eles had \"sent.\" This was onlya one-in-four guess, but everyone wasamused\u2014both at the outcome and atmy pretense of having discovered I wasactually telepathic. Joking aside, I had some criticisms to share, and the parapsychologists listened earnestly. I thought the person whomonitors the experiment by sitting in theroom and interacting with the test sub-ject should not have seen (or actuallybeen familiar with) all of the two hun-dred or so photos used in the series ofganzfeld experiments. And I wonderedwhy the researchers did not attempt to further test those subjects who scoredconsistently well (or poorly, for that mat-ter), to see if their results might representonly a statistical fluke or could have someother explanation. (This entire subject is complicated and deserves a more detailed descriptionand analysis than I am able to providehere. Those who are further interestedshould read the critiques of ganzfeld andother psi experiments by CSI's RayHyman [1996; 2008], who is professor emeritus of psychology at the Universityof Oregon and an expert in cognition, thepsychology of deception, and the evi-dence for paranormal claims, including parapsychological ones.) Wondering at the Gypsy's Trance The most sensational of our investigative adventures was surely our encounter witha \"gypsy\" (Roma) fortuneteller andmedium at her apartment in Budapest.She wore a colorful scarf and treated usto music from Radio C, the local Roma channel, while I idly looked at her well- worn deck of fortune-telling cards. For an unstated fee (more about that later) she offered to enter into a trance in order to get some important advice that Eles was seeking from the spirit of her de-ceased twin. Eles had invented the dead twin in a conversation with me on the way to themedium's apartment. Her original imaginary creation was female; however, when the Roma woman (who does soothsaying weekly on Radio C) began to fish for information and asked if thetwin had been male, Eles decided to go with that. She also agreed with other gleanings by the medium that culmi- nated in the tale of the brother having died in a car accident caused by his own drunkenness. Eles played her role ad- mirably, and the medium swallowed the bait, hook and all. As the medium prepared to commu- nicate with the alleged twin, she warned us not to be afraid if she shouldfail to emerge from her trance state but simply try to revive her by calling hername and having some water ready. Itook the warning as an indication that the woman was going to put on a good show, and I was not disappointed. She knelt to pray, then sat in a chair whereshe embarked on her voyage to the Other Side (figure 4). Suitably \"entranced,\" she was soon spinning a \"message\" from the nonexist-ent twin to Eles, who seemed obviously moved by the heartfelt outpourings. Atlength, the alleged communication over, Eles dutifully attempted to revive the medium, who appeared to be immersed in her role, eventually coming to with great histrionics, including a bout of sob-bing. After she had finally calmed down, I asked her about her gifts, and she toldus that her maternal grandmother had also been clairvoyant. We were not quite prepared for what would soon be the most elaborate act of all: her attempt towrest from us a whopping fee. She apparently thought\u2014wrongly again\u2014that we were wealthy gorgios (non-gypsies) who would cough up alot of cash. Not a speaker of Hun garian,I left it to Hrasko and Eles to conductthe negotiations, which I could see werefilled with reasoned if angry discoursefrom our side and more anger, bluster,and histrionics from the Roma woman. I had thought at one point we might throw down some cash and walk out,but I did not know that\u2014surrepti-tiously following our entry into herapartment\u2014she had locked us in!What a gal! Still, I will not use the term\"attempted extortion.\" Maybe she just did not want us to be disturbed. In time, for a fee of about fifty U.S. dol- lars\u2014excessive, considering the medi- umistic communication was at best awork of imagination\u2014we were on ourway, and the Roma woman was all smiles. We were smiling too, from our different perspective. n References Attila Hill. 2011. Available online at www. caboodle.hu; accessed February 24. Eyewitness Travel: Hungary. 2007.

His website is at www.massimopolidoro.com. In September 2005, the Italian media was flooded with news about a psy- chic, Maria Rosa Busi, who appar- ently led the police to the body of a miss- ing girl at the bottom of Lake Como.Television and newspapers gave amplecoverage to the psychic, who claimedthat an otherworldly vision allowed her to unravel the three-year-old mystery. She said she had been able to \"see\" the last moments of Chiara Bariffi's life be-fore she drove into the lake in her car inlate 2002. She even claimed to haveheard a message from the deceasedwoman. \"I went to the lake, and I sawwhere it happened.... I heard her, I sawher and I drew a map,\" Busi said. \"No-body thought she was in the lake.\" The psychic, who claims clairvoyant powers, was first contacted by the par-ents of the victim, who were trying tofind out what happened to their daugh-ter. They sent Busi a photograph ofBariffi, who was around thirty years old when she disappeared. \"When I saw the photo, I knew that she was dead,\" Busi said. \"I'm a clairvoyant. I can tell when someone is living or dead.\" Police had no leads, and the missing persons case languished. Murder was a possibility and, since Bariffi had also battled emotional problems, some sus-pected suicide. The family even thought that Bariffi might have gone to Venice or left the country for Spain. Remo Bonetti, a rescue worker who has led similar searches for bodies in the past, said that the mystery would not have been solved without Busi's help. \"Without the directions of Maria Rosa no one would have ever been ableto find her, unless by accident,\" he said. How \"Psychic\" Is the Seer? This is how the case was first presented in the media: A girl went missing. Po-lice searched, but three years passed by and no trace of her was ever found. Then a psychic came along who through magic visions saw and heard the girl calling from the depths of thelake, where rescue workers finally foundher. A miracle! That is, until we looked deeper into the case. Along with CICAP's col- league Marco Morocutti we decided toinvestigate. First, we retrieved press news clippings and articles relating to Busi. We found that she had also claimed success two years before, after finding the body of a woman who com- mitted suicide in the Lake of Iseo.However, in her statements she forgot to mention that the husband of thewoman had also committed suicide, and his body had been retrieved from the waters of that lake just before thewoman's suicide. Also, the police had found the couple's car, a purse with per- sonal documents belonging to the miss- ing woman, and her cell phone by the same lake. Furthermore, before disap- pearing the woman had recorded a tape in which she expressed her intention to take her life. The fact that her body was found in the lake not far from whereher husband was found does not seem as impressive once the background cir-cumstances are known. Busi had also been in the news for claiming that the legendary \"gold ofDongo,\" the supposed treasure of Mus- solini, was buried in the Vittoriale, themuseum that was once the house of cel- ebrated poet and Mussolini supporter Gabriele D'Annunzio. Several holes were dug in the park, but no treasure was ever found. \"The treasure is there, I say. They just did not look hard enough,\" the psychic still claimed. 26 Volume 35 Issue 6 | Skeptical InquirerThe Lost Girl Investigating a Case of \"Psychic Detection\" Self-proclaimed psychic Maria Rosa Busi holds up a photograph of Chiara Bariffi.

Dec 11_SI new design masters 9/27/11 12:43 PM Page 26Skeptical Inquirer | November / December 2011 27What Really Happened at the Lake Now that the record of the claimed psychic was a little bit clearer, it wastime to learn what happened at the time of Bariffi's disappearance. On the night of November 30 and early morn-ing of December 1, 2002, Bariffi wasdriving back home from an evening with friends. The drive was less three miles, but part of the trip was along theedge of Lake Como. That night, the weather bulletins tell us, a violent storm passed over the area. It was so strongthat it created landslides on surround- ing hills. Bariffi would never reachhome that night; both she and her car vanished. Her disappearance was not so sur- prising once we knew a little more about the circumstances surrounding it. Both Bariffi's family and the policesupposed that the most likely explana-tion was that Bariffi's car crashed through the railings and plunged into the water below. There was in particulara very dangerous and sharp bend in the road overlooking the lake where, in the past, other cars had broken through andfallen into the lake. Marco Morocutti went to Como and saw three tomb- stones along the road: a grim reminderto drivers of how risky that bend can be. He also talked to residents who ex- plained that there was road work beingconducted at the time of the disappear-ance and that sand was piled up along the railings\u2014a situation that, coupled with a slippery road and visibility made poor by the storm, was clearly a recipe for disaster. The waters below that particular bend were the first place the police went searching. The only problem was that the lake in that very spot is ap - proximately seven hundred feet deep. Another car that had fallen there ten years earlier was never found. Scuba divers went looking anyway, but they had no success. After a while, the search for Bariffi was interrupted. Bariffi's parents started to imagine that maybe their daughter was not dead after all but had run awaywithout telling anyone. So a journalist friend of Busi suggested to them thatthey contact the psychic and seek herhelp. The woman went to Como,learned the whole story, and then took a look at the road. At that moment, ei- ther by some \"spirit message\" or by sheer deductive reasoning, she said that Bariffi had fallen into the lake in thevery same spot where the police had searched three years earlier. Maria Rosa Busi, however, had an advantage over the police. She couldcount on the generous help of the vol- untary rescue group led by Remo Bo - netti, a group that had already found120 lost people, most of them dead. Unlike the police, the group had no time limit and could use all kinds ofmodern technologies in their search. Inparticular, they employed \"Mercurio,\" arobot submarine that could reach adepth of 1,600 feet\u2014a faculty that the police lacked. It was just a matter of time and pa- tience before the cameras of the robot eventually found a car whose license plate matched Bariffi's. The lost girl had been found. The Media Never Learn So that's how things really happened at Lake Como. Once we know all thefacts, the psychic's feat appears muchless impressive than it did in the begin- ning. Furthermore, as a consequence ofthe enormous exposure that Maria Rosa Busi gained, she was later con- tacted regarding other missing personscases. In 2006 a small boy was kid-napped near Parma, and a month later Busi claimed that she saw him alive and well. After all, she had said that through her clairvoyant power she could \"tell when someone is living or dead.\" It laterturned out that the boy had been killed by the kidnappers only a few hours afterthey took him. After that, Maria Rosa Busi again gave directions and drew maps that shesaid would help in finding a canoeist who had disappeared in the Lake ofPusiano. Six years later, the canoeist isstill missing. But it seems that the media never learn. Last January, after the month- long disappearance of Yara Gam birasio,a thirteen-year-old girl who was last seen leaving her school gym, Busi trieda comeback. \"I am here because my conscience calls me. I feel I must do something for that poor little girl,\" shesaid to journalists. \"I feel she will be found; the family should be serene. Love will prevail and all will be well.\" Two months later, the dead body of Yara was found in a nearby field. The killer is still at large. Chiara Bariffi is believed to have driven into Lake Como after losing control around this dangerous curve.SI Nov.

His essays can be found at www.rationallyspeaking.org. Those of us who have spent years ar- guing against creationists of all stripes inevitably begin to think that the struggle is hopeless, at least in onesense: it seems to simply be impossible topersuade any major proponent of theother side that there is something seri-ously wrong with what he or she is doing. Now, it is tempting to just shrug one'sshoulders and mutter something alongthe lines of \"Well, they are a bunch of id-iots blindly driven by their ideology,\"after which we order a beer with our fel- low skeptics and further commiserate the sorry state of affairs when it comes to ra- tionality in this world. Except, of course, that that's a bit too easy. For one thing, you can rest assuredthat someone on \"the other side\" is shrug-ging his shoulders and muttering similar comments in perfect symmetry\u2014though since often proponents of intelligent de- sign (ID) are fundamentalist Chris tians they probably wouldn't do it over a beer. Yes, of course we are right and they are wrong, but what exactly makes us so sure that the charge of ideological blindness ought to stick to them but not to us? That is why I found interesting a paper published in the philosophy jour-nal Sophiaby Jeremy Shear mur ing Intelli gent Design\" (published on- line on December 4, 2010). Shearmur wishes to take seriously the fact that the ID movement is not fueled by a bunch of bumbling idiots but by people like UC Berkeley lawyer Phillip Johnson, Prince ton Theological Seminary grad- uate William Dembski, and LehighUni versity biochemist Michael Behe.Shearmur is simply trying to see what would happen if one were to take thesepeople at their word, as genuinely try- ing to build a non-naturalistic alterna- tive to modern science by way of out- lining a theory of intelligent design that does a better explanatory job of the his- tory of life than the Darwinian theory of evolution. The question is then, whatwould ID proponents have to do in order to be taken seriously and avoid being dismissed as simply a bunch of conservative Christian ideologues look- ing for any excuse to impose their the- istic views on the rest of us? I realize that it is hard to let go of the latter\u2014tempting, and somewhat empir- ically justified\u2014assumption. But let us try for a moment and see where Shear- mur manages to go. First off, Shearmurgives ID proponents credit over theirmain intellectual rival within the Chris- tian tradition, theological modernism\u2014 and rightly so, I think. Shearmur argues that the theological modernist position, which somewhat lackadaisically recon- ciles science and faith, fails in two major ways: first, because it keeps remaking God into whatever image happens to be compatible with the latest science, i.e., it succeeds through a theological copout;second, because it does so without the in- tellectual courage to acknowledge its marked retreat from the historical Chris- tian tradition. In other words, Dembski and Co. are theologically braver than their almost-anything-goes mainstream colleagues within Chris tian apologetics. Okay, but what about the (alleged) science? Shearmur reconstructs Demb - ski's approach within the context of a renaissance (so to speak) of Princeton Theological Seminary's \"old\" school, as developing \"a striking line in meta- physics in which he reinterprets ideas about the Word from St. John's gospelinto a research program for the under- standing of the world.\" This really does- n't sound like a promising beginning, but Shearmur (who, I should add, is anonbeliever) valiantly pursues his quest to give ID its best shot. Dembski's program faces one initial, huge hurdle, though: if he wishes toreestablish modern science in a way thatis seriously compatible with the Chris- tian scripture, he needs to ac count for the problem of error within scripture itself. Shearmur states that Dembski's \"un-apologetic apologetics\" has a range of op- tions available, all the way up to taking seriously W.V.O. Quine's suggestion that each and every thread of the \"web of knowledge,\" including the rules oflogic itself, ought to be up for discus- sion if there is sufficient reason to doubt its accuracy. Quine was one of the most influen- tial philosophers of the twentieth cen- tury, and he did have a major point tomake to the effect that there are no sa-cred cows in science, philosophy, oreven logic and math. (According to Quine, if our best understanding of the world is incompatible with some of the laws of logic, so much the worse for the laws of logic.) That said, as Shearmur immediately agrees, going that routewould be very dangerous for Dembski and colleagues: \"Such an approach canbe only defensive\u2014and it is also in principle a strategy open to any view, however silly it might actually be. Itspursuit simply shows that a view can bemaintained, not that it is true.\" And indeed, in the end Shearmur concludes that that is precisely ID'sAchilles' heel. Even if we take the ef- forts of Johnson, Dembski, and Behe atface value as an intellectually honestpursuit for an alternative type of sci- ence, the fact remains that they haven'teven begun to do anything beyond(highly questionable in itself) negative critical work. There are no experiments being done by ID proponents; there is no organic research program; there is no detailed theoretical explanation of intelligent design as a process. The question then becomes this: Is such a dearth of progress the result of the newness of modern ID (as compared to,say, William Paley's pre-Darwinian ver- sion), or is there an intrinsic reason that a theologically inspired scientific re- search program is an oxymoron? Shear- mur doesn't see why the latter conclu- sion should hold. I can't imagine anyreason why it shouldn't. 28 Volume 35 Issue 6 | Skeptical InquirerThe Hopeless War against Intelligent Design nSI Nov.

The Huf - fington Post reports, \"London UFOs: Multiple People Capture Odd Occur - rence Over British City\" (al though notat the same place and time; see http://tinyurl.com/43qfz4r). The video thatstarted it all, posted by a photographer known only as \"alymc01,\" can be seen at www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDIF- ZwJbF0. We see a lot of seemingly ran- dom (and pointless) filming of people on the street. The camera points sky- ward, and we see some small UFOs and then finally a big one (the \"mother-ship\") moving in and out of the clouds. One has to admit that the video looks pretty cheesy. The big \"mother- ship\" looks a bit like a lens flare, but it does not act like a lens flare; its move- ment is unrelated to that of the camera. At first I thought that the small UFOs were birds, but on closer examination they appear to be generated artifacts. Actually, the video is alymc01's second UFO video. His earlier video (www.you tube.com/watch?v=8nN6mhnD7E0) doesn't look nearly as impressive, so it was largely ignored. There was a great deal of commen- tary, but it did not go beyond comments like \"this looks like a computer-gener- ated fake.\" And strictly speaking, that's enough. After all, the burden of proof is not on the skeptic to show that a video isfake. The burden of proof is on someone who claims it shows unknown crafts to rule out all prosaic explanations. And since the film was posted anonymously, this makes it all the more dubious. Using the terminology of Myth busters, we already know enough to call this video \"busted.\" But also in the spirit of Myth busters , let's not stop there. Let's see if we can really blow this thing apart. British UFOlogist Nick Pope isn't buying the video's authenticity (http:// tinyurl.com/3j2rloy). That's bad for the video, since Pope, currently on tour to promote the DVD release of the Holly -wood space alien movie Battle: Los An- geles, buys a lot of dicey things. But ap- parently this video looks unimpressive even to him. Interest ingly, Pope adds, \"The slightly suspicious thing, though, is it's a part of London where it just so happens that a large number of film companies and visual effects companies are based. And some of the people do look a little bit self-satisfied. So I sus- pect this is a CGI hoax, and that some- one is showcasing their skills.\" A per- ceptive comment! Surprisingly, the most useful com- mentary on this video was found on the UFO and conspiracy-oriented website Above Top Secret (www.abovetopse- cret.com/forum/thread720773/pg1). The forum participants, mostly anony- mous, dug deeply and turned up facts that the \"experts\" seem to have over- looked. Of course, many of the com- ments in that very long thread are cred- ulous and foolish, and I don't want to imply that all of the participants areUFO Mothership and Fleet over London SI Nov.

But I am definitely impressed with a few of them. \"C-Buzz\" commented, \"100% CGI. 1:18-1:22 the object doesn't actually gobehind the clouds, it fades out. Not onlythat, it looks like he stuffed up creatingthis animation because if you have alook at the bottom left there is actuallya lighting effect which probably isn'tsupposed to be there and a RED orb moving across the building.\" It's hard to see, but it's there. There's also a brief\"green flash\" on the building as well as a suspicious-looking red color on the\"mothership.\" I'm not enough of an ex-pert on digital processing to know whatthis means, but it reeks of digital tamper- ing. Sharp eyes, C-Buzz! \"LiveEquation\" posts: The video is a scam right and I have evidence. If you start watching the video at 1:21 you will see two artificial bubble glares and then delay of the UFO glare. The UFO vanishes into the clouds first. Then you see 2 fake bubble glares and the ufo glare movingin the same direction after the UFO has already vanished, delay of about 1 second. It's actually weird that the UFO cast a glare. That's a giveway [sic]. The person who made the video doesn't know jack about optics. \"GiftOfProphecy\" adds, This video is clearly fake. You can prove it by watching the video start-ing at 1:00 and after, and stabilizing the video. You can see they did a hor- rible job motion tracking the camera movement ... probably because they have a rolling shutter camera. If you watch the UFO you can see it is notshaking with the camera perfectly, it is shaking independently. However the \"UFO\" is shaking [at] the same rate and nearly the same magnitude,its direction and position are just not synchronized. That to me indicates several bad motion track points. Inorder to insert a fake UFO into the video they had to track certain pixels as they move and shake around, thenapply that tracking to the UFO so itmoves exactly the same as the camera (match moving). Sometimes the pix- els will move, say 10 pixels in one di- rection, yet the computer detected the pixels move 12 pixels, and that creates a bad tracking point. Norm -ally you can fix bad tracking points by hand, but when there is about 30 tracking points per second, it be -comes very time consuming. If you apply the motion tracks to the UFOwhen it has bad track points, it will wobble and shake around similar towhat you see in the video. \"Charlyv\" noted, \"Fake, stop action in frames shows no motion blur, Im pos - sible for such recorded speeds in anyconsumer digital camera, regardless ofmake or resolution.\" Then \"davespan- ners\" opens up a whole new angle of in-vestigation: \"This is filmed outside coral bookmakers in clipstone / great portlandstreet in London. If you google search that building You will eventually findthis page [http://ny.beam.tv/who-we-a re/the-mill], which is a tv productioncompany that is in the very same build-ing.\" Dave spanners then goes on toquote from the company's website: \"The Mill creates pioneering visual effects forthe advertising, music, television and film in dustries.

In fact, it's neither, as we willsee. This story was accompanied by an equally dreadful video (www.youtube .com/watch?v=WwLhXmnbtTM). Now the buildings in the video are obviously real because the details are quite sharp. Mirages are very different. Mirages are not something imaginary or dream-like. They are a perfectly real phenomenon of meteorological optics:the behavior of light in the atmosphere, where temperatures can often vary dra- matically, result in different indices of refraction and hence non-straight lightpaths\u2014think of a fun house mirror. Mirage images are never as detailed as these Chinese images because the dif- ferent atmospheric layers are not stable enough to preserve details like that. Furthermore, mirage images always bring into view objects many miles dis- tant, not close up like in this video. There are two different kinds of mi- rages, superior and inferior. The in feriormirage is caused by cooler air overlay- ing much warmer air, creating imagesthat appear lower than they actually are. It is by far the most common. Usually it results in a strip of the sky seeming to bend downward below the horizon. It's often seen on highways on hot days, looking like distant water. The superior mirage is more in teresting, and rarer, as objects appear higher than they actually are, resulting in things becoming visible that are normally beyond the curvature of the earth. That Chinese \"ghost city\" is neither type of mirage .Typically with a superior mirage you will see a double horizon: an often slanted false horizon on top, with the actual horizon belowit. The region between them represents a mirage image of distant water. The Weather Doctor has a pretty good ex- planation of mirages (see http://tiny url.com/3rvko5n). When I was a student at North- western University my dorm roomfaced Lake Michigan. The double hori-zon of the superior mirage was actually a fairly common sight in the spring- time, when warmer air would blow in from the south over the still quite frigidlake. At night, images of lights of citiesin Indiana and Michi gan normallybelow the horizon would occasionallybecome visible. Similarly, people stand-ing on the lakeshore in southwestMichigan periodically re port seeing dramatic nighttime UFOs over thewater\u2014they are probably seeing mirageimages of the lights of Chicago pop into view. Any reporter worthy of that title would have followed through and de- termined exactly what was being seen: which buildings those were in the video and their location. Certainly at leastsome people who live in that area would be able to identify those build- ings and show on a map exactly whereeach building is. If you are in Huan shanCity and you speak Chinese or have an interpreter, how difficult would it be tointerview people to find out exactly which buildings are being seen in thevideo and where those buildings are lo- cated, thus solving the \"mystery\"? Aus- tralian photographer and film producer Auki Henry did exactly that (seehttp://tinyurl.com/3jnqkzk). He says,\"The reality was bad Chinese transla- tion combined with hyper-sensational- ist reporting. All the buildings in the footage are real buildings, not visions, mirages or illusions, they actually phys-ically stand exactly where they were filmed. The only thing out of the ordi- nary here is they are surrounded by floodwater and mist.\" Henry has nailed down every signif- icant detail. He gives us a map showing the location of each of the \"ghost\" buildings. And as far as I can tell he didit without even going to China or in- terviewing anyone there. The Xin'an River was at flood stage, and the waters generated fog that obscured the bottom parts of the building, making the tops of the buildings appear to be floating in air. And there's your big mystery solved. Why is it that no reporter bothered to do his or her job and get to the bot- tom of this story? News reporters don't want to get facts. They want to get ratings.And why let mere facts get in the way of a great story?Why is it that no reporter bothered to do his or her job and get to the bottom of this story?

Asuccessful marketing campaign can be scarily effective\u2014make a claim enough times and people will believe it. Then just take the claimfor granted; it becomes something every - one knows and no one questions. Back it up with some \"sciencey\" razzle-dazzle and link it to a combination of fear and hope, and you can have an entire indus-try based on nothing but marketinghype. Take antioxidants (or rather, don't take them): if you believe the hype, thenyou want them in your food; you wantto take them as pills; and you want the maximum most powerful antioxidants that canbe found in nature (especially from some obscure tropical fruit). Unfortu- nately, the evidence does not support the claim that there are any health ben- efits to taking antioxidants. The theory behind antioxidant claims sounds very compelling. Oxi dants arechemicals (free radicals, also called reac- tive oxygen species or ROS) that are the products of metabolism; they are highlyreactive and can cause damage to pro-teins and cells. This damage is a majorcontributor to aging and disease. Antiox- idants neutralize these free radicals and prevent damage. Unfortunately, medical science is rarely so clean and simple. This nicestory is true, as far as it goes (the best lies always contain a kernel of truth).Twenty years ago this was the state of our knowledge of ROS and antioxi- dants, and there was legitimate hope that antioxidants would be a useful therapeutic tool. However, as research continued we learned that the picture is more complex: The body has evolved a natural defense against the onslaught ofROS. These compounds are called free radical scavengers or antioxidants (suchas the protein superoxide dismutase andsome vitamins like C and E) and their job is to gobble up ROS before they can damage cells. In addition, some ROS actually serve a purpose in the body, for example as signals to cells or as neurotransmittersHave You Had Your Antioxidants Today? SI Nov. Dec 11_SI new design masters 9/27/11 12:43 PM Page 32Skeptical Inquirer | November / December 2011 33(nitric oxide). In fact, the body has evolved a balanced and complex system to maintain homeostasis between ROS and antioxidants. Influencing that sys-tem by taking large amounts of exoge-nous antioxidants may not be such agood idea. In other words, if a balancebetween ROS and antioxidants has e -volved, there is no reason to believe that there are any benefits to tipping the scales in one direction\u2014toward antiox- idants. In fact, doing so may cause harm. What does the actual clinical evi- dence show? Well, to find out we haveto go claim by claim. The best current evidence shows that antioxidant vitamins are of no use in im- proving cognitive function or in prevent-ing dementia (Gray et al. 2008). If welook at other specific neurodegenerative diseases, the picture is a bit more com- plex. Some studies show that vitamin E (but not C) may slightly re duce the risk of motor neuron disease, but only in women (Wang et al. 2011). Overall, the evidence is ambiguous and does not sup- port a benefit for treatment. In Parkinson's disease (PD) the pic- ture is more complex. There is some ev-idence that eating foods rich in vitamin E may help prevent PD, but taking vi- tamin E supplements does not. So per- haps it is something other than the vi- tamin E in these foods that is of benefit, or perhaps eating healthy foods in gen- eral is simply a marker for some othervariable that protects against PD. Other studies show a benefit from taking the vitamin supplements but not changing diet (Miyake et al. 2011). In other words, the evidence is ambiguous. It is reasonable to conduct further research into antioxidants and degen- erative diseases. Current evidence is mixed, without any clear benefit, but there is enough positive preliminary ev- idence to continue to study the poten- tial of antioxidants in preventing de-generative diseases. The evidence for taking antioxidant supplements in the general populationis also less than definitive. In addition, it actually suggests the potential for harm. A comprehensive review pub- lished in 2008 concluded: \"We foundno evidence to sup- plements or secondary pre- vention. Vitamin A, beta-carotene, andvitamin E may increase mortality\" (Bje-lakovic et al. 2008). That's right\u2014there might be an in - creased risk of death from taking vita- mins A and E. The data is far from de- finitive, but it shows that we cannotassume that supplements, even vita-mins, are harmless. It also shows that we need to be humble with our simplis- tic theories of biology. Until the re- search has had time to fully explore a biological question, we should not be confident in our extrapolations to clin- ical effect. Therefore, even when the theory sounds good, we always need todo clinical studies to see what the net effects are in humans. When it comes to antioxidants, there is still the potential that they may be useful in specific situations. At present, however, there is no evidence to supportgoing out of your way to eat lots of an- tioxidants in food or to take antioxidant supplements. In fact, doing so may be harmful. This evidence is at odds with the overwhelming marketing hype thathas successfully created an irrational de-mand for a dubious product. n References: Bjelakovic, G., D. Nikolova, L.L.

Thispoignant film features several desperatefamilies that want nothing more than tosave their children's lives by helping themto escape their local schools. Although Guggenheim is a liberal private-sector union member himself, his movie highlights the ominous role of public-sector teachers unions in pro- tecting bad educators and their perverse rules. Also emphasized is their stubborn opposition to charter schools and, worst of all, their tendency to make construc- tive change gallingly difficult. Superman also highlights the infa- mous \"Rubber Rooms\" of New York City. Beginning in 2009, these Tem - porary Reassignment Centers quar- tered more than seven hundred teachers considered too incompetent to re main in class. They didn't teach, of course, but they arrived at and departed from the Rubber Rooms every day at the regular time, as if they were still earning their living. They were paid full salaries with full benefits. They had vacations and summers off. In salary and benefits alone, these defective teachers siphoned between$35 million and $65 million per year from their city's already impoverished school budget\u2014a lot of money that could have been spent on children. Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Chan - cellor Klein tried to detach them from the payroll, but state tenure laws, re- strictive collective bargaining contracts, and the United Federation of Teach- ers\u2014which dared to compare its mem- bers' Rubber Rooms to the prisons at Guantanamo\u2014made such a common- sense solution impossible. How could this happen in a com- munity that truly values education? \"The New York City school district isThe Effect of Teachers Unions on Student Performance SI Nov. Dec 11_SI new design masters 9/28/11 11:17 AM Page 34Skeptical Inquirer | November / December 2011 35not organized to provide the best pos- sible education to its children,\" argues Terry Moe, professor of political sci-ence at Stanford University and seniorfellow at the Hoover Institution (Moe2011). Instead, thanks to union-influ- enced legislation and the contemptiblerules contained in the collective bar-gaining contract, \"the district is literallyorganizedto protect bad teachers and to undermine the efforts of leaders to en- sure teacher quality.\" Today, the National Education As - so ciation (NEA) and American Federa -tion of Teachers (AFT) are 4.5 millionmembers strong and clearly the most powerful interest groups in Amer icaneducation, perhaps in all of politics. Union dues alone provide them with as- tounding sums of cash for campaigncontributions and lobbying strategies.They rank first among the top twenty-five all-time donors in federal elections. For example, they contributed $59,354 -,731\u201495 percent of which went to De- mocrats\u2014between 1989 and 2010. During the 2010 election cycle alone, the NEA spent $40 million, giving $2million directly to Democratic candi- dates. At the same time, the AFTawarded $2.6 million to Democrats compared to $8,000 to Republicans. They send armies of well-trained ac- tivists to every political district in thecountry. At any time, they can financehighly effective media campaigns on anytopic or for any candidate they like. \"Noother group in the politics of education,\"Moe laments, \"representing administra-tors, say, or school boards or disadvan- taged kids or parents or taxpayers, even comes close to having such weaponry.\" So how much of this power is ever converted into policies that actually benefit education? Unions do cause in- creased spending, but money per sehas little if any effect on student achieve- ment. While student test scores since 1970 haven't budged, we've spent more than twice as many inflation-adjusted dollars on every child. Unions fight hard for across-the- board teacher pay raises, but who loseswhen bad teachers are paid more andgood teachers less than their actualworth? Politically powerless children, of course. Unions love smaller class sizes, too\u2014but contrary to popular belief, normal class size reductions have almost no impact on student learning. \"The unions pursue their own inter- ests,\" Moe confirms, \"and policies good for the unions are often bad for kids\" (Moe 2006). Let's glance at just a few of the diktats that typically show up in collective bargaining contracts: Arguably, the most maddening rules require that teachers be paid on a salaryschedule, based on years of experience and education\u2014never on performance.Other rules make it nearly impossibleto dismiss teachers for poor performanceand mandate complex, time-consuminggrievance procedures. Some require prin- cipals to give advance warn ing to teach- ers before visiting their classrooms and allow teachers, not principals, to make decisions about transfers and class assignments. The rules also limit the number and duration of faculty meetings and parentconferences that teachers can be re- quired to attend and the number of minutes teachers can be required to beon campus. They guarantee teachers acertain amount of \"prep time\" away from their students and restrict teachers'non-teaching duties, including lunch duty and hall duty. They also give teach-ers time off for union purposes. Unions may claim what's good for teachers is good for students, but most people, Moe guesses, \"would be ab-solutely shocked\" to know what's reallylurking in the collective bargainingcontracts that govern their kids' educa- tion and determine their futures. How Do Teachers Unions Affect Student Performance? \"I find that teachers' unions are primarily rent seeking, raising school budgets and school inputs but lowering student achieve - ment by decreasing the productivity of inputs.\" \u2014Caroline Hoxby, professor of labor economics at Harvard University in 1996 The professional, peer-reviewed litera- ture has remained frustratingly silent onthe issue of how unions affect student performance. Fortunately, however, twodistrict- and school-level studies\u2014as op- posed to those at the state level, whichtend to be highly aggregated and poorlycontrolled\u2014have been published in top-quality academic journals. Each con-cludes that collective bargaining for teachers has a significantly negativeeffect on student performance. Unions fight hard for across-the-board teacher pay raises, but who loses when bad teachers are paid more and good teachers less than their actual worth? Politically powerless children, of course.SI Nov. Dec 11_SI new design masters 9/27/11 12:43 PM Page 3536 Volume 35 Issue 6 | Skeptical InquirerThe first was a national study pub- lished by Caroline Hoxby, who set out to explain three related \"empirical puz- zles\" (Hoxby 1996). First, and most gen- erally, why did school inputs (govern-ment spending) have a significant effecton student outputs (performance) priorto around 1960\u2014when states began granting teachers the right to collectively bargain\u2014but not after that time? Second, why do the data continue to show no relationship between school inputs and student learning, even aftercontrolling for students' socio-eco-nomic background? Third, why dometropolitan areas with few opportu-nities for competition among publicschools tend to show more generous in- puts (for example, higher per-pupil spending, higher teacher salaries, andlower student-to-teacher ratios) yetpoorer student performance? Hoxby initially noted the precise timing of legislation facilitating teacherunionization and collective bargaining.She then analyzed district data from across the United States\u2014on student dropout rates in particular\u2014to isolate the impact of union activity on student performance. As the above quote suggests, Hoxby discovered that teachers unions produce two highly regrettable effects: they cause taxpayers to spend more on education and, at the same time, they decrease school productivity. In other words, the overall impact of unions on society and education is decisively negative. Unions use their political power and the process of collective bargaining to waste our money. Somewhat incidentally, in a later study Hoxby and Andrew Leigh from the National Bureau of Economic Re -search explored why, since 1960, the share of teachers in the highest aptitude category (top 5 percent of all collegegrads) fell from 5 percent to 1 percent, and the share of teachers in the lowest aptitude category (bottom 25 percent of all college grads) rose from 16 to 36 per- cent (Hoxby and Leigh 2004). Initially, Hoxby and Leigh expected to prove the \"pull\" hypothesis, propos-ing that increasing pay parity with men in non-teaching occupations began to draw women out of teaching. But the evidence proved otherwise. Instead, smart people were being \"pulled\" out of education because of increasing com- pression of teachers' pay. Good, bad, or ugly, all teachers are essentially treated alike. Why? Because unions not onlydefend ineffective teachers, they rou- tinely oppose merit pay for exceptional teachers. Unions and collective bargain- ing, Hoxby and Leigh discovered, de- serve much of the blame for the dumb- ing-down of educators as well as theirhapless students. But Terry Moe would publish the second and most revealing study on point. Therein, he addressed the issue from an entirely new angle. Using alarge, random sample of California school districts\u2014all engaged in collec-tive bargaining\u2014Moe carefully probed the actual contents of the resulting labor contracts (Moe 2009). He then coded the many rules con- tained in the agreements according to their \"restrictiveness,\" the degree to which they shackled the hands of school administrators\u2014precisely the people we elect to ensure quality edu- cation. The most restrictive rules, by Moe's estimation, gave teachers the right to make voluntary transfers (thus denying administrators the opportuni- ties to send good teachers where they are needed most), limited the number of students that teachers were required to instruct, and thwarted the teacher evaluation process. Finally, Moe applied a second vari- able: the California Academic Per form - ance Index, which assigns each schoola score determined by the performance of its students. He then framed the issue concisely as such: \"Whether, in using their power to secure rules that advance the occupational interests of their members, the teachers unions are (unintentionally) limiting the public schools' capacity to educate children.\" After controlling for variables per- taining to student backgrounds and the traits of particular schools and districts,Moe concluded that \"collective bargain- ing does indeed have negative conse- quences for student achievement, andthat the effects are concentrated on pre- cisely those districts and schools\u2014large districts, high-minority schools\u2014that, over the years have been the worst per- formers and most difficult to improve.\" So, although almost everyone suffers because of teachers unions and collec- tive bargaining rights, minority kids confined to big cities suffer the most. \"It follows,\" Moe adds hopefully, \"that efforts to boost achievement in these contexts, as well as to reduce theachievement gap between whites and minorities, need to recognize that col- lective bargaining may be part of the problem\u2014and that it deserves to be taken seriously as a target of reform.\" Short of actually abolishing teacher col- lective bargaining rights, he advises that \"reducing the restrictiveness of labor contracts could have significant payoffs for public education.\" The social stakes are astronomically high in public education. Parents andstudents should guard themselves against teachers unions' many excesses, andAmerica can no longer tolerate educa- tional mediocrity. Yes, we should reward effective educators who in crease their students' success. But teachers must ac-cept effective performance standards and the real-world pressures that attend them. In an upcoming column, I'll ad- dress reform in teacher compensation and accountability. n References: Hoxby, C.M. 1996. How teachers' unions affect education production.

The world is full of dangerous toxins, New Agers claim, andin order to get healthy and \"balanced\"(whatever that means) you need to peri- odically remove impurities from your body. \"High Co lonic Irrigation ColonCleans ing\" is said to remove contami- nants and detoxify your intestines for\"improved health, more active lifestyle,and a more enjoyable, exciting life,\" ac-cording to one typical website. Thenthere's the old-fashioned toxin removalmethod of sweating\u2014though, Inquiree\"column (\"Sweating the Small Stuff,\" SI,May/June 2010), contrary to popular be- lief sweat does not actually remove tox- ins. And don't forget ear candling, abogus procedure by which ear wax and toxins are supposedly drawn out of the ear using a lit, hollow candle tube (see \"On Ear Cones and Candling,\" SI, Sep- tember/October 2000). Actually, the human body does a pretty good job of eliminating toxins on its own. Virtually all products claiming to cleanse and detoxify the body are worthless and unnecessary. Still, that doesn't stop their being marketed, and Kinoki foot pads are one of the mostpopular in recent years. Kinoki promotional literature de- scribes how the large, adhesive band- ages work: Formulated in Japan using all-nat- ural tree extracts and powerful nega- tive ions to rid the body of harmful toxins, this foot pad works on the principle of foot reflexology. Simply place the pads on the soles of yourfeet (or a targeted body part such as the shoulder or knee) before going to bed. By morning the pad will have absorbed toxins accumulated in your body from pollution, radiation expo- sure, etc., turning the white pad to a shade from gray to black. The Kinoki pads remove \"heavy metals, metabolic wastes, toxins, parasites, chem- icals, and cellulite\" from the body. No need for expensive liposuction or plasticsurgery: the pads remove cellulite! And since they absorb radiation, they can apparently also be used in the event of nuclear accidents, like the one that dev-astated Japan earlier this year. How exactly this is done is never ex- plained. How do the pads know which of the body's countless chemicals (many of them crucial for good health) to re- move? Furthermore, even if the pads worked as described they couldn't leach out enough toxins or heavy metals tomake a difference. For those not impressed by the plen- tiful testimonials, perhaps the most ef-fective sales tool is the pads themselves, which do indeed turn unappetizing col- ors within a day or two of being placedon the body. All that black, disgustingcolor must be toxins coming from some- where, right? Well, maybe not. One writer, Chris Wool ston (2008) of the Los Angeles Times, did a little \"not-quite sci- entific experiment: I put a few drops of sterile saline solution on a fresh pad. The result: a dark-gray, unsightly mess that looked exactlylike the pads I'd beenpulling off my feet. Either moisture alone can discolor the pads or the salineindustry has some explaining to do. The pads also turned dark after a few min- utes near a warm fireplace.\" If people feel better after using the Kinoki pads, it's for the same reason that people feel better after using other dis- credited devices like magnetic in soles or Power Band bracelets: the placebo effect. People subjectively re port feeling better after getting any treatment, whether ef- fective or sham. Kinoki pads may notleach toxins from your feet, but they do leach money from your wallet. n Reference Woolston, Chris. 2008. Kinoki foot pads' detox claims don't stand up to science.

Hagen Q: A:SI Nov. 9/27/11 12:43 PM Page 37Now, there are serious, scholarly questions relating to Shakespeare's authorship, as I learned while doing graduate work at the University of Kentucky and teaching an under- graduate course, Survey of English Literature. For a chapter of my dissertation, I investigated the questioned attribution of the play Periclesto see whether it was a collaborative effort (as some scholars suspected, seeing a disparity in style be- tween the first portion, acts I and II, and the remainder) or\u2014as I found, taking an innovative approach\u2014entirelywritten by Shakespeare (see Nickell 1987, 82-108). How- ever, such literary analysis is quite different from the efforts of the anti-Stratfordians, who are mostly nonacademics and, according to one critic (Keller 2009, 1-9), \"pseudo-scholars.\" Could a mere commoner have been the greatest and most admired play- wright of the English language? In- deed, could a \"near-illiterate\" have amassed the \"encyclopedic\" knowledge that fills page after page of plays and poetry attrib-uted to William Shakespeare of Stratford- upon-Avon? Those known as \"anti-Strat - fordians\" insist the works were penned by another, one more worthy in their estima- tion, as part of an elaborate conspiracy that may even involve secret messages en- crypted in the text.Anti-Stratfordians start with the answer they want and work backward to the evidence\u2014the opposite of good science and scholarship. They reverse the standards of objective inquiry, replacing them with pseudoscience and pseudohistory.Much Ado about Nothing SI Nov. Dec 11_SI new design masters 9/27/11 12:43 PM Page 38Skeptical Inquirer | November / December 2011 39Through-the-Looking-Glass Syndrome Like many other crank ideas and conspiracy theories, the no- tion that William Shakespeare did not write the plays and poems attributed to him may at first sight seem absurd. But step through the looking glass (to use Lewis Carroll's term) and adopt the farfetched premise, and things can look very different. By thus starting with the answer and working back- ward to the evidence\u2014the opposite of the ap proaches of sci-ence and scholarship\u2014one can seemingly reverse the burdenof proof and mirror the development of a viable hypothesis. I call this process the Through-the-Looking-Glass Syn- drome because the individual who suffers from such a bout ofcontagion has entered a realm in which the very standards ofobjective inquiry are effectively reversed, becoming their super-ficial lookalikes: pseudoscience, pseudohistory, and so on. People are drawn into this illusory world, it appears to me, by something other than impartial reason. Having investi- gated questionable claims for more than four decades, I have marveled at how certain persons have walked, been lured, or stumbled headlong into some strange but profound belief. For example, time and again someone has been so attracted to the \"haunting\" image on the Shroud of Turin that he will not accept it as the red-ocher (iron-oxide) pigmented work of a confessed fourteenth-century artist, which has been con- firmed by microchemical tests and radiocarbon dating. Wish- fully believing that the cloth really wrapped the body of Jesus in the tomb, he sees the forger's confession as false, the iron- oxide as a contaminant, and the carbon-dating as an error re- sulting perhaps from a burst of radiant energy that altered the carbon ratio at the moment of Christ's miraculous resur- rection (Hoare 1994; cf. Nickell 1998).Countless more could be given. Anthropologist Grover Krantz believed that Bigfoot\u2014indeed as portrayed in the famously faked Roger Patterson \"Bigsuit\" film of 1967\u2014was the surviving giant ape Giganto pithecus. Harvard psychiatrist John Mack ignored evidence of his patients' fan- tasy proneness and \"waking dreams\" to suggest they had been abducted by aliens. And Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, creator of the rationalist detective Sherlock Holmes, was easily duped both by s\u00e9ance trickery and 2007, 251-58; Nickell 1994, 153, 175-76). As we see, many of the proponents of such ideas are quite intelligent. How ever, it seems that\u2014just as in jujitsu when one's large size becomes a liability once one has been thrown off balance\u2014a person's own intelligence can work againsthim when he is under the spell of the Through-the-Look- ing-Glass Syndrome: the intelligent person may be able to think up rationalizations and theoretical complexities of breathtaking cleverness, fooling first himself, then others. So it is with the Shake speare-wasn't-written-by-Shakespeare minions, as we shall see. Stage Left: The Baconians For nearly two centuries after his death, Shakespeare went unquestioned as the author of the plays and poems bearing his name. The first recorded doubter was a Reverend James Wilmot who\u2014having undertaken to write a biography of the Bard but being unable to turn up a single original manuscript in Stratford\u2014expressed his suspicions to a Quaker acquain- tance, who re ported them to his local Philo sophical Society in Ipswich in 1805. In 1848, Colonel Joseph C. Hart pub- by Joe NickellSI Nov. Dec 11_SI new design masters 9/27/11 12:44 PM Page 3940 Volume 35 Issue 6 | Skeptical Inquirerlished a book on seafaring that also included his notions on various other topics. Hart despised Shakespeare, whom he ac cused of buying or stealing plays that he \"first spiced with ob-scenity, blackguardism and impurities before they were pro-duced\"; he felt the admirable portions, such as Hamlet's solilo-quies, were attributable to another (Keller 2009, 138-41). The first book-length assault on the Bard was launched in 1857 by a woman named Delia Bacon. Her 675-page The Phi- losophy of the Plays of Shakspere Unfolded cast Shakespeare as \"a stupid, ignorant, third-rate player\" in a \"dirty, doggish group of players.\" Surely he could not have written the great works bear-ing his name, she concluded. Rather, Bacon (the sister of Congre gational minister Leonard Bacon) be lieved the worksmust have been produced by a secret society of literary figureswith Sir Walter Raleigh (1552-1618) as head and Sir Francis Bacon (1561-1626) as guiding light. She believed, wrongly, that she was descended from the latter. So fanatical was Delia Bacon that she once spent a troubled night, armed with lanternand spade, at Shake speare's grave in Stratford's Holy Trinity Church planning to literallydig for answers. Believing she had deciphered cryptic messages in Francis Bacon's letters thatpointed to certain secrets\u2014perhaps even manuscripts\u2014hiddenin a hollow be neath the gravestone, she fully intended to ex-cavate but then struggled with her supposed evidence and fi- nally lost her nerve. She died insane at age forty-eight (Keller2009, 141-42; Schoen baum 1991, 385-94). Delia Bacon had set the stage, as it were, for subsequent \"Baconians\"\u2014those who became convinced Sir Francis Bacon had indeed written as \"Shakespeare.\" Enter a Min- nesota crank named Ignatius T. Donnelly, who had previously \"proved\" that both Aztecs and Egyptians descended from a race that inhabited the (imaginary) \"lost continent\" of At- lantis. Donnelly pored over a copy of Shakespeare's complete plays, the 1623 First Folio (see figure 1), and divined certainmathematical formulas (involving a set of \"basic numbers\" and \"factor numbers\") that let him \"decipher\" supposed mes- sages from the text. When the result was gibberish, as it often was, Donnelly modified the rules, which made cryptogra- phers quick to laugh at his approach. \"They pointed out,\" ex- plains code master Fletcher Pratt (1942, 87), \"that his rules for solution were practically all variables, and that his solutionin fact consisted of finding whatever words he wished to make up part of his 'decipherment' and then finding somecombination of basic numbers and factor-numbers thatwould yield the desired result. Given so many variables it is possible to extract almost any message from a wordage as large as Shakespeare's. ...\" Nevertheless, other Baconians followed. Orville Ward Owen, a physician in Detroit, caught the bug and spent the remainder of his life utilizing his own supposedly improved method of decipherment. One of Owen's divined Baconian messages urged, \"Take your knife and cut all our books asun-der, And set the leaves on a great firm wheel/ which rolls androlls.\" Inspired, Owen constructed two massive reels, turned by (appropriately) a crank, which unrolled a thousand-foot canvas. Mounted in rows on this were the printed pages of text from Shakespeare, Bacon, and others. Owen or a mem- ber of his three-woman staff operated the machine using\"key\" words to extricate text dictated to a typist. In time Owen published five of his six volumes of Sir Francis Bacon's Cipher Story. Still later he received communications from Bacon's ghost (Schoenbaum 1991, 411-13). Owen's secretary, Elizabeth Wells Gallup, next launched her own unique method of deciphering Bacon's supposedly concealed messages. She in fact employed a \"biliteral cipher\"actually invented by Bacon. (One of the ciphers I studied asa budding cryptanalyst of about twelve, it employs two fontsof printing type, say, roman and italic, which we can designate aand b. The text that will carry the secret text is marked off in five-letter units, so that the letter Acan be represented by aaaaa, Bby aaaab, and so on [see Gaines 1956, 6-7].) Unfortunately, Gallup's supposed decipherments were subjected to detailed analysis, most thoroughly by the famousAmerican code experts Colonel William and Elizabeth Fried man, with devastating results. The type of Elizabethantimes bore imperfections, became battered, was often mixed indiscriminately, which\u2014coupled with the effect of roughpaper and other factors\u2014meant that \"differences\" in type could easily be found, even where none existed (Pratt 1942, 90-91). As Shakespearean scholar Samuel Schoenbaum(1991, 419) says of Gallup, \"What she had discovered was Delia Bacon that she once spent a troubled night, armed with lantern and spade, at Shake speare's grave in Stratford's Holy Trinity Church planning to literally dig for answers.SI Nov. Dec 11_SI new design masters 9/27/11 12:44 PM Page 40Skeptical Inquirer | November / December 2011 41the revealed text bore words that were not in use until after Bacon's death. Gallup did admit, at one point, that to distin-guish between a and btypefaces, it was necessary to use \"in- tuition\" (Pratt 1942, 91-92). The entire quest of the Baconi-ans to find secret texts in Shake speare's writings isreminiscent of journalist Michael Drosnin's The Bible Code books (1997; 2002), which tout \"predictions\" of modern events that were allegedly \"encoded\" in the Hebrew Bibleabout three thousand years ago. (See Thomas 2003 for a re-buttal.) Marlowe et al. Although there is no convincing evidence that Bacon ever wrote a single play, there were many adherents to the Bacon-as- Shakespeare \"theory.\" How ever, that conviction was eventuallyfollowed by a Marlovian craze\u2014the belief that Christopher Marlowe (1564-1593), the greatest Elizabethan dramatist prior to Shakespeare, penned \"Shakespeare.\" The fact that Marlowe was killed in a tavern fight before the majority of the Bard's plays had been written did not faze the Marlovians. Havingstepped through the looking glass, their chief advocate, a Broad- way press agent named Calvin Hoffman, conjured up an expla-nation. Marlowe's death, Hoffman imagined, was staged by killing some foreign sailor in his stead, while Marlowe fled via Franceto Italy where he began to write plays before eventually return- ing to England in disguise. Everything was supposedly arranged by his aristocratic gay lover who hired an actor, Will Shake -speare, to allow his name to grace the manuscript. This imag-ined scenario was, said the Times Literary Supple ment (January Figure 1. The 1623 First Folio of Shakespeare's complete works.SI Nov. Dec 11_SI new design masters 9/27/11 12:44 PM Page 4142 Volume 35 Issue 6 | Skeptical Inquirer24, 1956), \"a tissue of twaddle,\" but surely the reviewer was being too kind (Schoenbaum 1991, 445-47). Beyond Marlowe, some seventy other candidates have been proposed, ranging from Sir Walter Raleigh, CardinalWolsey, and Ben Jonson to various earls\u2014of Darby, of Essex,of Rutland, and, of course, of Southamp ton (the latter havingbeen Shakespeare's patron)\u2014and even Queen 1993, 15-20; Keller 2009, 135-36 Schoenbaum 1991, 395-404). Then there is the seventeenth Earl of Ox-ford, the current favorite of the anti-Stratfordians. The Earl of Oxford In 1920, an English schoolmaster with the unfortunate name J. Thomas Looney published his \"Shakespeare\" Identified, set- ting forth the claim that the seventeenth Earl of Oxford, Ed- ward de Vere (1550-1604), was the true author of the plays and poems bearing Shakespeare's name. Intellec tually naive, the book unsurprisingly attracted many followers. The Loonies adopted \"Oxford\" as their standard bearer even though he had died before King Lear, Macbeth, Antony and Cleopatra, and several other plays were performed. They postu- late that scholars misdated Learand Macbethand that the other plays, having been left unfinished, were subsequently completed by inferior dramatists (Schoenbaum 1991, 430-34). Their evidence for Oxford as author is as questionable as their belief is impassioned. They discovered, for example, in a 1578 address to Oxford by fellow poet Gabriel Harvey, atell-tale clue: Harvey says, \"Thine eyes flash fire, thy will spears...\" [emphasis added]\u2014an unmistakable refer- ence to the Bard! Unfortunately, this is a rogue translation ofthe Latin, which really just says, \"Thine eyes flash fire. Thycountenance shakes a spear\" (Keller 2009, 162-64). One Oxfordian of the 1940s even enlisted the aid of a spir- itualist. The medium used \"automatic writing\" to link Shake- speare, Bacon, and Oxford, who supposedly had collaborated to produce the plays (Wilson 1993, 19-20). Oxfordians believe the Earl of Ox ford adopted \"William Shakespeare\" as a pen name. That the hy phenated version is used for about half of the quarto editions of the plays led one recent Oxfordian, Charles Ogborn Jr., to write in 2009, \"When we come upon a regularly hyphenated English namecompounding two words not in themselves names and also descriptive of an action, we may be sure that the name is fic-titious and intended to be understood as of allegorical signif-icance.\" This is absurd and begs the question, why then was not the hyphenated spelling used for all printed versions ofthe plays? In fact, creative phonetic spelling was common inShakespeare's time, as evidenced, for example, by such differ-ent versions as Will, Willm, William, Willel mum, etc., and Shack spere, Shaxpere, Shake spear, Shake-speare, and Shakespeare; elevendifferent versions of Christopher Marlowe's surname (Keller2009, 156-57). In 1987 a moot-court debate on the Oxford-versus- Shakespeare controversy was held at the American Uni - versity. It was presided over by three U.S. Supreme Court Jus-tices: Harry Blackmun, William Brennan, and John Paul Stevens. They found in favor of Shakespeare, and Justice Stevens pointedly concluded that \"the Oxfordian case suffers from not having a single, coherent theory of the case\" (qtd. in Bethell 1991, 47). Will the Real Shakespeare... Or this heading could read, \"Will, the real Shakespeare.\" Although the anti-Stratfordians savage Shakespeare (but resent any criticism of themselves or their candidate for au- thorship), the fact is that there is no proof (innuendo and co-incidence and mystery mongering are not proof) that \"Shakespeare\" was written by anyone other than William Shake speare. And there is much evidence that he was indeed the author. The famous individual of that name was a historical person- age born at Stratford in 1564 and christened (ac cording to theHoly Trinity Church baptismal - mus filius Johannes Shak spere\"\u2014that is, of John Shak spere\" (Schoenbaum 1991, 7-8). While there is no record of Shake speare attending Strat- ford's gram mar school, there is no record of anyone doing so prior to the nineteenth century (Matus 1991, 66); old recordsare frequently incomplete or missing (as I learned during my years as a certified geneaological specialist). A marriage license was issued on November 27, 1582, to \"Willelmum Shaxpere etThe fact is that there is no proof (innuendo and coincidence and mystery mongering are not proof) that \"Shakespeare\" was written by anyone other than William Shake speare.SI Nov.

In 1592 Robert Green alerted his fellow dramatists toShakespeare as a young literary encroacher, calling him ... an upstart Crow, beautified with our feathers, that with his Tiger's heart wrapped in a Player's hide [quoting from Shake speare's Henry VI1] supposes he is as well able to bom- bast out a blank verse [un rhymed iambic pentameter] as the best of you: and being an absolute Johannes fac totum [Jack- of-all-trades], is in his own conceit the only Shake-scene inthe country. The pun on his name, coupled with the readily identifiable line, represents the earliest mention of Shakespeare as an actor and playwright (Wilson 1993, 124-25). Additional evidence reveals the continuing life of a very real person: For instance, Shakespeare is by no means without back- ground documentation, albeit mostly of a dry-as-dust legal variety. With occasional exceptions, the christenings, mar- riages and deaths of the close members of his family are all to be found in the still-extant registers of his home parish church, Holy Trinity, Stratford-upon-Avon. As record of his life as a successful working actor, his name appears high in Ben Jonson's First Folio's cast lists of the performances of some of Jonson's plays by Shakespeare's company. In the case of some, but by no means all, of Shakespeare's plays as pub- lished in his lifetime, his name is linked with them formally both on the title page and on the surviving official register of the Stationers' Company, the official trade union of the book- sellers and printers of his time. London Public Record Office documents show him to have acted as witness in a court case, complete with his authenticated signature to this effect. Also in London's Public Record Office and elsewhere are to be found deeds of his property dealings (with two more of his signatures), the wills of his London fellow actors and Strat- ford friends, which include some kindly remembrances of him, and his own will, the latter of which bears the final three of the six signatures generally agreed as authentically his.(Wilson 1993, 9) William Shakespeare died about April 23, 1616, and was buried on April 25. In 1623 the famous First Folio of his plays, collected by fellow actors John Heminges and Henry Condell, was published (again, see figure 1), showing a body of work so impressive that many believe it must be the work not of a commoner but an aristocrat. How did the Bard acquire the vast learning shown in his writings? Shake speare's inherent genius would have been sup- plemented by a serious education in grammar school (where he would have learned some Latin and Greek) and later resi-dence in London, Britain's intellectual center, where he obvi- ously read omnivorously. Himself an actor, as well as a share-holder in an acting company and a theater, he befriended many playwrights, poets, scholars, travelers, gentlemen, and others(Keller 2009, 12, 271)\u2014sources of knowledge indeed. (Never-theless, Shake speare did not al ways get things right: for exam- ple, he gave Bohemia a seacoast and put clocks in ancient Rome [Evans 1949].) Oxfordians wonder at the absence of any manuscripts, let- ters, or diaries in Shakespeare's handwriting, but there is a general lack of such materials from Elizabethan and Jacobean dramatists (Keller 2009, 4). They apparently placed little value on keeping such items, since collecting literary autographs did not become a serious endeavor until the latter part of the eigh-teenth century (Matus 1991, 70). To sum up, there really was a Shakespeare, and to believe that someone else wrote the plays and poems bearing his name\u2014that there was in fact a conspiracy to perpetrate an elaborate hoax\u2014is to gratuitously violate the principle of Occam's razor, the dictum that the hypothesis with the fewest assumptions is to be preferred. But those who have stepped through the looking glass will not be dissuaded. As Schoenbaum (1991, 451) notes, nothing \"will erase suspicions fostered over a century by amateurs who have yielded to the dark power of the anti-Stratfordian ob- session. One thought perhaps offers a crumb of redeemingcomfort: the energy ab sorbed by the mania might otherwisehave gone into politics.\" n Note 1. From part III, act I, scene iv, line 137.

Simple activities can help us to understand the real causes of such phenomena and to reject paranormal interpretations. MICHAEL MAUSER Are they auras or afterimages? Vitality globules or white corpuscles? Angels or phosphenes? What we believe often determines what we see and experience. Some simple activities can help us understand vision phenomena that may be misinterpreted as evidence for the paranormal. In a brief review on the aura, a \"glowing field surrounding a human being,\" Perezand Hines (2011) mention perceptualillusions as among many possible rea- sons the belief in auras persists. Dale etal. (1978) suggest two vision phenom- ena that may be involved in a perceptionof an aura: border contrast effects andafterimages. When uniformly shaded fields are presented adjacent to one another, we perceive them as non-uniformly shaded with enhanced contrast at the border. This visual illusion was first reported by Ernst Mach (1865), and it is often pre- sented as \"Mach bands\" as shown in fig-ure 1 (Ratliff 1965). Figure 2 presentsthe illusion as a series of silhouettes and shows how an aura might be perceived. In either case, the bands can be revealed as truly uniform if you cover the borders with your fingers. The illusion resultsfrom a process known as lateral inhibi-tion, wherein neurons associated with adjacent photoreceptors on the retina can influence each other to emphasize a border. With regard to afterimages, I cannot say it better than Blackmore (1996, 37), who wrote: If you hold out your hand against a dark background and look at the space just beside the skin, you will begin to see a faint glow around it. ... Lightskin against a dark background pro- vides high contrast and good condi- tions for after-images. As the eyes move slightly but rapidly about (as they always do), an after-image builds up around the edge of the hand and produces a light blur. Most people are well acquainted with afterimages, so the only surprise here may be that our eyes are always moving without our being aware of it. You can see this jitter by first staring for a minute at the circle where the grid lines cross infigure 3, which will \"print\" the image ofthe grid on your retina. If you then stare at the plus sign in the square, you should notice that the afterimage jumps around as your eyes move. Figure 1. Mach bands Figure 2. A series of silhouettes Auras Figure 3.

By \"focusing the gaze in-tently into the sky for a few mo-ments\" (Flex ner 2004, 128) youwill see that the \"globule wells outfrom an invisible source, appears and moves rapidly away, to giveplace to more globules\" (147).Flexner writes that when webreathe in globules of our bodies change theminto \"personal vitality\" (128), so heclearly regards them as an atmos- pheric phenomenon that is beneficial toour health. We can never be sure exactly what someone else is seeing , but what Flexner describes seems a lot like the blue field entoptic phenomenon (also calledScheerer's phenomenon or flying cor- puscles). We sense light with the retina,which is at the back of the eye. Arteries, veins, and capillaries are present on top of the retina, and these plus the blood flowing through the capillaries can be seen under the right conditions. We see the arteries, veins, and capillaries as net- works of shadows and the blood flow inthe capillaries as numerous short-lived, seemingly erratic, rapidlymoving dots of light with darktails. To see the larger blood vessels on the retina, close one eye and look straight ahead at a blank wallwith the other while flashing a beam of light across the pupil from the periphery. This will cause a spot of light to be focused on theperiphery of the retina. The spotacts as an internal light sourcecasting shadows of the blood ves- sels on the ret ina. These shadowsare not nor mally seen because theretina adjusts for any constant sen- sation. For other viewing techniques andmore information, see Walker (1982). To see the parafoveal cap illaries on the retina, put a pinhole (~0.8 mm) in a business card and look at a bright, fea- tureless surface (or the sky) while hold- ing the pinhole close to your eye. Rap- idly move the card in small circles, and through the hole you should see a pat-tern similar to that shown in figure 4. Note the capillary-free zone at the cen- ter of vision marking the fovea, where photo receptors are most tightly packed. Most people have occasionally seen the blood cells moving through theseretinal capillaries that surround the fovea when staring at a bright surface, partic- ularly after physical exertion. The white blood cells are relatively large and mustdeform to fit in the capillaries, causing a space to open up ahead of them and themuch more numerous and smaller red cells to pile up behind. The red cells ab-sorb more light, so what we see are short, bright streaks with dark tails moving in the short, convoluted paths of the capil-laries. Under ideal viewing conditions, you can see dozens of these white cellsmoving at a time and recognize that they always trace out the same paths and move in time with your pulse. To im- prove your viewing, you can hold a pieceof cobalt glass or blue plastic up against a blue sky. A science museum (see www.exploratorium.edu/xref/exhibits/blood_cells_in_the_eye.html) or an ophthalmol-ogist may have a viewer (sometimes called an entoptoscope), which is essen- tially just a bright, diffuse source of nar-row-band blue light. For more informa-tion, see Sinclair et al. (1989) and Walker (1982).SI Nov.

Butsome of the descriptions I have readsound like the person was seeingfloaters or other entoptic (within theeye) phenomena. If you are reallylooking for and expecting to see anangel or ghost, just about any blurrything you can't explain will probablydo. There are plenty of entoptic phe- nomena that look like blurry things,but I think floaters, phosphenes, andPurkinje's blue arcs are the mostlikely candidates for misinterpreta-tion. Floaters are cells and tissue sus- pended in front of the retina. They castshadows on the retina that can be veryconspicuous when looking at a bright,featureless surface. If a floater is in yourperipheral vision, you may becomeaware of it moving around but will notbe able to get a clear view of it becauseit will move with your eye movement. You can dramatically improve the visibility of floaters by holding a pointsource of diffuse light close to your eye.Put a small piece of aluminum foil on a hard surface and twirl a needle point onit to make a tiny hole (~0.2 mm). Coverthe hole with matte-surface cellophanetape, and hold the foil close to your eyewhile looking at a bright light sourcethrough it. Light from the hole will berefracted by the cornea and lens to castdistinct shadows of things on and inside your eye as shown in figure 5. If you move the foil back and forth and up anddown while continuing to look straightahead, you will be able to gauge the rel- ative distance of various things from theretina as well as see more of the eye's in- terior. Moving your head relative to a horizontal plane may also result in some of the floaters moving closer to the fovea where the shadows can be seen more clearly. See Walker (1982) formore information. When you press on one corner of your eye, you can activate the photore- ceptors, causing you to see a spot of light on the opposite side of the eye. This per- ception of light when no light is entering the eye is known as a phosphene. A rapidmovement of the eye can also result in a phosphene at the optic nerve because the retina is apparently stretched there (Friedman 1941). If you do this at night, it can be quite noticeable, but only for the first one or two attempts\u2014and you can't see it very clearly because it is fif- teen degrees from your center of vision where visual activity is substantially less.See Walker (1981) for more informa- tion on phosphenes. The photoreceptors can also activate spontaneously. This is why even in the total absence of light you don't see ab-solute blackness but instead a mottled gray called \"dark noise\" or \"equivalentPoisson noise\" (Elkins 2000, 241). With a little imagination you can \"see\" allkinds of things in this noise. Purkinje's blue arcs are my favorite entoptic phenomenon both because of their beauty and because, as Richard Gregory (1997, 57) wrote, \"Here we are seeing parts of our own brains!\" There is nothing paranormal about it, but peo- ple may be tempted to misinterpret it because the phenomenon is fleeting and difficult to reproduce. To see these arcsclearly, go into a windowless room that contains a small LED indicator light (preferably red). Close your eyes andturn off the lights. After about thirty seconds, open just your right eye and look at the right edge of the LED. You will momentarily see two faint but dis-tinct blue arcs streaking a distance of Even in the total absence of light you don't see absolute blackness but instead a mottled gray called \"dark noise\" or \"equivalent Poisson noise.\" With a little imagination you can \"see\" all kinds of things in this noise.

(Your thumbheld out at arm's length has a width ofabout two degrees.) If you then look di- rectly at the light, you may see a faint blue haze around it. If you look to the left side of the light, you will see a blue spike where the arcs were. Stable images on the retina disappear quickly, but you can prolong the phenomenon by shiftingyour eye back and forth or by switchingto your left eye for the reverse view. Y ouwill eventually need to turn the lights onand repeat the process when your eye be- comes accustomed to the dark. What you are seeing is due to the action of thenerves on the retina that connect thephotoreceptors in the center of vision (thefovea) to the optic nerve about fifteen de- grees away. These nerves arc around thefovea, which is why you see arcs when you look at the right edge of the light with your right eye but only a spike when you look at the left edge. Because the eyes de- velop from the brain, these nerves are considered part of the brain. See Walker (1984) for more information. Conclusion Subjective visual experiences can be very hard to evaluate. The images on our reti- nas can result from objects and processes within the eye itself. If we are ignorant of these phenomena, we will not considerthem when trying to interpret things weare seeing. The photoreceptors on our retinas are not perfect transducers: they respond to stimuli other than light; theyare noisy (as evidenced in the dark noise mentioned earlier); there is a lag in their response time; and they become satu- rated, requiring time to recover. Vision is a brain process that starts at the retina,turning discrete signals on a two-dimen- sional surface into the perceptions of lines, surfaces, shapes, and three-dimensionalobjects in an external world. This process is influenced by expectations and precon- ceptions as many visual illusions demon- strate (see www.michaelbach.de/ot/). n References Blackmore, S.J. 1996.

The documentary acknowledges that \"main- stream archaeologists\" do not accept the claim that any of these civilizations had contact with the indigenous NorthAmerican cultures, yet it features the views of several \"diffusionists,\" none of whom appear to be archaeologists (\"mainstream\" or otherwise). These dif- fusionists argue that a wealthof arti-facts appears to support the \"lost civi- lization\" claim, and they purport to explain why mainstream archaeologists have so assiduously ignored or sup- pressed this evidence for numerous episodes of intercontinental intercourse.What Is the Evidence for Lost Civilizations in North America? Interspersed throughout Lost Civiliza - tions of North America are images of a bewildering variety of artifacts, some of which are recognized icons of Amer - ican archaeology while others are less familiar and even startlingly odd. The narrator explains these puzzling juxta- positions as follows: Many artifacts are shown throughout this film. Some artifacts are accepted as authentic by the scientific commu- nity today, and some are not. In many cases authentic artifacts may be shown alongside controversial ones. This is done in part to underscore thedifficulty in determining authenticity, and also to illustrate a conflict that exists between mainstream anthro- pologists, and those who have been termed \"diffusionists.\" There are numerous problems with this justification for intentionally blur- ring the distinction among verifiablyancient artifacts, objects of questionableauthenticity, and objects that are de - mon strably fraudulent. First, it falsely suggests that there is a legitimate sci- entific controversy over the interpreta- tion of these artifacts. Fram ing this al- leged controversy in this way is verysimilar to creationists attempting to characterize their argument with evo- lutionary biologists. As with that more familiar canard, there is no real scien- tific controversy. We are not aware of anycontemporary anthropologist who thinks there is scientific validity to the infamous artifacts featured in this doc- umentary, such as the Michigan Relics (Halsey 2004), the Grave Creek Stone(Lepper 2008), the Bat Creek Stone (Mainfort and Kwas 2004), and the Newark \"Holy Stones\" (Lepper and Gill 2000) (figure 1). The effect of presenting these bogusAs noted in Part One of this discussion (SI, September/ October 2011), the documentary The Lost Civilizations of North America (produced by Steven Smoot, Rick Stout, and Barry McLerran)purports to be an exploration of \"the fas- cinating world of ancient North America, and why the ar- tifacts and evidences of ancient civilizations have been lost and largely ignored\" (qtd. from the DVD's website at www.lostcivilizationdvd.com/documentary.html).

Itap pears deliberately obfuscatory and isdemeaning to the achievements of theancient Native American artisans. Second, we believe that the documen- tary's justification for mixing au thenticwith \"controversial\" artifacts wildly exag- gerates the \"difficulty in determining au-thenticity.\" In any archaeological analysis,the key to determining the authenticityof a putative ancient artifact is to estab- lish its context. For virtually none of thedisputed artifacts shown in the docu-mentary is there any reliable information about its archaeological context. To beginwith, none of the artifacts shown, nor anysimilar pieces that might lend support tothe authenticity of the objects high- lighted in the video, has been recoveredin any modern archaeological excavationusing the tools and techniques of latetwentieth-century archaeology. This is acrucial point: by and large, artifacts with putative ancient Old World writing werefound in New World sites during only arather narrow window of time (primarilyfrom the mid-nineteenth into the earlytwentieth century), a period during which there was enormous controversyconcerning the origins of the mound builders of the American Midwest andSoutheast. In the far more extensive ar-chaeological fieldwork accomplished be-tween 1930 and the present, no such ar- tifacts have ever been discovered by professional archaeologists. We can thinkof no legitimate artifact category inwhich archaeologists ceased finding ex- amples of an artifact type once the field became professionalized with appliedscientific methodology. In many cases, moreover, informa- tion on the historical context of these inscribed objects has demonstrated that they are frauds or forgeries. The video's narrator asserts, for example, that the Bat Creek Stone was \"found using mod- ernmethods within the original sur- roundings\" (emphasis added) (figure 3). Donald Yates, a featured diffusionist who holds a doctorate in classical stud- ies, goes on to assert that naysayers can'tdismiss this artifact because it was re- Figure 1. Ostensibly discovered in an ancient mound located in West Virginia, the Grave Creek Stone's inscription (top) reflects an impossible mixture of a number of Old World written languages (Grave Creek Mound Museum).

It certainly is true that John Emmert, the man who claimed to have found theBat Creek Stone, was in the employ ofthe Smithsonian Institution at the timeof its discovery. During this period, theSmithsonian hired an eclectic assort- ment of individuals with varying levelsof expertise to conduct local operationson the Institution's behalf. Emmert ap-pears to have been one of the lesserqualified excavators, and he was later fired because of questions about thequality of his work (Mainfort and Kwas 1991, 12). Even discounting the obviousquestions about his competence, sinceEmmert excavated the stone in 1889, his methods could hardly be considered \"modern\" in any meaningful sense. Fi- nally, since the archaeologists Robert Mainfort and Mary Kwas discovered the source used by the forgers of the BatCreek inscription, conclusively demon- strating it to be a fraud (Mainfort and Kwas 2004), consideration of Emmert'squalifications is moot. It is clear now that Emmert either perpetrated the fraud himself or failed to detect the im- posture because of his dodgy methods. The Newark Holy Stones The artifacts given the most screen time in the documentary are the so-called Newark \"Holy Stones.\" In fact, the nar- rator refers to the controversy surround-ing the interpretation of these artifacts as a case study that \"demonstrates the divi- sion between some diffusionists and most mainstream archaeologists.\" If the producers of the documentary sincerely believe this statement, then it is difficult to understand why they feature only the diffusionist side of the argument. What makes this one-sided presentation par-ticularly perplexing is that one of the sci- entists interviewed (one of the authors of this article) has written extensively on theNewark \"Holy Stones\" and therefore could (Lepper 1999; Lepper Note that use the qualifier in his phase \"most main- stream archaeologists\" leaves the listener with the false impression that there might be some \"mainstream archaeolo- gists\" out there who accept the Newark \"Holy Stones\" as authentic. We are aware of none who have gone on record in sup- port of these egregious, if historically in- teresting, forgeries. The Newark \"Holy Stones\" consist of five separate artifacts, at least two of which even many diffusionists ac - knowledge to be fraudulent (Lepper 1991). The documentary focuses on the second of the artifacts to be reported al- though both of the two surviving \"HolyStones\" are featured in various video clips. David Wyrick, a Licking County, Ohio, surveyor and avocational archae-ologist, made his first sensational discov- ery, the so-called \"Keystone,\" in a shal-low excavation at the monumental Newark Earthworks. He found the \"Decalogue Stone\" (figure 4), even more spectacular and apparently definitive proof of his belief that ancient Israelites had built the ancient mounds, just five months later at a different site a fewmiles south of Newark (Lepper and Gill 2000). The Reservoir Stone Mound, also known as the Jacksontown Stone Mound, was the largest aboriginal stone structure in North Americanorth of Mexico. It was forty feet in height and 180 feet in diameter. First described in 1822 in a call to preserve the magnificent edifice, it was, nevertheless, largely destroyed between 1831 and 1832 when the stones were used in the construction of an extensive series of dikes framing the reservoir on the Licking summit of the Ohio and Erie Canal. Estimates vary, but between 10,000 and 15,000 wagon loads of stone are said to have been hauled away for this purpose. When the bulk of the stones had been removed, a portion of a circular arrangement of ten to twenty eight-foot-tall earthen mounds was revealed. In the video, Ancient American mag- azine's publisher Wayne May narrates the story of Wyrick's discovery of the Decalogue Stone: They found one major earth structure in the center surrounded by twelve small burials. David Wyrick wentstraight for the middle one with nine other gentlemen and they began to dig that mound down and they un- covered it\u2014and when they did they found a wooden coffin made out of oak and opening up that coffin in there was a large skeleton of a man, but also in this coffin was a little box no more than maybe about eight or ten inches in size and it was ce- mented shut. Wyrick and the men, while they were all there together, they pried this box apart and in it was a black stone. They opened this box and here was this unusual artifact. This account of the basic facts of the discovery is riddled with errors. Some may seem trivial, but they are important to document because they demonstrate a pattern of carelessness with regard to facts that is depressingly typical of thediffusionist literature. 50Volume 35 Issue 6 | Skeptical InquirerFigure 2.

The exact total of these small mounds wasnever recorded, probably because the entirety of the stones have never been removed, leaving some still buried be- neath the remnants of the mound. May's reference to \"twelve\" leaves the unwarranted impression of an exactcount. The fact that May settled so pre-cisely on the number twelve may havesomething to do with the mystical sig- nificance of that number in the Judeo- Christian tradition (twelve tribes of Is- rael, twelve disciples, etc.). 2. Wyrick did not undertake his investi- gation with nine other men but with five. Sources allow us to identify at least four of them: Jacob Wyrick, John Nicol, John Haynes, and John Larett. Nicol's presence is significant, because he wasdirectly implicated in the blatant hoax of two of the subsequent \"Holy Stones\"(Lepper 1991). 3. Wyrick's team did not discover the wooden \"coffin.\" The \"coffin,\" originally described as a \"trough,\" was found in 1853 by William Parr (Wyrick 1860). Parr cutoff a piece of the wooden trough to retain,but he left the rest in the hole to be re-buried. Wyrick and a group of men re-turned to the site in August of 1860 to re- excavate the mound in order to recover the wooden \"sarcophagus.\" The excava- tion that resulted in the recovery of theDecalogue Stone was Wyrick's second ex-pedition to the site and at least the third time the mound had been dug into. 4. Neither Wyrick nor Parr recovered the skeleton of a \"large man,\" and the Decalogue Stone was not found in the coffin but rather several inches beneathit. Wyrick (1860) reported that Parr found human bones, but they amounted to only \"bits of skull,\" a few teeth, and some hair. There would have been noway to reliably identify either the sex or the size of the person represented bythese meager human re mains, and the bones are not known to be curated inany museum collection where they could be re-studied using modern foren-sic methods. The only artifacts associ- ated with the human remains were ten copper bracelets. The Decalogue Stone was found in clay well below the original depth of the wooden burial platform. May then recounts Wyrick's efforts to interpret the Decalogue Stone: They took it to some scholars\u2014iden- tified that it was probably some type of Hebrew. They took it to some rab- bis living in the area and looking at it, they said yes they could read it and it was a complete rendition of the Ten Commandments. They called it block Hebrew. And so then naysayers started picking on Wyrick. He was ac- cused of sticking this stone in front of these nine men somehow and being able to hide it and conceal it. And it wasn't until sometime in the 1900s, lo and behold, in Israel they find, guess what, they found block Hebrew. The block-style of He- brew was given a name by the ex- perts\u2014monumental Hebrew, be cause of the way it was written. Long after Wyrick. After! In other words, May is claiming that the version of Hebrew found on the Decalogue Stone could not have beenfraudulently produced in 1860 because this form of writing was not known until years after the discovery of the stone. This is all nonsense. In fact,Wyrick took the Decalogue Stone di- rectly to the local Episcopal Minister, John McCarty, who published a com- prehensively annotated translation ofthe inscription within a week of its dis- covery (McCarty 1860). There were rabbis who could, in deed, read the inscription. Abraham Geiger, a highly respected German rabbi and scholar of Hebrew, concluded in the July27, 1860, New York Times that the Deca- logue Stone inscription was \"the bungling work of an unskilled stone mason and the strangeness of some let-ters as well as the many mistakes and transpositions was his fault. The letters are not antique. This is not a relic of hoary antiquity\" (qtd. in Alrutz 1980, 41). Geiger's assessment has been con- firmed and elaborated by our colleague Jeff Gill, who noted specific errors in theinscription that could have occurred only if someone were working from a conventional nineteenth-century type- face Hebrew text and then converting Figure 3. The Bat Creek Stone is one of a number of ancient artifacts found in North America bearing inscriptions in Old World scripts. All such artifacts have been shown to be fraudulent. Figure 4. About 6.8 inches in length and made from black limestone, the Deca- logue Stone is named for the fact that it is inscribed with the Ten Commandments in an ancient-looking form of Hebrew. It wasdiscovered in 1860 during excavations in the remains of the largest stone mound in North America. (Johnson-Humrickhouse Museum) Skeptical Inquirer | November / December 2011 51SI Nov.

Doing so would result in a recurring pattern of error, whichconfirms the modern source for the in-scription (Lepper and Gill 2000, 20).Frank Moore Cross, Harvard Univer-sity professor of Near Eastern lan-guages and one of the foremost con- temporary authorities on ancientHebrew, fully corroborated Gill's con- clusions, writing that it was that\"the modern forms of the Hebrewcharacter[s] . . . stand ultimately be-hind\" the Cross offered his opinionthat the Decalogue Stone was a\"grotesque\" forgery that could not betaken seriously. May's peremptory dismissal of the idea that Wyrick might have been ablesomehow to bury the fraudulent Deca-logue Stone in front of the \"nine\" wit-nesses is completely unwarranted, sincethe mound in question had been duginto on at least two previous occasions.Moreover, Wyrick's plan to continue hisinvestigation of the mound was knownby at least five other individuals, anyone of whom would have had ampleopportunity to plant the artifact within the excavation before the day arranged for the second expedition. Nicol's sub- sequent involvement in a similar proven hoax casts considerable suspicion in his direction. May's claims about the significance of block Hebrew, also called monumen- tal Hebrew, are specious and unin-formed. \"Block Hebrew\" whatpalaeographers and Class ical Hebrew orthography from the Second Temple-era down to the present, and there is no coherent correspondencebetween any ancient epigraphic Hebrewand the Decalogue alphabet. Finally, by ignoring the historical context in which the Newark \"HolyStones\" appeared, May and other diffu- sionists lose the opportunity to under- stand the true nature of the forgeries.The Newark \"Holy Stones\" representedan attempt to encompass the prehistory of the New World within the biblical history of the Old World, thereby un-dermining the dangerous doctrine of polygenesis, which sought to provide a scientific justification for both the en-slavement of African people and the forced removal of Native Americans from their homelands. Ironically, these ideas would have provided some sup- port and nuance for a central theme of the Lost Civilizations of North America documentary. How Did Important Evidence of a Lost Civilization Come to Be 'Lost'? Lost Civilizations of North America ad - vances the unsupportable proposition that the epigraphic evidence supporting diffusionist claims was not simply dis- carded after a thorough review by fair- minded scholars, but that it was actually accepted and deliberately suppressed by official historians because \"the idea thatancient inhabitants knew of and used Middle Eastern Hebrew symbols un - der mined the notion that Native Amer -icans were isolated savages.\" The claim that scholars have dis- missed or even destroyed data to sup- port racist interpretations of America'spast are made explicitly by Wayne Mayin the documentary. His argument rests on the use of a selectively edited quo- tation by John Wesley Powell, who served as the director of the Smithson- ian Institution's Bureau of AmericanEth nology and the U.S. Geological Survey: \"Hence, it will be seen that it isillegitimate to use any pictographicmatter of a date anterior to the discov-ery of the continent by Columbus for historic purposes.\" This quote appears on the screen just as we show it here, ending with a period as if this were the complete thought expressed by Powell.From this it is asserted that scientists knew about Native American writing and conspired to suppress the truthabout such writing and its connection to Old World alphabets by forbiddingthe scientific use of these \"pictographs.\" This is, of course, patently false, andwhen his statement is read in its full context it is clear that this was not what Powell meant. The quoted phrase does not end in a period as shown in the documentary. Instead, a semi-colon separates the first part of the sentencefrom the rest of Powell's thought. Pow- ell's entire statement is repeated here Figure 5. Petroglyph panels, like this spectacular example called Newspaper Rock (in Utah), are splendid works of art. While pointing out that petroglyphs and pictographs could not be identified as a formal written language, John Wesley Powell nevertheless explicitly recognized their signifi- cance for the stories they told of the lives of Native Americans.

(Powell 1881, 75) In other words, while Powell felt it \"illegitimate\" to interpret pictographs (figure 5) directly as a form of writtenhistory, he nevertheless felt they were ofenormous importance and should becollected and analyzed precisely be- cause they represent the beginning of awritten language (exactly what the doc-umentary claims Powell and otherswere attempting to hide) and a historycould be derived by those who studiedthem. Powell was not attempting tosuppress archaeological evidence butsimply trying to subordinate theory tothe collection of data. Clearly, Powell got it wrong on some issues. For example, while he correctlynoted that the \"pictographs\" produced by the civilizations of Meso america weremore \"conventional\" than those seen in North America, he incorrectly surmised that theirs wasn't a true system of writ- ing. This error, however, does not war-rant the implication made in the docu- mentary that his goal was to suppress any evidence showing that the native people of North America were capable of developing civilization. Exactly the opposite is true. As a matter of fact, Powell worked to dispel the myth of a mound-building people distinct from Native Americans, a conclusion he based not on armchair theorizing but on masses of data from extensive Amer ican ethnological and archaeological field- work. It is incredible that anyone would suggest, as the producers of Lost Civ - iliza tionsclearly do, that Powell \"robbed\" Native Americans of their history. Thisis one of the more egregious of severalnon sequiturs present in the documen-tary. Powell's purpose was to uniteAmerican archaeology and ethnology in the study of the mounds, not to suppressevidence. That is not to suggest that hedid not have predispositions, opinions,and biases. Who does not? Yet Powelldid as much as anyone at the close of the nineteenth century to make American archaeology and ethnology more exact-ing sciences. His critical comments on limitations attending the use of certainkinds of anthropological data still bear reading today. Why Are Archaeologists Skeptical about Old World Visitors to the New World? This brings us to a subject touched on only briefly in the documentary: the Norse settlement of North Americacirca 1000 CE. The clear implication in the documentary is that since it can bedemonstrated that the Norse were here one thousand years ago, it is also possi-ble that Middle Easterners were in the New World two thousand years ago. In fact, before the 1960s, archaeolo- gists were generally skeptical about claims of a pre-Columbian Norse dis- covery and settlement of the New World primarily because these claimswere based not on material remainsfound in North America reflecting apre-Columbian Norse presence but onthe interpretation of historical docu-ments\u2014specifically, sagas(Eric the Red's Saga and theGreen - lander's Saga), both of which had beencommitted to paper fully two centuriesafterthe events discussed were sup- posed to have taken place. Archaeologists, with a focus on ma- terial evidence, tend to subscribe to es-sayist Ambrose Bierce's definition of written history: \"An account mostly false, of events, mostly unimportant, which arebrought about by rulers, mostly knaves,and soldiers, mostly fools\" (Bierce [1911] 2003). Essentially, material remains\u2014the things people made, used, and then either lost or discarded\u2014represent the gold standard in archaeological analysis. So,while the two aforementioned sagas claimed that lands to the west of the Norse settlements in Greenland had been discovered, explored, and briefly settled, most in the archaeological com-munity were skeptical of taking the sagasliterally without material evidence as confirmation. This all changed when, in the early 1960s, artifacts and even structures un-questionably of Norse origin werefound by archaeologists working inNew foundland at the site of L'anse auxMeadows. Items such as a ring-headedbronze pin, a soapstone spindle whorl, Powell's purpose was to unite American archaeology and ethnology in the study of the mounds, not to suppress evidence. That is not to suggest that he did not have predispositions, opinions, and biases. Who does not ??SI Nov.

These material remains lookednothing like any that had been found atnative sites but matched, in detail, ob-jects found in known tenth- andeleventh-century Norse sites in Green-land, Iceland, and Scandinavia. Radio-carbon dates proved that the New-foundland village had been occupied before 1000 CE, placing it in time roughly contemporaneous with theevents described in the sagas. Subse -quent research throughout northeasternCanada has revealed additional mate- rial evidence of a Norse presence there about one thousand years ago (Suther-land 2000). As a result, archaeologists now fully accept that the Norse cameto the New World, explored, and, in some cases, settled there five centuriesbefore Columbus. The Norse example is an instructive lesson in assessing the underlying claim made by the Lost Civilizations docu- mentary. It is, unfortunately, a lessonlost. If interlopers from the Middle East arrived in North America two thousandyears ago, one would expect there to beabundant material evidence of their presence. If a handful of Norse explorersand settlers left behind recognizable el-ements of their material culture scat- tered across Canada, certainly a large contingent of Hebrews moving into Ohio and building the literally thou-sands of mound sites found there wouldhave, just like the Canadian Norse, leftbehind villages littered with material objects diagnostic of their culture and easily distinguishable from that of the native people already there. Their mate- rial culture would be found abundantly virtually anywhere archaeologists\u2014or,for that matter, anyone else\u2014dig. They certainly would have left behind more than a handful of inscribed tablets. But there is no such evidence for the pres- ence of Hebrews or any other Old World people in pre-Columbian Ohio.In this case we are confident in turning the old clich\u00e9 on its head: here, at least, the absence of evidence is, indeed, evi-dence of absence.Finally, we wish to make one addi- tional point. It is not surprising thatwhen individuals in the nineteenth cen-tury, for whatever reason, wished to con- vince their contemporaries that themounds had been constructed by Middle Easterners, the most obvious and, to be frank, easiest way to attempt this was to manufacture fake artifacts, like the Newark \"Holy Stones,\" with inscriptionson them. It would have been far more dif- ficult (in reality, virtually impossible) to concoct entire sites with trash pits, houseremains, and burials\u2014all reflecting the morphology, artifact types, skeletons, andburial practices appropriate for and diag- nostic of Hebrews dating to the first cen- tury. Let's not be too hard on the fabrica- tors of these frauds, hoaxes, and forgeries; they did the best they could\u2014and they'restill fooling some people even today. One additional category of evidence discussed in Lost Civilizations will be ex amined in the third article in this se-ries: genetic data used to trace the ori-gins of the Native Americans in generaland the mound builders in particular. n References Alrutz, Robert W. 1980.

GORSKI There's an old recurring Saturday Night Live sketch in which a Scots- man bellows, \"If it's not Scottish, it's crap!\" As I read Reynold Spector's \"Seven Deadly Medical Hypotheses\" (Spector 2010), I couldn't shake the image of him in a kilt roaring, \"If it's not a randomized, double-blind clinical trial based on the hypothetical/ in ductive method, it's deadly crap!\" Un- fortunately, Spector fails to demon- strate convincingly why most of his seven hypotheses even merit the label\"deadly.\" Sadly, Spector's overwrought application of the word deadlyto hy - potheses that are not even, by Spector's definition, \"deadly\" torpedoes what might have been a provocative exercise in skepticism. What is left are weak or erroneous conclusions based on dubi- ous arguments. Because there are so many question- able arguments in Spector's article, I will be forced to \"cherry pick\" a couple. More complete discussions of other examples can be found elsewhere (Gor ski 2011a). His first Deadly Medi cal Hypothesis (DMH) is as good an ex ample as any. Unfortunately, DMH #1 is not even ahypothesis at all but rather two opinions, the second of which is a straw man tacked on to allow Spector to gleefullyattack both opinions as one: \"Either the investigator does not need a specific hy- pothesis and/or can use an inadequatemethod to test the hypothesis.\" Spector cites an editorial as support for the existence of this DMH (Glassand Hall 2008). However, although theauthors of the cited editorial did makethe provocative argument that in the ageof genomic medicine specific hypothesesmight not always be necessary anymore and that instead science can focus on an- swerable questions, nowhere do they ad- vocate using \"inadequate methods\" to test hypotheses or answer questions. That is Spector's opinion, and the strawman that gives him the opening to at- tack \"hypothesis-less\" studies. Yet hy- pothesis-generating studies are very im- portant to the process of discovery, because they are how we develop new lines of investigation that might one daycome to fruition as useful treatments that can pass FDA muster, standards de- signed for a very late point in the discov- ery process. It's a long and winding road from hy- pothesis generation to hypothesis testing to treatment to treatment validation.Most hypotheses fail and are forgotten, and even for those that succeed, the me- dian time between first publication of a discovery or hypothesis and its validation in large randomized clinical trials ranges from fourteen to forty-four years (Con- topoulos-Ionnidis et al. 2008). Com-pared to this, genome-wide associationstudies (GWAS) have only been in exis- tence for a relatively short time. Ironically, Spector argues that GWAS should be re- placed by \"direct sequencing of the por- tions of the genome of interest, compar- ing patients with proper control subjects.\" That is exactly what is happening now (Berger et al. 2011) as next generation sequencing (NGS) techniques drive the cost of genome sequencing low enough to make such studies feasible. I also notethat many of the assumptions behind GWAS that Spector dismisses are also assumptions behind\u2014you guessed it!\u2014 next generation sequencing experimentsof the sort that Spector apparently ap - proves of. Right now, the National Insti - tutes of Health is funding a huge initia- tive, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA, see http://cancergenome.nih. gov), in which dozens of cancer genomes are being se quenced\u2014without hypothe-ses!\u2014generating numerous prom ising hypotheses to test, the results of whichFOLLOW UP] Disputing 'Seven Deadly Medical Hypotheses' The article \"Seven Medical Hypotheses\" by Reynold Spector, MD, in our March/April 2011 issue prompted considerable comment and controversy within the skeptical community. Several physician-skeptics wrote critical blog posts, and others let us know they were uncomfortable with much of what Spector had written and the certainty with which he expressed his conclusions. We invited four of the critics to submit short letters for this section. Reynold Spector then responds. \u2014EDITOR SI Nov. Dec 11_SI new design masters 9/29/11 10:04 AM Page 5556 Volume 35 Issue 6 | Skeptical Inquirermight one day be true personalized med- icine (which, by the way, was another ofSpector's misguided not-so-deadly hy-potheses). Speaking of cancer, the most offen- sive DMH is the last one, namely that\"from a public health perspective, can-cer chemotherapy (chemo) has been amajor medical advance.\" Note how Spector is careful to insert the phrase \"from a public health perspective.\" This, too, is a straw man, as no one ar- gues that chemotherapy is a major pub- lic health advance; rather it is an ad- vance in the treatment of individualpatients with certain kinds of cancerthat respond to chemotherapy. I've dis-cussed at length the slanted perspectiveinherent in this DMH, including itsmisleading characterization of chemo - therapy (Gorski 2011a) and why we \"haven't won the war on cancer yet\" (Gorski 2011b). If Spector had simplywritten that ble of curing many hematologic malig- nancies and a handful of solid malig- nancies (such as testicular and analcancer), does a poor job on its own ofprolonging life in patients with inoper-able solid malignancies, I would have had little argument with him. Appar - ently such a universally accepted con-clusion wasn't provocative enough,however, so he declared chemotherapyan utter failure\u2014from a public health perspective, of course!\u2014ignoring can- cers for which chemotherapy improvesdisease-free and overall survival and quality of life even when they are ad- vanced (Venook 2005) and the useful- ness of chemotherapy in adjuvant and neoadjuvant settings. No doubt Spector thought he was being provocatively \"skeptical.\" Unfor - tunately, most of his DMHs are neither deadly nor, truth be told, hypotheses. At worst, they are the sorts of dead endsthat science eventually corrects, which is how science works. Appar ently, Spec- tor doesn't have the patience to deal with the messiness of science-based medicine.David H.

MARK CRISLIP The article \"Seven Deadly Medical Hypotheses\" has fundamental flaws. The argument, as I understand it, is that medical researchers fail to use the hypo- thetical/deductive approach to decide upon research agendas and therefore waste a \"vast quantity of re source to dis- prove them.\" The argument as presented is circu- lar. The author uses information from completed studies to prove the studies should not have been done in the first place. He fails to consider the state of knowledge at the time the studies were done and the cumulative nature ofmedical knowledge. The author's criticism of Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) is an ex -ample of his reasoning and his ignoring the state of medical knowledge. The benefits and risks of HRT were dis- cussed at length with patients and on rounds in the 1980s when I was a med- icine resident. Are the benefits of HRTgreater than the potential risk of cancer from estrogen? As noted at the time in assessing HRT risks: Hip fractures, Colles' fractures, and coronary heart disease, and breast and endometrial cancers are impor- tant conditions in postmenopausal women that might be influenced bythe use of hormone replacementtherapy .... A 50-year-old white woman has a 16% risk of suffering a hip fracture, a 15% risk of suffering a Colles' fracture, and a 32% risk of suffering a vertebral fracture during her remaining lifetime. These risks exceed her risk of developing breast or endometrial cancer. She has a 31% risk of dying of coronary heart dis- ease, which is about 10 times greaterthan her risk of dying of hip fractures or breast cancer. These lifetime risks provide a useful description of the comparative risks of conditions that might be influenced by postmen - opausal hormone therapy. (Cum mings et al. 1989) And the risk for cancer was uncer- tain, as discussed in a 1989 New Eng - land Journal of Medicine editorial: \"Evi- dence that estrogen increases the risk of breast cancer has been surprisingly diffi- cult to obtain\" (Barrett-Connor 1989). In the 1980s the risks of HRT were uncer- tain and the benefits appeared consider- able. I spent significant time convincingmy mother, based on the information of the time, to take her Premarin. At no time does Reynold Spector describe, based upon the information we had at the time, why evaluation of HRT, or the other deadly hypotheses, should not have been pursued. It is the data gathered from the present he uses to discredit the past. If he had used the hypothetical/deductive methods basedon information known at the time, or better, information from today, to pre-dict what was and what will not be worth pursuing, it would be more im- pressive. Hindsight is always 20:20.SI Nov. Dec 11_SI new design masters 9/29/11 10:04 AM Page 56Skeptical Inquirer | November / December 2011 57Spector makes similar arguments for his other six deadly hypotheses. Well, one deadly hypothesis, five re jected hypothe- ses, and one opinion. The last hypothesis, \"cancer chemo therapy (chemo) has been a major medical advance,\" which Spector de clared false, is not a hypothesis gener- ated by researchers but by the author's after-the-fact opinion, and he fails to rec- ognize the benefits of failure. The author states \"when one dispas- sionately weighs the minimal prolonga- tion of around \"good\" nothing dispas- sionate in the author's analysis] life in patients with metastatic cancer ... ver- sus the very distressing side effects of chemotherapy with'targeted' chemo -therapy drugs, the case is close.\" If it had been 1990, Spector could have been writing about AIDS and HIV therapy. AIDS is infinitely simpler than cancer, yet a decade of false starts and dead ends, of failed hypotheses, led to progressive understanding of the pathophysiology and treatment of HIV and resulted in the era of HAART, where the expected life ex pectancy of those with HIV is often close to normal. Medicine advances slowly and er - ratically, and unfortunately more in - sights are often gained from failure than success. Only after enormous ef- fort can we retroactively identify which medical interventions warranted the gold standard, large, randomized, pla - cebo-controlled trials demanded by Spector. Doing so prospectively is not as easy as he suggests. Medicine is pushed forward not by pseudoscientists and worse but by caring, hardworking, and committed health care professionals who are doing the best they can under often tight funding limitations and great uncertainty. Spector's dismis- sive attitude toward the blood and sweat expended by the researchers\u2014 and, often forgotten, the patients who volunteer their life and health to ad- vance medicine by participating in clin- ical trials\u2014is disappointing.

Readers might understandably be puzzled by the discrepancy between our perspective and that of Reynold Spec tor's \"Deadly Hy- pothesis Two,\" in which he says that it isa \"well-documented fact that estrogen is a carcinogen and causes breast cancer.\"To support this claim, Spector relies onthe findings of the Women's Health Initia tive (WHI). But the WHI is one of the studies we criticize in great de tail, showing that its findings regardingbreast cancer have been inconsistent. Virtually all of its alarmist conclusions\u2014 that HRT in creases the risk of dementia, stroke, cardiovascular disease, breast can- cer, and even \"deaths from all causes\"\u2014 were a result of selection bias or post hoc statistical manipulation. Is estrogen the carcinogen that Spec - tor so unequivocally thinks it is? Ourpaper reviews the mounting evidencethat questions this common wisdom. Even the WHI results have not sup-ported that association, finding a modest (and usually statistically nonsignificant) rise in relative risk only for the combina- tion of estrogen-progestin therapy. In fact, a recent reanalysis of updated WHI data reported that postmenopausal ad- ministration of estrogen alone decreases the risk of subsequent breast cancer. Of course, scientists and other skep- tics can and do disagree with one an- other when it comes to interpreting data. Our primary objection to Spec - tor's discussion of HRT is not his con- clusion but his tone of certainty, his oversimplification of an enormous bodyof research, and his unwillingness to question received wisdom from the WHI. Even some investigators who share his belief that the relative risks of HRT warrant concern acknowledge that the absolute risks from this treat- ment are small. In one worst-caseanalysis, researchers calculated that a fifty-year-old woman taking estrogen and progestin for ten years has a 96 per- cent chance of remaining free of breastcancer versus 98 percent if she does not take HRT.

On a closer read- ing, I realized my discomfort was be- cause he sounds more like a denialist or a contrarian than like a judicious skep- tic. His seven hypotheses are stated in words that subtly misrepresent theFOLLOW UP]SI Nov. Dec 11_SI new design masters 9/29/11 10:05 AM Page 5758 Volume 35 Issue 6 | Skeptical Inquirertruth, and he attacks them with dogma- tism where nuance is called for. His main thesis is that \"many med- ical and nutritional hypotheses are ill- conceived.\" That may be true, but sci- entists are doing the best they can. Does he imagine that they could some- how discipline themselves to only study hypotheses that will turn out to be true? After falsely characterizing hormone replacement as an avoidable error, heperpetuates the myth that HRT kills 5,000 women yearly from breast cancer. The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) study showed no difference in overall mortality; so if HRT killed 5,000women from breast cancer it would have to have saved another 5,000 from other causes of death. Deadly Hypothesis Four is that \"screening tests beyond the standard medical examination are necessary foridentifying disease or the risk of disease in apparently healthy, asymptomatic adults.\" The utility of screening tests is not an ill-conceived hypothesis, muchless a deadly one. A routine history and physical on an asymptomatic patient arenext to useless for detecting pre-sympto- matic disease or risk of disease. That's why we have tried to devise useful screening tests to diagnose certain dis- eases and risk factors before symptoms develop, so early treatment might have achance of altering the course of disease.No screening test was ever a dopted with- out credible data and plausible reasoning. It is a gross oversimplification to call \"screening tests are necessary\" a false hy- pothesis. Instead, Spector should have at- tacked the myth that screening tests are categorically good and always save lives. Sometimes they fail to improve patient outcomes or even do more harm than good, and we then abandon them. All the tests Spector questions (mammography, PSA tests, genetic screening) were first questioned in the very medical literature he disparages. What Spector characterizes as \"a chronic scandal\" is nothing of the sort. It is a reflection of the complexity of the scientific process. Yes, we need to bemore skeptical. We need to carefully evaluate the evidence for any medical claim. We need to do better-designed studies. But it's not always possible todo the ideal study; sometimes we haveto go by the best available evidence from epidemiologic and other less de- sirable studies. We had to figure out that smoking caused lung cancer withoutforcing subjects to smoke or not smoke in a randomized controlled prospective study. Spector's article was doubly disap- pointing because he had so many excel-lent points that were sabotaged by the way he presented them. Medical science is far from perfect, but it is a cooperative, self-correcting endeavor that constantly criticizes itself and is constantly improv- ing. We need continued rational skepti- cism and constructive dialog, not over-simplified contrarian polemics. n Harriet Hall, MD, \"The SkepDoc\" Editor, Science-Based Medicine Contributing Editor, S KEPTICAL INQUIRER CSI fellow Contributing Editor, Skeptic magazine REYNOLD SPECTOR Responds Tt is clear from reading these letters that the correspondents do not un- derstand how to evaluate the medical literature\u2014how to discriminate the wheat from the chaff. They do not un- derstand the hierarchical nature of proffered evidence. For example, I doubt any of the correspondents under- stand Hill's criteria for assessing causalrelationships in epidemiology/obser - vation studies (see below). I recom-mend they read Spector and Vesell(2006) or the online methodologicalsupplement to my paper on nutrition inS KEPTICALINQUIRER(Spector 2009). They should also consult the FDA reg-ulations for what constitutes proof in drug development. Let me be concrete. Three corre- spondents claim I don't understand that the evaluation of clinical science is noteasy. Gorski talks about the \"messiness of science-based medicine.\" Crislip states \"medicine advances slowly and er- ratically.\" Hall states that \"scientists are doing the best they can.\" What they do not understand is that one of the rea- sons for this sorry state of much of theclinical literature is that many published studies do not have a clear hy pothesis, are underpowered, or use inadequate methods (e.g., epidemiology/observa- tion studies attempting to \"prove\" causal connections). Exam ples include the hundreds of epidemiology/observation studies on hormone replacement ther-apy (HRT) (see be low) or megavitamin therapy (Spec tor 2009), most of whichyielded incorrect or inconclusive results and essentially none of which satisfied the Hill criteria for validity (Spector and Vesell 2000; 2006). Genome-wide asso- ciation studies, or GWAS, are another example. We have known for decades how to do good clinical science, but the methodologies are often not followed for reasons previously enumerated (Spec tor and Vesell 2002); flawed studies are pub- lished and confusion reigns. Much of the confusion could be eliminated by practicing valid science. The notion that all these unscientific studies are hypoth- esis-generating is ludicrous. Bluming and Tavris challenge the notion that HRT increases breast can- cer in post-menopausal women. Let me give a broad overview of the multifac- eted and overwhelming data that sup- ports the view that HRT causes human breast cancer: 1.Estrogen causes cancer of the breast in female animals. 2.Unopposed estrogen causes cancer of the uterus in humans with a risk of up to twenty times more than aver- age. That is why unopposed estrogen is not given to any woman with a uterus. 3.The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) and then the Million Woman Study (Beral et al. 2011) both showed that HRT in women with a uterus in- creased breast cancer by 40-90 per-SI Nov.

The longer the use and the earlier the start of HRT, the higher the riskof developing breast cancer. 4.The Million Woman Study also showed about a 40 percent increasein incidence of breast cancer for hys- terectomized women who took es- trogen for eight years (Beral et al.2011).

Thewomen in that study were on estro- gen for only three and a half years,and the results are inconclusive(Jungheim and Colditz 2011). 5.After the publication of the WHI study on HRT, the use of HRT fellprecipitously and soon after breastcancer incidence declined, consistentwith HRT causing breast cancer(Beral et al. 2011). 6.Anti-estrogens in post-menopausal women decrease breast cancer inci- dence by a whopping 60-80 percent(Goss et al. 2011). 7.The International Agency for Re - search on Cancer considers HRT (either unopposed estrogen or estro- gen/progesterone combinations) hu - man carcinogens (cancer causing agents) (Jungheim and Colditz2011). So do the FDA and U.S. Supreme Court. 8.The labeling of HRT, approved by the FDA, recommends HRT for theshortest possible time at the lowest possible dose. 9.Bluming and Tavris concede that in a worst-case scenario, there might be a 2 percent increased risk of breast cancer in women on HRT for ten years. This amounts to two hundred thousand more cases of breast cancer per ten million women on HRT for ten years. At the peak of HRT use, many times more women were tak- ing HRT. What are Blum ing and Tavris thinking? Crislip writes an apologia for why, before the definitive studies of HRT began to be published in 1998, physi-cians used HRT broadly. I find his ar- gument unconvincing\u2014in fact worri- some. First, we have known for decades that estrogen causes breast cancer in an- imals and cancer of the uterus in women. There was also substantial data suggesting but not proving that HRT causes breast cancer in women. Second,the FDA wisely rejected (in the 1990s) the manufacturer's claims that HRT de- creased cardiovascular and central nerv- ous system disease. These claims were based on epidemiology/observation studies, but they didn't meet the Hill criteria and turned out to be wrong. The FDA ap proved claims only for HRTdecreasing post-menopausal symptoms and fractures. The FDA wisely ignoredthe unbridled industry-driven hype, un- like many gullible physicians. Third, there were many HRT skeptics, includ- ing this correspondent (Spector and Vesell 2000) and National Institutes ofHealth Director Bernadine Healy, whobegan the WHI studies in 1991 to an- swer the HRT questions definitively. Now, twenty years later, we know that HRT causes breast cancer, strokes, clot-ting, uterine cancer (with use of unop-posed estrogen), cardiovascular disease,and so forth. HRT should not be usedchronically; excellent nonhormonal ways to prevent fracturing have been available since 1996. In fact, I believe a good physician should use only proven therapies for which the risk/benefit ratio favors the patients. That was never the case with HRT, a known carcinogen. Fortu nately,when my sister asked me if she shouldtake HRT for her menopausal symp- toms in the mid-nineties, I said no; it's too risky and its benefits are uncertain. I also wrote about this over ten years ago (Spector and Vesell 2000). To answer the questions on cancer chemotherapy, I recommend my S KEP - TICALINQUIRERarticle \"The War on Cancer\" (Spector 2010). More over, the problems with chemotherapy keep sur-facing. For example, it was shown that for lung cancer patients, hospice care with minimalist chemotherapy was betterthan standard chemotherapy in terms of both quality of care and longevity (Temel et al. 2010). The scandals associated with the so-called targeted chemotherapy\u2014 such as the ineffective, incredibly expen- sive, and risky Avastin in breast cancertreatment\u2014escalate (Tucker 2011). Fi- nally, the authors of a recent long, thoughtful article (Smith and Hillner 2011) argue persuasively, as I did, that there is tremendous overuse of chemo -therapy. The authors point out that \"some oncologists choose chemo therapy in order to maximize their practice income. A system in which one half the profits in oncology [practice] are from drug sales is unsustainable.\" Where is the well-being of the patient in this? A thoughtful, em- pathetic reader will weep. n References Beral, V., G. Reeves, D. Bull, et al. 2011. Breast cancer risk in relation to the interval between menopause and starting hormone therapy.

Of these few, perhaps nomonster has inspired more wild specu-lation than the creature that terrorizedFrance in the 1760s\u2014a monstrous killer that was responsible for perhaps more than a hundred deaths. As a skep- tical investigator of such mysteries, Ihave had a long fascination with thisanimal\u2014often referred to as the Beastof G\u00e9vaudan, or in French as La B\u00e9te. I had it in mind to do a lengthy investi-gation of the historical basis for thecreature when I found that Jay M.Smith's new book, Monsters of the G\u00e9- vaudan , has rendered such an exercise moot. Far more than a monster story, Smith's book breaks down the tale ofimperiled villagers and impotent publicand military responses to the threatwithin the geopolitical context of France's position after its devastating loss to England in a war that effectivelystripped away much of the empire's military clout and standing in the world. This is no simple story of vil- lagers being wiped out by animal at-tacks. Instead, Smith shows that the lurid story of La B\u00e9te is perhaps one of the first examples of media frenzy cre- ating a monster far more spectacular than its likely mundane basis. (If hap- less villagers being torn to pieces by an- imals can be considered mundane \u2014 and Smith makes a pretty good case that it could be at the time.) But not only does the book give us the socialcontext, it also demonstrates how the politicians, clergy, and aristocrats of the region attempted to utilize the beast's attacks for their own political gain.So many books have been written about La B\u00e9te that it is difficult to tease out the facts; even at the time the crea- ture(s) were killing people, the reports described very conflicting details. The clergy at the time bemoaned the loose morals of young people and urged everyone to get back onto a stronger moral track, or else the attacks would continue. Local politicians tried not to look inept in the face of this dire threat and formed hunting parties to try and run the animal to ground. Amateur zo- ologists speculated wildly about whatthe true nature of the animal could be. Broadsheet newspapers printed lurid details of the killings as well as various pieces of fantastic art describing the beast and its supernatural antics. Moreover, as the nascent popular press ran its stories of the beast and thefailed attempts to protect the region from attack, local would-be heroes andhunters from other parts of France dis- covered the perils of bad publicity. Throughout the past century, the overwhelming question about La B\u00e9te has been what was it ? At the time, guesses about the creature's identityranged from wolf to bear to hyena. Awerewolf was also suggested. The \"Jackthe Ripper\" killings of the late 1800s af-fected the La B\u00e9te tale by prompting the theory that the killings were performed by a serial killer. Smith does a good jobof summing up the problem with thiskind of modern interpretation of the legend outside of historical context: \"In the case of the beast, the gradual decon- textualization of its story meant that it eventually became available for 'recon- textualization' in new narrative genres that reflected contemporary concerns or offered the possibility of entertaining reinterpretation of a story with fantastic appeal\" (264). Smith's book also does a fantastic job of retelling the story of La B\u00e9te within its historical context. His pas- sion for that period of French history isapparent in the way he makes these characters and their motivations clear to modern readers. But what about the big question? What was La B\u00e9te? In the opening Smith makes a very compelling case that the terrorizing monster was a pack of wolves that hadbecome unafraid of people. This isn't abook about solving the mystery of what particular animal was responsible for these killings. Instead it explains that such killings were not even rare eventsSlaying the Beast of the G\u00e9vaudan BLAKE SMITH Monsters of the G\u00e9vaudan: The Making of a Beast By Jay M. Smith.

After all, with the emergence ofEuropean tales of the \"big bad wolf,\" it would be quite surprising if wolves never posed a danger. Smith points out that farfrom being innocuous, wolves were probablyresponsible for hundreds to thousands ofdeaths in the previous century to the killingsof La B\u00e9te: The threat was ubiquitous. Rabies-infected wolves claimed well over a thousand French lives in the early modern centuries, and in spite of the modern \"dogma\" that healthy wolves never attack humans, man- eating wolves unhampered by disease killed at least 1,875 people in these same years. Because of huge gaps in the ad ministrative records before the nineteenth century, Moriceau is in clined to put the true num- ber of human fatalities in the early modern period closer to a staggering 9,000.\" (12) Combining details of the killings, char- acter sketches of the aristocrats and hunterswho sought to kill the beast, and modern analysis of how the legend itself has mor- phed over time, this book provides the an- swers to most of the questions I had aboutthe case. Yes, there really were killings; yes,there really were animals to blame; and no, it probably was not a hyena or a werewolf that was responsible for the many gruesomedeaths. But even knowing the culprit was anatural animal, the tale of the developinglegend is still fascinating. If you enjoy mysteries and history, this book has much to offer. While the tragedyof the deaths this creature caused may have diminished over the past two centuries, this book does a great job of giving context to the killings and their rise to infamy a morepoignant and understandable story than I've previously encountered.

I have struggled for years looking for a solution as to why the towers fell and had a hard time believing the planes brought them down. I also had ahard time believing explosives were set at the base of the towers because the collapse seems to occur story by story. Your an - atomy of the WTC collapse makes more sense than anything I have read on the subject. Out- standing article. Thanks again. Richard E. Browning, PE rbrowning@industrial- tech.com Dave Thomas's very specific an - atomy of the collapses at the World Trade Center was ab- sorbing. I do have a couple of ques- tions. If the planes loaded withjet fuel had entered the buildings diagonally, would the buildings have toppled in the direction of the weakened corners instead of falling on their footprints, there - by causing far more damage to the surrounding area? Something else I've won- dered ever since the event: Was there not even one architect or structural engineer somewhere in the country who could see that the risk of collapse was such thatthose 343 firemen needed to get out of there? Don Keith Waterloo, ON, Canada I found it easy to dismiss the demolition theories without re- quiring analytical refutation.These theories introduce far greater problems to address thananything they purport to solve. It seems the \"mastermind\" wouldalmost certainly have to be the president of the United States. What would we do to such a president if he were found out?Clearly he would have to believethat absolute secrecy could bemaintained forever. We can't even keep secrets in the CIA! Many people would have to be involved over an extended time period: demolitions experts, hi- jackers, FBI and Interpol inves- tigators, etc. What if one of the WTC aircraft hijackings had been thwarted by passengers as in the case of Flight 93? One ofthe towers would still be standing with demolitions evidence thatwould have to be removed. Even a flight cancellation or delaywould have created havoc. Whatif WTC 7 hadn't caught fire? Certainly this could not have been guaranteed. Would they have proceeded with the demo- lition? What if the demolition triggers failed due to damage from the aircraft? The list could go on for pages. All of this so we could go to war in Afghanistan?Give me a break! Robin McMeeking Pinckney, Michigan As I read Bartlett and Miller's ar- ticle on the 9/11 Truth move-ment (\"A Bestiary of the 9/11 Truth Movement: Notes from the Front Line,\" SI, July/August), it occurred to me that the more extreme and ridiculous 9/11Truther claims are themselves agovernment conspiracy to dis- credit the more plausible claim that the government chose to in- vade Iraq and steal the secondlargest reserve of oil in the world. But, hey, I'm probably just one of those conspiracy nuts. R. Allen Gilliam Winter Park, Florida I just read Dave Thomas's 9/11 Truth move ment article. Good stuff. I don't hold a brief for the conspiracy seekers, but I think he may be wrong on one point. I thought I'd call it to your atten- tion before one of the Truthers brings it up to try to discredit your effort. On page 38 Thomas says, \"Thermite is simply not practical for carrying out a controlled demolition, and there is no doc- umentation of it everhavingbeen used for that purpose.\" In fact, there was one. In 1933-1934 Chicago held a World's Fair, themed \"A Cen- tury of Progress .\" One of the at- tractions was something called \"The Sky Ride.\" Two 600-foot- tall towers supported cars which passengers rode between at the 200-foot level. After the Fair completed its run the towers were razed. The West tower was brought down by dynamite, the East by ther- mite. Look at the Wikipedia entry for the Sky Ride. I lived in Chicago in the 1940s and visited the park that was once the fair grounds manytimes. One of the tower stumps was still there. Aside from that, a very good article. Joe Ferrari White Plains, New York If I could say one thing to the9/11 Truthers, it would be this: Remember that the officialex- planation for 9/11 is itself a con- spiracy theory. There, now, aren'tyou happy? Richard S. Russell Madison, Wisconsin Thank you for the great article \"A Bestiary of the 9/11 Truth Movement: Notes from the Front Line.\" The authors' dissec- tion of the people who are in- volved in the 9/11 Truth move- ment and their backgrounds, motivations, and the roles they play is truly eye-opening. It an- swers some of my puzzlement and bewilderment over seem- ingly educated, intelligent, andcompetent people (such as the Architects and Engineers for9/11 Truth group) who can be so willfully and deliberately igno- rant. The biggest among the three groups described by the au- thors is the \"illiterati,\" whose\"contributions, almost entirely devoid of genuine intent to findtruth, are almost always nakedly and transparently propagandis- tic\" and whose membership is \"as much a social and recreational[INBOX SI Nov. Dec 11_SI new design masters 9/27/11 12:44 PM Page 62Skeptical Inquirer | November / December 2011 63pursuit as an exercise in critical inquiry.\" Under this definition, I find that \"illiterati\" are everywhere in our society, not just confined to the conspiracy theory circle. You can find them in the comments section of any article published online. Some high-profile, highly charged topics generate hun- dreds or even thousands of com-ments. In a random sampling you will find that only a few of the comments are thoughtful, fair, and even-handed. Most ex- press a point of view entirely fil- tered through the narrow, some- times radical, prism of the commenter's worldview. Some are ramblings seemingly unre- lated to the article, and some are emotional outbursts; some are obviously written by people who never actually read the article. They attack, belittle, and insult the author and the other com- menters. There is no intention or even pretense to engage in con- structive debate to forward and share ideas. The \"illiterati\" are everywhere. It's quite depressing! Mio Sam Lao Princeton, New Jersey SI readers should be aware that Dave Thomas's critique of myanalysis of the destruction of WTC 1, the North Tower of the World Trade Center, is based onassumptions that have no obser- vational or experimental basis. He achieves his large forces by postulating a series of unobserv- able, high frequency micro-jolts, not detectable with the frame rate of an ordinary video camera. As a reality check, I have done a video analysis, titled \"What a Gravity-Driven Demolition Looks Like\" (see www.911speak out.org), showing a known, purely gravitational demolition. In that demolition, as the upper section of the building impacts the lower section, there is signif-icant, measurable, macroscopicdeceleration of the falling sec- tion, just as one would expect. However, in the case of WTC 1, deceleration is noticeably absent.There was no deceleration be-cause there was no significant impact, because 90 percent of the resistance was being eliminated by other means. The problem is not that I (or my peer reviewers) don't know the difference between static and dynamic loads. The problem is that Dave Thomas, and the edi- tors of this magazine, have madethe a prioridecision to defend or- thodoxy in the name of skepti- cism and heap scorn on the true skeptics of the blatantly ideolog- ical official myth of 9/11. David Chandler davidchaler@gmail.com Dave Thomas replies: I appreciate Richard Browning's kind re marks. Don Keith asks some good ques- tions. The consensus is that even if there was some tilt at the start of the tower collapses (and there was), any asymmetry in the collapse of the first panels would quickly be oblit-erated with the increasing down- ward pace of the gravitational av-alanche. The Towers' failure mechanism caused them to fall down on an area somewhat largerthan their footprints, rather than falling over like a felled tree. As re- gards advance warning of the tower collapses, there was at least one failed attempt. This incident is nicely summarized at the Screw Loose Change blog (search on Ganci). Briefly, before the collapses, an \"engineer type person\" warnedNYFD Battalion Chief John Pe- ruggia that the buildings were in imminent danger of collapse. Pe-ruggia promptly dispatched EMT Zarillo to warn Chief Ganci at the command post across the street from WTC 1. Zarillo told Ganci about the collapse danger, but Chief Ganci only had about enough time to say \"Who the f___ told you that?\" be- fore WTC 2 collapsed. Joe Ferrari's good correction re- garding a real thermitic demolition of a radio tower from Chicago's 1933-34 World's Fair is appreci- ated. It did happen, and it was doc- umented in the November 1935edition of Popular Mechanics . You'd think that 9/11 thermite ad-vocates like Steven Jones or NielsHarrit would be interested in a real thermitic collapse, but 9/11 Truthers have simply ignored this new and relevant information. That's probably because the real thermitic demolition required thou- sands of pounds of thermite for just a small radio tower\u2014how much would have been needed for the Twin Towers and WTC 7? David Chandler argues that my explanation for the towers' rapid (but not \"free fall\") collapses is flawed because it was based on assumptions with \"no observational or experimental basis,\" and that I postulated a \"series of unobservable, high frequency micro-jolts, not de- tectable with the frame rate of an ordinary video camera.\" That is not correct. I based my model on com- mon knowledge and the laws of physics. I used the height and massof tower floors, the stiffness of tower columns and supports, and the principle of conservation of energy to estimate the dynamic forces ap- plied by the falling upper sections. Iapplied the law of conservation of momentum to calculate the drop in speed due to the resistance of each floor panel throughout the collapses. I used these speed changes, and Newton's Second Law of Motion, to deduce collision times for each floor panel, and calculated (not \"as- sumed\") that these were brief, on the order of a few milliseconds in my one-dimensional, simplified analysis. If the frame rate of the video Chandler used was far too large to see the rapid and subtle ve- locity changes predicted by my model, that is not the model's fault. But the biggest mistake Chan- dler makes is to state that there is no observational support for my model,which explains how the collapsing towers encountered considerable re- sistance, making them fall at less- than-gravitational accelerations. My model predicts that the early collapses were at 2/3 g and the final stages at 1/3 g. There is observa- tional confirmation of my model, from measurements of the fall of WTC 1 showing that the accelera- tion for the first few seconds was ef- fectively 2/3 g. Who provided this confirmation? David Chandler. My detailed explanation of all this has been available to DavidChandler since August of 2010 at www.nmsr.org/nmsr911c.htm. That he concludes his response to S KEPTICALINQUIRERwith non- scientific polemics is most revealing. What Is Acupuncture? In \"What is Acupuncture?\" (SI, July/August 2011) Novella makes it clear he has no love for acupuncture, but I think hemisses some important positives for acu puncture in his analysis. First, as he accurately points out, acupuncture is quite likely notChinese in origin. Otzi, the five- thousand-year-old Europeanwho melted out of an Italian Alpine glacier, has what appearto be acupuncture points tat- tooed on his skin. This is very early science\u2014a systemic view of healing long before humans un- derstood the circulatory system or nervous system. Whether they had it right or not, healers were plotting what appeared to be complex relationships between symptoms and various non-localareas of the body and were quiteprecise about it. Second, while Novella finds only two studies among the greatnumber of acupuncture studies that meet his criteria as showing no bias, this criticism can be ap- plied to the majority of clinical studies. But the meta-analysis provided by WHO ( Acupuncture. Review and Analysis of Reports on Controlled Clinical Trials ,Xia - orui Zhang, Acting Coordinator, TRM & EDM World Health Organization) shows that for many conditions, acupuncture is significantly more effective than conventional medical treatment. In fact, in the German study that Novella cites (M. Haake et al.'s \"GERAC for Chronic Low Back Pain\") both real and sham acupuncture were more than twice as effective as conventional treatment in reducing low back pain. (Real acupuncture was slightly more effective than the sham version.) Placebo or not, acupuncture works. Robert VeitchMinneapolis, MinnesotaSI Nov. Dec 11_SI new design masters 9/27/11 12:44 PM Page 6364 Volume 35 Issue 6 | Skeptical InquirerSteven Novella, MD, replies: Veitch makes a number of incorrect statements in his response to my acupuncture article. First, he char- acterizes what was being practiced five thousand years ago (whether acupuncture or not) as science. However, there is nothing in the historical record of any culture to in- dicate that scientific methods were being employed at that time. Veitch confuses \"complex\" and \"precise\" practices with scientific practices.However, there are many examples of complex, elaborate, and precisedisciplines that are completely fab- ricated and devoid of any real sci- ence, such as astrology. In fact, the analogy is appropriate, as the ori- gins of acupuncture are closely tied with astrological beliefs. Further, I never claimed there are only two studies of acupuncture devoid of bias. There are many good studies, but there are far more very poor-quality studies. The WHO meta-analysis is highly criticized as being political and misrepresenting the evidence. A recent and rigorous review of systematic reviews ofacupuncture (E. Ernst, M.S Lee,and T.Y. Choi's \"Acupuncture: DoesIt Alleviate Pain and Are There Serious Risks? A Review of Re- views, Pain, April 2011) shows that research has failed to demon- strate that acupuncture is effective for any pain indication. It is essen- tially an elaborate placebo. Finally, Veitch misinterprets the Haake back pain study (which is not surprising\u2014most of the mediaalso did). The study was not de- signed to compare acupuncture to conventional treatment. Patients were selected who had already failed whatever care they were receiving,and in that arm of the study they continued their already-failed care. They were not given any conven-tional treatment as part of the trial. Their group assignment was notblinded, and their outcome was used only as a baseline. The only blinded comparisons in the study\u2014among true, sham, and placebo acupunc- ture\u2014showed no significant differ-ence. In other words, acupuncture does not work. Popper, Kuhn . . . and Ziman Thanks his column about \"Popper vs. Kuhn,\" which brought up many interesting issues (SI, July/Au-gust 2011). The point he made that \"science works well precisely because there is a division oflabor\" between \"puzzle solving\" and \"criticism\" is particularly in- triguing. Some years back I taught a college course called \"Technol- ogy and Human Values.\" On my required reading list was Public Knowledge: An Essay Concerning the Social Dimension of Science by John Ziman (Cambridge Uni- versity Press, 1968). Of course, Ziman wrote many fine books about what science is and how it's done. Still, his exploration in Public Knowledge of the concept that \"science is public knowledge\" offers many valuable insights into how science works in the realworld. Ziman's definition branches off into many fruitful areas, with the notion of a scientific consen- sus\u2014a social factor\u2014at the core. The concept offers key insights into how scientists are trained, the interplay between scientific claims and challenges, and manyother elements within the scien- tific community. Pigliucci's \"divi- sion of labor\" clearly functions within that community. Ziman's long essay sparked many valuable class discussions about the nature of science. I highly recommend it to those in- terested in a somewhat different \"take\" on the subject. (The book no longer seems to be in print, but many college libraries havecopies.) Evan E. Filby, PhDIdaho Academy of Science Women in Science I was surprised that Kenneth W. Krause's otherwise excellent arti- cle \"Women and SI, July/August 2011) failed to discuss the importantinfluence of the lack of role mod- els applying to women's (and mi- norities') choices concerning a scientific career. The psycholog-ical effect of never having seen a woman with a PhD in mathe- matics (and not seeing any pa- pers by one until later in my career) was a strong negative during my time in graduate school from 1973-1978. Fortu- nately, another woman entered the PhD program at the same time, and we were office mates. Together we constituted 66.7 percent of the female enrollment in the mathematics PhD pro- gram at the University of Cali- fornia, River side, for most of my graduate career. My office mate graduated a year before I did and thus became the first woman with a PhD in mathematics Ihad ever known. Both my office mate and I went through crises of doubt and serious considerations of quitting. I was able to buck her up at cru- cial times and she did the same for me. I think neither of us would have finished had the other not been in the program. When one is constantly beingtold how \"weird\" one is for pur- suing such a \"man's\" field and how unlikely it is that one will succeed, it is really hard to persist and to have confidence in one's ability. I'm sure the experience of minor- ity PhD students is similar. The more women and mi- norities enter high-end scienceand advance in their fields, the more appropriate role models there are. So in the last thirty- eight years, there has been a greatimprovement in removing this psychological disincentive for women to pursue PhDs in sci -ence. In 1978, I was the firstwoman with a PhD in mathe- matics hired by my current uni- versity. Now fully half of my de- partment consists of women with mathematics doctorates. All of my younger female colleagues had women as thesis advisors, too. Now all of our students haveplenty of female role models to inspire them and make it seem natural for women to be in the field and to be respected for their contributions. Thus I personally expect more women to pursue high-end science in the next twenty years, simply because the number of women in such careers is reach- ing a critical mass. It is now con- sidered more normal and accept- able for a woman to be in such a career than it ever was before. That really matters for manywomen. Lucy Dechene, PhD Department of Mathematics Fitchburg State University Fitchburg, Massachusetts Kenneth W. Krause replies: Yes, as the new study from Ceci and Williams suggests, women have come a very long way in high-end science. But we should take care not to diminish the plight of our less for- tunate predecessors. In the context of a discussion regarding the historical reality of true discrimination, vague and reduced complaints about the \"psychological disincen- tive\" of not seeing enough womenaround the university might ring hollow. Some women who have ac- tually been victimized might even feel insulted, which I know was not Dechene's intent. And now, as Ceci and Williams also point out, we ap- pear to be faced with a similar but opposite problem: \"bias in favor of women.\" Discrimination against anyone on the basis of gender (or race), I would add, is categorically unacceptable. That said, Else-Quest con- cluded in her earlier study that \"girls will perform at the same level as their male counterparts when they are encouraged to succeed, are given the necessary educational tools, and have visible female role models excelling in mathematics \" (my emphasis). I wonder, though, if in order to be accepted according to one's individual merits, one would be well advised to think of him- or herself as an individual first, rather than as a member of any group.[LETTERS TO THE EDITORSI Nov. Dec 11_SI new design masters 9/27/11 12:44 PM Page 64Skeptical Inquirer | November / December 2011 65S\u00e9ances and Sinkings The assertion that Helen Duncan was prosecuted during World War II for illegally exposing the 1941 sinkings of the HMS Barhamand HMS Hood cannot be entirely correct (Joe Nickell's \"The S\u00e9ances of 'Hellish Nell,'\" SI, July/August 2011). The loss of the Barhamwas revealed only after the war, via film footage (endlessly reused) showing the vessel rolling onto its side as its magazines blew up. The secrecy was feasible because after loosing its torpedoes, U- 331 was too tied up avoiding being rammed and then depth charged to realize its success.That the Barhamwas a little- known, slow, ram-bowed, un-modernized World War I war- ship helped keep its terrible destruction under wraps. The crew of the new Bis- marckwas entirely aware that after having lobbed just five salvos of twenty armor piercing rounds, they had blown up the \"Mighty\" Hood, a ship that had been the terror of war games despite being twenty years old. The Nazi propaganda machine wasted no time in informing theworld that Hitler's fleet had sentthe exceptionally handsomepride of the Royal Navy to the bottom. British authorities made no effort to hide the loss. Not ac- knowledged was Admiral John Tovey's gross error of dividing his powerful battle fleet of four bat- tleships and battle cruisers into two weak divisions. There was wide discussion in the press about how the national tragedy (too similar to the explo- sions that killed almost all aboard three battle cruisers at Jutland in 1916) could have hap -pened, the common myth being that the Hood lacked sufficient deck armor. The real cause of the explosions was the dangerously unstable formulation of British gun propellant. Gregory PaulBaltimore, Maryland Joe Nickell replies:The bogus medium Helen Duncanwas not actually prosecuted for ex-posing secrets but for violating the 1735 Witchcraft Act, although \"it was said\"\u2014belatedly , as I pointed out\u2014that she had revealed the sinking of the Hoodand Barham . Whereas Paul asserts that \"The Loss of the Barham was revealed only after the war\" (i.e., 1945), a member of the HMS Barham as- sociation observes (confirmed by other sources) that it was otherwise. The sinking (which occurred on No- vember 25, 1941) was \"officially published\" in January 1942. He suggests that survivors could have contacted relatives even before the of- ficial announcement and that \"it was local knowledge at the time that the ship had sunk\" (quoted by BBC News, online). As to the Hood, as Paul notes, \"British authorities made no effort to hide the loss.\" Unfortunately (as I noted in my investigative article), there is an online petition calling for Duncan to be pardoned, but I believe only the misinformed and the gullible will sign it. Religious, or Not? I enjoyed Keith Taylor's forumcolumn \"Deliberate Ignorance\" (SI, July/August 2011). However, I saw a statement I just had tocheck. On page 53, he says, \"The last refuge for deniers of hardfacts is religion; every congress- man except Pete Stark of Oak- land claims a belief in a supreme being.\" Until just a few years ago there were six members in the House who were listed as unaf- filiated. Given the general atti- tude of many about atheists and agnostics, that seems like a sen-sible choice. There used to be five to eight members of Congress routinely listed as non-affiliatedor unaffiliated (http://newsweek .washingtonpost.com/onfaith/faithfacts/2007/01/religious_affili- ation_on_capit.html). In the current Congress, none are unaffiliated, but there are five or six who refused to answer. That choice suggests somethinghas changed in the assessment of the religious-political climate.Has this country become more intolerant of atheists and agnos- tics, or are we just hearing more people making an issue of reli-gion when it should be consid- ered as irrelevant to holding a public office? The proclamations seem to have no bearing on per- sonal conduct and, for some, the public disgrace that follows. Arthur R. ThomasGloucester, Massachusetts Mumler's Ghost? In the article \"Photos of July/August Massimo Polidoro states photographer William Mumler died in 1884.Earlier in the article he discussesMumler's photograph of the \"crowd of mourners at the Lon- don Cenotaph on Armistice Day.\" Since the Cenotaph was completed in 1920 and Arm - istice Day originated on Novem- ber 11, 1918, I guess it must have been Mumler's ghost that took that photograph. E.A. Grens Rio Vista, California Immortality's Implications Regarding the review \"Escaping Mortality\" by Daniel Grassam (SI, July/August 2011), I am al- ways baffled by the proponents of life extension for humans who never seem to consider the prac- tical implications of \"immortal- ity.\" Will these immortals be eat- ing food, drinking water, drivingcars, discarding trash, buying houses, and continuing to exploit the earth's diminishing resources? After they retire, will they be col- lecting pensions or Social Secu- rity for, let's see, forever? Our aging population is already put- ting enormous strain on the do- mestic (and world) economy and the environment, so how can we expect that an exponentially in- creasing number of people in a new leisure class will have any- thing but an overwhelmingly neg ative impact on the planet? Even a modest increase in life ex- pectancy will necessarily and profoundly accelerate the growth of human population on the planet and the resultant crises ofresource dis tribution and envi- ronmental damage that we have already begun to see. Unless we quickly find ways to cope with growing demands on our dimin- ishing resources, there may not be any future generations to worry about this problem. Don Mayer Palos Verdes, California Viewing the tor, SI, July/August 2011) dis- cussed the possibility of a time viewer that would not disturb the past. However, we cannot observe without affecting that which we observe in some, possibly minus- cule, way. If the time viewer ex-tracted photons from the past, then the effect of those photons on the past would change. De- pending on how it worked, the time viewer might, in fact, ob- scure the vision of some animal or person, bringing it to injury or death. If used in the same place over a period of time, it might siphon off enough photons to damage vegetation.
