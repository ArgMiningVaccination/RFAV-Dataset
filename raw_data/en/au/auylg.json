This rate agreement supersedes all previous rate agreements/determinations for Fiscal Years 2019 through 2022. SECTION I: RATES - TYPE: PREDETERMINED (FRED) Rates Type From To Off-Campus Base Applicable Function (a) Other Sponsored Activities DISTRIBUTION BASE (a) Modified total direct costs, consisting of all direct salaries and wages, applicable fringe benefits, materials and supplies, services, travel, and up to the first $25,000 of each subaward (regardless of the period of performance of the subawards under the award). Equipment, capital expenditures, charges for patient care, rental costs, tuition remission, scholarships and fellowships, participant support costs as well as the portion of each subaward in excess of $25,000 shall be excluded from modified total direct costs. SECTION II- GENERAL A. LIMITATIONS: Use of the rates set forth under Section I is subject to availability of funds and to any other statutory or administrative limitations. The rates are applicable to a given grant, contract or other agreement only to the extent that funds are available and consistent with any and all limitations of cost clauses or provisions, if any, contained therein. Acceptance of any or all of the rates agreed to herein is predicated upon the following conditions: (1) that no costs other than those incurred by the institution were included in this indirect cost pool as finally accepted and that such costs are legal obligations of the institution and allowable under governing cost principles; (2) that the same costs that have been treated as indirect costs are not claimed as direct costs; (3) that similar types of costs have been accorded consistent accounting treatment; and (4) that the information provided by the institution which was used as a basis for acceptance of the rates agreed to herein, and expressly relied upon by the Government in negotiating and accepting the said rates is not subsequently found to be materially incomplete or inaccurate. B.ACCOUNTING CHANGES: The rates contained in Section I of this agreement are based on the accounting system in effect at the time this agreement was negotiated. Changes to the method(s) of accounting for costs, which affects the amount of reimbursement resulting from the use of these rates, require the prior written approval of the authorized representative of the cognizant agency for indirect costs. Such changes include but are not limited to changes in the charging of a particular type of cost from indirect to direct. Failure to obtain such approval may result in subsequent cost disallowances.

E.DFARS WAIVER: Signature of this agreement by the authorized representative of The University of Illinois at Chicago and the Government acknowledges and affirms the University's request to waive the prohibition contained in DFARS 231.303(1) and the Government's exercise of its discretion contained in DFARS 231.303(2) to waive the prohibition in DFARS 231.303(1). The waiver request by The University of Illinois at Chicago is made to simplify the University's overall management of DoD cost reimbursements under DoD contracts. F.APPLICATION OF RATES: 1. The rates included in Section I are not intended to be applied to Intergovernmental Personnel Act (IPA) costs. If the University of Illinois at Chicago elects to seek reimbursement of indirect costs associated with TA agreements, then the University of Illinois at Chicago and the Office of Naval Research shall establish a special indirect cost rate for IPA agreements in accordance with the provisions of 2 CFR Part 200. Page 2 of 3 2. Application of the appropriate On-Campus or Off-Campus indirect rate(s) is to be determined at the beginning of each sponsored agreement and is to be equitably adjusted if the circumstances which determined the application change materially during the period of performance. a.The On-Campus rate is to be assessed except when a portion of the sponsored agreement is performed at an off-campus site. The criteria for utilization of the off-campus rate consists of all of the following: (a) performance at the off-campus site must be on a continuous basis; intermittent performance is not sufficient; (b) the University personnel working or engaged on the project must be physically located at an off-campus site; and (c) the off-campus performance must be of sufficient duration; normally a full semester, summer term or the period of performance of the sponsored agreement. The off-campus rate will be used for the off-campus portion of the work on a sponsored agreement. b.Off-campus costs may include costs incurred at the off-campus site for salaries, related benefits, supplies, utility costs, rent, local travel and other similar costs, which are treated as direct. Travel to and from an off-campus site is considered an off-campus cost. G.

Taylor Street Rm. 589 Chicago, IL 60612 Application Track: Promising Practices-Multiple Projects The amount of funds requested is $846,851. 1 ABSTRACT The goal of the proposed work is to expand and enhance Illinois' targeted violence and terrorism (TVT) prevention framework. Illinois has been building capacities in school-based help lines and behavioral threat assessment teams, but key gaps remain. This proposal is from the University of Illinois at Chicago, DePaul University, Loyola University, and the Illinois Terrorism Task Force. It builds on Safe2Help Illinois and Illinois' initiative with the National Governors Association, a DHS funded bystander engagement curriculum, and UIC's ongoing trauma, resilience, and violence prevention work. The program focuses on reducing the risk for future violence for youth and young adults who are either convicted of crimes related to TVT, at- risk for involvement in TVT, or vulnerable to involvement due in part to mental health or psychosocial problems. It does so through engaging mental health and psychosocial specialists, other frontline practitioners, and lay adult and youth gatekeepers. It entails three projects: 1) training & capacity building for mental health and psychosocial specialists, other frontline practitioners, and organizational leaders in TVT prevention and care; 2) implementing the CARE bystander engagement intervention, and; 3) mobilizing youth and caregivers to strengthen protective factors in youth. These projects will significantly contribute to a public health prevention framework in Illinois. 2 NEEDS ASSESSMENT Mass shootings in the U.S. continue to rise, with more than 600 in 2020 and 147 thus far in 2021.1 In March 2021, FBI Director Christopher Wray testified that domestic terrorism is a growing threat, with more than 2,000 investigations since 2017.2 In May 2021, DHS established a new Center for Prevention Programs and Partnerships (CP3) which aims to help communities build local prevention frameworks through a whole-of-society approach. 3 CP3 will create new opportunities for local jurisdictions to address these threats in innovative ways, which can include drawing upon what other countries have done well. One lesson learned from combatting international terrorism in other countries is that intelligence and law enforcement strategies need to be complemented with civil society led prevention. 4 In many countries, and to a much lesser extent in the U.S., successful non-law enforcement programs help people move away from domestic terrorism and other forms of violence. One U.S. example is the Colorado Resilience Collaborative, which takes a socioecological approach to preventing terrorism and targeted violence. At the Boston Children's Hospital, a prevention initiative is focused on reducing youth risk for targeted violence and terrorism by reducing mental health problems and increasing social belonging. The Los Angeles County Department of Mental Health's School Threat Assessment Response Team (START), recently evaluated thru DHS funding, provides a comprehensive threat prevention and management program in schools and communities across Los Angeles County.' A second lesson is not to focus exclusively on ideology and de-radicalization. Yes, initiatives should challenge extremist ideology and disinformation, but a wide range of factors explain involvement in violent extremism, and the many pathways into it.6 A socioecological model can identify the modifiable risk and protective factors that mitigate for or against extremist violence (e.g. family support, job prospects, untreated mental health problems). 7 A third lesson learned is to leverage existing evidence-based interventions and best practices in mental health and public health, and to utilize a \"whole of society\" or public health approach to violence prevention.' Public health approaches engage vulnerable individuals and communities without adding to their stigmatization and are tied to broader agendas for building healthy and resilient communities. 9 A fourth lesson learned is to vigorously protect the human rights and civil liberties of individuals and communities involved in targeted violence and terrorism (TVT) prevention, and to uphold racial equity.1\u00b0 The proposed work builds on all these lessons learned. Existing Services and Gaps for the Target Populations in Illinois. Over the past five months, Weine and Alderden met with stakeholders throughout Illinois to better understand the existing TVT prevention assets and gaps. In December 2020, Illinois launched a school safety program called Safe2Help Illinois to raise awareness of 21st century threats facing school children in Illinois.\" This program offers students a safe, confidential way for sharing information that might help prevent suicides, bullying, school violence or other threats to school safety. One key component of Safe2He1p Illinois is a toolkit of resources for parents and educators, developed by West 40, aimed at changing the culture in Illinois schools. Another key component is a 2-day behavioral threat assessment training for schools, conducted by Western Illinois University (co- taught by Dr. Dewey Cornell), which has trained 778 K12 and higher education entities since 2016. The Illinois State Board of Education (ISBE) has other programs focused on child mental health (e.g. AWARE) which offer opportunities for synergy. In March 2021, the State of Illinois was awarded the opportunity to participate in the National Governor's Association (NGA) Police Academy on Preventing Targeted Violence. The NGA 3 academy will bring together Illinois community mental health and public health stakeholders and school officials, in collaboration with public safety, to discuss the availability and current limitations in delivering training, education, and referral services to individuals who may be at risk of engaging in ideologically inspired targeted violence. The proposed work builds on Safe2Help Illinois and the NGA initiative so as to develop an integrated prevention framework for targeted violence and terrorism in Illinois. NIJ funded research in Illinois documented multiple contextual challenges for TVT prevention, including: 1) low trust in law enforcement and security agencies due in part to racial disparities in policing; 2) no clear definition of extremist and targeted violence among community practitioners; 3) not knowing who to report to besides the police, and how information sharing, referrals, and diversion work; 4) not knowing what behavior or statements may precede violence, and; 5) deep concerns about the history of and potential for profiling based on ethnicity, race, or religion. 1 2' 13 In Illinois, the following are critical gaps in programming regarding TVT prevention: 1) lack of coordination and integration between law enforcement and mental health and social service systems and practitioners; 2) lack of adequate prevention, intervention, and supports across the trauma continuum for offenders; 3) lack of specialized expertise in TVT prevention and care among MHPSP; 4) lack of strong practices of violence prevention in Illinois schools and communities; and 5) lack of outcomes and metrics for TVT prevention. The proposed work was designed mindful of all these challenges and gaps. Illinois is concerned with three groups of youth and young adults: Justice-involved: Persons already convicted of behavior related to TVT and re-entering the community. At-Risk: Persons with identified risks for TVT, such as those associated with persons who are radicalized. Vulnerable: Persons with low social belonging, history of victimization, and high intergroup conflict. The proposed work increases preventive services to these groups by providing training and consultation to mental health and psychosocial specialists, other Gaps Projects frontline practitioners, organizational leaders, and lay k f Project I Lac o trained adult and youth gatekeepers. Tertiary/ MHPSS in TVT Training & Secondary who can Capacity Prevention Building for provide services PROGRAM DESIGN This program entails 3 projects which constitute a public health prevention framework for TVT in Illinois. The NOFO objectives for each are below. Secondary/ Primary Project 1: Training & capacity building for mental Prevention health and psychosocial specialists, other frontline practitioners, and organizational leaders in TVT ( prevention and care (Objectives 3 & 5) Primary Goal. To build capacities among mental health and Prevention psychosocial specialists, other frontline practitioners, and organizational leaders statewide in Illinois for providing mental health treatment and psychosocial support to persons who are either at-risk or re-entering the community. Insufficient trusted & informed citizen advocates in local communities Inadequate protective resources against R&R MHPSS in TVT Pro ect 2 Implementing the CARE Bystander , Engagement Pro eel 3 Mobilizing Youth & Caregivers to 1' Protective Factors (b)(4) 4 Problem Statement. A sub-group of persons who either require rehabilitation, are at-risk, or vulnerable, have mental health and psychosocial problems (e.g. depression, substance abuse, family conflict/separation, trauma) that can drive their involvement in TVT and require treatment and support.14 The vast majority of mental health and psychosocial specialists, and other frontline practitioners, do not have adequate knowledge or skills to work in this area.15 Project Description. This project forms a TVT prevention team and targets mental health and psychosocial specialists (psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, counselors), frontline practitioners (e.g. probation officers, teachers, case managers), as well as organizational leaders (from mental health, public health, probation, parole, law enforcement agencies, and relevant community-based organizations who work with the aforementioned persons). It focuses on building capacities for practitioners and their organizations for offering appropriate and effective mental health and psychosocial support. It also aims to develop a network of regional practitioner experts in Illinois who can consult on cases and advance best practices in their regions. The trainings are anchored in socioecological and trauma-informed best practices for violence prevention which target key risk and protective factors (e.g. promoting safety and challenging norms that promote violence)16,17 as well as state of the science research on TVT prevention. 18,19 Practitioners and specialists will be recruited through funded regional mental health hubs (e.g. AWARE), service organizations, and professional networks. Advanced Training for Mental Health and Psychosocial Specialists. This is a 6-hour training for specialists who are or plan to engage in individual work with persons requiring rehabilitation or are at-risk. It covers: drivers of violent radicalization and violence; violence risk assessment; trauma-informed strategies; individual and family therapeutic techniques for diminishing involvement in violent extremism, and; sociocultural adaptation. Basic Training for Other Frontline Practitioners. This is a 3-hour training which introduces frontline practitioners to TVT, concerning behaviors, prevention approaches, the roles of mental health and psychosocial support, and how to link persons to needed services. Training for Organization Leaders. This is a 2-hour training designed to build capacities among managers, executives, and policymakers from mental health, public health, probation, parole, law enforcement agencies, and relevant CBOs in TVT prevention best practices. Curriculum Development. The above 3 trainings will be delivered in a hybrid format which includes pre-recorded videos with slides and readings, and a real-time engagement with an interactive discussion and simulations. In months 1 to 6, the team will meet weekly to build the content, solicit feedback from stakeholders and end users and convert it to the on-line formatting. Expert Consultation on TVT Case Management. Throughout Illinois, the team clinicians will provide mental health and psychosocial specialists and other frontline practitioners with consultation on TVT related case management through both dyadic and group format. The aim is to assist their providing effective care and support and strengthening systems of care. Identifying and Mentoring Local Practitioner Experts. The team will identify and recruit \u20148 local mental health experts from psychiatry, psychology, and social work (2 per Illinois region) who are engaged in and committed to TVT work. The team will provide them with mentorship to increase their capacities in case management for TVT. The team will also invite them to convene together in trainings and presentations so as to network state-wide regional TVT expertise and to engage their support for Illinois TVT prevention. Dissemination through Existing Networks. (b)(4) (b)(4) 5 Project 2: Implementing the CARE Bystander Engagement (Objectives 4 & 1) Goal. Implement the CARE Bystander Engagement Intervention in Illinois communities to strengthen community resilience and facilitate violence prevention and assess its efficacy. Problem Statement. Engaged bystanders are those who intervene when they observe or become aware of behaviors that are potentially harmful. Research has shown that engaged bystanders are crucial to preventing multiple types of violence, including bullying,19-21 sexual victimization,22-26 intimate partner violence,27 and suicide.28,29 Those who frequently interface with adolescents and young adults, such as family caregivers, teachers, park district employees, and local youth program operators, often learn about or see behaviors that are concerning. 30,31 Yet, many of these individuals do nothing31 because they are uncertain what to do with this information, fear being judged negatively for intervening, believe others are better suited or more responsible for intervening, do not recognize the seriousness of the behaviors, 32-34 or are apprehensive about involving others, especially law enforcement. 35 Description. This project entails educating lay adults who frequently engage youth and young adults about TVT and what steps to take action should they identify a concern. Those trained in the CARE bystander engagement intervention do not include those trainect in Project 1 CARE Bystander Engagement Intervention Training Curriculumr )(4) (b)(4) (b)(4) Monitoring & Evaluation. The project will assess the training activities using pre-post assessments and the trained practitioners' capabilities and activities with a fidelity checklist. \"(b)(4) 6 Prior Work. The CARE curriculum was developed through a joint effort between researchers, TVT subject matter experts, and a gatekeeper/bystander prevention curriculum specialist (Afeef, Alderden, Gleicher, Langford, Weine, & Zarse). To inform curriculum development, the researchers reviewed the literature on violent extremism as well as bystander, and gatekeeper theory and interventions and conducted 9 focus groups with 72 participants. 35 The team met regularly over one year to identify training topics and draft the training curriculum. A 15-person pilot training was conducted to get feedback from participants and to observe the training in action. The pilot training was for individuals who worked in public health, human service, social service, and/or education areas. The participants positively endorsed the training, and suggested ways to strengthen the curriculum or training execution. (b)(4) (b)(4) Refining the CARE Curriculum. (b)(4) (b)(4) Selection of Pilot Communities. Once the curriculum has been finalized, the team will identify 4 communities linked with Safe2he1p schools (in Cook County, North, Central, and South Illinois) to implement the training. Communities where ample support service agencies and clinicians have received the training for Project 1 will be prioritized to ensure that the communities have the resources to respond should a need be identified. 7 (b)(4) (b)(4) Implementation of the CARE Curriculum. In each of 4 communities, the team will convene 2 trainings of 20 lay adults (160 total). Each training will consist of online materials and activities that allow for self-directed learning followed by a 2 hr. in-person/remote session. Monitoring & Evaluation. (b)(4) 8 Prolect 3: Mobilizing Youth and Care2ivers to Strengthen Protective Factors in Youth (Objective 2) Goal. To form youth leadership groups and caregiver engagement groups in 4 Illinois communities and to provide training and support to mobilize youth-led resilience building activities and caregiver engagement activities in their schools and communities. Problem Statement. Communities and schools are in need of programs to strengthen protective factors in youth by emphasizing youth empowerment and skill building, enhanced social cohesion and a sense of belonging and security, so as to prevent targeted violence and terrorism in youth. Youth empowerment and engagement in positive social action within their school setting can enhance individual and collective self-efficacy as well as improve school climate toward preventing targeted violence and terrorism. 37,38 Description. Youth leaders and caregivers in 4 Illinois communities who participated in Project #1 and show potential for successful program implementation will participate in skill building curricula and collaborative action planning towards the implementation of the proposed school-wide initiatives. Youth and caregivers will be recruited by project staff with the assistance of school administrators to participate in resiliency training anchored on best practices for violence prevention which emphasize core positive youth development areas. The youth and caregiver curricula will be adapted from existing violence prevention programming developed at the Urban Youth Trauma Center.39 This adapted program emphasizes increased awareness and skills consistent with the critical principles\u00b0 and promotive factors for positive youth development, 41 as well as best practice for violence prevention. 18 Following the skills training, youth and caregivers will be invited to engage in practical prosocial involvement activities comprising individual action planning and collaborative program implementation to co-construct a prosocial school environment that values and recognizes youth, increases supports and connections, provides responsive services, and emphasizes psychological and physical safety. Youth Leadership Training Curriculum. (b)(4) (b)(4) Caregiver Engagement Planning. (b)(4) (b)(4) Monitoring & Evaluation. Baseline, immediate post, and 2-month follow-up assessments will be conducted to evaluate the impact of the program. Domains evaluated will include knowledge and skills gained and youth resilience indicators. Further monitoring and evaluation opportunities could focus on the 3 projects together as part of a \"complex intervention\". 42 (b)(4) ORGANIZATION AND KEY PERSONNEL Stevan Weine M.D. (Program director, Project 1 lead) is Director of the Center for Global Health and a tenured Professor of Psychiatry at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) with 10 continuous federal funding as Principal Investigator since 1998, including two NIH career scientist awards.

She is the principal investigator and co-director of the Urban Youth Trauma Center (UYTC), a SAMHSA funded Treatment Service Adaptation Center within the National Child Traumatic Stress Network, aiming to increase awareness of the needs of youth exposed to community violence and to disseminate interventions for youth with co-occurring trauma, substance abuse, and disruptive behavior problems. Jaleel Abdul-Adil, PhD is Co-Director of the Urban Youth Trauma Center and an Associate Professor of Clinical Psychology in Psychiatry at UIC. He has thirty-years of experience in designing, delivering, and evaluating programs for urban youth and families with particular emphasis on community-based violence (including youth street gangs) and cultural sensitivity strategies (including media-driven models) for ethnic minority populations for multiple funders including the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institute of Mental Health, the Illinois Department of Health and Human Services, and the Illinois Violence Prevention Authority/Illinois Criminal Justice Authority. James Marley, PhD is Associate Dean for Academics and Associate Professor in the School of Social Work at Loyola University Chicago. He has over 35 years of experience in mental health and mental illness as a clinician, researcher, and professor. He is currently involved in a DHS grant awarded to the McCain Institute focused on developing a national Prevention Practitioners Network. Robert Orell is director of Exit USA and has eighteen years of experience in providing interventions for individuals to help their disengagement and reintegration from violent political extremism and organized criminal gangs. Daniel Stanford is an experienced instructional designer, with particular expertise in online training development. The project will work with the Illinois Terrorism Task Force steering committee to address policy matters and will establish another steering committee focused on prevention development and implementation with key community, professional and governmental partners. SUSTAINABILITY This program is designed to continue beyond the life of the two-year funding period. This is approached through: 1) involving local stakeholders in building the prevention framework so that it meets their needs; 2) ongoing dialogue with state and federal governmental stakeholders; 3) disseminating the framework through manualized trainings, online modules, and briefs. Project 1. Over the course of two years the team will engage, train, and network 30 mental health and psychosocial specialists and 50 frontline practitioners. These persons will be available to be engaged in service provision in their communities for vulnerable, at-risk, and convicted youth and adults. After two years, responsibility for engaging their services, or for further training and development, will be transferred to the ITTF or its designate. The team will work with the ITTF 11 and DHS officials and other key entities (e.g. U.S. Courts, Illinois Department of Human Services) to find mechanisms to support practitioners and services. Project 2. The team will work with the ITTF and its member organizations to identify ways the training can be provided to other target audiences across the state. This will include identifying existing learning management systems that can be used to make online content available, document completion, and assess learning outcomes. The team will work to ensure the CARE model capitalizes on existing training resources in the state, such as regional training teams available through local/regional/state associations and state agencies. Projects 3. A manualized protocol summarizing youth and caregiver resiliency training and collaborative action planning activities will be developed to facilitate the dissemination of these activities to new settings. Over the course of the two years, the team will work to enlist the support of individuals at each of the four schools who can continue to support and facilitate these activities on a yearly basis, and will outline procedures for disseminating the program in new settings based on implementation outcomes. By the end of year 2, a list of other potential settings for dissemination of the youth and caregiver protocols will be generated.

For each goal in the IMP, create an Implementation Plan table and a Measurement Plan table. Please use the definitions provided in the IMP guidance document when crafting your plan. Draft, in the box below, the overarching goal statement for the project. Following completion of the IMP, each grantee is expected to complete the Risk Assessment & Mitigation Plan in Appendix A. In the Implementation Plan table: Type each activity in a separate row; add as many rows as needed. Arrange activity rows chronologically by the start date of the activity. This IMP should span both years of performance under this grant program. In the Measurement Plan table: Type each performance measure/indicator in a separate row. Map each performance measure to the relevant activity Include indicators that will help measure the results of the project; it is not necessary to have more than one indicator if that indicator sufficiently measures results. Identify and/or design data collection methods to be used to obtain the data that will be reported on quarterly. Ensure attention to collection of data that can be broken down by sex and age of project participants or beneficiaries. The information in the \"Performance Measures\" column of the Measurement Plan should align with the information in the \"Anticipated Outputs\" column of your Implementation Plan NOTE: Data collection methods should be specific and timebound. Any expenses incurred from the collection of data must come from the grant already awarded. No additional funds will be made available by DHS for this purpose.

Risks could include, but are not limited to: economic, social, or political changes; changes to planned partnerships; legal or compliance changes; or other risks unique to this project. Use the chart below to identify these risks; add additional rows if necessary. Risk Identified Risk Analysis (brief assessment of the impact the identified risk could/would have on the project) Risk Management Plan (plan to minimize the impact that the risk presents to the project and adjustments to be made if the risk transpires) COVID-19 prohibits face-to-face meetings or closes schools Although our team has planned for the possibility of transferring all activities to an online format, there is the potential for the curricula or services to be less effective on-line, or for family/youth engagement to be more difficult. If trainings are to be held virtually, every effort will be placed on ensuring that there is opportunity for interaction and application during training activities. Community members could resist participating in project activities for fear of stigma/ distrust Distrust of law enforcement and government could make recruitment difficult for Projects 1 to 3, which could make it hard to achieve the targeted outcomes. The project has been designed to emphasize community-based approaches to prevention for all communities. We will form a steering committee with strong community representation and respect their suggestions. We will develop messaging which emphasizes that no community is being singled out and which calls for racial equity. 14 CITIZENSHIP: USA E-MAIL ADDRESS: (b)(6) CURRICULUM VITAE STE VAN M.

Personal Statement: I am an associate professor of clinical psychiatry at the University of Illinois, Chicago, and the principal investigator and co-director of the Urban Youth Trauma Center (UYTC), a SAMHSA funded Treatment Service Adaptation Center within the National Child Traumatic Stress Network, aiming to increase awareness of the needs of youth exposed to community violence and to disseminate interventions for youth with co-occurring trauma, substance abuse, and disruptive behavior problems. I have worked in academic and community settings in efforts to bridge the gap between science and practice in support of the application of evidence based practices to support youth impacted by trauma, anxiety, and substance use. I am an associate professor of clinical psychiatry at the Psychiatry Department at the University of Illinois, Chicago, at the Institute for Juvenile Research. In my role as director of the Pediatric Stress and Anxiety Disorders Clinic, I develop and implement clinical programs for anxious youth and their families and lead research and training initiatives. Through my work with UYTC, I adapt, evaluate and disseminate an integrated intervention targeting traumatic stress and substance abuse problems among adolescents, and provide training and consultation on addressing trauma and violence in youth to all members of the youth-serving workforce and community members as a whole. I currently lead research-community collaborations to develop and use treatment and resources for youth affected by traumatic stress and substance abuse. I am the Chair of the Adolescent Trauma and Substance Abuse Committee, a nationally represented group of clinicians and researchers in the fields of trauma and substance abuse and sponsored by the National Child Traumatic Stress Network. I also lead a local cross systems collaboration initiative, currently funded through the Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority, which brings together law enforcement, schools, and mental health services in order to increase the workforce's ability to recognize, identify, connect and provide services to children and adolescents impacted by trauma and violence. With 21+ years of experience working with trauma-related services for diverse populations, I have developed and disseminated clinical intervention programs and led collaborative efforts to develop and disseminate resources addressing trauma, substance use, community violence, and COVID-19. 07/1994 12/1995 07/2000 Psychology Clinical Psychology Clinical Psychology B.

The unique contribution of my research is that integrates acculturation domains (i.e., cultural practices, cultural affiliation, attitudes) and cultural values (i.e., Familismo) into substance use models to better understand risk and protective factors on immigrants and U.S.-born Latinx adults who completed substance abuse treatment (SAT). My current research on protective factors that mitigate the short-term impact of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) on youth OMB No. 0925-0001 and 0925-0002 (Rev. 3/2020 Approved Through 02/28/2023) would shed light on proximal and distal factors that contribute to better outcomes, particularly for those living in low-resource communities. This, in turn, should inform new prevention and intervention programs that capitalize on cross-agency collaboration and community factors that promote sustainable behavior change and reduce existing disparities.

I am particularly interested in examining the relationship between community violence exposure and internalizing and externalizing symptoms in children and adolescents. My research also focuses on intergenerational trauma and barriers to mental health treatment for African-American and Latinx families. I have purposely devoted my research and clinical training to working with low-income and underserved minority populations because while this population often tends to be most at risk, utilization of mental health services is disproportionately low. As a clinician and researcher, I strive to highlight the increased rates of mental illness in urban communities and help to increase mental health awareness in minority children and families. B.

Its membership includes representatives from state, urban area and local government, the private sector, and non-governmental entities. The ITTF provides recommendations and guidance on homeland security laws, policies, protocol, and procedures, with a focus on establishing and maintaining long-term strategic solutions to the threats and realities of terrorism. One of the ITTF responsibilities is to lead homeland security prevention and protection efforts, including violence prevention, throughout the state. As the Chair of the ITTF, I am engaged with several different initiatives across the state that aim to prevent violence, including those that are school and community-based. Your project aligns with much of these efforts and will address existing gaps in services and training in this area.

In this role, I am building a nation-wide Prevention Practitioners Network, managing the Invent2Prevent university project with EdVenture Partners, and advising state and local governments on policies and initiatives for targeted violence prevention. Previously, I served as Regional Director of the DHS Office of Terrorism Prevention Partnerships, established and served as Deputy Director for the U.S. Countering Violent Extremism Task Force, and coordinated all terrorism prevention initiatives across the U.S. Department of Justice. In each of these capacities, I have developed strong relationships with prevention and intervention practitioners around the country. I have known Dr. Weine for many years. As a researcher, thought leader, practitioner, and educator, he has been working with governmental, law enforcement, and community partners to strengthen civil society approaches to preventing targeted violence and terrorism. In January 2021, Dr. Weine and Beth Windisch of DHS invited me to join them in reflecting upon how they could best strengthen Illinois' prevention framework. Dr. Weine is a national and international leader in public health approaches to violence prevention. For the past 12 years, he has been active in the violence prevention space, where he has conducted research on targeted violence and violent extremism prevention, with multiple grants from the National Institute of Justice, Department of Homeland Security, and Department of State. His work has focused on public health and mental health approaches to violence prevention. He is also a leading researcher in global mental health, funded by the National Institute of Health, where his research develops, implements and evaluate psychosocial interventions that are feasible, acceptable, and effective with respect to the complex real-life contexts where at-risk populations live. Dr. Weine's current proposal will help to build Illinois' targeted violence and terrorism (TVT) prevention framework. It focuses on reducing the risk for future violence for youth and young adults who are either convicted of crimes related to TVT, at-risk for involvement in TVT, or vulnerable to involvement due in part to mental health or psychosocial problems. It does so through training and engaging mental health and psychosocial specialists, other frontline practitioners, and lay adult gatekeepers in a public health prevention framework. This is a highly innovative approach, with an outstanding team, excellent partners, and a solid plan for monitoring and evaluation. His project will advance public safety and public health in Illinois and help build a model which can be applied in other states. In sum, I strongly support Dr. Weine's efforts to help build a prevention framework in Illinois and highly recommend that the Department of Homeland Security fund this important project. Thank you for your consideration of this important proposal. Sincerely. /1. , (b)(6) Bet& Steele \u2014 Senior Director of Preventing Targeted Violence McCain Institute for International Leadership 1800 I St NW, Washington DC 20006 McCainInstitute.org info\u00aeMcCainInstitute.org Boston Children's Hospital Until every c is weir HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL TEACHING HOSPITAL May 19,2021 Dear Targeted Violence and Terrorism Prevention Proposal Review Committee, I am writing today with my highest recommendation to the Department of Homeland Security for Dr. Weine's proposed targeted violence and terrorism prevention project entitled, \"Illinois Targeted Violence and Terrorism Prevention\" for the FY2021 Targeted Violence and Terrorism Prevention (TVTP) Grant Program. I am an Associate Professor of Psychology in the Department of Psychiatry at Boston Children's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, and Director of the Trauma and Community Resilience Center. I also lead a DHS-funded local area prevention framework, the Massachusetts Area Prevention Framework. Over the past 15 years I have conducted research and intervention development related to understanding and preventing violent extremism. Through this work, I have become acutely aware of the need for increased training and engagement of mental health practitioners, psychosocial specialists, other frontline practitioners in a TVT prevention efforts. Dr. Weine's current proposal speaks directly to this need, and would be a major advancement both within Illinois and the TVTP field more broadly. Dr. Weine's proposal would significantly advance a public health approach to the prevention of TVT. The array of trainings offered would significantly enhance capacity to respond to TVT prevention needs within Illinois, and bring multi-disciplinary, trauma-informed approaches to the work. The CARE curriculum will address a significant gap, namely the capacity of communities to identify and connect to supportive services individuals demonstrating concerning behaviors. Finally, the youth leadership project provide an evidence-based public health prevention approach that will build critical protective and promotive factors for youth. I have worked closely with Dr. Weine since 2014 when we first collaborated on a U.S. Department of Homeland Security's START project aimed at shifting the national dialogue on radicalization to violence (Countering Violent Extremism/CVE) from a criminal justice frame to one that builds individual and community resilience to all types of violence through social capital. We have since continued to collaborate on multiple projects together and I feel I know him well and am well-suited to comment on his abilities and capabilities and the quality of his current proposal. Dr. Weine is a national and international leader in global mental health and violence prevention. For more than 25 years, he has led an NIH funded program of services research on migration and trauma, with a focus on mental health, HIV risk and prevention, and mixed methods. His research mission to develop, implement and evaluate psychosocial interventions that are feasible, acceptable, and effective with respect to the complex real-life contexts where at-risk populations live. For the past 12 years, he has been active in the violence prevention space, where he has conducted research on targeted violence and violent extremism prevention, with multiple grants from the National Institute of Justice, Department of Homeland Security, and Department of State, and led or otherwise participated in numerous CVE training activities around the globe. His work has focused on public health and mental health approaches to violence prevention. In sum, I have carefully reviewed the proposal being submitted by Dr. Weine and his team, and believe this is an exciting and important innovation that will significantly advance the field. Dr. Weine and his team have developed an innovative prevention framework that builds on the strengths and assets of Illinois, and draws on science and innovation to further a local area prevention framework. I am intimately familiar with the work of his team, including not only Dr. Weine but also Drs. Suarez, Abdul- Adil, and Marley; this is an exceptional team with strong capacity to carry out the proposed work. I give them my highest recommendation. Thank you for your consideration of this important proposal. Sincerely, (b)(6) B.
