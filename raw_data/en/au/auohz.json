(Bill Draft Submitted by Representative Cody 5/30/19, with letter to John Wiesman, Secretary of Health) Name an d title of profession the applicant seeks to credential: Title: Acupuncture and Eastern Medicine: SHB 1865 (formerly East Asian Medicine) Acupunc ture and Eastern Medicine Practitioners (AEMP) East Asian Medicine Practitioner (EAMP) Acupuncturists (L.Ac.) App roximate number of individuals practicing in WA state: There are currently 1,599 active licensed East Asian medicine practitioners in Washington. Of this total, 115 are located out of state. Inf ormation about applicant's organization: Washington Acupuncture and Eastern Medicine Association (WAEMA) is the primary organization representing acupuncturists in Washington State through advocacy and educational efforts. Con tact: Charis Wolf, WAEMA President 2311 of members in the organization: approximately 280 members Appendices - Page A- 9N ames & addresses of national organizations with which the state organization is affiliated: American Society of Acupuncturists (ASA) 4400+ members David Miller (Chair) 4361 N Lincoln, Ave, unit 5 Chicago, IL 60618 Ph: 773-960-8901 National Certification Commission of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (NCCAOM) 17,653 Board Certified Acupuncturists 2025 M St NW, Ste 800 Washington DC, 20036 Ph: 888-381-1140, 202-381-1140 Name of other state or national organizations representing the profession: None States that regulate this profession: 47 states have some form of regulation over the practice of acupuncture, 3 do not. These states have regulations that will include the scope expansion that the profession seeks: Florida, New Mexico, Colorado, South Carolina, Utah, Washington This proposal will be divided into two sections: Clarification of existing scope and expansion of existing scope: Clarification of Existing Scope: 1. Define the problem and why the change in regulation is necessary (refer to RCW 18.120.030(1)). The definition of what is considered acupuncture is not clear enough for the general public and additional clarification is needed to assure that citizens unde rstand the depth and breath of the practice of acupuncture. The problem is that there is currently confusion over the insertion of acupuncture (filiform) needles for therapeutic purposes with other professions using different terminology for the same procedures used by licensed acupuncturists in Washington s tate. RCW 18.120.030 states that: (a) The nature of the potential harm to the public if the health profession is not regulated, and the extent to which there is a threat to public health and safety; Appendices - Page A- 10( b) The extent to which consumers need and will benefit from a method of regulation identifying competent practitioners, indicating typical employers, if any, of practitioners in the health profession; The potential harm to the public is when practitioners are not adequately trained or licensed to practice acupuncture in the state and the consumer becomes confused about what kind of treatment they are receiving and whether it is by a licensed practitioner with the treatment (acupuncture) within their scope of practice. This is not intended to limit other professions from gaining access to acupuncture techniques legislatively with appropriate training , it only assures that these terms will also be understood as the practice of acupuncture, not to be superseded or disallowed by alternative definitions that may arise in the future. To address this problem, we request a clarification in our scope of practice around what is considered acupuncture with the following language: a) (a) ((Acupuncture, including the )) Use of presterilized, disposable needles, such as filiform needles, and other acupuncture needles, syringes, or lancets to directly and indirectly stimulate meridians and acupuncture points, including ashi points, motor points, trigger points, intramuscula r needling, dry needling, and other non- specific points throughout the body. b) (b) Use of electrical, mechanical, or magnetic devices to stimulate meridians and acupuncture points, including ashi points, motor points, trigger points, intramuscular needling, dry needling, and other non- specific points throughout the body. (See attached Exhibit A for a) and b).) Ashi points and trigger points are already defined under the current East Asian Medicine Practitioner, WAC 246-803-030 (10)(b) which states \"For the purposes of this section, includes trigger points as a subset of acupuncture points and Ashi points as recognized in the current practice of East Asian medicine.\" This needs to be clarified in our scope of practice as well to prevent confusion by the general public regarding the practice of acupuncture. Auricular or Ear Acupuncture has always been in the scope of practice for acupuncture as it is just another part of the body that practitioners treat. Due to the popularity of the procedure nationally with the Veteran's Administration for reduction of anxiety, reduction of cravings and stress, often related to PTSD, and the opioid epidemic, we request that auricular acupuncture and the associated protocols be specifically identified to assure that the public clearly understands that this is a form of acupuncture regulated by the Washi ngton State Department of Health. (See attached Exhibit B) Appendices - Page A- 11c) Al l points and protocols for ear acupuncture including auricular acupuncture, national acupuncture detoxification association protocol, battlefield acupuncture, and the Nogier system; The stimulation of the acupuncture and Ashi points, either through insertion of needles or contacting the skin with non- inserting tools is also an existing form of acupuncture treatment. Non-inserting techniques still provide the benefit of acupuncture and are commonly used for children or other sensitive individuals who may have a low tolerance for needle insertion. (See attached Exhibit C) d) Use of contact needling and non- insertion tools that include but are not limited to teishin, enshin, zanshin. 2. Explain how the proposal addresses the problem and benefits the public (refer to RCW 18.120.030(4)). RCW 18.120.030 requires that the public and consumers clearly understand the profession and the treatments that they provide under state law. Other profes sions using acupuncture (filiform) needles therapeutically are practicing acupuncture under a different name causing confusion for the public. We want to assure that any use of acupuncture (filiform) needles for therapeutic purposes is considered acupuncture under the law. Public safety could be at risk with unauthorized use of acupuncture (filiform) needles, coupled with inadequate training and potentially operating outside of their scope of practice. 3. What is the minimum level of education and training necessary to perform the new skill or service based on objective criteria? All of the requested language changes above are already covered in master's level training provided by Washington states' approved acupuncture schools such as Bastyr University and others. The education ranges from 1,500 hours minimum to over 2,000 hours of training depending on the area of focus within the acupuncture and Eastern Medicine profession. A licensed acupuncturist must pass the NCCAOM board certification to practice in WA State. 4. Explain how the proposal ensures practitioners can safely perform the new skill or service (refer to RCW 18.120.030(1) and (4). The objective is to clarify these terms in our definitions for acupuncture under RCW 18.06 to reduce confusion an d clarify existing scope of practice. All licensed acupuncturists in Washington state must be board certif ied by the N CCAOM to be able to practice any of the techniques listed above and must be licensed by the state of Washington. The benefit to the public if regulation is granted is the clarification and reduction of confusion for consumers who are unable to tell what is considered acupuncture treatments by a licensed health care practitioner with acupuncture in their scope of practice. This will assure that the public can identify qualified practitioners; thus, reducing the chance of injury by unqualified practitioners. Appendices - Page A- 125. E xplain how the current education and training for the health profession adequately prepares practitioners to perform the new skill or service (refer to RCW 18.120.030(4)). Address the nature and duration of the education, training, and continuing education, including Washington curricula and accredited/approved out-of- state programs. Be specific on course content and credits/length applicable to the proposal: The clarifications above are not new skills or services for licensed acupuncturists in WA State, only clarifications of existing scope of practice. All of the requested language changes above are already covered in master's level training provided by Washington s tates' approved acupuncture schools such as Bastyr University and others. The education ranges from 1,500 hours minimum to over 2,000 hours of training depending on the area of focus within the acupuncture and Eastern Medicine profession. A licensed acupuncturist must be board certifi ed with the NCCAOM to practice in WA State. 6. Is an increase in education and training necessary? If so, are the approved educational institutions prepared to incorporate the increase? No increase in training is required for the improved clarity related to our existing scope of practice. The practitioner is required under the Uniform Disciplinary Act to have the appropriate training to practice any of the treatments listed above. 7. H ow d oes the proposal ensure that only qualified practitioners are authorized to perform the expanded scope of practice? By clarifying what is considered acupuncture, this should ensure that only qualified practitioners are authorized to perform acupuncture in Washington s tate. 8. If there are other factors in RCW 18.120.030 relevant to the proposal, please address them in detail. In the bill draft is the inclusion of \"treating substance use disorder\" under the definition of acupuncture or Eastern medicine. This is an additional clarification that acupuncture is considered a non-pharmacological approach towards easing symptoms associated with chemical dependency or substance use disorder for the treatment of pain, anxiety, depression, cravings and other related symptoms . Rules adopted by the Office of the Insurance Commissioner reflects this under the Essential Health benefits rule, WAC 284-43-5640 5 (a)(vi) Acupuncture treatment visits without application of the visit limitation requirements, when provided fo r chemical dependency. and cravings related to substance use disorder. (Please see Exhibits I, I.1, I.2, I.3, I.4, I.5) Expansion of Existing Scope of Practice 1. Define the problem and why the change in regulation is necessary (refer to RCW 18.120.030(1)). The problem is that our current statute, RCW 18.06.010 (l), list of approved substances for Point Injection Therapy (PIT) doesn't include local anesthetics, epinephrine and oxygen which are commonly used for PIT and part of the training curriculum for a practitioner approved to provide this treatment. A change in the regulation is needed to include these Appendices - Page A- 13s ubstances that will provide for the comfort and safety of patients receiving this treatment as well as match the education that the pract itioners are receiving for the practice of PIT. Adding these substances will provide patients of acupuncture and Eastern medicine practitioners access to the same substances as are used by other practitioners (physicians, nurse practitioners, naturopaths, physician assistants) who perform trigger point or point injection therapy. (Please see Exhibit D.1, D.2, D.3) To address this problem, we request a change in our scope of practice to include the following language: (j) (l) Point injection therapy as defined in rule by the department. Point injection therapy includes injection of substances, including sterile saline, sterile water, herbs, minerals, vitamins in liquid form, and homeopathic and nutritional substances, and local anesthetics consistent with the practice of acupuncture or Eastern medicine. An acupuncturist or acupuncture and Eastern medicine practitioner using point injection therapy who has met the training and education requirement established in rule may use local anesthetics, oxygen and epinephrine for potential emergency purposes for patient care and safety. a) Local anesthetic is a substance used to temporarily numb a small area of the body and are not considered Controlled Substances in Schedule I- V. Loca l anesthetic use is standard practice in Point Injection Therapy and is used to help numb the pain of certain injections of allowable substances under RCW 18.06.010 (j) for the comfort of the patient. Local anesthetics are currently being used by primary care providers, naturopaths, dental hygienists, midwives and in long- term care facilities by certified nursing assistants through nurse delegation. (See Exhibit D above) b) Epinephrine is an injected substance commonly used to treat allergic reactions such as anaphylaxis. Currently acupuncturists (East Asian Medicine Practitioners -EAMP) are allowed to use an epinephrine injection in the form of an EpiPen autoinjector in RCW 70.54.440. (WAC point injection therapy: 2-hour EpiPen training already required) We are requesting that epinephrine for intramuscular injection be added to the list of injectable substances in statute. (See Exhibit D above) The cost of EpiPens has skyrocketed in recent years and they have a relatively short shelf life. Being able to purchase epinephrine directly from approved wholesale manufactures would make the cost more viable for practitioners to be able to stock this substance and have available in case of emergency. The current WAC requires the epinephrine training but does not require that a practitioner must keep it available in their practice. Current requirements for storing and maintaining EpiPens is cost prohibitive fo r most EAMPs. c) Oxygen (O2) is commonly used for patient care and safety to treat allergic reactions, needle Appendices - Page A- 14s hock and along with epinephrine use, is currently offered in PIT training. Under the current law, if an EAMP wishes to have O2 in their office, a prescription from a primary care provider must be obtained. This is a hardship that is unnecessary. Like the EpiPen, training must be obtained, but neither the EpiPen or O2 in the office is required in order to perform PIT. (See Exhibit D above) 2. Explain how the proposal addresses the problem and benefits the public (refer to RCW 18.120.030(4)). a) Local anesthetics are commonly used by acupuncturists who are legally authorized to perform PIT and other health care practitioners to manage minor pain that may accompany an injection for a patient. This will benefit the public by allowing a measure of comfort for the patients receiving PIT treatments when appropriate. b) This proposal increases public safety by adding oxygen and epinephrine to the list of substances to be used to treat responses that could be associated with PIT. The benefit to the public is that the response time to address an allergic reaction could be lifesaving for a patient. c) Adding these substances will provide patients of acupuncture and Eastern medicine practitioners access to the same substances as are used by other practitioners (physicians, nurse practitioners, naturopaths, physician assistants) who perform trigger point or point injection therapy. (See Exhibit D.1 above) An E AMP will still be required to initiate an emergency response to an allergic reaction under RCW 18.06.140 Consultation with other health care practitioners \u2014Patient waiver \u2014 Emergencies \u2014Penalty, (2) In an emergency, a person licensed under this chapter shall: (a) Initiate the emergency medical system by calling 911; (b) request an ambulance; and (c) provide patient support until emergency response arrives. The addition of local anesthetics, epinephrine and oxygen will provide patients of Acupuncture and Eastern Medicine practitioners (AEMPs) access to the same substances as are used by other practitioner who perform trigger point or point injection therapy (PIT). They are all a part of modern PIT. (see Exhibit D.1) Suppliers of injectables for PIT and educators will have a clear sense of what can be used by an AEMP. It the expanded list of approved substances is accepted; the list would be consistent with other states and with the current training that is available. (Please see Exhibit E.1, E.2) 3. What is the minimum level of education and training necessary to perform the new skill or service based on objective criteria? a) Local anesthetics: As part of current Point Injection Therapy (PIT) training nationally, the use of local anesthetics is commonly taught as part of their curriculum in 24-hour training sessions. According to Christina Captain, DAOM who currently teaches PIT classes in WA, local anesthetics are given a minimum of 1.5 hours of lecture and 8 hours of clinical Appendices - Page A- 15tr aining. The NCCAOM has programs accrediting PIT trainings. The areas where local anesthetics such as lidocaine or procaine are commonly used are trigger points, tendons, scars and adhesions. They are \"points\" of tightness, tenderness, or discomfort anywhere in the body that may affect movement and normal function, or the quality of life of people affected by them. (Exhibit F.1, F.2, F.3) b) Epinephrine and Oxygen : Regarding training in the use of epinephrine and oxygen, of the 24 hours that the DOH requires before performing PIT , up to 2 hours is required for the use of epinephrine. There is ample time within that 2 hours to teach the safe use of epinephrine and oxygen in a clinical setting. (Please see Exhibit G. 1, G.2, G.3 ) 4. Explain how the proposal ensures practitioners can safely perform the new skill or service (refer to RCW 18.120.030(1) and (4). We believe that we can ensure that practitioners can perform the new skill or service listed above in question #3 in addition to the current training required in WAC 246-803-040 Education and training for point injection therapy listed below: WAC 246-803-040: East Asian medicine practitioners employing point injection therapy shall use only those substances and techniques for which they have received training. (1) The education and training for point injection therapy must: (a) Consist of a minimum total of twenty -four contact hours of training in the topics required in this section; (b) Include at least eight hours of clinical practical experience; and (c) Be administered by an instructor that meets the requirements of subsection (4) of this section. (2) A curriculum for a point i njection therapy training program must include: (a) Review of physical examination, contraindications and universal precautions, and differential diagnosis; (b) Compounding and administration of the substances authorized for point injection therapy under W AC 246-803-030 , including aseptic technique, recordkeeping and storage of substances authorized for use in point injection therapy; (c) Emergency procedures; (d) Point injection therapy techniques and contraindication within the East Asian medicine scope of practice relative to the authorized substances listed in WAC 246-803-030 (10)(a)(i) through (vi). (3) Except for the training in the use of intramuscular epinephrine, the training must be delivered in person and not through webinar or other online or distance learning method. (4) An instructor for point injection therapy must have: (a) A health care credential in good standing with a scope of practice that includes point injection therapy; and (b) At least five years of experience in a health care practice that includes point injection therapy. Appendices - Page A- 16(5 ) In addition to point injection therapy meeting the requirements of subsections (1) and (2) of this section, East Asian medicine practitioners using point injection therapy must complete training in the use of intramuscular epinephrine. (a) Training in the use of intramuscular epinephrine must be according to RCW 70.54.440 (4). (b) This training may be taken separately from the training in point injection therapy. (c) Up to two hours of training in the use of intramuscular epinep hrine count in meeting the requirement for twenty -four hours of training. (d) An East Asian medicine practitioner who holds an active credential with a scope of practice that includes the authority to prescribe, dispense or administer epinephrine does not need to meet the requirements of (a) of this subsection. (6) To qualify under this section, the training program shall provide each successful student with a: (a) Certificate of successful completion of the program; and (b) Course syllabus outlining the sc hedule and curriculum of the program. (7) The requirements of subsections (1) through (6) of this section do not apply to an East Asian medicine practitioner who has provided point injection therapy prior to July 1, 2017. East Asian medicine practitioners using point injection therapy prior to July 1, 2017, must have completed training and education in point injection therapy. (8) Any East Asian medicine practitioner performing point injection therapy must be able to demonstrate, upon request of the department of health, successful completion of education and training in point injection therapy. 5. E xplain how the current education and training for the health profession adequately prepares practitioners to perform the new skill or service (refer to RCW 18.120.030(4)). Address the nature and duration of the education, training, and continuing educati on, including Washington curricula and accredited/approved out-of- state programs. Be specific on course content and credits/length applicable to the proposal: All practitioners in WA state must first pass the board certifi ed NCCAOM exams which adequately prepare them to perform the services with the additional training. a) Local anesthetics: As part of current Point Injection Therapy (PIT) training nationally, the use of local anesthetics is commonly taught as part of their curriculum in 24-hour training sessions. According to Christina Captain, DAOM who currently teaches PIT classes in WA, local anesthetics are given a minimum of 1.5 hours of lecture and 8 hours of clinical training. The NCCAOM has programs accrediting PIT trainings. The areas where local anesthetics such as lidocaine or procaine are commonly used are trigger points, tendons, scars and adhesions. They are \"points\" of tightness, tenderness, or discomfort anywhere in the body that may affect movement and normal function, or the quality of life of people affected by them. (See Exhibit F.1, F.2, F.3) b) Epinephrine an d oxygen : Regarding training in the use of Epinephrine and Oxygen, of the 24 hours that the DOH requires before performing Point Injection Training, up to 2 Appendices - Page A- 17hour s is required for the use of Epinephrine. There is ample time within that 2 hours to teach the safe use of epinephrine and oxygen in a clinical setting. (See Exhibit G.1, G.2, G.3) 6.Is an increase in education and training necessary? If so, are the approved educational institutions prepared to incorporate the increase? Yes, an increase in training is necessary for the use of the substances proposed in the scope expansion and would be required under WAC 246-803-040. Currently there are a number of NCCAOM approved educational institutes providing necessary education and training for PIT that includes local anesthetics, oxygen and epinephrine within the 24 hours required . (See Exhibit F.2, F.3, G.1, G.2) 7. How does the proposal ensure that only qualified practitioners are authorized to perform the expanded scope of practice? WAC 246-803-040 Education and training for point injection therapy clearly states that East Asian medicine practitioners employing point injection therapy shall use only those substances and techniques for which they have received training. The new substances would be enforceable under this WAC. The n ew language proposed in the bill draft also includes training requirements: Section 2 (3) Prior to administering local anesthetics, oxygen and epinephrine in providing point injection therapy services, an acupuncturist or acupuncture and Eastern medicine practitioner must obtain the education and training necessary to provide these substance s. The department shall adopt rules by July 1, 2021, to specify the education and training necessary to administer local anesthetics, oxygen and epinephrine. 8.If th ere are other factors in RCW 18.120.030 relevant to the proposal, please address them in detail. (Please see additional research articles in 182019 Acupuncture Scope of Practice Sunrise Follow Up Questions on Applicant Report 1.Pleas e elaborate on how oxygen is administered during point injection therapy. 2. Please provide details on the training provided on the use of oxygen. 3.With the increased risk of an allergic reaction during point injection therapy, should oxygen and epinephrine be required in the offices of acupuncturists that practice point injection therapy? 1.Emergency oxygen is delivered from a cylinder, through a pressure regulator and oxygen tubing, and delivered via a mask . 2. Safety training: The management of anaphylaxis and associated emergency protocol is taug ht during the required 24 hours of training before performing PIT. There is ample time within th e 2 hours safety training requirement to teach the safe use of epinephrine and emergency oxygen in a clinical setting. 3.No st ate that allows PIT requires in office oxygen and epinephrine . We request that it remain optional in WA State. Appendices - Page A- 19Page Numbers for Applicant Report Exhibits Exhibit A.1 I.4 A-202 (document is nearly 500 pages long so just a link is included here) Exhibit I.5 A-203 Exhibit A .1 Evidence that this terminology is a part of acupuncture and is practiced broadly by our profession in the state and the country: Intramuscular Stimulation ( IMS); ( from the Gunn/IMS website) IMS relies heavily on a thorough physical examination of the patient by a competent practitioner, trained to recognize the physical signs of neuropathic pain. This physical examination is indispensable since chronic pain is often neurological as opposed to structural, and therefore, invisible to e xpensive X-rays, MRI Tests, Bone and CT Scans. Failure to recognize these signs will result in an inaccurate diagnosis, and thus, a poor starting point for physical therapy. The treatment involves dry needling of affected areas of the body without injecting any substance. The needle sites can be at the epicenter of taut, tender muscle bands, or they can be near the spine where the nerve root may have become irritated and supersensitive. Penetration of a normal muscle is painless; however, a shortened, super sensitive muscle will 'grasp' the needle in what can be described as a cramping sensation. The result is threefold. One, a stretch receptor in the muscle is stimulated, producing a reflex relaxation (lengthening). Two, the needle also causes a small injury that draws blood to the area, initiating the natural healing process. Three, the treatment creates an electrical potential in the muscle to make the nerve function normally again. The needle used in IMS, by stimulating muscle spindles, essentially becomes a specific and unique tool for the diagnosis of Neuropathic Muscle Pain. 1) In this first article, it is state d, \"Furthermore, because neural dysfunction occurs as the result of radiculopathy, a prime purpose of IMS treatment is to relieve shortening in paraspinal muscles that entraps the in the field of acupuncture know that the Hua Tuo Jia Ji points stimulate the paraspinal muscles and deep nerve roots. These are attributed to a physician living between 110- 207 AD. This link shows how they correspond with nerve root pathways. Incidentally, I learned this inschool in the late 90s and have also attached the chart that I've had on my desk for 20years. https://theory.yinyanghouse.com/theory/tamhealing/huatuo_jiaji_system 3) Finally, we can prove that Gunn's initial work that eventually became known as IMS began with acupuncture inquiry. See reference 1 below. From our previous Sunrise rebuttal: \"[Chan Gunn, MD] Gunn's early work was based on trying to find a modern understanding and presentation for acupuncture . He then developed IMS and began teaching IMS Appendices - Page A- 21(Intramuscu lar Stimulation) i.e. \"dry needling.\"1 Gunn stated, \"It is suggested that, as a first step towards the understanding and acceptance of acupuncture by the medical profession, the present anachronic systems of acupuncture locus nomenclature be dispensed with in favour of a modern, scientific one using neuroanatomic descriptions.\"2 It was a re branding of Intramuscular Stimulation. King, MH, Renwick, GJ. Acupuncture Loci: A Proposal for Their Classification According to Their Relationship to Know Neural Structures. T he American Journal of Chinese Medicine 1976;4(2):183-195. Chart showing neural connections to vertebra which correspond to the Hua Tou Jia Ji points all along either side of the spine: Appendices - Page A- 22Dry Needling (DN) ; \"Trigger point needling (aka dry needling) is not new in the practice of acupuncture. Modern acupuncturists use trigger, motor points, and modern anatomy and physiology in their practices. In addition to the default understanding that most of the classical points are in fact trigger points, and that by extension, acupuncturists can be said to be needling trigger points on a daily basis, the majority of acupuncturists incorporate the understanding and treating of trigger and motor points, as trigger and motor points, into their practices. In 2003, the national certifying body for acupuncture standards, t he National Commission for the Certification of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (NCCAOM), which administers board exams and board certification, surveyed then-current use of trigger and motor points among acupuncturists. Fully 82% of those acupuncturists surveyed reported the use of trigger points in the treatment of pain.\"89 Additionally, the application attempts to cast doubt that trigger points were ashi points. Although previously submitted in written testimony, the following is worth repeating: Ronald Melzack, Ph.D., world-renowned pioneer in the field of pain research, reported that, \"trigger points and acupuncture points for pain [i.e. ashi points], though discovered independently, and labeled differently, represent the same phenomenon and c an be explained in terms of the same neural mechanisms.90 In describing needling trigger points, L. Kalichman, a physical therapist, and S. Vulfsons, a medical doctor, state that a \"very similar method was developed in 7th century by Chinese physician Sun Su -Mo [Sun Simiao], who inserted needles at points of pain, which he called Ah-Shi [ashi] points. From the description of these points, it is clear that they are what are currently referred to as MTrPs [Myofascial Trigger points].\"91 In 2008, two medical doctors, Dorsher and Fleckenstein, demonstrated that 93.3% of the \"common trigger points\" in Travell's Trigger Point Manualcorresponded anatomically to established classical, channel - based acupuncture points.92 Citing further pain an d somatovisceral evidence, they conclude that trigger points and acupuncture points are likely the same physiologic phenomenon.93 The World Health Organization defines trigger points as a subset of acupuncture points.94 89 Fabrey, L, Cogdill, K, Kelley, J.

Evidence Dry needling (DN) is based on using dry needles (i.e. liform, hypodermic hollow-core needles, or other injection needles) to pierce and stimulate trigger points (TrPs).(8,13,14,36) Dr. Travell and her colleagues(13) systematically summarized 255 TrPs in 144 muscles in her popular book, titled Myofascial Pain and Dysfunction: Trigger Point Manual, thus, popularizing TrPs and DN. TrPs, the reactive (painful) points that are not completely fixed in muscle bellies, (8,13,14) are described as \"hyperirritable spots in the fascia surrounding skeletal muscle\". They are associated with palpable nodules in taut bands of muscle fibers. The spot is painful on compression and can give rise to characteristic referred pain, referred tenderness, motor dysfunction, and autonomic phenomena. Dr. Travell admitted to the general public that DN is acupuncture when she stated in a newspaper that \"the medical way of saying it is 'acupuncture.' In our language that means sticking a needle into somebody.\" (37) and in her book, \"many practitioners of acupuncture use several TrP criteria to locate pain acupuncture points and, in fact, are successfully performing dry needling of TrPs that they speak of as acupuncture therapy\".

This White Paper is to provide the authoritative information of dry needling versus acupuncture to academic scholars, healthcare professionals, administrators, policymakers, and the general public by providing the authoritative evidence and expertise regarding critical issues of dry needling and reaching a consensus. We conclude that Dr. Travell, Dr. Gunn, Dr. Baldry and others who have promoted dry needling by simply rebranding (1) acupuncture as dry needling and (2) acupuncture points as trigger points (dry needling points). Dry needling simply using English biomedical terms (especially using \"fascia\" hypothesis) in replace of their equivalent Chinese medical terms. Dry needling is an over-simplified version of acupuncture derived from traditional Chinese acupuncture except for emphasis on biomedical language when treating neuromuscular- skeletal pain (dry needling promoters rede ned it as \"myofascial pain\"). Trigger points belong to the category of Ashi acupuncture points in traditional Chinese acupuncture, and they are not a new discovery. By applying acupuncture points, dry needling is actually trigger point acupuncture, an invasive therapy (a surgical procedure) instead of manual therapy. Dr. Travell admitted to the general public that dry needling is acupuncture, and acupuncture professionals practice dry needling as acupuncture therapy and there are several criteria in acupuncture profession to locate trigger points as acupuncture points. Among acupuncture schools, dry needling practitioners emphasize acupuncture's local responses while other acupuncturists pay attention to the responses of both local, distal, and whole body responses. For patients' safety, dry needling practitioners should meet standards required for licensed acupuncturists and physicians. KEYWORDS dry needling, acupuncture, trigger points, acupuncture points, invasive therapy, evidence, expertise, consensusA.2 Evidence and Expert Opinions Appendices - Page A- 25 84 Chin J Integr Med 2017 Feb;23(2):83-90 \"DN is an invasive procedure in which a solid lament needle is inserted into the skin and muscle directly at a myofascial TrP. A myofascial TrP consists of multiple contraction knots, which are related to the production and maintenance of the pain cycle. ... DN also falls within the scope of acupuncture practice. ... In contrast to most schools of acupuncture, DN is strictly based on Western medicine principles and research.\" A clinical study by Anderson and colleagues (38) shows that TrPs, typical locations of tender points in many patients, were not just soft, but the softest spots in the muscle\u2014 the opposite of what most people would expect. \"A heterogeneous distribution of pressure pain sensitivity and muscle hardness was found,\" which indicates TrPs are not necessarily the \"tightest\" painful spots within muscles. The Yellow Emperor's Inner Classic (Huang Di Nei Jing, which was compiled 2000 years ago)(32) rst documented the reactive (painful) acupuncture point needling strategy and stated that \"the painful point is the site for acupuncture (Yi Tong Wei Shu).\" The term of Ashi point (AKA tender point) was formally coined by Dr. SUN Si-miao (581-682 CE), a famous Chinese physician in the Tang dynasty, for these reactive (painful) acupuncture points. (35) He stated that, \"In terms of the method of Ashi, in speaking of a person who has a condition of pain, when squeezing [that area], if there is a painful spot inside the patient says, \"Ah yes!\" Thus, they are called Ashi points.\" Gunn, et al (23) in 1976 proposed that \"as a first step toward acceptance of acupuncture by the medical profession, it is suggested that a new system of acupuncture locus nomenclature be introduced.\" Gunn and his colleagues started to use the term motor points (TrPs' synonym) as a substitute for the term acupoints in their publication. (24) Expertise Melzack and colleagues(39) published the first evidence-based study comparing TrPs with classic acupoints in Chinese medicine (CM), which was based on reviewing a set of 56 TrPs, and then they compared these to CM classic acupoints that are primarily used to treat regional pain conditions. They found that all 56 TrPs were within 3 cm of an acupoint, and that 71% had the same pain indications as those acupoints studied. This close correlation suggests that TrPs and (classic) acupoints for pain, though ... labeled differently, represent the same phenomenon and can be explained in terms of the same underlying neural mechanisms. The discovery of anatomically defined CM acupoints was profound as it provided a physiologic foundation for how acupuncture might work. Birch (40) challenged Melzack's validity of conclusion and investigated the two categories of acupoints through a broader range of literature. In his review, correlated CM acupoints were defined to exhibit pressure pain, and are used primarily for pain problems. His results showed an 18% rather than 71% correspondence of TrPs and CM classic acupoints for the treatment of pain. He further pointed out that TrPs and (classic meridian) acupoints do not fall into same concept category, and believes that a probable correspondence of TrPs to a different class of acupoints, is the Ashi points. Dorsher and Fleckenstein (41,42) applied different criteria than Melzack for anatomic correspondence and they defined that two points are correlated anatomically if they are within a 2-cm radius of each other and entered the same muscle. They investigated 255 common TrPs and compared them with CM classic acupoints. They found that 238 (93.3%) TrPs anatomically corresponded with classical acupoints. Furthermore, if the TrPs which are located internally and thus not fit for needling are eliminated, the corresponding rate will be even higher. They stated that ''the marked correspondences of the pain indications (up to 97%) and somatovisceral indications (up to 93%) of anatomically corresponding common TrP- classical acupoints pairs provide a second, clinical line of evidence that TrPs and acupoints likely describe the same physiologic phenomena.'' Moreover, the myofascial referred-pain patterns of 76% of TrPs accurately followed relevant meridian distributions. In a further study, Dorsher (43) reviewed four acupuncture texts (three are different from Birch's selection) to examine the validity of Birch's findings. He suggested that TrPs could conceptually be compared to classic acupoints for pain disorders, and that the clinical correspondence was over 95%. Zhou, et al (8) stated that acupuncture ...the Appendices - Page A- 26 85 Chin J Integr Med 2017 Feb;23(2):83-90 commonly used procedure for musculoskeletal pain involves Ashi points with the treatment protocols similar to those of DN. Peng, et al (9,10) compared TrPs and acupoints, and concluded that TrPs used in DN (in Western) is acupoints, within one category of traditional acupuncture points: the Ashi points (literally, \"Ah-yes; this is the needling point\" or tender point), widely used by majority acupuncturists. Zhu and Most (11) systematically reviewed DN history, many scholars' works on its origin, the comparisons of TrPs and acupoints, and they concluded that TrPs are exactly acupoints. They stated, \"TrPs in DN and acupoints in acupuncture are derived from painful spots or tender/tight nodules. Muscle pain can be relieved effectively when the target points are needled. The same phenomenon is given different names.\" Fan, et al (18,36,44) commented that Ashi originally means the reactive pain points, or tender points, while TrPs are only tender points found in muscle bellies; therefore, TrPs completely fall within the Ashi points category. TrPs needling has been widely and internationally used in the daily practices of acupuncturists. Based on extensive literature review and clinical experience, Jin, et al (12) and Hong, et al(45) reached the same conclusion. Liu, et al(46) stated that TrPs are significantly correlated to CM acupoints, including primary channel acupoints, extra acupoints, and Ashi points. TrPs may be considered as a rediscovery of the nature of acupoints, at least for treating pain conditions. Considering the correlation between TrPs and acupoints and the rarely-studied research area involving Ashi points, it may be reasonable to apply the ndings of TrPs as a valuable foundation for future investigation into Ashi points. Ashi points might be central or attachment TrPs, and the most significant characteristic of Ashi points may be pain recognition rather than pressure pain. Other Facts The National Commission for the Certification of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine, the certifying board for licensed acupuncturists, completed an analysis in 2003 that documented the prevalence of DN techniques in the practices of licensed acupuncturists. Of acupuncturists responding, 82% used needling of TrPs in patients that presented with pain. Of patients receiving acupuncture treatment, an estimated 56% present with TrPs pain. (4) AAPAS Comments In traditional Chinese acupuncture using classical CM languages and contemporary biomedical languages, there are at least three categories of acupoints, (33,34) namely Ashi points, classical meridian acupoints and Ashi points commonly include local or distal reactive pain points or called tender points, as well as local foci, local atrophy area, local skin change area, etc. Stimulating such Ashi points is a common strategy in acupuncture for the treatment of (but not limited to) pain due to neuromusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders, and local and sometimes distal illnesses and disorders. The localization of Ashi is largely dependent on the palpitation and searching by the practitioners; sometime its central point location has some variations in different patients with the same condition or even in same patients in different stages of the condition. Classical CM acupoints include 361 points on 14 major meridians, which can be used to treat both local and distal external and internal illnesses and conditions, including pain. The extra-meridian acupoints include at least 1,655 acupoints, which are not located on 14 major meridians, for the treatments of local issues including pain or even distal illness. (47) Both classical meridian acupoints and extra-meridian acupoints are given speci c point- names and originally derived from the Ashi points, their locations are relatively clearer, and basically xed. (33,34) Therefore, classical meridian acupoints and extra meridian acupoints largely overlap with Ashi points when treating the neuromuscular-skeletal pain (DN promoters rede ned it as \"myofascial pain\"). An acupoint is not a spot but an area; (48) in a real clinical practice, each needling zone (\"acuzone\") actually represents an area with one or more central points (a zone can be reached by needle horizontally, generally can be a 2-4 cm radius). Thus it is highly likely that acupoints per se overlap. TrPs largely overlap with both the classic and extra-meridian acupoints category (except for very few TrPs that are located internally, which are only fitting for manual therapy and not for needling) when treating pain. However, from the de nition of TrPs, that they are part of tender points in Appendices - Page A- 27 86 Chin J Integr Med 2017 Feb;23(2):83-90 muscle bellies (in which their locations are not totally xed, regardless of whether they have or do not have hard or tight nodules), the tender points are considered part of Ashi points. It can therefore be concluded that TrPs completely fall within Ashi points category. Definitions from related authors and analyses from independent scholars indicate that, in Western countries, DN does use acupuncture points. TrPs look like a rediscovery of the nature of acupoints, considering that DN has arisen much later than acupuncture (which has had many different schools over time) and DN promoters themselves are either acupuncture professionals or researchers (such as Gunn C, Baldry P, Hong CZ, Ma Y, et al), also, the medical doctors who largely cite acupuncturists' work (such as Travell J, and Simmons D, especially Travell whom is an acupuncture clinical researcher and had involved in planning acupuncture conferences), (37) except that they use the term DN to replace acupuncture to support the TrPs hypothesis, (23,24,18,36,44) help to reveal the reasons and factors for the start of DN. (18,36,44) From all of this, we conclude that DN has resulted from simply rebranding (1) acupuncture as dry needling and (2) acupuncture points as trigger points by simply using English biomedical terms (in \"fascia\" hypothesis) in place of their equivalent CM terms. In addition, Dr. Travell admitted to the general public that DN is acupuncture when she stated in a newspaper that \"the medical way of saying it is 'acupuncture'. In our language that means sticking a needle into somebody\", (37) and acupuncture professionals practice DN as acupuncture therapy and there are several criteria in the acupuncture profession to locate TrPs as acupoints. (13) Her words are very clear: TrPs are acupoints. What Is New About Dry Needling Points (Trigger Points)?Evidence Travell and her colleagues(13) summarized the TrPs' characteristics in their popular book Myofascial Pain and Dysfunction: Trigger Point Manual as: (1) Pain related to a discrete, irritable point in skeletal muscle or fascia, not caused by acute local trauma, inflammation, degeneration, neoplasm or infection; (2) The painful point can be felt as a nodule or bandin the muscle, and a twitch response can be elicitedon stimulation of the trigger point; (3) Palpation of thetrigger point reproduces the patient's complaint of pain, and the pain radiates in a distribution typical of the speci c muscle harboring the trigger point; (4) The pain cannot be explained by ndings on neurological examination. The spot is painful on compression and can give rise to characteristic referred pain, referred tenderness, motor dysfunction, and autonomic phenomena. Dommerholt (3) wrote: \"a myofascial TrP consists of multiple contraction knots, which are related to the production and maintenance of the pain cycle.\" Chen, et al (49) used magnetic resonance elastography (MRE, a modification of existing magnetic resonance imaging equipment to image stress produced by adjacent tissues with different degrees of tension) to image the taut band of a TrP in an upper trapezius muscle and tried to find the cause of myofascial pain symptoms. Their MRE image of the taut band shows the V-shaped signature of the increased tension (50% greater) compared with surrounding tissues. The study suggests that MRE can quantitate asymmetries in muscle tone that could previously only be identified subjectively by examination. In another study with 65 patients (50) with myofascial pain with taut bands, the ndings suggest that while clinicians may overestimate, and current MRE techniques may underestimate, the presence of taut bands, these bands do exist, can be assessed quantitatively, and do represent localized areas of increased muscle stiffness. Shah and colleagues (51) reported a biochemistry study which compared the tissue at active TrPs, latent TrPs and absent TrPs spots in the trapezius muscle and in normal gastrocnemius muscle, measuring pH, bradykinin, substance P, calcitonin gene-related peptide, necrosis as well as pressure algometry. The results showed that subjects with active TrPs in the trapezius muscle have a biochemical milieu of selected inflammatory mediators, neuropeptides, cytokines, and catecholamines different from subjects with latent or absent TrPs in their trapezius. These concentrations also differ quantitatively from a remote, uninvolved site in the gastrocnemius muscle. The milieu of the gastrocnemius in subjects with active TrPs in the trapezius differs from subjects without active TrPs. Appendices - Page A- 28 87 Chin J Integr Med 2017 Feb;23(2):83-90 Expertise Clinical study by Anderson and colleagues(38) shows that TrPs, typical locations of tender points, in many patients, were not just soft, but the softest spots in the muscle\u2014 the opposite of what most people would expect. \"A heterogeneous distribution of pressure pain sensitivity and muscle hardness was found,\" which indicates TrPs are not necessarily the \"tightest\" painful spots within muscles. Baldry (22) indicated that in the West, in 1821 and 1828, Dr. James M. Churchill published the book A Treatise on Acupuncture, using the information gathered from Japan and China. Dr. John Elliottson wrote a paper on acupuncture in 1827. \"Neither of them employed the complex procedures, techniques, meridian and other theories of traditional Chinese acupuncture as they were trying to avoid the rejection of acupuncture by the medical doctors of the time\". Instead, they employed the simplest strategy in acupuncture for the treatment of disease or other conditions \u2014especially neuromusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders, including musculoskeletal (painful) acupoints (now commonly known as TrPs). This simplest strategy in acupuncture is now commonly known as dry needling. Gunn, et al (23) in 1976 proposed that \"as a first step toward acceptance of acupuncture by the medical profession, it is suggested that a new system of acupuncture locus nomenclature be introduced.\" Gunn and his colleagues started to use the term motor points (TrPs' synonym) as a substitute for the term acupoints in their publication. (24) Jin, et al(12) stated that \"any modalities, as long as they apply needles to puncture certain locations at the body surface, belong to acupuncture, in spite of how and where the locations of stimulation are determined and whether by either Western neuro-anatomy or CM meridians \u2014the mechanism of DN and acupuncture are one in the same \u2014which achieves the efficacy via neural reflex arcs.\" \"De-meridian (where the meridian theory is not required for acupuncture and other related modalities) is not equivalent to de-acupuncture (modalities derived from but different from acupuncture) ...DN has de-meridian attributes but it uses acupuncture needles and techniques; therefore it does not have de-acupuncture attributes. In other words, as long as DN applies liform needles to stimulate TrPs, it is in the scope of acupuncture ... to protect the public safety of patients seeking acupuncture, we refute the de-acupuncture claim by DN educators.\" Other Facts The Council of Colleges of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (CCAOM)(4) states: \"'DN' has resulted in redefining acupuncture and re-framing acupuncture techniques in Western biomedical language. Advancement and integration of medical technique across professions is a recognized progression. However, the aspirations of one profession should not be used to redefine another established profession ...It is the position of the CCAOM that these treatment techniques are the de facto practice of acupuncture, not just the adoption of a technique of treatment.\" AAPAS Comments It is clear that Dr. Travell, Dr. Gunn, Dr. Baldry and others promoted TrPs (DN Points) and DN through re-translating and rebranding acupoints, acupuncture techniques, in one form of biomedical language in \"fascia\" hypothesis (by removing terminology of traditional Chinese acupuncture) while acupuncture has many different classical and modern schools, including using traditional Chinese acupuncture languages and various biomedical languages. DN is an over-simplified version (or say, simplest version) of acupuncture derived from traditional Chinese acupuncture except for emphasizing biomedical language when treating neuromuscular-skeletal pain (DN promoters rede ned it as \"myofascial pain\"). TrPs belong to the category of Ashi points in traditional Chinese acupuncture, and they are not a new discovery. Among acupuncture schools, DN practitioners emphasize acupuncture's local response while other acupuncturists pay attention to the responses of the local and distal locations, incorporating the whole body. The \"difference\" in DN points, or TrPs, is that the studies of TrPs try to focus more on local anatomy (especially hypothesis on \"fascia\") while former studies of acupuncture extensively focus on the activities of the central nervous system and hormones changes. Travell, et al systematically summarized the 255 myofascial TrPs on 144 muscles, their manual therapies, and needling techniques (under the term Appendices - Page A- 29 88 Chin J Integr Med 2017 Feb;23(2):83-90 DN, actually TrP acupuncture). It triggers scholars to pay more attentions to the research of local anatomy, biophysics, biochemistry, and imaging of acupoints. Actually there has been more research on the different schools of acupuncture, comparisons among such needling therapies, the relationship among them and the evolution processes of acupuncture globally. It also encourages schools (colleges) of the acupuncture profession to pay more attention to contemporary developments of acupuncture (in different names, terminologies). Acupuncture using biomedical languages is more readily to be accepted by the main medical stream and the general public with Western education background. However, it is also clear that the four characteristics of TrP mentioned by Dr. Travell are not a consensus of all DN scholars and professionals. The taut band, nodule, or local twitch response are probably not a necessary criteria of a TrP, except TrP is a tender point. (33,38) Is Dry Needling a Manual Therapy? Evidence The Federation of State Boards of Physical Therapy (FSBPT)(52) stated that DN is also known as intramuscular manual therapy. Beginning in 2009, the American Physical Therapy Association had recommended the use of the term \"intramuscular manual therapy\" (IMT) to describe the use of acupuncture needles by physical therapists, however, since late 2011, the organization advocates using dry needling as the term of choice. A commercial DN educator, Kinetacore, (53) explains that \"IMT ...the easiest way to think of this treatment is to relate it to a massage. The knots in your muscles that massage therapy often targets are similar areas of treatment for IMT (DN). Often times these knots live at a deep level that ngers and hands just can not get to. Those knots are the goal of IMT. The needles used are very fine, thin, and flexible needles that are quickly tapped into the muscle and causes those knots to decrease, the muscle to loosen, and healing to begin which ultimately decreases pain and increases proper function.\" Dommerholt (3) wrote: \"DN is an invasive procedure in which a solid lament needle is inserted into the skin and muscle directly at a myofascial TrP\". Sportscare Physical Therapy(54) states that \"IMT is an invasive procedure in which a solid filament needle is inserted into the skin and muscle directly at a myofascial trigger point. A myofascial TrP consists of multiple contraction knots, which are related to the production and maintenance of the pain cycle.\" Expertise A medical dictionary(55) de nes \"manual therapy\" as \"(a) collection of techniques in which hand movements are skillfully applied to mobilize joints and soft tissues.\" (Medical Dictionary, \u00a9 2009 Farlex and Partners) Ferguson, (55) Attorney General of Washington State, states that \"DN is not 'manual therapy' as we understand the term\". The National Center for Acupuncture Safety and Integrity (NCASI) (56) states that \"physical therapists contend that their right to practice DN arises by virtue of their right to practice manual therapy. The term manual therapy simply means a remedial treatment consisting of manipulating a part or the whole of the body by hand. It certainly does not include the practice of surgery (severing or penetrating tissues) in any form. Dry needling is acupuncture, not manual therapy\". In regulations of veterinary medicine, acupuncture procedure is often classified as a type of surgical procedures. (57) \"Surgery\" is defined by the American Medical Association (AMA), in part, as \"the diagnostic or therapeutic treatment of conditions or disease processes by any instruments causing localized alteration or transposition of live human tissue which include lasers, ultrasound, ionizing radiation, scalpels, probes, and needles.\" (58) The insertion of acupuncture needles falls well within what is medically considered to be \"surgery\" by the AMA. The American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (AAPM&R) states that \"DN is taught in American acupuncture schools as a form of treatment for individuals using acupuncture needles. DN is an invasive procedure. Needle length can range up to 4 inches in order to reach the affected muscles. The patient can develop painful bruises after the procedure and adverse sequelae may include hematoma, pneumothorax, nerve injury, vascular Appendices - Page A- 30 89 Chin J Integr Med 2017 Feb;23(2):83-90 injury and infection\".(59) AMA policy on DN states that \"DN is indistinguishable from acupuncture\", physical therapists and other non-physicians practicing DN should\u2014at a minimum\u2014 have standards that are similar to the ones for training, certification and continuing education that exist for acupuncture. It emphasizes that \"Lax regulation and nonexistent standards surround this (DN) invasive practice. For patients' safety, practitioners should meet standards required for licensed acupuncturists and physicians\". (60) Other Facts Zhou, et al(8) reviewed DN history and compared the theories and techniques of DN and acupuncture and concluded that DN is a kind of Western acupuncture for treating myofascial pain. DN as a subcategory of acupuncture uses the same needles, similar stimulating points, the same or similar needling techniques, and involves the same biologic mechanisms. Peng, et al (9,10) compared four aspects of DN with acupuncture: the points of the needle insertion, needles, needling techniques, and therapeutic indications. They concluded that DN can be called TrP acupuncture. It is an integral part of the traditional acupuncture. Zhu and Most (11) reviewed four features of needling techniques and explored the similarities and differences between DN and acupuncture. The authors concluded that DN is one type of acupuncture when solid liform needles are used. AAPAS Comments DN is a subset of acupuncture, also called TrP acupuncture. As the term indicates, it involves the procedure of piecing skin and other tissues of the body with different sized needles and is an invasive therapy instead of a manual therapy. For patients' safety, practitioners should meet the standards required for licensed acupuncturists and physicians, as American Medical Association, et al have indicated.

Findings: The term dry needling arose from the need to provide a contrast to the injection of a fluid through a hypodermic syringe [now sometimes referred to as wet needling]. Dry needling does not involve the injection of any substance, merely the insertion of a needle. The history of dry needling is inextricably bound up with the search for effective treatment of painful musculoskeletal disorders. In particular, it was the research into the use of injections, toboth cause and relieve pain in muscular tissue, that led to the development of trigger point theory and then to the use ofdry needling as a treatment. Conclusions: A search of the literature reveals that the important clinical finding that simple dry needling of tender points could produce profound and long-lasting relief of musculoskeletal pain had been published in 1941 and again in 1947. This provoked little interest in the wider academic or clinical community until the focus on acupuncture in the 1970s and the publication of a scientific explanation of the nature of myofascial trigger points in the 1970s and 1980s. Since 2000, there has been a surge in academic interest in dry needling and its use has expanded into the allied healthprofessions of physiotherapy, osteopathy, and chiropractic. K EYWORDS : Dry needling, history, musculoskeletal pain, myofascial trigger points INTRODUCTION Dry needling involves the insertion of needles into tender points in the body without the injection ofany substance. It is used to treat painful musculo- skeletal disorders. The more common approaches, which are best supported by research, target myofascial trigger points (1). Although the history of trigger point theory has been detailed in several publications (2,3), no description of the development of dry needling was found in the literature. In order to provide a historical context for this emerging modality, asearch of the literature was undertaken. The major texts of trigger point theory and dry needling were consulted. The Pubmed, Embase, and Physical Therapy and Sports Medicine databases were searched using the search terms trigger point, myofascial trigger point, tender point, and dry needling. Items retrieved were sorted for relevanceand duplication. The reference lists of the texts andthe key papers were also mined for additional references. Papers were retrieved if they offered the possibil- ity of an initial or early reference to a key concept,finding, or technique, or if they could provide a statement of contemporary knowledge. EARLY TENDER POINT/TRIGGER POINT THEORY Dry needling and trigger point theory emerged fromthe use of injections of anesthetic to treat painfulmusculoskeletal conditions. Before examining the early development of dry needling, it is worth exploring the early research that led to trigger point theory. While the presence of tight bands and tender nodules in muscles has long been recognized in many cultures, their significance in the production Correspondence: David Legge, University of Western Sydney, Sydney, Australia.

Appendices - Page A- 34of pain was not really articulated in the West until the twentieth century. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, a multitude of terms was used to describe pain arising from the muscles, which reflected the lack of coherent understanding.These included muscular rheumatism, fibrositis, rheumatic myalgia, non-articular rheumatism, and fibromyositis (3). The credit for getting on the right track is usually given to John Kellgren (2,4,6). In the late 1930s, Kellgren was working in University College Hospital in London under the supervision of Sir Thomas Lewis. Lewis had experimentally determined that injecting a saline solution into muscular tissue could lead to pain being experienced some distance from the site of the injection. Lewis encouraged Kellgren to explore this phe- nomenon and both researchers published theirfindings in consecutive articles in the British Medical Journal in February 1938 (7,8). Kellgren's paper contained several important observations that have been substantiated by subsequent research: /C15Pain from muscles is often referred. The pattern is specific to the muscle. /C15Tenderness could also be referred. /C15Tenderness was not a useful diagnostic guide unless the patient winced when a tender point was palpated [now known as the jump sign or recognition of painby patient]. /C15Some pain could be relieved by injecting procaineinto acutely tender points which were often at somedistance from the site of the pain. /C15The relief obtained often far outlasted the effects ofthe anesthetic and in many cases could be considered permanent. Kellgren was also the first to publish detailed illustrations of the pain referral patterns from specific muscles (9). Another researcher in the United Kingdom, who variously called himself Gutstein, Gutstein-Good, and finally Good, was also heading in the same direction, also publishing detailed illustrations of the referral patterns of different muscles and beginning, like Kellgren, in 1938 (2). While it is hard to determine the effects of Good's work, there is little doubt that Kellgren's paperstimulated a flurry of interest over the next few years in the United States, the United Kingdom, Europe, and Australia. Exploring the use of anesthetic injection into tender points produced several important findings. Harman and Young (10) published a case series in theLancet , reporting that tender points in thoracic musculature could simulate visceral pain whichcould be eliminated by injecting the points.Working in the United States, Arthur Steindler (11) was perhaps the first to use the term ''triggerpoints''. He reported that many cases of sciatica seem to involve referral from musculo/tendinous/ ligamentous structures rather than from irritation ofthe sciatic nerve. His use of the term ''trigger point'' was not confined to myofascial trigger points. In Australia, Michael Kelly was stimulated by Kellgren's paper to try the anesthetic injection technique for treating somatic pain. He was enthu- siastic about the results and found the injection technique suitable for use in general practice. He wrote a series of papers on the subject between 1941 and 1962, beginning with a letter to the British Medical Journal in 1941 (5). In 1942, Janet Travell and colleagues (12) pub- lished the first paper in what would turn out to be a lifelong contribution to the subject. Their use of the term ''trigger points'' was restricted to tender points in muscles. Travell's name and that of her longtime collaborator, Dr David Simons, became the most closely associated with the concept of myofascial trigger points. Several of these early researchers (5,6) noted the difficulty of finding the most relevant tender pointsand remarked that this contributed to inconsistent clinical results. The earliest paper identified in which the term trigger point occurred either as an index term, keyword, or in the title of a paper was by Pugh and Christie (13). It reported that trigger points were more common in servicemen with a history of musculoskeletal pain [more than 30%] than in those without such a history [3%]. A myofascial trigger point is defined as a hyperirritable spot in skeletal muscle that isassociated with a hypersensitive palpable nodule in a taut band. The spot is tender when pressed and can give rise to characteristic referred pain, motor dysfunction, and autonomic phenomena (4). THE EMERGENCE OF DRY NEEDLING Dry needling did not emerge with any fanfare. It seems to have been an almost incidental develop-ment, arising out of the use of injection therapy to treat musculoskeletal pain. Its acceptance was per- haps bolstered a little by an awareness of the reported effects of acupuncture-type needling. An important paper by Brav and Sigmond published in the United States in 1941 (14) made the claim that pain could be relieved by simple needling without the injection of any substance. It was a notable paper for several reasons. It was the2 D. Legge J Muscoskeletal Pain Downloaded from informahealthcare.com by 211.27.55.240 on 05/29/14 For personal use only. Appendices - Page A- 35first paper found in the literature search that referred to this finding, which is central to the use of dry needling. Brav and Sigmond did not claim the observation as their own, however. The first line of the paper reads: ''The origin of the local and regionalinjection treatment of low back pain and sciatica dates back to the earliest descriptions of acupunc- ture''. It goes on to reference Churchill's publica- tions on acupuncture which were published in 1821 and 1828. The paper is a report of a clinical trial set up to explore several questions, principally the efficacy of anesthetic injection and the importance of the location of the injection. Sixty-two patients present- ing with low back pain or sciatica and without underlying visceral disease were divided into threetreatment groups. Each group received needling into the lumbar paraspinal musculature, close to but not into, the emerging spinal nerve. One group was injected with one percent novocaine, another with normal saline solution, and a third received the insertion of the hypodermic with no substance injected. The novocaine group received the best outcome and the ''dry needling'' [although it was not named as such] came in a close second whichwas described as a ''startling'' result. Brav and Sigmond's paper probably deserves wider recognition for its early and substantial findings. Only one paper was found which refer- enced it (15). That paper was, in turn, referenced by just one other (16) as the first mention of the finding that needling without injection could be effective. The earliest mention of the term ''dry needling'' was by Paulett in the Lancet in 1947 (17). This paper reported on an investigation of 25 cases of low backpain with no evidence of organic disease. It is arevealing look at the nature of experimental inves- tigation of the time with several lines of enquiry being enthusiastically pursued. The part of the paper relevant to this discussion refers to attempts to eliminate pain by injection into the tender points. Paulett established that relief could be obtained not only from the injection of procaine but also by injecting saline and ''even dry needling''. The needling method was described indetail. A relationship was reported between effective treatment and deep needling into the tender points that resulted in a jab of pain and a reflex spasm [local twitch response?] of the muscle. Sub- cutaneous needling or deep needling that was painless did not lead to a beneficial outcome. In the United States, Janet Travell and Seymour Rinzler published a landmark paper on myofascial trigger points (18). It reaffirmed that a trigger pointwas able to cause referred pain, pain that mimicked visceral conditions and autonomic phenomena. It suggested that the intense afferent stimulus from a trigger point was responsible for these phenomena and contained a series of illustrations showing thereferral patterns from 38 muscles which provided a basis for reliable diagnosis and location of trigger points in those muscles. This paper also included the brief and unrefer- enced statement that dry needling could be an effective method of treating myofascial trigger points [the only references provided were to previous papers by the authors themselves]. Several other authors have referenced this article as the earliest use of the term (19,20). It is entirely possible that Travell and Rinzler were aware of the papers by Brav and/orPaulett and based their comment on the findings made in those papers. An article by Steinbrocker, the only author found to have referenced Brav and Sigmond's findings, was referenced in Travell and Rinzler's 1942 paper (12). By the 1960s, the concept of trigger points was established in the medical literature if not common in general practice. Although dry needling had been suggested as a treatment, the usual treatment wasstill the injection of anesthetic into the tender points. Despite the early interest, the 1960s and early 1970s produced almost no important new insights into trigger point theory or dry needling. Only 21 papers published between 1960 and 1975 were found that included a reference to musculoskeletal trigger points. Three of these were reports of iatrogenic pneumothorax from injecting trigger points. The rest were case reports or reviews. No trials were reported. Writing in the Journal of the American Osteopathic Association , Mennell (21) remarks on the slow acceptance of trigger points as acause of muscular pain. No articles are found when dry needling is used as a search term and no mentions of dry needling were found in any papers from this period. ACUPUNCTURE ''ARRIVES'' IN THE WEST In the 1970s, China began opening up to the world.There was a surge of interest in acupuncture, particularly its use for anesthesia and in the treat- ment of painful conditions. A search using acu- puncture as a search term produced 18 papers published in 1971 [a record up to that point], 99 in 1972, and 213 in 1973. While most of the published articles were specu- lative discussions about the possible benefits of acupuncture for the treatment of pain, some clinicalAHistory of Dry Needling 3 J Muscoskeletal Pain Downloaded from informahealthcare.com by 211.27.55.240 on 05/29/14 For personal use only. Appendices - Page A- 36trials were undertaken (19,22-24). Two studies were of particular relevance to the development of dry needling. The trial carried out by Ghia et al. (22) is the first to compare needling at traditional acupuncturepoints verses tender points [dry needling]. It concluded that, as both were effective, the location of the needling perhaps did not matter so much. The important factor was the intensity of the stimulus which was considered to be crucial in producing the analgesic effect. Melzack (24) attempted to compare the locations of acupuncture points and trigger points and claimed a high degree of correlation. DRY NEEDLING AND ACUPUNCTURE DIVERGE Chan Gunn, a United States based physician with an interest in treating pain, became interested in acupuncture in 1974 (25). Over the next few years, he explored the prevalence of tender points in several conditions (26,27) and concluded that most cases of chronic muscloskeletal pain were complicated by additional signs of radiculopathy (28). He developed an approach to dry needling that combined features of acupuncture [type of needles and needle tech-niques] with neurological and tender point models that he called intramuscular stimulation. In 1979, Karel Lewit of Czechoslovakia published what is widely recognized as a landmark paper in the development of dry needling (20). ''The Needle Effect in the Relief of Myofascial Pain'' reported his results when needling tender points without injec- tion. The study was a case series and included only cases of chronic pain. Lewit made several important observations in this paper which have had an impact on the development of dry needling: /C15The effect of the technique depended on the intensity of the tenderness at the point and the accuracy of theneedling. /C15He clearly did not confine himself to myofascialtrigger points in the narrower sense. Tender points inscars, ligaments, and periosteal insertions were allincluded in his study. /C15He used acupuncture needles as well as hypodermictype needles in his treatments and found that theacupuncture needles were safer and produced lessbleeding and bruising. /C15Her described the relief of pain resulting from dryneedling as ''The needle effect''. A year later, in 1980, Gunn published the results of the first clinical trial of dry needling of motor points [not trigger points] for the treatment of low back pain (29). Both Lewit and Gunn were clearly influenced by acupuncture. Gunn was president of the AmericanSociety of Acupuncture. Lewit freely admits to having borrowed the needles of acupuncture to perform his needling. The poor separation between the concepts of dry needling and acupuncture in the 1970s and 1980s isevidenced by the fact that two randomized trials that included dry needling as one of the interventions do not appear when ''dry needling'' is used as a search term. First, MacDonald et al. (30) showed that superficial dry needling of trigger points was super- ior to placebo but he called the treatment acupuncture. Second, Garvey et al. (31) showed that a session of dry needling produced a similar degree of short-term global improvement as did two other injection regimes and cooling spray plus acupressure. In 1989, Gunn published a manual of his intramuscular stimulation system of dry needling.The book Treating Myofascial Pain (25) was the first manual of dry needling with a good description andillustration of techniques for specific conditions. Gunn's unique take on dry needling treatment was that the treatment of the shortened muscles should be combined with the treatment of the relevant spinal segments because the local muscular condi-tion had been precipitated by a radiculopathy or neuropathy at the spinal segmental level. A second edition, Treatment of Chronic Pain (28), was released in 1996. Also in 1989, Peter Baldry, a United Kingdom- based physician with an interest in acupuncture,published Acupuncture, Trigger Points and Musculoskeletal Pain (32). This was a well-illustrated and well-referenced manual that was substantially about dry needling. Importantly, he made some attempt to reconcile trigger point theory withtraditional Chinese acupuncture theory and he did not confine his use of dry needling to myofascial trigger points. A second edition, Myofascial Pain and Fibromyalgia Syndromes (2), was released in 2001. This contained a lot more about the science of pain and myofascial trigger points and a lot less acu- puncture than the first edition. The change of emphasis found in Peter Baldry's updated text (2) was characteristic of way dryneedling was used by the turn of the century. Even though the use of acupuncture needles had become the norm in dry needling, the theory and techniques that dry needling relied on were very different to those used in acupuncture practice (1). Dry needling had become much more closely associated with trigger point theory (33) and with the manual therapy professions rather than the acupuncture profession (1).4 D. Legge J Muscoskeletal Pain Downloaded from informahealthcare.com by 211.27.55.240 on 05/29/14 For personal use only. Appendices - Page A- 37TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY DEVELOPMENTS Only moderate interest was shown in dry needling during the 1980s and 1990s. Less than 30 published papers that included some discussion of dry needlingof tender points were found that were published between 1980 and 1999. The situation rapidly changed after 2000 with around 100 such papers written between 2000 and 2013. The surge in interest in dry needling since 2000 was not just reflected in the academic literature. The increased interest has been worldwide (1,34) and involves the medical, physiotherapy, chiropractic, and osteopathic professions (33). Dry needling courses have become popular in Europe, North America, and Australia. They can also be found inAfrica and the Middle East. There are several plausible reasons that, when taken together, can explain the rapid adoption of the modality. These include the following: /C15The emergence of dry needling using acupuncture needles. While the use of hypodermic syringes tendsto be highly regulated, the use of acupuncture needlesis much less so. Physiotherapists, osteopaths chiro-practors and even massage therapists became free, in many jurisdictions all over the world, to add this therapy to their practices. /C15The basics of dry needling can be taught quite quickly(33). Many current courses introduce the basicmaterial via an on-line component followed by just1 or 2 d of practical instruction. /C15The publication of Travell and Simons' hefty Trigger Point Manuals in 1983 [Volume 1: The Upper Body] (3) and 1993 [Volume 2: The Lower Body] (35)provided a wealth of clinically useful material.Although they did not recommend dry needling asthe main form of therapy, they did contain a guide tothe diagnosis and location of myofascial triggerpoints. /C15The publication of diagnostic instruc- tion for dry needling treatment. /C15The science supporting the importance of myofascial trigger points as a potent source of pain has beenshown to be fairly robust (4,36). Researchers such asSimons, Gerwin, Shah, and Hong have gone a longway towards explaining the physiological and bio-chemical basis of trigger points. There is a growingevidence base supporting the use of dry needling for myofascial trigger points (1,34,37). /C15The clinical experience of using dry needling can be very satisfying for both practitioner and patient.Although it can be a bit hit and miss, a successful dryneedling treatment of a severe and chronic tenderpoint can produce dramatic results. Twenty-four randomized controlled trials were found that included dry needling as a treatment andthere have been several systemic reviews of the literature (38-44) that have included some sort of dry needling in their terms of reference. While the findings of these reviews have been generally supportive of the efficacy of dry needling for painfulmusculoskeletal conditions, the evidence remains far from conclusive. Several styles of dry needling have been described and tend to be simply classified according to depth of insertion (1,16,33). Superficial dry needling involves insertion that does not reach the trigger point and is often just millimeters deep. Baldry's superficial technique is a good example (43). Deep needling, in contrast, aims to penetrate the trigger point or tender point. It is generally agreed that, with deep needling, a local twitch response isdesirable (17,44-46). This is usually accompanied by a characteristic sensation. UNRESOLVED ISSUES Despite the increased attention, there is little con- sensus about the use of dry needling other than as treatment for painful musculoskeletal disorder through the needling of tender points. Some researchers and practitioners restrict the use of dry needling to the deactivation of myofascial trigger points (34,37,47,48). There is no doubt that the science is more robust in support of this use. About 70% of the articles found with significant reference to dry needling were restricted to adiscussion of dry needling as a treatment for myofascial trigger points. It is likely that this is a reflection of its clinical use. Other practitioners support a broader scope of use for dry needling. The earlier practitioners of dry needling included the needling of tender points in tendons, ligaments, and scar tissue as suitable targets (8,11,14,20). In the more recent literature, there is an increased interest in dry needling for tendon prob- lems (40,49-51). Travell and Simons (4) recognizedthat the taut bands produced by active and latent trigger points placed extra strain on tendon inser- tions which resulted in an enthesopathy or an attachment trigger point. As these are considered secondary to the central trigger point, they should resolve if the central point is resolved (52). Direct needling of the enthesopathy is only mentioned briefly. The lack of consensus about what Lewit (20) termed ''the needle effect'' is interesting. The authorsthat subscribe to the concept that the role of dry needling is to de-activate myofascial trigger pointsA History of Dry Needling 5 J Muscoskeletal Pain Downloaded from informahealthcare.com by 211.27.55.240 on 05/29/14 For personal use only. Appendices - Page A- 38tend to focus on its ability to affect the dysfunctional endplate and the taut bands that result (16,34,37). It is likely, however, that the ''needle effect'' has a broader application and, while some will choose to stay within the confines of the robust evidence base,others will continue to extend the scope of practice and include ligamentous, scar, fascia, and possibly articular tissues as suitable targets for dry needling practice. CONCLUSIONS It is clear from this review that the modality of dry needling emerged from the exploration of the role of tender or trigger points as a cause of muscular pain. The earliest mentions of dry needling in theliterature were made in the 1940s (14,17) by researchers who have been insufficiently recognized for their pioneering contribution. The roots of dry needling, and the theory on which it is based, are quite distinct from the practice of acupuncture. However, without the interest in acupuncture in the mid-1970s and the introduction of acupuncture needles into contemporary practice, it is likely that dry needling would never have become an established modality. Once established dry needling was taken up enthusiastically by doctors, physical therapists, andother manual therapists all over the world. While not the exclusive domain of any one discipline (1), dry needling is a ''cheap, easy to learn, low risk, and minimally invasive'' (33) form of therapy that can be combined well with other modalities.

Appendices - Page A- 43NPI: 1548258114 William E. Fassett, PhD, DC , EAMP 4916 N.E. St. Johns Rd. Vancouver, WA 986 61 Via e -mail ( DrShultz@cascadiahealthcare.com) Dear Dr. S hultz: I am pleased to respond to your request for my thinking about whether pharmacists or wholesalers in the State of Washington may legally supply procaine, lidocaine, or other local anesthetics to East Asian medicine practitioners for their use in point injection therapy . Point injection therapy is defined in statute in RCW 18.06.010 (j) as follows: \"(j) Point injection therapy (aquapuncture), as defined in rule by the department . Point injection therapy includes injection of substances, limited to saline, sterile water, herbs, minerals, vitamins in liquid form, and homeopathic and nutritional substances, consistent with the practice of East Asian medicine. Point injection therapy does not include injection of controlled substances in Schedules I through V of the uniform controlled substances act, chapter 6 9.50 RCW, or steroids as defined in RCW 69.41.300; .... \" [Emphasis added ] The department has by regulation defined point injection therapy to include \"subcutaneous, intramuscular, and intradermal injection of substanc es consistent with the practice of East Asian medicine to stimulate acupuncture points, AHSHI points, trigger points and meridians. \" (WAC 246 -803-030(10)(a)) The regulation lists , with greater precision, substances tha t may be used that were included in the statutory definition. The department further implicitly authorizes practitioners using point injection therapy to administer a drug not included in the statute - epinephrine ; the department requires practit ioners to be trained in its use in case of anaph ylaxis (see WAC 246 -803-040(5)) . While the RCW 70.54.440(4 ) for the standards for epinephrine training, it does not cite that statue for the authority for practitioners to administer epineph rine. It does seem to me that the department has authority under RCW 18.06.010(j) to define by regulation additional substanc es - beyond those suggested in the statute - that may be used in East Asian medicine as long as they are consistent with East Asian medicine pra ctice, and that the department has done so . D.1 - PIT - Dr. Fassett Appendices - Page A- 44The department 's current list of medications does not , in my view, include local anesthetics such a s procaine or l idocaine. From a pharmacist 's perspective, the recognized standard classification scheme for drugs and biologicals in the US is the AHFS Pharmacologic -Therapeutic Classification, which is incorporated in the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) and is used by state Medicaid programs and Health Canada. Procaine, lidocaine, and similar agents are separately classified in AHFS category number 72 - Local Anesthetics. (Lidocaine (admi nistered is classified as an antiarrythmic Procaine and lidocaine ar e is an aminoester and li docaine is an aminoamide; neither can be characterized as a fat, car bohydrate, or protein, which are the recognized categories of nutritional agents. Therefore, a pharmacist or wholesaler could not reasonably distribute injectable local anesthetics to East Asian medicine practitioners based on the listing in the WAC. Although they are n ot in the department 's list, these agents are clearly widely recognized as agents used in point injection therapy and in trigger point injection therapy , both in East Asian medicine and in allopathic medicine. I won't repeat multiple citations supporting this conclusion - I assume your group is providing such material to the department. Patients seeking the relief provided by trigger point inje ctions or point injection therapy will have reduced options when seeking care from East Asian medicine practitioners than when seeking care from certain other providers. Other licensed health professional s in Washington that may administer local anesthetics by injection include physicians, nurse practitioners, physician's assistants, dent ists, nurses, pharmacists and d ental hyg ienists; physical therap ists may administer local anesthetics via iontophoresis, which results in measur able levels of the drug at 5 mm or more below the surface of the skin. Two western states recognize local anesthetics as agents for use in point injection therapy . Colorado specifically lists lidocaine and procaine in 4 CCR 738-1, rule 10, effective 5/30/16; New Mexico 's expanded practice formulary includes procaine i n NMAC 16.2.20.8 .F (2)(b)) . My recommendation to your group is to seek the addition of \"local anesthetics specifically manufactured for injection by means of hypodermic needles \" to WAC 246 -803-030 (10)(a). This w ill provide patients of East Asi an medical practitioners access to the same agents as used by other practitioners (physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants) who perform trigger point or point injection therapy.

I have received several referrals from Medical Doctors requesting this therapy as an alternative to surgery or at least an attempt to avoid surgical intervention. The problem I have in meeting the requirements of these referrals stems from our inability to utilize current, researched methods of orthopedic injections. Restrictions prohibiting the use of local anesthetics such as Procaine or Lidocaine diminishes our effectiveness in delivering satisfactory patient outcomes that are up to current industry standards of care. The use and effectiveness of local anesthetics in Point Injection Therapy is well documented. Injectable gasses such as ozone are also widely accepted as a safe and effective Point Injection substance. These substances add to patient comfort and can dramatically improve therapeutic results. Please allow this letter to serve as my petition to our governing body that the addition of local anesthetics and injectable gasses should be added to our scope of practice. Sincerely yours, Andrew Schlabach EAMP D.2 - PIT - Dr. Schlabach Appendices - Page A- 46WA DOH & EAM Advisory Board: My name is Scott Richardson, I am a Doctor of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine. I have 4 year of Graduate lev el training and 2 years of Post Graduate training. In addition to my Masters and Doctorate degrees, I have also studied at Cheng Du University in China and did an apprenticeship in Taipei Taiwan. I am also a NCCAOM credentialed Continuing Education Provider for acupuncturists learning Point Injection Therapy. For the last 6 years I have worked with the Colorado legislation, medical board and pharmacy board developing language regarding the safe practice of P oint Injection Therapy and establishing a list of approved substances that protect the public while providing safe treatments for chronic pain and other conditions. Local anesthetics are commonly used in Point Injection therapy and I would highly recommend including them as a permissible substances. This is consistent with best practices and they are non- narcotic and n on-habit forming . Only a small amount is used and this helps the patient tolerate the treatment. Common local anesthetics are Lidocaine, Marcaine, and Procaine. There is a long established history of safe use with each substance. I would also recommend specifying each substance or category of substances used in Point Injection Therapy. We are in our third revision of permissible substance list due to the language surrounding the substances used. While formulating a concise list may seem tedious, it establishes clear boundaries of what can be used. As a provider and teacher of Point Injection Therapy I would ask that you consider the following list: Local Anesthetics Lidocaine, Marcaine, and Procaine, Dextrose, Glucose, and Maltose, Enzymes, Amino Acids, Vitamins, Minerals, Sterile Herbs, Saline, Hyaluronic Acid, Glucosamine, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Bicarbonate, Ozone and Homeopathic Substances. The use of topical Lidocaine should also be permissible and the use of epinephrine and oxygen should be allowed for patient care and safety. In accordance with best practice s, the use of ultrasound guidance should be permitted to locate anatomical locations and landmarks. Again this protects the patients and increases treatment efficacy. This list is consistent with other states that are establishing a list of permissible substances and is consistent with the training and testing received by acupuncturists. If you have any additional questions or concerns regarding Point Injection Therapy, please to not hesitate to reach out.

Washington 2018 \"Taking the AIT course with Christina has added value to my acupuncture practice that I could not have imagined! The state of Washington only recentlyincorporated acupuncture injection therapy into the LAc scope of practice in2017 so Christina's AIT course was a fantastic opportunity to level up healingtreatments for my patients. I had researched other AIT courses in WA and CObut decided on Christina's and came away very satised. She is aknowledgeable, supportive, and captivating educator. She made the materialeasy to comprehend, digest, and to effectively put to use immediately the nextday in clinic!

ThanksChristina!!!\" Joie 2018 - Washington \"Having taken more courses than I can even try to remember, I have to say that Christina Captain's Acupuncture Injection Therapy course standsout as one of the best. Spread out over three 20 hour weekends, theformat of teaching was one that allowed for proper digestion of the vastamount of information offered. The fact that we were able to practice withB12 and actual homeopathic medicines elevated the whole experience. At Appendices - Page A- 56rst, I was hesitant to take the class because of the way it was spread over the 3 weekends, but, having taken the course, I now understand whyDr. Captain structured the classes in this fashion. Honestly, it's so muchinformation that the time between classes helped me digest it all properly.Dr. Captain is incredibly gifted as an instructor. She's fun and she takesthe time to make sure that each and every student understands thematerial offered, and is able to inject properly. Did I mention that we wereable to practice with ACTUAL B12 and homeopathic medicines becauseTHAT was an amazing bonus! I happened to have been suffering fromacute lower back pain on one of the weekends, so Christina used me as a\"patient in front of class.\" Not only was I able to experience what thetreatments felt like, I was able to see how effective (and quickly) themedicines actually worked.

From 1999 to 2017, I provided testimony, research and served as a subject matter expert for the Colorado Department of Regulatory Agencies in the original adoption of the 1999 Director's policy finding that acupoint injection was in the scope of Colorado licensed acupuncturists to the adoption of the 2016 Injection Therapy rule authorized by the Colorado Acupuncture Practice Act . In providing the subject matter expert opinion on the rule that was eventually adopted, I provided finding s of a literature search for adverse events connected to acupoint injection. I could find no adverse events in the literature regarding substance injection of s aline, sterile water, dextrose, glucose, homeopathic substances, hyaluronic acid, Sarapin, and vitamins with the exception of cyanocobalamin. I conducted a similar search and could not find adverse events on ozone injection therapy. Injection of cyanocobalamin, or vitamin B12 is associated with rare reports of anaphylactic reaction. In addition to B12 injection, acupuncture practitioners in Colorado had been given the authority to use injectable Lidocaine and Procaine since 2004. When the current Rule 10 allowing use of B1 2 and Procaine and Lidocaine were ado pted, there had been no single incident of injury due to injection therapy. Authority to use any form of injectable epinephrine and oxygen was added for practitioners who chose to employ B12 and Lidocaine or Procaine. From 1999 to 2017, I worked at Southw est Acupuncture College in Boulder, CO as a full professor and lead administrator involving curriculum development. In that period, I was responsible for the development of the curriculum that led to the state required education for the New Mexico, where m y college had a branch. In that capacity, I developed the educational curriculum for the use of B12, procaine, and the use of oxygen and epinephrine as part of a safety plan required of acupuncturists who used B12 and lidocaine/procaine. The proposed 24 hours of training are adequate to train LEAP to safely use the expanded list of substances and any emergency medications. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or need further information. Sincerely, Dr. Valerie Hobbs, DAOM, Dipl. O.M (NCCAOM\u00ae) Director, Postgraduate Doctoral Programs - Kris Justesen Letter Appendices - Page A- 6111-20-2018 To Whom it may concern, I have been practicing acupuncture for almost 30 years, APIT has always been an important treatment modality in my work, I have used it and taught it to other professionals. I am very grateful that it has been validated, recognized and regulated in the state of Washington. We have been granted access to many different substances for therapeutic purposes, most of which are included in the chinese pharmacopoeia. Of all of these substances a very important group that I believe should be included in our scope of practice is local anesthetics, since they are used worldwide by health professionals to enhance the effectiveness of point injection therapy. In my professional opinion adding the group of local anesthetics to the list of substances allowed in point injection therapy would benefit the patients, practitioners and our profession as a whole by amplifying the therapeutic benefit of the modalities already in our scope of practice. It reduces the number of needles used in an acupuncture session, frequency of sessions, pain at the injection site and increases absorption of other substances used in the injections due to increased cell membrane permeability. Local anesthetics could be easily integrated into the required training for APIT, as is epinephrine. Thank you for your consideration Sincerely, William B.

Taw, MD, FACP; Eve Henry, MD ABSTRACT Fibromyalgia is a clinical syndrome characterized by chronic widespread pain that is often accompanied by >1 concomitant symptoms (eg, fatigue, poor sleep, cognitive alterations, and mood disturbances). In 2005, an estimated 5 million people in the United States suffered from fibromyalgia, and its growing effect on health- related quality of life is substantial. An increasingly popular hypothesis proposes that noxious, peripheral sensory input might contribute to the initiation and perpetuation of the diffuse pain seen in patients with Lawrence B.

It is a clinical syndrome characterized by chronic widespread pain that is often accompanied by 1 or more concomitant symptoms, including fatigue, poor sleep, cognitive alterations, and mood disturbances.1 ,2 In 2005, an estimated 5 million people in the United States suffered from fibromyalgia,3 and its growing effect on health-related quality of life is substantial.4 ,5fibromyalgia. That theory has led to the evaluation of multiple interventions to stimulate distal areas as a means to modulate the peripheral and central nervous systems. It has been the authors' experiences that the combination of trigger point injections and acupuncture provides improved clinical outcomes. In the current article, the authors present a case report of a patient with fibromyalgia who was successfully treated with an integrative approach that combined acupuncture with trigger point injections. ( .Altern Ther Health Med. 2016;22(1):58-61.) Because the exact etiology of fibromyalgia is unknown, treatment is often directed at symptom control. Medications are commonly used first; however, their use is often limited by adverse effects, which has led many medical practitioners to consider employing a more comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach to improve outcomes. Although the underlying pathophysiology of fibromyalgia has yet to be completely elucidated, a rising consensus exists that fibromyalgia is the result of aberrant pain sensitization.6 Functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have demonstrated that patients with fibromyalgia have increased neuronal activation of the pain processing regions of the cerebral cortex after the application of otherwise innocuous stimuli.7 ,8 Considerable evidence suggests that peripheral nociceptive input may be involved in the initiation and maintenance of the sensitization of the central nervous system (CNS) that is seen in patients with fibromyalgia.9 ,1 0 Resolution of peripheral pain has also been documented to have widespread, systemic effects in fibromyalgia patients. Studies have demonstrated that deactivation of a local tender point not only significantly increased local pain thresholds but also decreased heat and pain sensitivity at distant anatomical sites in patients with fibromyalgia.1 1 58 ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES, JAN/FEB 2016 VOL. 22 N O . 1 Taw\u2014Acupuncture and Trigger Point Injections for Fibromyalgia H.3 - Fibromyalgia Appendices - Page A- 81The increasingly popular hypothesis that noxious, peripheral sensory input may contribute to the initiation and perpetuation of the diffuse pain seen in patients with fibromyalgia has led to the evaluation of multiple interventions, such as trigger point injections and acupuncture to stimulate distal areas as a means to modulate the peripheral and central nervous systems.6 FIBROMYALGIA AND TRIGGER POINTS Myofascial trigger points are small regions of intense tenderness and hyperirritability in muscles or their fascia.1 2 Multiple studies have documented the presence of active trigger points in patients with fibromyalgia, consistent with the idea that those patients have coexisting myofascial pain syndrome.1 3 ,1 4 A recent study described how manual manipulation of active trigger points reproduced the overall, spontaneous pain pattern experienced by patients with fibromyalgia, suggesting that referred pain from trigger points may account for a significant portion of the widespread pain in patients.1 5 Trigger point injections are often used in patients with fibromyalgia to deactivate trigger points, which may be indicated by a local twitch response, and the injections are associated with a decrease in pain symptoms and localized hypersensitivity.1 6 A prospective study has demonstrated that fibromyalgia patients who received trigger point injections had significant improvement in experienced pain intensity, higher pain thresholds, and improved ranges of motion at 2 weeks after the injections.1 7 FIBROMYALGIA AND ACUPUNCTURE A significant anatomical correlation exists between musculoskeletal trigger points and acupuncture points. Melzack et al1 8 reported more than a 70% correspondence between acupuncture points and trigger points. Further analysis has suggested that many of the trigger points identified in fibromyalgia patients could be considered to be ah-shi points (ie, tender and clinically relevant acupuncture points), bringing the correlation closer to 100%.1 9 This overlapping relationship suggests that the benefit observed with trigger point injections may be related to the selection and stimulation of points using the concepts of acupuncture. Numerous research studies have demonstrated the profound analgesic effect that acupuncture can have for patients with pain symptoms.2 0 '2 1 Indications of the involvement of the peripheral and central nervous systems in the underlying mechanism of acupuncture have been present since the mid- to late-20th century.2 2 A growing body of evidence suggests that neuropeptides, such as endorphins in the CNS, may be mobilized by stimulation of the peripheral nervous system through acupuncture.2 3 '2 4 Further studies have demonstrated that the analgesic effects of acupuncture can be transferred between animals through cross-infusion of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) into the third ventricle, and acupuncture induced analgesia can be reliablynegated through infusion of the opiate antagonist naloxone.2 5 Although research on the efficacy of acupuncture in patients with fibromyalgia has been mixed, a number of studies have demonstrated decreased pain and improved quality of life after multiple acupuncture treatments. A recent case series established that acupuncture perform ed specifically at tender points, significantly decreased pain and improved quality of life, as measured by the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire, the Beck Depression Inventory, and the Beck Anxiety Inventory.2 6 One recent systematic review2 7 of published data found 3 randomized clinical trials that demonstrated a positive clinical effect for acupuncture with fibromyalgia patients.2 8 '3 0 In the current article, the authors present a case report of a patient with fibromyalgia who was successfully treated with an integrative approach that combined acupuncture with trigger point injections. CASE REPORT A 54-year-old female visited the authors' clinic with a 14-month history of diffuse body aches that extended from her neck down to her feet, extreme fatigue, insomnia, a sensation of lightheadedness, and multiple chemical sensitivities. Her symptoms had led her to visit 3 academic institutions and 12 medical specialists. She had been given a diagnosis of fibromyalgia by her rheumatologist based on the 1990 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria for the classification.3 1 The woman was initially given venlafaxine and acetam inophen to help manage her symptoms from fibromyalgia. Because she had poor-quality sleep and was not able to perform aerobic or aquatic exercises due to severe fatigue, she was also advised to start sodium oxybate. Unfortunately, with the new medication, she experienced significant adverse effects that required hospitalization. Hypersensitivity to pharm aceutical agents prom pted her to avoid use of further medications for fibromyalgia and to pursue a holistic approach that incorporated more natural therapies. She then visited the authors' clinic. At the time of her evaluation, she was markedly stressed by her prolonged illness. A detailed history was obtained, and the patient' s prior evaluations and work-ups, including blood tests and imaging studies, were reviewed with her. No structural or biochemical abnormalities were identified as the source of her prolonged symptoms. A complete physical exam was then performed, which revealed tight, palpable muscle bands along her neck, back, and gluteal regions and thighs bilaterally. A combination of trigger point injections and acupuncture was performed on a weekly basis for 8 visits. After palpation for active trigger points, treatment was initiated with trigger point injections into the various local muscle groups (Figure 1). The areas to be injected were prepared with alcohol using a sterile technique. A 23-gauge, 2.5-cm needle was Taw\u2014Acupuncture and Trigger Point Injections for Fibromyalgia ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES, JAN/FEB 2016 VOL. 22 NO. 1 59 Appendices - Page A- 82Figure 1 .

After the injection, the needle was removed while pressure was applied to minimize the risk for bruising. The patient was then placed in a comfortable resting position to allow acupuncture to be performed on points that had not yet been deactivated by the trigger point injections. Point prescriptions varied with each visit but often incorporated key distal points, such as Large Intestine 4 (LI-4) and Large Intestine 10 (LI-10), Liver 3 (LIV-3), Stomach 36 (ST-36), Spleen 6 (SP-6) and Spleen 10 (SP-10), Kidney 3 (KD-3), and Yintang (Figure 1). Each point was manually stimulated until the deqi sensation was elicited. Needles were left in place for 20 minutes and then removed. In the course of her treatments, the patient experienced significant improvement in sleep quality, together with decreased pain, fatigue, and lightheadedness. She discontinued use of venlafaxine and acetaminophen, and, further, was able to work full time as a business analyst, exercise, travel regularly, and resume her active lifestyle. At a recent visit to the authors' clinic 4 years after initiation of treatment, she reported being able to maintain her desired level of activity and was receiving regular maintenance treatments once or twice per month. DISCUSSION As in the case with the patient described in the aforementioned report, a significant number of patients with fibromyalgia pursue complementary and alternative medicine as part of their comprehensive treatment program due to an inadequate response to allopathic medicine, adverse effects from conventional care, or patient preference for more natural therapies.3 2 Consistent with the 1990 ACR criteria forclassification of fibromyalgia, this patient had multiple active trigger points. Based on the common features of point location and pain modulation through its proposed effects on the peripheral and central nervous systems, these points were readily identified and effectively deactivated using a combination of acupuncture and trigger point injections. CONCLUSIONS The authors' clinical model uses the novel approach of integrating acupuncture with trigger point injections for patients with fibromyalgia. As trigger point injections and acupuncture have been shown to modulate both the peripheral and central nervous systems, it is possible that the combination of the 2 procedures may have a synergistic effect. It has been the authors' experiences, both in the current case and in other cases, that the combination of the 2 interventions, which use the concepts of acupuncture, provides improved clinical outcomes. This result is noteworthy because fibromyalgia is associated with significant morbidity and limited treatment options. Further research is warranted to examine whether the combination of acupuncture and trigger point injections provides an enhanced clinical benefit in patients with fibromyalgia when compared with either intervention alone.

Purpose: To investigate the efficacy of gluteal trigger point (TP) injections with prilocaine in patients radiculopathy complaining of gluteal pain.Overview of Literature: TP injections can be performed using several anesthetic agents, primarily lidocaine and prilocaine. While several studies have used lidocaine, few have used prilocaine.Methods: A total of 65 patients who presented at the polyclinic with complaints of lower back pain with lumbar disc herniation (based on physical examination and magnetic resonance imaging) and TPs in the gluteal region were included in this prospective compara - tive study. Group 1 comprised 30 patients who were given TP injections, a home exercise program, and oral medications, and group 2 comprised 35 patients who were only treated with a home exercise program and oral medications. The patients' demographic data, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) scores, and Visual Analog Scale (VAS) scores were recorded, and these data were evaluated at 1- and 3-month follow-ups.Results: The ODI and VAS scores of both groups significantly decreased initially and at the follow-up examinations, but the decreas-es were more marked in group 1.Conclusions: We obtained better results with TP injections than only a home exercise program and oral medications in patients with radiculopathy and TPs in the gluteal region.

Asian Spine Journal pISSN 1976-1902 eISSN 1976-7846 www.asianspinejournal.orgReceived Jun 15, 2017; Spine Journal Introduction Lumbar disc herniation (LDH) is one of the most com - mon causes of nerve root pain and results from the dis - placement of the nucleus pulposus inside the vertebral canal. It may also manifest as lumbosacral radiculopathy due to pressure on the spinal nerve roots [1]. This condi-tion presents with dermatomal pain due to compression of the nerve root and weakness and paresis of the muscle groups and can be diagnosed with a positive straight leg raise (Las\u00e8gue) test [2]. Several studies have shown that trigger points (TPs) are common in patients with radicu -H.4 - Lumbar Herniation Point Hernia Asian J ournal 233 lopathy. The presence of TP-related pain in radiculopathy, in addition to peripheral neuropathy, is a major factor of symptom aggravation [3]. TPs are irritable spots in the skeletal muscle and may manifest as palpable nodules [4]. They are common sources of regional neuromuscu - loskeletal pain that are widely accepted by clinicians and researchers [5]. Simons et al. [6] defined TPs as painful foci in a taut band in the skeletal muscle. These foci can be active or latent; active TPs cause spontaneous pain and motor symptoms with nerve stimulation, whereas latent TPs do not cause painful symptoms. In addition, active TPs have shown the presence of chemical mediators, such as bradykinin and serotonin [7]. Pharmacological agents, manual and physical therapy, dry needling, TP injection, and botulinum toxin injections have been widely used for the treatment of TP; however, the most important step is treating the main cause of its pathogenesis [8]. TP injec - tions are primarily performed using lidocaine or prilo - caine, and while several studies have used lidocaine, few have used prilocaine. Therefore, we investigated the efficacy of gluteal TP injections using prilocaine in patients with lumbosacral radiculopathy and pain in the gluteal region. Materials and Methods 1. Subject The present study initially evaluated data from 275 pa - tients who were diagnosed with LDH based on clinical examination and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) between November 2013 and March 2014. The study in - cluded 65 patients with LDH with or without spinal canal stenosis of 20%-30% on lumbar MRI or TPs associated with canal stenosis. The patients with LDH comprised the main study group, and some of these patients had ac - companying spinal stenosis. A problem for patients is that it is nearly impossible to create a specific group excluding spinal stenosis. In addition, some patients have stenosis outside the limits of the accepted stenotic value [3,4]. We expected that spinal stenosis was accompanied by findings of disc and nerve root pressure. Three clinicians in the Department of Neurosurgery evaluated all the patients and their images and reached a consensus on all decisions regarding medical and physical therapy. Patients with concomitant conditions, such as sciatalgia, piriformis syn - drome, previous surgery in the gluteal region, metastatic carcinoma, or a history of using a prosthesis compromis - ing hip biomechanics, were excluded from the study. The patients were divided into two groups. Patients in group 1 were given injection therapy, a home exercise program, and oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, and those in group 2 received the home exercise program and oral medications only. In patients given injection therapy, TPs were detected with patients in the prone position using the flat palpation technique in which the taut band and TPs were localized in the superolateral gluteal region and compressed be - tween the thumb and index finger and against the under - lying bone and soft tissue [9]. The diagnostic criteria for a TP include the presence of a hypersensitive spot and pa - tient recognition of the elicited pain as it is being felt, the presence of a taut band, and the presence of a local twitch response and jump sign, although the presence of this sign is not required for diagnosis [4]. The presence of two TPs within 3 cm of each other was unacceptable, and the most appropriate spot for the injection was identified as the TP . The presence of a maximum of three TPs in the gluteal region was considered appropriate for injection. After positively identifying a TP , the pain was scored on a Vi - sual Analog Scale (V AS). One TP injection was performed in 30 patients consenting to injection therapy. A sterile 21-gauge needle attached to a 10-mL syringe containing5 mL of prilocaine and 5 mL of normal saline was usedfor each patient. With the patient in the prone position,approximately 3 mL of the sterile mixture was injected atthe painful TP in the gluteal region using the techniquesuggested by Simons et al. [6], whereby the syringe is heldwith the fingers of the dominant hand, the TP is held be - tween the index and middle fingers of the non-dominanthand, and the needle is inserted into the muscle at a 90\u00b0angle. Each patient was also given a home exercise program and an oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent. Pa - tients were instructed to perform the exercises, which included postural training, muscle reactivation, and cor - rection of flexibility and strength deficits, and the patients progressed to 4-6 weeks of functional exercises. Follow - ing recovery, the patients underwent a follow-up exercise program that included protective exercises for 2-3 days a week [10]. Oral medications included a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (etodolac, 400 mg twice/day), a muscle 8 mg twice/day), and an anti-inflammatory gel (ibuprofen 3 times/day for Appendices - Page A- 87Bahar Dernek et al. 234 Asian Spine J 2018;12(2):232-237 10 days). Demographic data, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) scores, and V AS scores were recorded for each pa-tient, and all patients were evaluated 1 and 3 months after instituting these measures. Pain severity was evaluated on a 10-mm VAS rang - ing from 0 (no pain) to 10 (the worst pain imaginable). Function was evaluated using the Turkish ODI consisting of 10 items: pain intensity, personal care, lifting, sitting, walking, standing, sleeping, social life, travel, and degree of pain. Greater the total score, greater was the disability. The validity and reliability of the Turkish ODI have been evaluated previously [11]. 2. Ethics and consent to participate The study received ethical commity approval from Kanuni Sultan Suleyman Trainig and Research Hospital Clinical Research Ethics Committee (approval no., KAEK/2/10). 3. Statistics Descriptive statistics are presented as mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, maximum, frequency, and ratio. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to measure the distribution of variables. Quantitative independent data were analyzed using the independent sample t-test and Mann-Whitney U-test, and dependent data were analyzed using the Wilcoxon test. The chi-square test was used to analyze the qualitative independent data. Statisti - cal analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics ver. 22.0 software (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY , USA). Results No significant differences were observed in age, sex, or baseline V AS score between the case and control groups (p>0.005) (Table 1). The VAS scores at 1 and 3 months were significantly ( p<0.05) lower in the case versus the control group and significantly ( p<0.05) lower than base - line values in both groups (Table 1, Fig. 1). There were no significant differences ( p>0.005) in baseline ODI scores between groups, and the ODI scores at 1 and 3 months were significantly ( p<0.05) lower in the case than control groups and significantly ( p<0.05) lower than the baseline values in both groups (Table 1, Fig. 2). Discussion Low back pain (LBP) is a common problem that is treated by both primary care and specialty physicians. While its etiology includes several factors, LBP is usually associated with muscular components. Identifying the cause of LBP Table 1.

VAS, Visual Analog Scale; ODI, Oswestry Disability Index. a)By comparison with baseline in Lumbar Disc Hernia Asian S pine J ournal 235 in clinical practice is challenging because there are usually several causes. Intervertebral disc herniation, one of the most common causes of LBP , affects the nerve roots, lead - ing to lumbosacral radiculopathy [12], which is often ac - companied by lumbar and gluteal local TPs. Patients with TPs experience additional pain and discomfort, which can complicate radiculopathy treatment [13]. In a study of 207 patients with gluteal TPs, Adelmanesh et al. [12] found that 74.6% ipsilateral to the ra - diculopathy. Active TPs located in the gluteus minimus muscle can mimic sciatica during the chronic phase of ra - diculopathy [12]. The location of the TPs is often not ana - tomically clear. Nevertheless, Akamatsu et al. [14] identi - fied TPs as entry points of the spinal accessory nerve into the trapezius muscle and tendon in a cadaver study. TPs may result from trauma to or overload of specific muscle groups. Repetitive strain injuries can cause the formation of chronic TPs. Instead of the generic term \"muscle pain, \" terms such as local soft tissue pain, local fibromyalgia, and idiopathic myalgia may be used. TPs can be palpated as taut bands in specific locations [15]; the palpation of these tender spots causes a local twitch response, which activates alpha motor neurons. In our study, a local twitch response was obtained at the active TP foci. A detailed history and physical examination are essential for the di - agnosis of a TP due to limited diagnostic laboratory tests [16]. Iglesias-Gonz\u00e1lez et al. [17] evaluated 42 patients with nonspecific LBP and revealed that TPs in the lumbar area and hip muscles are particularly important sources of nonspecific LBP . They also demonstrated that patients with nonspecific LBP have a greater disability and worse sleep quality than individuals without a TP [17]. TP injec-tion is preferred when conservative methods fail [9]. Vari - ous conservative approaches can be used in the manage - ment of TP , the most common of which are dry needling and local anesthetic administration. The gauge of the needle used for TP injection can also affect treatment suc - cess. While previous studies used 21-, 25-, and 27-gauge needles [18], we preferred to use a green 21-gauge needle in the present study. The injection site should be cleaned with an antiseptic agent and sterilized prior to performing the injection [19]. We used Betadine to clean the site, with the patient in a prone position, using the technique of Simons et al. [6] for the injection, which we believed to be more effective [20]. In vitro studies have revealed that local anesthetics reduce the release of free oxygen radicals from polymor - phonuclear leukocytes (PMNLs) [21]. In vivo studies administration inhibits adhe - sion and leukocyte migration [22,23]. Local anesthetics have also been found to decrease the release of histamine from mast cells and leukotriene B4 from PMNLs as well as the release of interleukin-1 (IL-1) [24]. Due to their short half-lives and lower local irritant effects, lidocaine and prilocaine are the most commonly used local anes - thetics for injection saline to the neck and lumbar muscles and observed a greater pain decrease with the use of local anesthetics compared with saline, although no difference was noted between the two anesthetics. Frost [26] treated patients with acute lumbar pain with either mepivacaine or saline and observed no difference after 2 weeks. In the present study, patients undergoing medical therapy and an exercise program comprised the control group. The group receiving TP injections had significantly reduced pain and improved functional status compared Fig. 1.

The different results obtained by various studies may be due to the differences in the gauge of the needle or active ingredient used as well as the method of application. Any failure to precisely localize the TP and injection of a spot adjacent to the TP may also yield unsat - isfactory results. We believe that the mechanism of action and features of the anesthetic are also important determi - nants of TP injection success. Yuan et al. [27] showed that lidocaine inhibits lipopolysaccharide-related inflammato - ry mediator release from microglia and reported that the mechanism of action involves the blockage of the p38 mi - togen-activated protein kinase monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils as well as on LPS, thereby inhibiting nitric oxide, prostaglandin E2, tumor necrosis factor-, IL-1, and monocyte chemo - tactic protein-1 [28]. Given that molecules such as IL-1 are often present in the vicinity of TPs, lidocaine reduces the secondary pain due to the TP via both neurological and biochemical mechanisms. The effectiveness of various procedures, such as injections in the epidural space, facet joints, and locally sensitive TPs as well as nerve blocks, has been discussed in large database collection trials that question the efficacy of injection therapy in patients with posterior back pain [29]. Statements on the efficacy of multiple injections and various nerve blocks in the litera - ture compared with such nonspecific studies have shown high heterogeneity [19,25]. Although few studies have used prilocaine, we prefer its use for TP injection. We found that it was effective for the treatment of TPs, and its mechanism of action may be similar to the biochemical processes involving lido - caine. Further molecular studies on the exact biochemical mechanisms of prilocaine are warranted. Conclusions Our study showed that patients with radiculopathy, which was possibly due to secondary TPs in the gluteal region, have favorable results with TP injection. We suggest that TP injection be part of the treatment of lumbosacral ra - diculopathy in selected patients.

Chronic Shoulder Pain: A Case Report. Seenauth C, Inouye V, Langland JO. Abstract Context Shoulder pain is one of the most common pain complaints reported by patients. Consensus is lacking on its ideal treatment, and many different treatments are available and used.Prolotherapy is an injection\u00adbased therapy that has shown significant results in treating manycommon musculoskeletal pain conditions, including osteoarthritis, lateral epicondylosis, and low\u00adback pain. Objective The study intended to evaluate the use of dextrose prolotherapy in thetreatment of shoulder pain. Design The research team performed a case study. Setting Thestudy occurred at the Medical Center at Southwest College of Naturopathic Medicine (Tempe, AZ,USA). Participant The participant was a middle\u00adaged male with a long\u00adterm history of untreatedshoulder pain. Intervention Injections were placed in the patient's glenohumeral joint space, theacromioclavicular joint, the subacromial space, and the insertion of the supraspinatus. Eachlocation was injected with a solution of 50% dextrose diluted with 1% lidocaine, 0.25%bupivacaine, and 1 mg methylcobalamin. The final concentration of dextrose in the solution wasapproximately 22.8%. Outcome Measures The patient completed questionnaires (numericalrating scale, verbally reported at the beginning of each visit) indicating his level of pain on a scaleof 0 to 10, with 0 = no pain and 10 = worst pain. Results Following 3 sessions of prolotherapy, the patient reported a 90% reduction in pain and full restorati on of normal activity. Conclusions The findings suggest that dextrose prolotherapy may be an effective treatment for chronicshoulder pain and may be an alternative to surgery or other more costly and invasiveinterventions.

A report follows. General Data In this series of 103 cases of primary trigeminal neuralgia, 45 cases were male and 58 female, ranging in age from 21 to 69 years, and in duration of the illness from 1 month to 21 years. These cases were characterized by sudden severe pain in the trigeminal nerve distributing area of the face. It would happen once a day in the mild cases, or several dozen times a day in the severe cases. Methods of Treatment 1.For neuralgia of the 1st branch , Nei Yuyao ( Extra) was selected. A No. 5 syringe needle was in serted into the point 0.5 cm deep to reach the bone surface of the orbital margin and induce a sensation of electric transmission with no blood let out, when 1ml of 2% lidocaine was injected into the point. 5- minute later, when the pain in the 1st branch area was alleviated or disappeared, the injection of 50mg VB 1 and 0.25mg VB 12 was followed. 2. For the neuralgia of the 2nd branch, Sibai (ST 2) was selected. A No.5 syringe needle was inserted into the point via the infraorbital foramen of an angle of 40\u00b0 -50\u00b0 posterolaterally upwards to a depth limited within 1cm, followed by injection of themedicines upon appearance of the electric shock sensation, with the same quantity and method asmentioned above. 3.For neuralgia of the 3rd branch, Xiaguan (ST 7) was selected. A No. 5 long dental syringe needle was inserted into the point posteriorly towards the medial side for about 4 cm (never deeper than 5cm).When the sensation like a electric shock radiated to the mendibula, 2ml of 2% lidocaine was injected into the point slowly. 5 minutes later, when the pain in the 3rd branch was alleviated or disappeared, the injection of 100mg VB 1 and 0.5mg VB 12 was followed. The treatment was given once daily, 10 sessions constituting one therapeutic course, with a 3- day interval between courses. Criteria for Therapeutic Effects Cured: Complete disappearance of the pain, with no recurrence in a period of 3 months. Markedly effective: Disappearance of the pain, but with mild recurrence 3 months after treatment. Improved: Alleviation of the pain, with reduced frequency of H.7 - PIT - Trigeminal Neuralgia Appendices - Page A- 95the episodes. Ineffective: No obvious improvement after the treatment. Results of Treatment After 1 -3 courses of treatment, the patients were followed up for 3 months. Among the 103 cases treated, 56 cases (54.37%) were cured, 29 cases (28.16%) markedly effective, 16 cases (15.53%) improved, and 2 cases (1.94%) ineffective. The total effective rate was 98.06%. Illustrative Case Mr. Feng, aged 55 years, paid his first visit on May 13,1998. Two months before, the patient got sudden severe pain on the right side of the face, with intermittent episodes from several times to several dozen times a day and each attack lasting 10 -60 seconds. He had been treated with some medicines but with no effect. The diagnosis was right trigeminal neuralgia of the 3rd branch. The point- injection at Xiaguan (ST 7) with lidocaine, VB 1 and VB 12 was given once daily. After 6 treatments, the pain disappeared. Another 4 treatments were then given for consolidation. No recurrence was found in a 3 -month follow -up period. Comment By means of facial point -injection, the author has obtained quite good therapeutic results in the treatment of primary trigeminal neuralgia. The points respectively selected are Nei Yuyao (EX- HN4) for neuralgia of the 1st branch, Sibai (ST 2) for the 2nd branch, and Xiaguan (ST 7) for the3rd branch. Good therapeutic effects can be expected only when the needling sensation is made to radiate to the painful area. This therapy has proved highly effective for primary trigeminal neuralgia.

Acupuncture has emerged as a powerful, evidence-based, safe, cost-effective, and available treatment modality suitable to meeting this need. Acupuncture has been shown to be effective for the management of numerous types of pain, and mechanisms of action for acupuncture have been described and are understandable from biomedical, physiologic perspectives. Further, acupuncture's cost-effectiveness could dramatically decrease health care expenditures, both from the standpoint of treating acute pain and through avoiding the development of opioid addiction that requires costly care, destroys quality of life, and can lead to fatal overdose. Numerous federal regulatory agencies have advised or mandated that healthcare systems and providers offer non-pharmacologic treatment options, and acupuncture stands as the most evidence-based, immediately available choice to fulfil these calls. Acupuncture can safely, easily, and cost-effectively be incorporated into hospital settings as diverse as the emergency department, labor and delivery suites, and neonatal intensive care units to treat a variety of pain seen commonly in hospitals. Acupuncture is already being successfully and meaningfully utilized by the Veterans Administration and various branches of the U.S. Military. 1. Acupuncture is an effective, safe, and cost-effective treatment for numerous types of acute and chronic pain. Acupuncture should be recommended as a first line treatment for pain before opiates are prescribed, and may reduce opioid use. 1.1 Effectiveness/E fficacy of acupuncture for different types of pain. There is growing research evidence to support the effectiveness and efficacy of acupuncture for the relief of numerous types of pain, especially chronic pain, as well as the use of acupuncture for a diverse array of conditions (Table 11, Appendix 1). Acupuncture has been shown to be effective for treating various types of pain, with the strongest evidence emerging for back pain, neck pain, shoulder pain, chronic headache, and osteoarthritis . In an individual patient meta8analysis of 17,922 people from 29 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), it was concluded that the effect sizes in comparison to no acupuncture controls were 0.55 standard deviation (SD), 95% confidence interval (CI) [0.5180.58] for back and neck pain; 0.57 SD, 95% for osteoarthritis; and 95% CI [0.3780.46] for chronic headache. No meta8analysis was performed on shoulder pain as there were only three eligible RCTs. In all analyses, true acupuncture was significantly superior to no acupuncture and sham acupuncture controls (p<0.001).2 Appendices - Page A- 108 2 Table 1. Acupuncture for the use of numerous conditions including pain conditions.

Effectiveness was rated by the 8,727 treating physicians as marked or moderate in 76% of cases.3 Appendices - Page A- 109 3 In a network meta8analysis comparing different physical interventions for pain from knee osteoarthritis, acupuncture was found to be superior to sham acupuncture, muscle8strengthening exercise, tai chi, weight loss, standard care, and aerobic exercise (in ranked order). Acupuncture was found to be statistically more significantly effective than muscle8strengthening exercises, standardised mean difference (SMD) = 0.49, 95% CI [0.0080.98].4 In early 2017, the American College of Physicians (ACP) published guidelines based on the evidence for the non8invasive treatment of low back pain. For acute or subacute low back pain, the ACP strongly recommends non8pharmacologic treatment with acupuncture , along with superficial heat, massage, or spinal manipulation, and nonsteroidal anti8inflammatory drugs or skeletal muscle relaxants. For chronic low back pain, the ACP also strongly recommends acupuncture , in addition to exercise, multidisciplinary rehabilitation, mindfulness8based stress reduction, tai chi, yoga, motor control exercise, progressive relaxation, electromyography biofeedback, low8level laser therapy, operant therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, and spinal manipulation, etc.5 A systematic re v iew and meta8analysis on acupuncture for the treatment of sciatica concluded that acupuncture was superior to standard pharmaceutical care (such as ibuprofen, diclofenac, and prednisone) in reducing pain intensity (mean difference (MD) = 1.25, 95% CI [1.6380.86]) and pain threshold (MD = 1.08, 95% CI [0.98-1.17]).6 A systematic rev iew and network meta8analyses of 21 different interventions for sciatica found that acupuncture was second in global effect only to biological agents, and superior to all other interventions including non8opioid and opioid medications.7 A systematic rev iew on acupuncture and moxibustion for lateral elbow pain found that acupuncture and moxibustion were superior or equal to standard care.8 A systematic rev iew on acupuncture for plantar heel pain found that evidence supporting the effectiveness of acupuncture was comparable to the evidence available for standard care interventions such as stretching, night splints, and dexamethasone.9 The use of acup u ncture to relieve pain associated with surgical procedures captured the world's attention in the early 1970's when well8known New York Times journalist James Reston, who, while in China, witnessed acupuncture's effectiveness on his post8operative pain, published his personal experience with acupuncture shortly before President Richard Nixon's trip to China. Since then, acupuncture has been used before, during, and after surgery to manage pain and to improve post8surgical recovery in a variety of contexts.10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18 It is noteworthy that acupuncture has been report ed to be effective in pain relief during and after surgical procedures on children and animals as well.19,20,21,22 Nonetheless, ov er the past two decades post8operative pain management has come to rely increasingly on opioids while underutilizing alternative analgesics such as acupuncture. In 2012, surgeons and dentists combined prescribed 16.2% of all opioids in the U.S, trailing only family practices as the leading source of opioid prescriptions at 18.2%.23 Eighty to ninety8four percent of patients underg oing low risk surgical procedures fill a prescription for opioids within 7 days.24,25 Recent data has shown that opioid prescriptions vary widely and that the majority of surgical patients are over8prescribed opioids, as approximately 70% of pills go unused.26 The risk of chronic Appendices - Page A- 110 4 opioid use after surgery in previously non8dependent patients is determined to be 5.9 - 6.5%,27 although in sel ect populations such as head and neck cancer patients, the risk is up to 40%.28 The increase in pos t8operative opioid use is somewhat paradoxical considering that known adverse effects such as sedation, pneumonia,29,30 ileus, urinary retention, and delirium prolong patient recovery and de lay the meeting of discharge goals.31 Acupuncture is a promising adjunctive analgesic modality to reduce the risk of post8operative opioid dependence. A meta8analysis published in late 2017 in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA Surgery) focused on non8pharmacological treatments in reducing pain after total knee arthroplasty. Thirty8nine randomized clinical trials were included in the meta8analysis (2,391 patients). Moderate8certainty level evidence showed that electrotherapy reduced the use of opioids (MD = 3.50, 95% CI [5.9081.10]) morphine equivalents in milligrams per kilogram per 48 hours (p=.004, I2=17%), and that acupuncture delayed opioid use (MD = 46.17, 95% CI [20.848 analgesia (p<.001, I2=19%). There was low8 certainty level evidence that acupuncture improved pain (MD = 1.14, 95% CI [1.9080.38] on a visual analog scale at 2 days (p=.003, I2=0%). Evidence showed that acupuncture is better than cryotherapy, co ntinuous passive motion, and preoperative exercise in the studied condition.32 Reduction in opi oid use has been demonstrated across a wide range of both minor and major surgical procedures, including cardiac surgery,33 thoracic surgery,34 and craniotomy.35,36 Moreover, acupuncture may even reduce post8operative ileus and expedite bowel recovery after colorectal cancer resection.37 As acupuncture is often combined with electric stimulation, electro8acupuncture may have more c linical benefit in post8operative pain management. A Cochrane systematic review on acupuncture or acupressure for primary dysmenorrhea found that both acupuncture and acupressure were more effective in reducing pain than placebo controls.38 Five other systematic reviews and/or meta8analyses on various forms of acupoint stimulation incl uding acupuncture, acupressure, and moxibustion for primary dysmenorrhea have reported similar outcomes.39,40,41,42,43 The effectiven e ss of acupuncture for labor pain is still unclear, largely due to the heterogeneity of designs and methods in studies which have produced mixed results. While some studies reported no reduction in analgesic medications, some studies reported reduction of pain during labor, reduced use of opioid medications and epidural analgesia, and a shorter second stage of labor.44,45,46 A systematic rev iew on acupuncture for trigeminal neuralgia suggests that acupuncture may be equal or superior to carbamazepine, but the evidence is weakened by the low methodological quality of some included studies.47 A Cochrane syst ematic review on acupuncture for fibromyalgia found low to moderate8level evidence that acupuncture improves pain and stiffness compared with no treatment and standard therapy. Furthermore, electro8acupuncture is probably better than manual acupuncture for pain in fibromyalgia, although more studies are warranted.48 A prospective, randomized trial of acupuncture vs. morphine to treat emergency department/emergency room patients with acute onset, moderate to severe pain was conducted. Acupuncture provided more effective and faster analgesia than morphine, and was better tolerated. The study included 300 patients, with 150 patients in each group. Success rate was Appendices - Page A- 111 5 significantly different between the 2 groups (92% in the acupuncture group vs 78% in the morphine group, p<.001). Resolution time was 16 \u00b1 8 minutes in the acupuncture group vs 28 \u00b1 14 minutes in the morphine group (p< .005). Overall, 89 patients (29.6%) experienced minor adverse effects; of these, 85 (56.6%) were in the morphine group and only 4 (2.6%) were in the acupuncture group (p< .001).49 The above menti oned meta8analysis included 29 trials and 17,922 patients with chronic pain conditions; data on longer term follow8up (available for 20 trials, including 6376 patients) suggests that approximately 90% of the benefit of acupuncture relative to controls would be sustained at 12 months after the course of treatment. Patients can generally be reassured that treatment effects persist at least 12 months.50 1.2 Safety and f e asibility of acupuncture for pain management. The strongest evidence for the safety of acupuncture in chronic pain management comes from an open pragmatic trial involving 454,920 patients who were treated for headache, low back pain, and/or osteoarthritis. Minor adverse events were reported in 7.9% of patients while only 0.003% (13 patients) experienced severe adverse events. Minor adverse events included needling pain, hematoma, and bleeding, while serious adverse events included pneumothorax, acute hyper8 or hypotensive crisis, erysipelas, asthma attack, and aggravation of suicidal thoughts.51 In a prospective fea sibility study, acupuncture was seen as feasible, safe, and acceptable in an ICU setting by patients from diverse backgrounds.52 A systematic review suggests that acupuncture performed by tr ained practitioners using clean needle technique is a generally safe procedure.53 The medical literat ure also indicates that acupuncture may be used successfully on cancer patients for symptom management due to the low risks associated with its use.54 1.3 Cost-effe ctiveness of acupuncture for pain management. In a systematic review of 8 cost8utility and cost8effectiveness studies of acupuncture for chronic pain, the cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained was below the thresholds used by the UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence for \"willingness to pay\". The chronic pain conditions included in the systematic review included low back pain, neck pain, dysmenorrhoea, migraine and headache, and osteoarthritis.55 In a cost8effectiveness analysis of non8 pharmacological treatments for osteoarthritis of the knee, acupuncture was found to be the most cost8effective option when analysis was limited to high8quality studies.56 Using acupuncture for pain management, patients and insurers can save money and successfully manage their pain and other symptoms without the adverse risks associated with prescription medications. A recent study found that full insurance coverage for acupuncture would increase an average insured member's monthly health insurance premium from $0.38 to $0.76. Acupuncture was noted to save $35,480, and $4,246 per patient for migraine, angina pectoris, severe osteoarthritis, and carpal tunnel syndrome respectively .57 Considering the large fees associated with prescription medications and surgery for pain conditions, acupuncture is extremely cost8effective. The Acupuncture Evidence Project also enumerates those conditions for which acupuncture has been found to be cost8effective (Table 2).58 Appendices - Page A- 112 6 Table 2. Conditions with demonstrated evidence of cost effectiveness. Allergic rhinitis Low back pain Ambulatory anaesthesia Migraine Chronic pain: neck pain (plus usual medical care) Depression Osteoarthritis Dysmenorrhoea Post8operative nausea and vomiting Headache 1.4 Can adjunctive acupuncture treatment reduce the use of opioid-like medications? Some studies have reported reduced consumption of opioid8like medication (OLM) by more than 60% following surgery when acupuncture is used.59,60 A pilot RCT also showed a reduction by 39% in OLM use in n on8malignant pain after acupuncture, an effect which lasted fewer than 8 weeks after acupuncture treatment ceased.61 The above mentioned meta8analysis, having moderate8 certainty level evidence, showed that electro8acupuncture therapy reduced the use of opioids, and acupuncture delayed opioid use; with low8certainty level evidence indicating that acupuncture improved pain.62 The conclusions suggest that electro8acupuncture may be effective in reducing or delaying the us e of opioid medications. In a study looking at acupuncture's effectiveness in treating pain in a military cohort at a United States Air Force medical center, acupuncture dramatically decreased the use of opiates and other pain medications among personnel. Opioid prescriptions decreased by 45%, muscle relaxants by 34%, NSAIDs by 42%, and benzodiazepines by 14%. Quality of life measures also showed impressive changes, with some measures of improvements showing statistical significance (p< 0.001).63 The Veterans A d ministration is increasingly looking to incorporate acupuncture into care, as is the U.S. Air Force and other branches. Training of military physicians is increasing, and systems are being studied to further incorporate acupuncture. The military is rapidly incorporating this care into its offered services for service members.64,65 Studies of the effects of opioid analgesia in the elderly reveal a significant burden of disease due to falls from mental impairment. This is worsened when seniors are using multiple medications affecting cognition. In a recent study from the Journal of the American Geriatric Society, serious falls as per Medicare Part A and B ICD/CPT codes were evaluated in 5,556 nursing home residents aged 65 or greater. Seniors taking > 3 + CNS standardized daily doses were more likely to have a serious fall than those not taking any CNS medications (adjusted odds ratio = 1.83, 95% CI [1.358 2.48]), and the authors urge, \"Clinicians should be vigilant for opportunities to discontinue or decrease the doses of individual CNS medications and/or consider non8pharmacological alternatives.\"66 Appendices - Page A- 113 7 A recent study in the New Zealand Medical Journal noted that medication related harms were both common and create d a substantial burden of disease for patients and the healthcare system. They listed opioids first among the six categories of medications causing the most significant burden.67 In light of the findings of these studies and similar, utilization of non8pharmacologic treatment options such as acupuncture must be a priority of paramount status. 2. Acupuncture's analgesic mechanisms have been extensively researched and acupuncture can increase the production and release of endogenous opioids in animals and humans. Mechanisms underlying acupuncture's analgesic effects have been extensively researched for over 60 years. In animal models, acupuncture and/or electro8acupuncture has been shown to be effective for the alleviation of inflammatory, neuropathic, cancer8related, and visceral pain. Mechano8 transduction of the needling stimulus at specific points on the body triggers the release of ATP and adenosine, which bind to local afferents.68,69 Ascending neural pathways involving A, A, and C sensory fibres have been mapped, as well as a mesolimbic analgesic loop in the brain and brainstem, descending pathway mechanisms, dopaminergic contributors, and cytokine, glutamate, nitric oxide, and gamma8amino8butyric8acid (GABA) effects. Acupuncture analgesia has been shown to involve several classes of opioid neuropeptides including enkephalins, endorphins, dynorphins, endomorphins, non8opioid neuropeptides, (VIP), and calcitonin gene8related peptide (CGRP) have been investigated for their roles in both the analgesic and anti8inflammatory effects of acupuncture.70,71,72,73 Given that acupu ncture analgesia and activates \u00b5 and opioid receptors, it is feasible that acupuncture, used in conjunction with OLM, might alleviate pain with a lower OLM dose for patients already taking OLM.74 This idea is further supported by evi dence that acupuncture increases \u00b5 opioid receptor binding potential, allowing for effective analgesia at lower doses of OLM.75 For patients not yet prescribed OLM, acupuncture should be reco mme nded prior to OLM prescription commencing. This would be in8line with existing guidelines, such as those by the ACP76 and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),77 which re commend that safe and effective non8opioid alternatives should first be exhausted befor e resorting to OLM. It is important to note as well that opioids as a monotherapy are often not as successful as may be thought in the general public perception. A recent systematic review of opioid analgesics for low back pain, which included 7,925 participants, found that opioids were poorly tolerated and for those who tolerate them the effect is unlikely to be clinically important within guideline recommended doses.78 The first ever randomized controlled trial evaluating the long8term effectiveness of opioids, found that thos e on long8term opioid analgesia were actually in marginally more pain at 12 months than those in the non8opioid group.79 Hence, complementary methods of pain control are critical to successful pati ent management. Appendices - Page A- 114 8 3. Acupuncture is effective for the treatment of chronic pain involving maladaptive neuroplasticity. Adverse neuroplastic changes can present a challenge in pain management, as maladaptive neuroplasticity can be associated with severe chronic pain that is resistant to treatment. Via peripheral stimulation, acupuncture may relieve the symptoms of patients affected by problematic neuroplastic changes. There is evidence that acupuncture has the capacity to reverse adverse neuroplastic changes in the dorsal horns of the spine, as well as in the somatosensory cortex.80,81,82,83 This suggests that acupuncture may have an important role in treating chronic pain which involves adverse neuroplastic changes. 4. Acupuncture is a useful adjunctive therapy in opiate dependency and rehabilitation. Acupuncture is an effective way to treat opioid addiction. There are more than 45 human and animal studies and clinical trials included in the PubMed database exploring acupuncture's role in minimizing the usage of multiple drugs of potential abuse including opiates and methamphetamine.84 In 1973, Doctors Wen and Cheung, et al. from Hong Kong published an accidental find ing that ear acupuncture treatment for respiratory patients had apparently alleviated opioid withdrawal signs and symptoms.85 These findings were replicated by others around the world, includin g in New York and Sydney in the mid81970s. In 1985, Dr. Michael Smith, et al. in New York established the National Acupuncture Detoxification Association (NADA), which today operates in over 40 countries with an estimated 25,000 providers. There are more than 1,000 programs in the U.S. and Canada that now use acupuncture to help addicts overcome their addictions.86 Acupuncture for addiction is a versatile modality than can be effortlessly integrated into many envi r onments including prisons, in8 and outpatient programs, community centers, disaster relief, and humanitarian aid efforts. Furthermore, acupuncture addiction protocols can address acute and prolonged withdrawal symptoms, stress and anxiety related to drug withdrawal, and help prevent relapse. Using drugs to treat those already drug addicted is not a rational plan of action, and finding sound, non8pharmacologic treatment options is of paramount importance. A meta8analysis done in 2012 concluded that \"the majority [of studies] agreed on the efficacy of acupuncture as a strategy for the treatment of opiate addiction\" and that \"neurochemical and behavioral evidence have shown that acupuncture helps reduce the effects of positive and negative reinforcement involved in opiate addiction by modulating mesolimbic dopamine neurons. Moreover, several brain neurotransmitter systems involving opioids and GABA have been implicated in the modulation of dopamine release by acupuncture.\"87 In a recent RCT involving 28 newborns with N eonatal Abstinence Syndrome, laser acupuncture plus OLM significantly reduced the duration of oral morphine therapy when compared to OLM alone.88 The mechanism for acupuncture in op iate withdrawal was found to be mediated by the endogenous opioid \"dynorphin\" binding to kappa8opioid receptors.89 Appendices - Page A- 115 9 5. Acupuncture has been recommended as a first line non-pharmacologic therapy by the FDA, as well as the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine in coping with the opioid crisis. The Joint Commission has also mandated that hospitals provide non-pharmacologic pain treatment modalities. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) released proposed changes to its opioid prescription guidelines in early May 2017. This was titled as its \"Blueprint for Prescriber Education for Extended8Release and Long8Acting Opioids\". The guidelines now recommend that doctors become informed about non8pharmacologic options for pain control to help avoid the overuse of opioids.90 Per the FDA's r equest, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) released a report to outline the state of the science regarding prescription opioid abuse and misuse, as well as the evolving role that opioids play in pain management. The new NASEM report on pain management and opioids recommends more public education, reimbursement models, and support for non8drug approaches to pain treatment. It systematically summarizes the evidence for acupuncture's clinical benefits in treating different pain conditions, and provides an overview of some of the basic science underlying acupuncture's mechanisms in pain management.91 Further, effective Janua ry 1, 2018, the Joint Commission has mandated that hospitals provide non8 pharmacologic pain treatment modalities.92 Acupuncture is ideally suited to fulfil this mandate. These official, evidence8based clinical guidelines are in line with global healthcare trends; as of November 2015, acupuncture had over 870 recommendations in official clinical guidelines for over 100 conditions from institutions in over 30 countries.93 6. Among most non-pharmacological managements for pain relief now available, acupuncture therapy is the most effective and specific for opioid abuse and overuse. There are several forms of non8pharmacological managements for acute and chronic pain, including physical therapy, spinal cord manipulation, yoga, tai chi, and cognitive behavioral therapy. Among these therapies commonly recommended by medical authorities, acupuncture is the most specific in targeting the endogenous opioid system. There is more evidence that acupuncture can induce endorphins to cope with acute and chronic pain in basic research than for any other non8pharmacological approach for pain.94,95,96,97 7. Acupuncture is widely available from qualified practitioners nationally. In 2013 more than 28,000 licensed acupuncturists were estimated to be practicing in the U.S., with many more in training.98 A 2015 study found the number of trained practitioners to be approximately 34 ,400. The number of licensed acupuncturists was noted to have increased by 23.3% and 52.1% compared to the years 2009 (n=27,965) and 2004 (n=22,671) respectively.99 Currently the C ouncil of Colleges of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (CCAOM) has 57 schools in its membership,100 with approximately 10 schools offering doctoral degrees. The National Certification C ouncil for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (NCCAOM) has certified more than 18,000 practitioners for minimal competency.101 The American Academy of Medical Acupuncture Appendices - Page A- 116 10 also represents more than 1,300 medical doctors trained to offer acupuncture services, and has approved nine p rograms for medical doctor certification in acupuncture.102 One certification program alone ha s trained more than 6000 physicians in medical acupuncture,103 so a conservative estimate of the total number of physicians trained would be approximately 10,000, though the number in active practice with acupuncture is unknown. Most states allow physicians to practice acupuncture, with some specifying additional training.104 Increased coverage and demand for acupuncture will lead to a greater supply of providers as well. As noted above, NADA providers are estimated at 25,000 individuals, with more than 1,000 programs in the U.S. and Canada. Appendices - Page A- 11711 Appendi x 1. Effectiveness of Acupuncture.

Page A- 130ABSTRACT Medical pain management is in crisis: from the pervasiveness of pain to inadequate pain treatment, from the escalation of prescription opioids to an epidemic in addiction, diversion and overdose deaths. The rising costs of pain care and managing adverse ef fects of that care has prompted action from state and federal agencies including the DOD, VHA, NIH, FDA and CDC. There is pressure for pain medicine to shift away from reliance on opioids, ineffective procedures and surgeries toward comprehensive pain management that includes evidence- based nonpharmacologic options. This White Paper details the historical context and magnitude of the current pain problem including individual, social and economic impacts as well as the challenges of pain management for patie nts and a healthcare workforce engaging prevalent strategies not entirely based in current evidence. Detailed here is the evidence -base for nonpharmacologic therapies effective in post-surgical pain with opioid sparing, acute nonsurgical pain, cancer pain and chronic pain. Therapies reviewed include acupuncture therapy, massage therapy, osteopathic and chiropractic manipulation, meditative movement therapies Tai chi and yoga, mind body behavioral interventions, dietary components, and self- care/self -efficac y strategies. Transforming the system of pain care to a responsive comprehensive model necessitates that options for treatment and collaborative care must be evidence- based and include effective nonpharmacologic strategies that have the advantage of reduced risks of adverse events and addiction liability. The evidence demands a call to action to increase awareness of effective nonpharmacologic treatments for pain, to train healthcare practitioners and administrators in the evidence base of effective nonphar macologic practice, to advocate for policy initiatives that remedy system and reimbursement barriers to evidence-informed comprehensive pain care, and to promote ongoing research and dissemination of the role of effective nonpharmacologic treatments in pain, focused on the short and long term therapeutic and economic impact of comprehensive care practices. Appendices - Page A- 131SECTION 1: THE PROBLEM HISTORICAL CONTEXT FOR A CALL TO CHANGE Pain care in America is in crisis. The prevalence of pain is high despite costly, well - intentioned medical responses, which rely mainly on pharmaceuticals and high- tech interventions. Pain and aspects of current pain management strategies are having enormous deleterious impacts on patients, the health system and society.1,2 From the 1970s to the 1990s there was hope that new drugs, more liberal use of opioids, new technologies and a growing understanding about the mechanisms of pain would reduce the occurrence of uncontrolled pain. This was not the case. Growing rates and escalating costs of pain -related morbidity, mortality and disability have led to calls for culture change in pain medicine by The Office of the Army Surgeon General Pain Management Task Force (PMTF) Report, 3 Institute of Medicine (IOM) (now the National Academy of Medicine, NAM),1,2 Interagency Pain Research Coordinating Committee's National Pain Strategy,4 and others. Government leaders have declared the opioid crisis a national emergency. The recommendations consistently promote a shift toward a more comprehens ive, patient -centered and health -focused approach to pain patients. In this model, collaborative care is team -based, interdisciplinary, and involves both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic approaches. The model affirms the essential role patients have in i mproving their own health and pain-related behaviors. There is a growing recognition that current conventional medical treatment may not be the best starting point and is often not sufficient. In addition to inadequately addressing pain there is increasing evidence that conventional treatment strategies are fueling the opioid crisis, according to a National Institute for Drug Abuse (NIDA) report citing one in three Americans used prescription opioids for pain in 2015. 5 Moreover, evidence -based nonpharmacologic approaches may be the more appropriate initial treatment for acute and chronic pain management. Currently there is no clear roadmap for a comprehensive approach to pain management that includes evidence-based nonpharmacologic strategies. The goal of this white paper is to outline the role of evidence-based nonpharmacologic strategies for the management of pain and how they can best be integrated with conventional approaches. This integrative pain management approach is in alignment with the stated goals of the reports from the Office of the Army Surgeon General PMTF, NAM, National Academies of Science and the NIH National Pain Strategy. How pain is assessed, managed and taught to health professionals must be updated. A shift is essential to address the immense deleterious impact that pain and the current system of pain care, including opioid reliance, have on patients, the health system and society. Appendices - Page A- 132Magnitude of the Pain Problem Societal impact The morbidity, disability and economic costs of pain in America are enormous. Recent estimates for the cost of pain care fall in the vicinity of $560 -635 billion annually.1 This exceeds the annual expenditures for heart disease, cancer and diabetes combined, the nation's priority health conditions.6 The IOM report estimated over 100 million American adults suffer from chronic pain. This figure is likely an underestimate of America's overall pain burden, as it does not include children, nursing home resident s, active military, or those in prison. 1,2 The prevalence of chronic pain conditions in the general adult U.S. population is estimated to range from 11 -47% in large surveys.1,6-11 Low back and neck pain, osteoarthritis (OA), and headache are the most comm on pain conditions in the U.S and are leading global causes of disability in 2015 in most countries.12 Unfortunately, we can expect the chronic pain burden to escalate. A 2013 National Academy of Sciences report predicts pain prevalence will rise as chroni c illnesses increase.13 For example, neuropathic pain currently affects over six million Americans and is expected to rise dramatically due to the increasing prevalence of diabetes. Obesity is also increasing and is associated with risk of diabetes, neuropathy and orthopedic problems.1 Inadequate post- surgical pain management strategies for the increasing numbers of ambulatory and outpatient surgeries have resulted in chronic pain. As surgical, anesthetic and pharmaceutical interventions save lives in cases of catastrophic injury and life threatening illness there is another growing cohort of people who are living with chronic pain.1 While pediatric pain statistics are less well studied, a systematic review of the epidemiology of chronic pain in children and adolescents found that 'persistent and recurrent chronic pain is overwhelmingly prevalent in children and adolescents and should be recognized as a major health concern in this population'.14 The most common pediatric chronic pain complaints include migra ine, recurrent abdominal pain and general musculoskeletal pain, including limb pain and back pain.15 Depending upon the population surveyed and time frame of the survey, prevalence estimates for pediatric chronic pain range from 4 -89%: headache (8 -83%), abdominal pain (4-53%), back pain (12-24%) , musculoskeletal pain (4-40%), and 'other' or general pains that included recurring earaches, throat pain.14 Impact of pain: individual, workplace and employer health costs The impact of pain is felt at many level s ranging from the effects on the individual, families, the healthcare system, employers and the community at large. Chronic pain is a high impact disruptor of lives and economies. It is complex\u2014physically, neurologically, psychologically, socially, spiritually, economically, and symbolically.16 For the individual, there may be decreased physical functioning and increasing difficulties with simple daily and self -care activities.17 These changes can have an impact on psychological health, with an increase in sadness, worry, anger, depression, suicidal thoughts, and a reduced sense of self- worth with Appendices - Page A- 133changes in abilities.18 For children, there may be an impact on school performance, school attendance, and interactions with peers.14,19 For both adults and children, pain negatively impacts social functioning and relationships. As a result of alterations in work capacity, people in pain have lower hourly wages and miss more time from work than those without pain.6 In some cases pain leads to the nee d for work modifications or disability claims. Pain is associated with impairment in physical and psychological functioning,12,20 lost work productivity,21 and lower socioeconomic status.22 In addition to the costs and time needed for seeking care, people with pain conditions have significantly higher direct healthcare expenditures.6 Opioid abuse/dependence impact on health care costs Among the distinctions of the current epidemic from earlier opioid abuse epidemics is that this crisis, having been based in medical prescribing, is disproportionately affecting white, middle -class people in non- urban settings, including those with private insurance.23 2007-2014, opioid dependence rose by 3,203% among patients privately insured23 2011-2015 privately insured opioid abuse or dependence charges rose from $72 million to $722 million.24 Allowed amounts for opioid abuse/dependence health care services grew more than thirteen-fold during the same period, from $32 million in 2011 to $446 m illion in 2015. In 2015, the average annual per -patient charges and estimated allowed amounts by insurance were more than five times higher for patients with diagnoses of opioid abuse or dependence than for those with any diagnosis. In 2015, private insurers and employers providing self-funded plans paid nearly $16,000 more per patient with a diagnosis of opioid abuse or dependence than for those with any diagnosis.24 2006-2010 emergency department (ED) visits related to prescription opioid poisoning increased to 259,093; over half were hospitalized resulting in over $4 billion in costs.25 ED visits for pediatric opioid poisoning between 2006 and 2012 numbered 21,928 with over $81 million in total charges.26 From 2007-2014 pregnancy drug dependence diagnosis (including prescription opioid) rose 511%.23 From 2003-2012, neonate abstinence syndrome (NAS) admissions increased more than four-fold with annual costs growing from $61 million to nearly $316 million.27 Hospital stay is 3.5 times longer for NAS neonates compared to non-NAS neonates, with a three-fold increase in cost.27 A sizable percentage of the driving public has detectable levels of opioids in their blood28 with opioid impaired driving implicated in motor vehicle accidents.29 These costs and risks are substantial and yet fail to measure the costs to the health and wellbeing of society: communities, families, friendships and individuals. Appendices - Page A- 134Economic impact of pain The US spent 17.8% of the GDP on healthcare in 2015,30 expected to increase to 20% or higher by 2025.31 A significant portion of that is pain related since pain is the most common and compelling reason for seeking medical attention.32,33 'The economic burden of prescription opioid overdose, abuse and dependency is estimated to be $78.5 billion each year in the US.34 Social Security Disability Insurance statistics suggest that worker disability from musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders is rising, not falling. Work disability attributed to musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders increased from 20.6% of beneficiaries in 1996 to 25.4% in 200535 to 31.7% in 2015.36 In addition to worker disability there are direct and indirect workforce financial costs including both workplace absenteeism2 and lost productivity from ill and injured workers while still working, called presenteeism.37,38 There can be lost business opportunities and reduced customer goodwill due to work that goes undone and deadlines, meetings, appointments or engagements missed due to employee absence or reduced capacity. The Integrated Benefits Institute (IBI) (2005) conducted a landmark and ubiquitously cited survey in 2006: nearly all CFOs surveyed (343 senior finance executives) reported that they will focus on controlling healt h plan costs over the next two years because they believe that work time lost to employee illness including chronic pain is reaching critical levels and is affecting business performance. 39 A majority will seek to manage all health -related costs, including absenteeism and bottom- line effects as key impacts of employee ill health . IBI also found, however, that CFOs are ill -informed about health-related lost work time. Nearly half of survey respondents never receive reports about 'incidence of absence', and l ess than a quarter receive reports on its financial impact. Far f ewer know about presenteeism with nine in ten never receiving reports on the incidence or impact of presenteeism in the organization. Cost savings from improving worker health requires new re cord keeping strategies. One of the most significant new research models is the extension of return on investment (ROI) analyses to include economic outcomes resulting from health interventions such as performance and productivity. For example, while very few newly approved pharmaceuticals actually save money, they can improve health at a reasonable cost. In pharmacy literature, net increases in spending that are up to $50,000 may be deemed acceptable or cost- effective if these dollars will save at least one quality -adjusted year of life (QALY). However, this widely accepted methodology has rarely been used when considering the value of health improvement programs. 40 By contrast, the more demanding objective of realizing net savings has generally been required in evaluations of health and productivity management programs.41 Companies with successful wellness programs, with improved health-related and economic outcomes, encouraged wellness to improve employees' lives not only to reduce costs.42 Furthermore, employers and payers need to realize that benefits of investments in health accrue over time, and there may be a lag between improvements in health and savings from improved productivity. Standard calculations of documenting ROI may need to become more sophi sticated to capture net cost savings in the intermediate and long run. The current workforce literature is inadequate to evaluate the specific role of pain as distinct from overall illness. The literature on work -related injuries such as back, neck and upper Appendices - Page A- 135limb pain covers a subset of pain problems but does not capture data on such pain- related conditions as arthritis, autoimmune disorders, and diabetic and other neuropathies that are not work related. The current lack of clarity of clinical and especially cost implications remains to be resolved by future, more rigorous studies conducted at worksites over multiple years with adequate follow up times to determine both clinical and cost benefits.43,44 Ongoing studies seek to develop best practice models for business analysis outcomes. Recent reviews confirm that companies that invest in worker health and wellbeing, including through health-promotion programs, have markedly improved stock price performance compared to the Standard and Poor's 500 Index (S&P). 45,46 Similar savings have also been observed through health promotion programs among individuals who are retired and on Medicare.47 Health disparities and pain: race/ethnicity, gender and age Pain and pain care impact specific socioeconomic and demographic groups differently. Increased vulnerability to pain is associated with having English as a second language, race and ethnicity, lower income and education, sex and gender, age group, geographic location, military veterans, cognitive impairments, surgical patients, cancer patients, and the end of life.1 Many of these same groups are also vulnerable to pain treatment that is limited in access and scope.1 2,48 In addition to factors such as age, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, gender and geography, education and health literacy also influence access to kinds of care and to care outcomes. For example, while back pain is common across all primary care populations, low- income, racially diverse individuals are impacted differently. African Americans have a lower likelihood than whites of receiving comprehensive pain assessment and management. 48 African Americans may also receive less intensive diagnostic and treatment approaches compared to white patients.48 For occupation-related back pain, whites are more likely to be diagnosed with disc herniations and have surgery than blacks; yet a nonspecific diagnosis and lack of surgery uniquely predicts lower treatment expenditure and disability ratings for African Americans.49 Perversely, it is possibl e that this disparity in care provides an advantage to those African Americans who might ostensibly be considered 'undertreated': less treatment for back pain may be better treatment. 35 This does not, however, erase the sting of discriminatory care. Episodes of major lifetime racial discriminatory events are the strongest predictors of back pain reported in African - Americans, with perceived day -to-day discrimination being the strongest p redictor of back pain for African American women.50 Racial discrimination as a predictor of pain is consistent with the impact of social context and its interrelationship with chronic pain.51 Older African Americans experience severe mismanagement of pain and potentially inappropriate or dangerous medication duplication or interactions, particularly those with comorbidity, multiple providers and limited access. 52 Patients of lower socioeconomic status and lower health care literacy are less likely to be abl e pursue effective healthcare options not typically covered by insurance. There is ongoing research to assess how disparities in health care and outcomes operate along ethnic and socioeconomic lines. A recent review of long- term survey data indicates that racial/ethnic Appendices - Page A- 136disparities in pain may be in part accounted for by socioeconomic status and education level\u2014 both factors that interact with race and ethnicity.11 Hispanics are at higher risk for pain and pain undertreatment given the incidence of lower education, income levels, and lack of health insurance and/or access to care. These disadvantages are further compounded when there is limited English proficiency that impacts communication with health care providers.1 American Indians and Alaska natives have markedly higher rates of pain symptoms compared to U.S. general population,53 with high rates of diseases and health conditions such as diabetes, arthritis and obesity that produce significant pain.1 Despite this, American Indians report minimizing pain complaints and not readily asking for help, likely exacerbating disparities through underdiagnosis and undertreatment. 54 Asian Americans have overall lower pain pr evalence than non -Hispanic whites. However, the variety of national origins, cultures, languages and ethnicities lead to variations within this group. Lower reports may be due to a general reluctance to report pain (perceived as a sign of weakness) and a f ear of side effects of pain medication combined with the potential liability of lower English proficiency and the experience of cultural bias by health professionals.1 In every ethnic/racial category, women are more likely than men to report a wide range o f chronic pain conditions 1,55,56 while pain prevalence varies for women by age and race/ethnicity.57 Women experience disparities in pain care with misdiagnoses, delays in correct diagnoses, improper and uneven treatment, gender bias, stigma and neglect, and dismissal and discrimination from the health care system.1,58 Women report greater severity, longer -lasting and more frequent pain than men, and also experience multiple pain problems. Women are prescribed opioids and benzodiazepine sedatives at higher rates than men. 59,60 While men are more likely than women to die from prescription opioid painkillers, the percentage increase in deaths since 1999 is over fivefold greater among women. 61 Between 1999 and 2010, about 18 women died every day in the U.S from a prescription opioid overdose. For every woman who died of an overdose, there were 30 who went to the emergency department for painkiller misuse or abuse.61 Chronic pain in children is often underrecognized1 and even when recognized is still undertreated, with consequences that include behavioral changes and adverse effects on child development.62 While both boys and girls are more at risk of chronic pain as they get older, girls report chronic pain more often than boys.14,63 Undertreated pain is also co mmon among hospitalized children.64 There are many levels at which children may receive disadvantaged care.65 Many pain medicines have not undergone clinical trials or been approved for pediatric use and consequently providers are more reluctant to adminis ter them. The prevalence of chronic pain among independent living older adults ranges from 18 % to 57%, depending on the definition of chronic pain. More severe pain and pain that interferes with activities increases with age.1 Additionally, there may be difficulty assessing pain in older adults with cognitive impairment. Side effects of drug treatment may further adversely affect their cognitive function and overall health. 66-68 Appendices - Page A- 137Easy access to opioids as the main pillar of pain care can be vi ewed as inadequate or 'disadvantaged' care based on the lack of evidence for safety or effectiveness for chronic non- cancer (CNCP) pain.69,70 This is further reinforced by opioids' abuse liability. The successful marketing of opioid dose- escalation for CNCP has adversely affected those traditionally considered disadvantaged as well as those who are not. The perfect storm of circumstances, with opioids for CNCP promoted by physicians71 and pharma alike, opened the floodgates to single modality care with opi oids creating an addiction crisis72 with a staggering impact on, for example, unemployed and disabled workers in economically devastated industrial communities.73 White, middle -class people in non-urban settings are disproportionately affected by the current opioid crisis. Between 2007-2014, opioid dependence rose by 3,203% among patients privately insured in these communities.23 Effective pain care is not assured by economic access to care, for example, through private insurers.13 While the 2016 Centers for Disease and Control (CDC) guidelines confirm non-opioid therapy is preferred for chronic pain outside of active cancer, palliative and end-of- life care,74 for these populations pain is often the dominant symptom1 and there is substantial evidence that nonpharmacologic therapies can play a significant role in cancer pain, palliative and end of life pain care as well. 75-77 Taking into account all health care disparities and the current U.S. crisis in pain care, a case can be made that any patient no matter their ethnic or socioeconomic status, who is not informed or who is not offered effective nonpharmacologic options for pain is, in fact, inadequately served. One could argue that given the risks of standard care, failing to educate patients and recommend nonpharmacologic care should be considered unethical. Complexity of pain categorization There is tremendous variability in the categorization of pain states that can obscure the magnitude of the problem of pain management. Pain is commonly categorized into acute and chronic, according to timeline and connection to tissue injury. Acute pain typically lasts less than 3 months but may persist longer and usually has a clear connection to a physically identifiable nociceptive (pain generating) pathology or tissue damage.78 Acute pain is expected to resolve as the tissue damage heals. Chronic pain is present for longer than 3 months and may or may not have a clear and current connection to an identifiable tissue-based cause, structural injury or defect. Cancer pain can be acute, whether it is post -surgical or due to ongoing nociception, or can be chronic. The timeline of a pain co ndition is increasingly being recognized as an artificial metric, as the distinguishing features of the mechanisms of acute and chronic pain are recognized. For chronic pain, the search for causative physical sources can be frustrated by many factors, incl uding the lack of sensitivity of available imaging technology to detect soft issue and neuropathic causes, the complex structures that can be involved in the generation and modification of pain, and the limited training most doctors receive in the subtleties of physical examination for pain conditions. 79,80 Physicians report wanting more training and knowledge on evidence -based nonpharmacologic therapies and are not aware of evidence- based resources.81 Appendices - Page A- 138'Any meaningful effort to improve pain management will require a basic culture shift in the nation's approach to mandating pain-related education for all health professionals who provide care to people with pain'.82 More recent discoveries about central an d peripheral nervous system pain processing (central sensitization and peripheral sensitization) are being recognized as more actionable when classifying pain. Central sensitization involves neuronal and non-neuronal pathways (example, glial pathways) to nd from the brain and spinal cord.83 Peripheral sensitization involves peripheral structures such as muscle, nerve, fascia and others.84,85 In both central and peripheral sensitization, decreased inhibitory signals meant to downregulate nociceptive transmi ssion are themselves inhibited, leading to enhanced perception of pain. This presents clinically as hyperalgesia (experiencing a mildly painful stimulus as very painful) and allodynia (experiencing non -painful stimuli as painful). The phenomena of peripher al sensitization are increasingly recognized in the medical community and well documented in basic science literature. 84,85 Another increasingly recognized neuroplastic process is the reorganization of the somatosensory cortex leading to altered and ineffi cient movement strategies, which can themselves cause fatigue and pain.86,87 These changes in the nervous system currently inform our perceptions of chronic pain and are seen in many common chronic pain syndromes, including headache; back and neck pain; chronic abdominal pain; fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue; visceral pain; and the group of conditions called repetitive strain injuries such as cervical postural syndrome, most cases of thoracic outlet syndrome, carpal tunnel disorders, trigger fingers, and forearm and thumb tendonitis. Pain can also be subcategorized according to anatomical sites where the pain is felt such as headache, neck and back pain. Pain can be named for the tissues involved such as musculoskeletal, visceral, or neuropathic. It can be named for the pathological process such as cancer pain, osteoporotic pain, OA pain, repetitive strain injury or post-surgical pain. Many of these categories of pain can coexist and even overlap, making it important to understand the parameters and definitions used with studies evaluating pain statistics. Regardless of classification systems, the number of people in pain is high and increasing. 1,7-10 Moreover, chronic pain states have the highest economic and societal adverse impacts. Co-morbidities associated with pain The definition of pain commonly used in hospice was proposed by Dame Cicely Saunders, and includes the physical, psychological, social, and spiritual domains.88 This inclusive definition can be helpful in thinking about non- terminal cases in volving pain since co- morbidities spanning Saunders' domains are common in chronic pain patients and can complicate the evaluation and successful treatment of pain. There is a complex association between pain and psychiatric disorders. Adults with mental health disorders are significantly more likely to be prescribed opioids; 16% of Americans who have mental health disorders receive over half of all opioid prescriptions. 89 Patients with chronic pain are at increased risk of comorbid depression, anxiety and post- traumatic stress disorder.32,90 Pain increases depression Appendices - Page A- 139risk 3 -5 fold.91 Pain, rather than chronic disease, is associated with the recurrence of depressive and anxiety disorders;20 50-80% of chronic pain patients report insomnia of a severity that warrants clinical attention.92 However, opioids generally exacerbate rather than improve these sleep and mental health comorbidities.93 There are many interconnections between social reject ion or exclusion and pain; for example, both are experienced in the same parts of the brain.51 Social isolation is a common condition among pain patients. Pain itself isolates the individuals since they may withdraw from family, work, school and social act ivities. Pain medications, however, can exacerbate rather than improve isolation by interfering with hormonal and neurotransmitter functions.94 The endogenous opioid system is involved in the development and maintenance of human attachment. According to th e brain opioid theory of social bonding,95,96 beta endorphins attach to mu opioid receptors resulting in analgesia and feelings of wellbeing. These are closely related to the dopamine reward system and the oxytocin system affecting bonding, reinforcing the rewarding nature of close social interactions.97-99 The disruption of these interconnected functions\u2014human social bonding, parent-infant bonding, the endogenous reward system which includes sexual response\u2014by exogenous opioids is currently being studied e xtensively. Hypogonadism as a result of long term opioids has long been recognized.100 The measure of the social dysfunction seen with opioid use is far reaching and has not been adequately addressed within in most clinical practice settings.99 As discusse d above, substance use disorders (SUD) commonly occur and have increased as a result of the liberal use of prescription opioids. These may result from preexisting SUD or be iatrogenically induced dependence, tolerance and addiction to prescribed opioids. F or a brief time, the term 'pseudo addiction' was used to justify the prescribing of higher opioid doses while ignoring 'red -flag' signs of addiction such as lost prescriptions, requests for early refills, and non-adherence with prescribed doses. 101 In studying the association of prolonged opioid use with psychiatric co- morbidities, there is an 'adverse selection' at play; people with serious psychiatric co -morbidities are more likely to end up on high dose, long term opioids.102-105 This could be in part a result of the difficulty accessing behavioral health and addiction services as well as the need to present with physical symptoms to obtain care. Opioids are being used as a proxy treatment, a convenient but risky option for complex pathologies that are ch aracterized and labeled as 'pain' by patients and practitioners. 102 The social services needed to fully assess and treat them are often unavailable. Pain interacts with overall health. Other comorbidities such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease and obesity are at once the cause of certain types of pain and exacerbated by pain.1 Illnesses that are comorbid with pain can, in turn, be exacerbated by the use of opioids that are ineffective for chronic pain, produce illness behavior and carry a significant abus e liability.

The majority of medical/healthcare visits are initiated because of pain32-35 and as a result, primary care practitioners (PCPs) , family medicine, general internal medicine, general pediatrics, combined medicine -pediatrics, general obstetrics and gynecology, osteopathy, and general surgery assisted by nurses, nurse practitioners (APRN) and physicians' assistants (PAs) care for the largest proportion of those with pain and prescribe the largest proportion of pain medications including opioids.106-108 The current business model for most primary care settings encourages short appointments to increase the volume of patients seen. Pain patients, especially chronic pain patients, have complex medical histories and often have multiple overlapping causes of pain. These presentations place an intense time pressure on PCPs making it difficult for them to fully address the complexities of chronic pain and may encourage therapeutic choices that can be easily recommended within the time allotted, most commonly prescription drugs. In 2012 nearly 49% of all dispensed opioid prescriptions were accounted for by primary care specialists.2 Additionally, the education currently provided to PCPs is deficient in content related to pain in general and the full spectrum of evidence-based pain care approaches. Pain curricula in medical school education for both MDs and DOs in the U.S. ranges from 1-31 hours during the 3-4 year curriculum, with a mean of 11.13 hours and a mode, or common length, of four 4 hours. 109 Residency education is also insufficient to prepare primary care practitioners for competency in the treatment of common pain problems.1,110 'A lack of knowledge and/or evidence of clinical effectiveness preclude the delivery of adequate care.'110 'Thus, the current training system has left primary care practitioners with inadequate tools with which to deal with some of their most frequent and challenging patients.' 80 'Any meaningful effort to improve pain management will require a basic culture shift in the nation's approach to mandating pain- related education for all health professionals who provide care to people with pain.'82 Other medical specialists also treat pain that is within the purview of their specialty on a regular basis. Examples of this are urologists treating kidney stones and their painful sequelae or orthopedic surgeons treating post-operative pain. Generally, these specialists will treat pain for a short term and then return the patient to primary care or specialty pain care. Other specialties such as rheumatology, sports medicine, and physical medicine and rehabilitation (PM&R) sometimes have long- term engagemen t with pain care for their patients, mainly with interventional and pharmacologic options. The medical pain specialty grew out of the work of John J. Bonica who directed the Department of Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine at the University of Washington in the 1960s. Many, if not most, pain clinics are still housed in anesthesiology clinics, but fellowship pain training can now be pursued not only by anesthesiologists but other specialists in neurology/psychiatry, PM&R, and internal and family medicine. Phys icians who receive fellowship training in pain care learn interventional pain strategies that originated in regional anesthesia and acute pain care. Acute pain interventions are an essential part of pain care. But the expansion of these strategies, which a re the mainstay of anesthesiology and acute pain practices, to chronic pain care have had more modest success and only in carefully selected patient Appendices - Page A- 141groups.111 Additionally, there are licensed practitioners from evidence-based disciplines, as in acupuncture therapy, massage therapy, osteopathic therapy, chiropractic and others, providing pain care but whose work may currently be less accessible within most formalized health systems. Another way to categorize the practitioners in the pain field is through insurance reimbursement. Some practitioners are typically insurance reimbursable such as physical therapists, psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers and dentists, and under certain circumstances, pharmacists. Practitioners licensed in fie lds such as acupuncture, massage, chiropractic, and naturopathy provide care that 60-70% less likely to be reimbursed. 112 Even when health coverage is available it is generally limited, such that patients will still have substantial out-of- pocket costs.113 There are also studied approaches to pain care that are not regulated but are delivered by licensed practitioners 'in place' such as nurses using guided imagery or progressive relaxation, for example. These services are generally not reimbursed. The need for an informed strategy including all evidence- based comprehensive pain care is clearly demonstrated to be in patients' best interest, as reflected by their health care seeking and out-of-pocket expenditures for pain care. Reported in 1993 the number of visits to what were called 'unconventional' providers exceeded visits to all US primary care physicians; 1990 expenditures were 13.7 billion, 10.3 billion of which was out of pocket.114 Analysis of the 2012 National Health Interview Survey estimated the out-of-pocket expenditure at $30.2 billion.115 Out-of-pocket expenditures for back pain alone was $8.7 billion.113 Coordination of care across disciplines and access to nonpharmacologic care have not been optimized in the current system in most states and ter ritories. There are a few state Medicaid policy initiatives aimed at increasing access to effective nonpharmacologic therapies as a first line treatment for pain conditions. For example, the Oregon Health Plan (OHP - Oregon's Medicaid program) covers acupu ncture therapy, chiropractic and osteopathic manipulation, physical therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy for all back conditions. In addition, yoga, intensive rehabilitation, massage, and/or supervised exercise therapy are recommended to be included in the comprehensive treatment plans and will be provided where available as determined by each Oregon's Coordinated Care Organization. 116 Vermont's legislature is piloting a program where they will cover acupuncture therapy for back pain in a Medicaid population and monitor health outcomes and cost- effectiveness.117 Private coverage of every category of licensed provider is mandated in the State of Washington, where the number of people using insurance benefits for care by these providers was similar to data by the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS); hence coverage did not lead to runaway utilization.118 Musculoskeletal pain was the most common diagnosis for a visit. For insured patients with back pain, fibromyalgia and menopause symptoms, users of nonpharmacologic therapy providers had lower insurance expenditures than those who did not use them.119 Coverage for care is not current to the evidence-base detailed in Section 2 below. Diversity of practice and engaging multiple evidence-based disciplines is enthusiastically embraced in pain medicine as a concept. Yet without a strategy on evidence-based pain care both in terms of effectiveness and cost -effectiveness, patients are not well guided in options and are Appendices - Page A- 142often left to be the sole case managers for their own care as they navigate a system fragmented into silos. Practitioners and patients are challenged by other barriers in access to nonpharmacologic options that are effective for pain. In addition to the socioeconomic, gender, and racial/ethnic disparities already detailed, geographic disparities exist in the numbers and locations of practitioners using nonpharmacologic options leaving many regions and populations underserved. 120,121 As of the writing of this paper there are ongoing meetings regarding Medicare and Medicaid coverage for licensed practitioners working within their state -regulated scope of practice and utilizing therapies proven effective for pain. The Joint Commission (TJC), which has long recognized nonpharmacologic approaches to pain, has now mandated that their accredited hospitals and facilities provide evidence-based nonpharmacologic options for pain, emphasizing the importance of options in comprehensive care. Strategies will be needed to facilitate both access and coverage to nonpharmacologic therapies. Risk and lack of effectiveness of prev alent pain care strategies Despite increased medical expenditures for pain and technological advances such as magnetic resonance imaging, new medications and surgical approaches, the prevalence and impact of chronic pain is worsening rather than improving. Many factors have contributed to the current situation. Both patients and medical practitioners labor under the mistaken idea that most pain problems can be fixed by the doctor or surgeon with a drug or procedure. Medical school and graduate courses still emphasize a search for appropriate dosing of opioid medications rather than considering other options. The business model of medicine, the cultural authority of projected and perceived certainty, and the disempowered position of patients in pain has promoted simplistic solutions \u2014albeit well-intentioned\u2014to complex problems. Patients are often regarded as passive participants with little emphasis placed on self -care, on pain prevention, or therapies that engage preventive and self -care strategies, despite demonstrated longitude of benefit. The increasing need to respond to poorly addressed pain resulted in the numeric quantification of pain. As the notion of pain as the 'fifth vital sign' took hold in the late 1990s, pain assessment became increasingly focused on a single dimension of patient status\u2014the pain score on an 11-point, 0- 10 rating scale; either a numeric rating scale with numbers marked on a 10cm line or the visual analogue scale like the Wong- Baker scale, usually a 10cm line with faces expressing l evels of pain and no numeric markings on it. 122 By taking eyes off the more complex goals of quality of life and overall functional ability, the system inadvertently contributed to reduced functioning and increased suffering of pain patients.69 The pressure to manage pain scores rather than to treat patients themselves has contributed to overprescribing opioids, widespread drug diversion which is engaging illegal sources for prescription drugs, the resurgence of heroin addiction, increasing disability from pain, and deaths from overdose. 1,2,35,123,124 Pain practitioners have long noted that pain scores do not deliver accurate information about the status of a patient. Scores vary inexplicably and alone do not inform Appendices - Page A- 143tailored, comprehensive and effective solutions. Pain scores do not capture level of function or quality of life (QOL) intrinsic to an experience of wellbeing that can be present despite high pain scores. The reduction of a patient's pain experience to pain scores led to a narrowly defined goal of pain score reduction in response to interventions.123 Opioids and other drugs The US prescribes 50 times more opioids than the rest of the world combined.72 Between 1999 and 2010, opioid prescriptions in the US were enough to medicate every American adult with a standard pain treatment dose of 5mg of hydrocodone every 4 hours for a month.125 This indicates a public health crisis as prescription opioids contribute to substance use disorder (SUD) or addiction. Prescription opioids are now the most frequent gateway drug to heroin. Inadvertent overdose deaths associated with prescription opioids exceed overdose deaths from heroin and cocaine combined 125 and in many states now exceed deaths from motor vehicle accidents.126,127 Societal and family disruption, violence and insufficient resources to treat SUD have resulted. Complications attributable to the rapid rise of opioid use for chronic non- cancer pain (CNCP) hav e led to an evidence based re -evaluation of the practice of prescribing ever - increasing doses of opioids that have known risks and unproven benefits.69,128 This has finally propagated recommendations for a shift away from opioids and toward comprehensive, multi- modal evidence- based care. While the government has increased access to naloxone for the treatment of acute opioid toxicity (respiratory arrest), it is important to note that this is not a preventative strategy for the deepening opioid crisis. Acut e pain care can impact the development of chronic pain and disability and the development of opioid dependence, tolerance, addiction and diversion. Patients often receive long-term opioid therapy after an acute problem such as dental procedure, surgery or injury. Alarming numbers of patients then transition to chronic use after starting opioids for the short- term treatment of post-operative pain (27%) or injury-related pain (27%). 129 Pain relievers are the medications reported most often prescribed at hospital emergency and outpatient department visits.33 Per the CDC, the economic burden of prescription opioid overdose, abuse and dependence is estimated to be $78.5 billion each year in the US.34,130 Moreover, misuse and abuse of prescription opioids costs the country an estimated $42 billion a year in lost productivity. 131 Workers' compensation data from Washington State indicates that injured workers who are on opioids for over three months are unlikely to return to work.124 The probability of long- term opioid use increases after as little as five days of prescribed opioids as the initial treatment of pain; the probability of patients remaining on opioids for the long- term is the highest when treatment is initiated with long acting opioids, 132 a strategy borrowed from cancer pain treatment71 and not well studied in non- cancer pain. Tolerance (requiring higher doses to achieve the same analgesic effect), dependence (suffering withdrawal symptoms if a dose is missed) and opioid i nduced hyperalgesia 133 (a heightened sensitivity to pain) can develop quickly. There is no clear way to ascertain what baseline pain is present and Appendices - Page A- 144what pain is in response to withdrawal from the last dose of opioid or induced by the opioid itself. Acetaminophen (APAP) has been found to be only modestly helpful for mild pain; it is ineffective for acute low back pain,134 and it is uncertain if it has any effect in chronic low back pain (cLBP).135 Although there are fewer adverse events with acetaminophen than other medications,134 there are dose limitations due to hepatotoxicity.68 Nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory (NSAID) medications may be helpful in decreasing pain from a variety of causes such as arthritis, headache and back pain. More recent trials, however, report \"that NSAIDs had smaller benefits for cLBP than previously observed\".134 The benefit of NSAIDs for spinal pain compared to placebo were not clinically important.136 NSAIDs are now recognized to interfere with healing137,138 and cau se of significant morbidity and mortality. They are a well- recognized cause of rebound headaches. Rebound pain, chronic medication use and discontinuation syndromes in other conditions have not been as widely studied but exist.139 Many patients have diffic ulty tolerating NSAID medicines due to gastrointestinal side effects such as nausea and abdominal pain.140 The FDA has issued new warnings on NSAIDs,66 adding stroke and cardiac risk to the list of already well-known risks, which include delayed healing, r enal failure and acute and chronic GI bleeding.2,68 There are 16,500 deaths annually from NSAID associated GI complications among RA and OA patients alone.67,140 Corticosteroid medications are considered potent anti- inflammatories often prescribed orally o r by injection for refractory neurologic and autoimmune related pain as in discogenic pain, rheumatoid arthritis and intractable headache. Recent studies challenge the usefulness of steroids for many indications including chronic pain.134,141 One in five A merican adults in a commercially insured plan were given prescriptions for short term use of oral corticosteroids during the three-year period from 2012 through 2014. 142 Even at relatively low doses, corticosteroids can be associated with insomnia, nervousness, behavioral changes, increased appetite, headache and joint pain.143,144 There are increased risks of serious acute complications such as infection, venous thromboembolism, avascular necrosis and fracture. There are also risks of development and or ex acerbation of chronic disease such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, osteoporosis, and other features of iatrogenic Cushing's syndrome.142 Corticosteroids are one of the most common reasons for admission to hospital for drug related adverse events'.142 Yet corticosteroids do not appear to be effective for acute, radicular or nonradicular low back pain.134,141,145 Epidural steroid injections are associated with less improvement in patients with lumbar spine stenosis,146 increased risk of spinal fractures,147 and increased risk of infection if followed within three months by spinal fusion surgery.148 Skeletal muscle relaxants are prescribed for short -term pain relief in acute pain but are associated with central nervous system adverse effects, especially sed ation.134 Research is equivocal on significant benefit of some muscle relaxants for pain or muscle spasm.149 Baclofen (oral, IV or intrathecal) can be helpful for neurologically mediated spasticity as in multiple sclerosis, traumatic brain or spine injury but with risk of increase in mean fat body weight150 and serious complications, even organ failure, with disruption in administration.151 Carisoprodol (Soma) should be avoided as it metabolizes to meprobamate, which has been withdrawn from the Appendices - Page A- 145market in many jurisdictions due to toxicity and respiratory suppression when combined with opioids. Benzodiazepines may provide some relief for nonradicular low back pain and muscle spasm.134 However, common adverse effects include anticholinergic sympt oms such as dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, drowsiness, sedation and confusion. Adverse effects and risk of dependence are important limiting factors especially since there is a high prevalence of concurrent benzodiazepine and opioid use in patients with chronic pain.152 Moreover, half of deaths from drug overdoses among veterans occurred when concurrently prescribed benzodiazepines and opioids. 153 Anticonvulsant (antiepileptic) medications gabapentin and pregabalin are often used in neuropathic and neurological pain conditions such as diabetic neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia and migraine and more recently in acute perioperative pain.2 Topiramate and valproate/divalproex are commonly used for headache attenuation or prevention.154,155 Though carbamazepine is commonly used in the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia evidence for its effectiveness is not strong.155,156 These medications provide mild to moderate benefit while being limited by neurological adverse effects including drowsiness and cognitive slowing.157 Antidepressants of various classes including tricyclic, serotonin and norepinephrine modulators are commonly used in pain conditions including neuropathic, migraine and amplified pain disorders such as fibromyalgia and complex regional pain syndrome. 158 There is also a growing recognition that mood disorders, anxiety and other psychiatric co- morbidities increase the suffering associated with pain, which has resulted in an increase in the use of non-opioid drugs such as antidepressants. Certain antidepressants have propensity to anticholinergic effects, vasomotor symptoms, weight gain, sexual dysfunction, emotional blunting and suicidality and need to be chosen carefully based on risk and co- morbidities.159 Breakthroughs in neuroscience regarding the roles of glial cells160 and other pain modulating neuroplastic changes have led to the premature use of purported modulators of glial function, including ketamine, naltrexone, dextromethorphan, some tricyclics and other drugs, with variable results .161,162 But an effective course of acupuncture applied to local points for carpal tunnel syndrome results in distinct neuroplastic changes.87,163 as do other nonpharmacologic interventions for chronic pain.164 This trend to include the neuroplastic related aspects of chronic pain represents a significant contribution to pain care and is the focus of further research. Topical medications from various categories including local and general anesthetics (e.g., lidocaine and ketamine), muscle relaxants (e.g., baclofen), and antidepressants (e.g., amitriptyline) are used sing ularly or in combination for local pain management. Anti-inflammatories and capsaicin have been most studied and have the strongest evidence for benefit in musculoskeletal and neuropathic pain, respectively.165,166 Local anesthetics have been used topicall y and as intralesional injections. More recently intravenous infusions have been used for neuropathic pain or generalized pain.167 Inhaled and topical medications containing cannabinoids , most commonly tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and the less psychotropic annabidiol (CBD), interact with Appendices - Page A- 146cannabinoid receptors primarily in the brain to provide a broad range of effects.168 In addition to reduction of nausea, recent evidence demonstrates that cannabinoids exhibit comparable effectiveness to opioids in models of acute pain and significant effectiveness in chronic neuropathic pain.169,170 In a systematic review of RCTs of medical marijuana for CNCP, no serious adverse events were noted but \"neurocognitive adverse effects related to learning, memory, and psychomotor deficits were common even with low-dose, short- term use of medical marijuana though they appear well tolerated\".171 Headaches, sedation, dysphoria, and poor concentration were also noted. Long- term consequences of medical marijuana remain u nknown and research is ongoing for benefit in non-neuropathic chronic pain. Several classes of condition -based medications like triptans are prescribed for acute migraine172 and 'disease modifying agents' in autoimmune conditions have benefit in reducing pain related to these conditions, as in rheumatoid arthritis.173 Cardiovascular and immunosuppressive adverse effects limit their use. Imaging, procedures and surgery In medical systems where a team approach to care is absent, a variety of specialists end up delivering a menu of very similar services, primarily medication, along with costly, invasive procedures and surgeries. A sometimes -premature response to or over- interpretation of imaging technology can result in higher rates of procedures and surgeries . In the first decade of the 21st century, the use of high- cost imaging for the spine and joints for pain rose dramatically.174 However, studies suggest that MRI findings do not correlate well with pain intensity or functional impairment, nor is advanced imaging associated with better outcomes.175 Surgery rates are highest in areas of the country where imaging rates are highest,176 yet imaging is not associated with an advantage in subsequent pain, function, quality of life or overall improvement. 35 While the process of imaging is not related to a high incidence of adverse events, part of the risk of imaging is the prompting of interventions that may result in increased risk with little gain. Moreover, common age-related, nonspecific MRI findings such as degenerative disc disease or anomalies of the spine may unnecessarily contribute to patient alarm and distress 35 that leads to reduced physical and work activity and a vicious cycle of disuse, distress, and greater disability. The focus on imaging encourages patients to identify with their anatomical pathology often with little understanding of how that contributed to their pain or functional state. Procedures for pain include injections of various kinds, nerve blocks, epidurals, tissue ablations, spinal cord stimulators and pain pumps. These procedures can significantly reduce suffering and allow salvage of damaged limbs and tissues in the case of acute tissue injury. Timely use of these techniques can reduce the development of post- traumatic stress dis order (PTSD). 177 In chronic pain these interventions can also be very helpful in carefully selected patients. 178,179 Unfortunately, for many procedures there are no practice guidelines that are universally followed. Expensive interventional procedures for chronic pain, such as epidural and joint steroid injections increased by 228% from 2000 to 2011,180 and surgical center utilization Appendices - Page A- 147increased by 300%.181 The overuse of these strategies raises risk for patients and costs to the system. Moreover, their lack of effectiveness can be demoralizing for patients.182,183 As the long- term outcomes of surgical procedures are assessed, it is more evident that surgery performed to alleviate pain often does not achieve its goal. In geographic regions, the best spinal surgery outcomes occurred where surgery rates were the lowest; the worst results occurred in areas where rates were the highest.35 Structural pathology of the knee, rated during meniscal surgery, for example, does not correlate with patient reported pain and function.184 There is equivocal evidence for many common surgeries intended to remedy chronic pain; knee arthroscopies 185 and meniscectomies, for example.186-188 Surgery is found effective in the short but not in the long term for most patients with cervical radiculopathy and facet arthropathy neck pain. 189 When long- term follow -up for lumbar spine stenosis surgery is done, non- operative groups fare as well as the operative groups,190 except the operative groups experience an increased rate of side effects. The cost of a laminectomy can range from $50,000 to $90,000 without insurance and up to $2000 in copayments with insurance coverage. A spinal fusion can cost between $80,000- $150,000.191 \"Despite no specific concurrent reports of clarified indications or improved efficacy, there was a 220% increase in the rate of lumbar spine fusion surgery from 1990 to 2001 in the US.\" 35 Yet there are no clear benefits observed with surgical versus non- surgical treatment.190 Conservative treatment including physical therapy has been associated with positive long-term outcome and a reduced likelihood of cross-over to surgery after one year.192 Increased costs and lack of evidence of efficacy is not to condemn surgery as an option, but to question practice that engages surgery before or instead of more conservative, evidence - based therapeutic care. Decisions are complicated by a business model of medicine that continues to value costly interventions not necessarily supported by evidence, particularly in the case of chronic pain and despite the fact that many patients who submit to surgery do not have resolution of their chronic pain. While more research is needed to understand the progression from acute to chronic pain, it is clear that the limited, siloed strategies of the prevalent pain management system have not addressed the scope of pain in America. The NIH National Pain Strategy, 4 NAM,82 the CDC opioid guidelines,193 the updated pain mandate from The Joint Commission,194 the FDA,195 and the American College of Physicians (ACP) Clinical Practice Guideline (ACP)196 recommend evidence -informed, comprehensive pain care while conceding that past strategies generally, and the use of opioid medications specifically, have not remedied but rather exacerbated chronic pain, abuse, addiction, illness behavior and disability. Rapidly emerging science continues to inform our understanding of pain states and potential responses. Emerg ing science about the impact on pain states by the microbiome,197-199 mitochondria,200 fascia,201-203 glia160 and neuroplasticity,87,163 and movement disorders secondary to pain86 will likely inform future pain treatments. The national pain strategies are shifting from a model of pain care, well-intentioned but delivered in specialty silos, favoring expensive solutions that have equivocal evidence of benefit Appendices - Page A- 148to multimodal evidence -informed options, fitted to a patient's whole experience of pain and therapeutic goals. Evidence-informed practice is based in evaluation and dissemination of current research including biological, medical and behavioral science. Thirty seven US State Attorneys General have submitted a letter to America's Health Insur ance Plans (AHIP) asking them to include and incentivize evidence-based nonopioid treatments for pain.204 Nonpharmacologic therapies for pain are now recommended by the American College of Physicians (ACP) for acute and chronic low back pain. As of January 1, 2018, the largest hospital accreditation organization, the Joint Commission, will require hospitals provide nonpharmacologic modalities for pain.204 The current evidence for nonpharmacologic therapies for acute and chronic pain is detailed next. SECTION 2 - SOLUTIONS TO THE PROBLEM EVIDENCE -BASED NONPHARMACOLOGIC PAIN CARE (NPPC) Nonpharmacologic therapies are best considered within the context of all evidence -based medical treatment. The terms 'complementary and alternative' stratify care by considerations other than evidence of effectiveness and risk. Evidence-based nonpharmacologic therapies are safe and effective components in comprehensive pain care that can also be opioid sparing, that is, reduce the need for opioids to manage severe, acute pain and consequently reduce the need for chronic opioids. Nonpharmacologic therapies c an be stand -alone interventions or work in combination with medicine, procedures or surgery. An often underrecognized feature of nonpharmacologic therapies is their ability to confer additional benefits: a treatment to reduce pain can also reduce anxiety and depression, nausea and vomiting; facilitate restful sleep; and increase a patient's sense of well -being and desire to participate in their own recovery. Policy decisions for strategies on pain care must be informed by research and evidence for all pract ices in medicine. The assumption that conventional care is proven care has been challenged by reviews: the U.S Office of Technology Assessment in 1978 estimated that only 10-20% of all procedures then used in medical practice were shown to be efficacious b y controlled trial. 205 Estimates reported in the early 1990's determined 10- 15% of medical interventions were based on results from randomized controlled trials; by 2003 that figure improved: approximately 50%, of conventional care was found to be evidence- based.206 Comprehensive, research -informed care should follow the evidence and include all evidence- based disciplines in a multimodal approach to pain care, particularly therapies that have evidence not only in the short term but have been evaluated for impact longitudinally, that is, care that registers improvement months and years following a course of treatment.207,208 There are effective nonpharmacologic therapies available from licensed and regulated professionals such as acupuncture therapy, massage therapy, osteopathic manual medicine, chiropractic, physical therapy, and psychology. There are instructors trained in evidence- based, directed or self -engaged movement and meditative movement therapies as in yoga and Tai chi. Appendices - Page A- 149Lifestyle or behavioral approaches, such as stress management, cognitive behavioral therapy, meditation/mindfulness, and meditative movement therapies are also recommended as nonpharmacologic strategies. Other lifestyle approaches including diet and sleep hygiene have been shown to benefit health. These are low risk, low cost, well accepted by patients and many have been used successfully for thousands of years. There is an additional benefit to many of NPPC strategies; unlike drugs and surgery, they involve patient par ticipation and a commitment to self -care. Increased self -efficacy in managing pain often accompanies NPPC and correlates with improved mood and predicts improved outcomes in many chronic conditions, including pain. 209 For example, the military has studied \"active self -care therapies\" as a category of pain management that may be of value in an integrated, multimodal approach.210 Evidence -Based Nonpharmacologic Therapies for Acute Pain Over 50% of chronic opioid use begins in the acute care setting, after surgery, or for treatment of acute injury related pain.129 Nonpharmacologic therapies have demonstrated benefit for acute pain with opioid sparing in hospital settings for inpatient post-operative pain and for acute pain not related to surgery. The largest hospital accreditation organization in the US, The Joint Commission (TJC), has revised their pain mandate that was introduced in 2000. Effective January 1, 2018, TJC will require that their accredited hospitals and facilities 'provide' nonpharmacologic therapies for pain as a 'scorable' Element of Performance.194 Per TJC clarification statement of 2015, these include but are not limited to, physical modalities such as acupuncture therap y, chiropractic therapy, osteopathic manipulative treatment, massage therapy, physical therapy (PT), relaxation therapy, and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). While CBT, PT, exercise2 and electrical stimulation (E -Stim) have shown benefit for chronic pain,211,212 they are not detailed in this evidence review as they are currently recognized and part of covered conventional care options, albeit underutilized in some systems. CBT, PT, exercise and E- Stim are recognized nonpharmacologic therapies for pain an d included in the recommendations. Nonpharmacologic Therapies for Acute Inpatient Pain with Opioid Sparing Acupuncture therapy post-operative pain Acupuncture is understood as the insertion and manipulation of fine solid core needles at specified points or combination of points on the body. 'Acupuncture therapy' derives from the traditional East Asian paradigm recognizing the interrelationship of organs and body points and channels as well as associated symptoms, disease and dysfunction. Depending on a s tate's scope of practice, acupuncture often includes treating by means of mechanical, thermal or electrical stimulation; by insertion of needles, or by application of heat, pressure, or other forms of Appendices - Page A- 150stimulation. In practice, acupuncture needling is often done in combination with other therapies such as palpation, Tui na, Gua sha, cupping, moxibustion, e- stim, auricular treatment, herbal medicine and recommendations on diet, exercise, self -reflection and meditative movement like Tai chi. Acup uncture therapy, therefore includes acupuncture needling, accompanying therapies and recommendations that engage a patient in self -care, particularly in the treatment of chronic pain. In multiple systematic reviews with meta -analyses, acupuncture was effective in reducing post-surgical pain compared to sham acupuncture, controls and usual care with reduction in opioid need (21% opioid reduction at 8 hours, 23% at 24 hours and 29 % at 72 hours post- surgery) with lowered incidence of opioid- related side effects such as nausea, dizziness, sedation, pruritus and urinary retention.213-215 A systematic review with meta -analysis found acupuncture after total knee arthroplasty reduced pain and was associated with delayed opioid use.216 In a systematic review and meta -analysis, peri -operative auricular acupuncture reduced postoperative pain and need for analgesic use compared to sham or standard-of- care controls.217 Pain benefit at 48 hours was equivalent to analgesics with fewer side effects. These findings have potential for reduction in hospital readmission due to uncontrolled pain. 218 Intraoperative electrical stimulation of acupuncture points reduced intraoperative opioid requirements, post-operative pain and duration of stay in the post anesthesia care unit.219 Acupuncture was effective, safe, and well tolerated for post- tonsillectomy pain in children with no significant side effects.220 The American Pain Society's guidelines on post-operative pain management neither 'recommend nor discourage' acupuncture therapy as part of recommended multimodal post- operative pain based on the literature available at the time of their guideline writing.221 A subsequent systematic review with meta -analysis cited above supports the use of acupuncture as adjuvant therapy in treatin g postoperative pain and reducing opioid use.214 Acupuncture therapy acute non -surgical pain For acute and subacute low back pain, a systematic review with meta- analysis222 led the American College of Physicians (ACP) to recommend acupuncture as a first -line of care.141 Acupuncture is also effective for acute migraine.223 In an RCT enrolling 300 patients with acute pain presenting to an emergency department, acupuncture was s uperior to parenteral morphine for pain relief and onset of action with fewer adverse effects.224 A retrospective study of emergency department acute pain patients found acupuncture decreased pain comparable to analgesics with additional benefit of reduction in anxiety.225 A trial of 1964 patients found acupuncture benefit comparable to pharmacotherapy for emergency department patients presenting with acute low back pain and ankle sprain. 226 A systematic review with meta -analysis of acupuncture analgesia in the emergency setting found acupuncture '...provided statistically significant, clinically meaningful and improved levels of patient satisfaction with respect to pain relief in the emergency setting'. 227 The authors found evidence of lower cost and low adve rse effects profile. In an observational study of 1008 patients including children, acupuncture given Appendices - Page A- 151as first aid immediately after, optimally within 48 hours, of a burn injury reduced pain, reddening, pigmentation, scarring and PTSD that commonly follows traumatic burns.228 Acupuncture therapy safety Acupuncture has a 'relative risk' that is low. The NIH Consensus Statement on Acupuncture published in 1998 found that 'the incidence of adverse effects is substantially lower than that of many drugs or other accepted procedures for the same conditions.229 Systematic reviews and surveys have clarified that acupuncture is safe when performed by appropriately trained practitioners 230-237 with infrequent minor side effects such as feeling relaxed, elated, tired or having sensation or itching at point of insertion.234 Rare serious complications such as infection or pneumothorax are directly related to insufficient training.235,236,238 Safe use of acupuncture has also been established in pediatrics230,239- 241 and for women who are pregnant.242- 244 Massage therapy post-operative pain Massage therapy involves manipulation of soft tissue structures of the body to prevent or alleviate pain, spasm, tension, or stress and to promote health and wellness. A systematic review with meta -analysis of 10 trials showed a single dose of massage therapy provided significant improvement in post-operative pain.245 In a systematic review of 16 trials, massage therapy was effective for treating pain and anxiety compar ed to active comparators in surgical pain populations.246 In a randomized trial of veterans undergoing major surgery, massage was effective and a safe adjuvant therapy for the relief of acute post -operative pain.247 Massage is effective for pain reduction in post- cesarean section patients,248 cardiac,249 and thoracic surgery patients.250 Massage therapy safety Therapeutic massage is relatively safe. Studies in adults and children with cancer251-253 and in the post-operative period247 have found rare serious adverse events254-256 and low rates of minor complaints such as muscle soreness.141 Appendices - Page A- 152Mind body1 directed therapies post-operative and acute pain Music therapy post-operative acute pain A systematic review with meta -analysis of research found music therapy reduced pain in burn patients257 and in pediatric post-operative pain.258 A meta -analysis of 97 studies evaluating music therapies for pain from a variety of causes (acute and procedural pain, and cancer/chronic pain) demonstrated statistically significant decreases in pain intensity, emotional distress, and analgesic use, both opioid and non-opioid intake.259 A trial of music therapy for post- cesarean section pain found decreased pain in the 24 hours following surgery and decreased analgesic consumption in the first four hours. 260 Suggestive techniques and guided imagery post-operative and acute pain A meta -analysis of trials found suggestive techniques such as hypnosis may be useful tools to alleviate post-operative pain, especially in minor surgeries.261 A systematic review and meta -analysis of the efficacy of audio recorded therapeutic suggestions given while under general anesthesia found no effect on pain and small but significant effects on medication use and recovery.262 Listening to a guided imagery CD 2 weeks before and 3 weeks after total knee replacement resulted in reduced pain that persisted at 3 weeks.263 Virtual reality assisted distraction Virtual reality (VR) technolog y enables people to become immersed in a computer - simulated, three -dimensional environment as a distraction to pain.264 Coupled with standard analgesia, VR has been found beneficial in reduction of burn-induced pain and burn wound care in adults and children.264,265 VR assisted burn and nonburn wound care reduced opioid need by 39% compared to no VR, while levels of pain and anxiety were similar.266 VR has shown potential in inpatient cancer procedure- related pain.267 Mind body directed therapies safety Music therapy, suggestive techniques, and guided imagery are not associated with significant adverse effects and are safe options to improve post- operative recovery.260-262 VR has 1 The term 'mind body' represents an attempt to accommodate the bidirectio nal or circular impact that interventions have on symptoms typically categorized as either mental/psychological/spiritual or 'discretely physical'. However, this is an artificial bifurcation since all body systems use identical communication molecules and mechanisms and since there is never a physical condition that does not register a psychological component. We use the term here as it has been utilized in the current literature but acknowledge a certain limitation shared by terms such as 'behavioral' or 'relaxation' therapies. Appendices - Page A- 153potential risk of nausea and increased potential for collisions with objects in the real world.268 The latter is controlled by creating 'safe areas' to use VR and with in -person 'spotting' supervision. Debriefing post-V R experience may benefit especially young children and those vulnerable to effects of immersive reality experience. Multimodal approach to acute pain care Multimodal pain care is now recognized as the optimal inclusive and responsive approach to patients experiencing pain: inclusive of all evidence- based therapies including effective nonpharmacologic options and responsive to patient's diverse and evolving needs. Evidence- based nonpharmacologic therapies are recommended in comprehensive pediatric and adu lt pain care.82,194,269 Multimodal pain care is recommended by the American Pain Society in their guidelines to post-operative pain management.221 Effective nonpharmacologic options are recommended by the ACP in their guidelines for acute low back pain.141 Frequency, dosage and timing of nonpharmacologic interventions for inpatient and acute pain care Therapies that are delivered by a single licensed independent practitioner, such as an acupuncturist, massage therapist or therapist providing an engaged or guided mind/body intervention, are generally given as daily treatment for the term of the inpatient stay with referral for outpatient care follow-up. Care such as music therapy or virtual guided imagery are not single practitioner dependent. Access can b e continuous or timed if provided by recordings that can be self -administered by patients. A session of inpatient acupuncture or massage therapy care can last from 20 -45 minutes. There is evidence-based data on dosage and frequency of nonpharmacologic therapies, but more research is needed to determine the optimal frequency, dosage and timing of interventions: length of a session, or for the case of acupuncture therapy, what constitutes an optimal intervention in terms of session time, number of points palpated, needled, point retention time, and with what additional hands-on therapies. Evidence -Based Nonpharmacologic Therapies for Cancer Pain Acupuncture therapy cancer pain The American Society of Clinical Oncology Clinical Practice Guidelines found acupuncture was effective in improving pain. The reviewers categorized these findings as 'evidence- based; benefits outweigh harms; evidence quality: low; strength of weak'.270 A recent systematic review with meta -analysis of 29 RCTs found acupuncture effective for cancer -related pain, particularly malignancy -related and surgery -induced pain.75 Acupuncture alleviates side effects of oncology radiation, including pain associated dysphagia,271 Appendices - Page A- 154as was found in a systematic review of acupuncture treatment for dysphagia following stroke.272 Cancer patients receiving inpatient acupuncture at a major cancer center experienced significant improvement in pain, sleep disturbance, anxiety, drowsiness, nausea, and fatigue.273 In a systematic review with meta -analysis acupuncture relieved joint pain associated with breast cancer treatment induced menopause.274 A review on the management of peripheral neuropathy induced by chemotherapy found acupuncture to be among therapies that may be useful.275 Massage therapy cancer pain Massage therapy was found in systematic reviews with meta- analyses to be effective for pain in cancer patients compared to active comparator s276 or usual care.76 Massage therapy was also effective for metastatic bone pain,277 for pain in children with cancer278 and those undergoing stem cell transplantation.278,279 Mind body directed therapy cancer pain Mindfulness-based courses including web-based mindfulness interventions (eHealth)280 are supportive for cancer patient's symptom burden. In systematic reviews with meta- analyses Mindfulness- Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) had a beneficial psychological impact for breast cancer patients,281,282 and on quality of life, mood and distress in cancer patients.283 A recent trial of MBSR for metastatic breast cancer patients demonstrated a positive impact on distress with a mild effect of improving average pain.284 In a large systematic review with meta- analysis, music therapy showed statistical improvements in cancer pain, emotional distress from pain and a small but statistical effect on anesthetic use, opioid and non-opioid intake.259 Music therapy in a palliative care setting found significant improve ment in pain, anxiety, depression, shortness of breath and mood.77 Evidence -Based Nonpharmacologic Therapies for Chronic Pain Nonpharmacologic therapies are well studied and effective for chronic pain. A Clinical Practice Guideline from the American College of Physicians (ACP) states nonpharmacologic interventions should be considered as first-line options in chronic low back pain, noting that fewer harms are associated with these effective therapies than with pharmacologic options. The ACP emphasizes therapies be administered by practitioners with appropriate training.141 Acupuncture therapy chronic pain Acupuncture has accrued the most evidence in the treatment of chronic pain. An individual patient data meta -analysis of 29 randomized trials involving 17,922 patients using acupuncture therapy for chronic musculoskeletal pain related to the neck and low back, knee OA, Appendices - Page A- 155headache and migraine found acupuncture was significantly better than both sham acupuncture and usual care for all conditions.285,286 In a systematic review with meta -analysis, acupuncture was associated with greater, immediate r elief of chronic pain compared to sham acupuncture or analgesic injection.287 In a meta- analysis on long term impact, the effects of a course of acupuncture treatment for patients with chronic pain persisted significantly following care; 90% of acupuncture benefit persisted at 12 months in trials using wait list or usual care controls. Trials comparing acupuncture to sham found 50% persistence of benefit at 12 months for the verum groups.208 An updated individual patient meta-analysis of acupuncture for chronic nonspecific back pain, neck pain, shoulder pain, chronic headache or osteoarthritis included an additional 7 years of trials evaluating 39 trials (20,827 patients).288 Acupuncture was superior to both sham and no acupuncture controls for each pain condition. The effects of acupuncture were found to persist over time with only a small decrease, approximately 15%, in treatment effect at one year after randomization or 9-10 months after the completion of treatment. A novel finding was additional confirmat ion of benefit for acupuncture over sham on upper body musculoskeletal pain, neck and shoulder pain. In a systematic review with meta -analysis, acupuncture showed benefit over controls in the treatment of peripheral neuropathy related to diabetes, HIV, Bell's palsy and carpal tunnel syndrome.289 Simple pressure sustained by seeds or small magnets taped to ear points, a form of auricular treatment, showed benefit in acute and chronic pain in systematic reviews with meta- analysis.217,290 In a large multicent er trial of 14,161 patients with chronic neck pain, acupuncture (15 sessions over 3 months) added to routine care was associated with improvements in neck pain and disability maintained through 6 months compared to routine care alone. 291 Although acupunct ure care increased cost of treatment, the health benefits lasted well beyond the three - month study duration; per international cost-effectiveness threshold values, acupuncture was determined to be a cost -effective treatment strategy.292 In a cost -effectiveness review of nonpharmacologic interventions for low back pain (LBP), acupuncture was found to be a cost- effective option. 211 Meta- analyses demonstrate acupuncture is effective and cost -effective for knee OA.293,294 A systematic review and meta- analysis of manual acupuncture for myofascial pain syndrome found treatment of myofascial trigger points reduced pain and improved pain threshold in studies using a single treatment or a course of 8 treatments.295 Further research is needed to clarify the longitudinal impact of myofascial trigger point treatments as single or multiple sessions. A network meta -analysis of acupuncture needling alone and combined with Gua sha, moxibustion, or e- stim are effective in decreasing pain and in improving physical function in myofascial pain syndrome.296 In systematic reviews297,298 and meta- analyses,299 acupuncture was found effective for frequent episodic or chronic tension headaches and for episodic migraine. Acupuncture has also been shown to be effective for chronic shoulder pain,285,300 pain related to OA of the hip,301 and temporomandibular disorder myofascial pain.302,303 In a military population, acupuncture treatment given at least 4 times within a year was associated with improved symptoms, ability to Appendices - Page A- 156function and sense of wellbeing as well as reductions in opioid prescriptions (45%) muscle relaxants (34%), NSAIDs (42 %) and benzodiazepines (14%).304 In a systematic review and meta-analysis, acupuncture therapies with prokinetics were more effective than prokinetics alone for functional dyspepsia.305 Acupuncture therapy is recommended for functional dyspepsia in patients contraindicated for prokinetics. A systematic review and meta- analysis of trials comparing acupoint stimulation to NSAIDs for primary d ysmenorrhea found advantages in acupoint stimulation in alleviation of dysmenorrhea symptoms with fewer side effects and potential use for patients with NSAID contraindication.306 Based on their systematic review, the American College of Physicians (ACP) C linical Practice Guideline recommends acupuncture for acute, subacute and chronic low back pain (cLBP).141,222 The US Department of Health and Human Services Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) concluded that acupuncture therapy is effective for cLBP compared to placebo, sham, no treatment, usual care, or wait list controls. 145 The NIH also recommends acupuncture for low back pain and for knee OA.307 The FDA Education Blueprint For Health care Providers Involved In The Management or Support of Patients with Pain suggests acupuncture among a range of available therapies as part of a multidisciplinary approach to pain management.195 As stated above, acupuncture therapy has a 'relative risk' that is low when provided by qualified trained practitio ners. Massage therapy chronic pain Based on their systematic review, the ACP Clinical Practice Guideline recommends massage for acute, subacute and chronic low back pain (cLBP).141,222 AHRQ found massage effective for cLBP compared to placebo, sham, no t reatment, usual care, or wait list controls.145 The NIH also recommends massage for neck pain.307 Sixty high quality and seven low quality studies included in a systematic review with meta -analysis on pain and function across all pain populations found mas sage therapy effectively treats pain compared to sham, no treatment, and active comparators.308 A systematic review for upper and lower extremity conditions found soft tissue therapy effective for the management of heel pain and lateral epicondylitis.309 A trial of massage therapy for knee OA found the optimal dose at 8 weekly one-hour sessions with benefits persisting for at least 8 weeks beyond treatment. 310 A systematic review with meta -analysis found manual therapy including massage was effective for p ain, stiffness and physical function in knee OA with a call for more study with extended follow-up.311 Stiffness and physical function showed significant improvement with treatment duration of more than 4 weeks. As indicated above, massage therapy has a lo w risk of adverse events when provided by a trained practitioner. Appendices - Page A- 157Spinal manipulation therapy and manipulative therapy chronic pain Spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) involves treatment of the spine and pelvic related joints; manipulative therapy (MT) refers to the treatment of other joints in the body including upper and lower extremities. SMT and MT are often associated with high velo city, low amplitude (HVLA) thrust techniques, as well as low velocity, low amplitude (LVLA) or joint mobilization techniques. SMT, MT, HVLA and LVLA are techniques commonly used to improve pain and function, primarily by osteopathic physicians and chiropra ctors. A systematic review with meta -analysis showed SMT improves low back pain with benefits maintained for up to 6 weeks. 312 SMT was also shown to be cost-effective for low back pain.211 Based on their systematic review, the ACP Clinical Practice Guideline recommends spinal manipulation for acute, subacute and chronic low back pain (cLBP).141,222 AHRQ found SMT as effective as other active interventions for cLBP).145 Systematic reviews found SMT beneficial for neck pain,313 cervicogenic headache,314 and prophylaxis of migraine.315 Systematic reviews and a meta- analyses found manual therapy beneficial for knee OA311,316 as well as OA of the hip, patellofemoral syndrome, ankle inversion sprain, plantar fasciitis317 and common shoulder disorders.318 A systema tic review also found evidence that MT is effective when combined with exercise and/or multimodal therapy for lateral epicondylitis, carpal tunnel syndrome and temporomandibular disorders .319 A systematic review found for adults with 'whiplash -associated disorders' and 'neck pain associated disorders', nonpharmacologic therapies including manual therapy are cost- effective.320 For improving low back and shoulder pain, MT may be more cost- effective than usual care that included exercise, stabilization and/or advice about activity.321 Manipulation therapy safety Adverse events associated with spinal manipulation include muscle soreness or transient increases in pain.141 Rare serious adverse events include cervical artery dissection, stroke and neck injury.322 The most recent review of systematic reviews confirms that though rare, there is some risk of significant adverse events.323 Mind body directed therapies for chronic pain Mindfulness, meditation and relaxation therapies chronic pain Mindfulness and meditation -based therapies focus training on moment to moment awareness of breathing and attention without judgment to transform perception and relationships to pain and the larger environment. Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) is a training that has had considerable study for chronic pain. A systematic review and meta-analysis found MBSR for low back pain was associated with short-term improvements in pain intensity and physical functioning compared to Appendices - Page A- 158usual care.324 In a trial for patients with chronic low back pain, comparing MBSR to CBT or usual care found both MBSR and CBT to be cost- effective and MBSR to be cost -saving.212 CBT is recognized as a moderately effective approach to chronic pain, for example, low back pain;141 however, we do not include an in-depth review of CBT as it is currently part of covered conventional care options, albeit underutilized. Based on their systematic review, the American College of Physicians (ACP) Clinical Practice Guideline recomme nd CBT and MSBR for chronic low back pain.141,222 Mindfulness and relaxation-based eHealth interventions have evidence of positive effects on health outcomes for patients with chronic pain including headache, fibromyalgia, and irritable bowel syndrome.280 Internet -delivered pain -coping skills training (PCST) with physiotherapist- prescribed home exercise for persons with chronic knee pain provided clinically meaningful improvements in pain and function that are sustained for at least 6 months.325 PCST is an approach based on CBT principles that target psychological factors such as low self- efficacy, poor pain coping, and pain catastrophizing, common in persons with chronic pain. PCST has been shown to be effective for osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis pain,326 and specifically knee OA.327 MBSR has also shown benefit in adolescent pain328,329 and adult patients with chronic headache.330,331 A review of patients with arthritis, chronic back or neck pain, or two or more comorbid pain conditions experienced the largest average improvement from a mindfulness program in pain severity and functional limitations.332 Greater home meditation practice was significantly associated with greater improvements in psychological distress and self -rated general health. Benefit for pain and high continued compliance have been consistently associated with MBSR from its earliest study. 333 Relaxation therapies use physiologic techniques (e.g., slow diaphragmatic breathing, progressive muscle relaxation) that regulate the sympathetic/parasympathetic balance to reduce symptoms of sympathetic arousal often seen in chronic pain including situational stress, muscle tensi on and shallow breathing. They also include other directed therapies like guided imagery (use of words depicting calming images and music to evoke positive imaginative scenarios), hypnosis and suggestion (induction of a relaxed but focused state of consciousness receptive to positive suggestion), acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) (strategies of mindful awareness and acceptance) and music therapy. In a large meta-analysis, music therapy showed a reduction of chronic pain, emotional distress due to pain, and a small but statistically significant reduction in opioid and non-opioid intake. 259 Based on their systematic review, the ACP Clinical Practice Guideline recommends progressive relaxation for chronic low back pain.141,222 The NIH also recommends relaxation, 'autonomic regulatory' approaches for fibromyalgia.307 In a meta- analysis of trials, acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) and mindfulness - based interventions were shown to be comparable to cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in managing chronic pain.334 ACT was comparable to CBT but with higher patient satisfaction in Appendices - Page A- 159one trial on chronic pain;335 older adults with chronic pain were more likely to respond to ACT in another RCT.336 Systematic reviews of guided imagery were found enco uraging but inconclusive for musculoskeletal and non-musculoskeletal pain.337,338 A more recent systematic review of guided imagery in fibromyalgia, arthritis and rheumatologic disorders found statistically significant improvement in pain and function, with several trials demonstrating reduction in medication use.339 Mindfulness, meditation and relaxation therapy safety The body of research evidence has shown mindfulness-based practices, hypnosis, suggestive therapies, guided imagery, CBT, ACT and progressive relaxation techniques are utilized across diverse patient populations. These approaches are safe, with rare adverse reactions in psychiatric patients, people with epilepsy or those who have suffered abuse or trauma where relaxation may trigger a rare paradoxical reaction.141,324,339,340 Biofeedback chronic pain Biofeedback utilizes techniques in which a signal generated by a device trains the patient to manipulate an aspect of their physiology not typically directed (e.g. heart rate variability, muscle tension) and provides a self- care tool for physiologic modulation. A meta -analysis of biofeedback for chronic low back pain (cLBP) found pain reduction, reduced depression, disability, and muscle tension, and improved coping.341 Based on another systematic review, the (ACP) Clinical Practice Guideline recommends electromyography biofeedback for cLBP.141,222 A meta -analy sis of trials also found biofeedback effective for tension headache with stable benefit over an average follow-up phase of 15 months. Biofeedback with relaxation therapy was most effective for children and adolescents with headache.342 A meta -analysis of biofeedback for fibromyalgia found significant reduction of pain,343 with less effect established in another systematic review due to variability of measures across trials.344 Biofeedback safety In a systematic review of trials for fatigue and cognition, neurofeedback (EEG biofeedback) and biofeedback were shown to be well- tolerated without major adverse effects.345 Biofeedback has low risk of harms with rare side effects of headache, fatigue or sleep problems. 343 No adverse events are reported in a meta-analysis of biofeedback for chronic back pain.341 Appendices - Page A- 160Movement therapies for chronic pain Yoga chronic pain Therapeutic yoga is the use of yoga to help people with health problems manage their health conditions and reduce their symptoms. Yoga originated in ancient India and has been adapted in the West. Yoga practice combines attention and meditation (dhyana), breathing (pranayama), and physical postures (asanas). A Cochrane review of yoga for chronic nonspecific back pain found moderate supporting evidence of yoga compared to non -exercise controls resulted in small to moderate improvements in back -related function at three and six months and was comparable to exercise for chronic low back pain (cLBP). 346 Early intervention of 'medical yoga', group sessions of guided Kundalini yoga individualized to each medically screened patient with low back pain, was found to be cost- effective.211,347 Based on their systematic review, the American College of Physicians (ACP) Clinical Practice Guideline recommends yoga for cLBP.141,222 AHRQ found yoga effective for cLBP pain compared to placebo, sham, no treatment, usual care, or wait list.145 NIH recommends yoga (hatha, Iyengar and viniyoga) for cLBP.307 In a systematic review and summary of reviews,348,349 yoga was found to have beneficial effects in patients with pain. In addition to low back pain, systematic reviews with meta- analysis found yoga beneficial for osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, kyphosis and fibromyalgia;350 Additional systematic reviews found yoga to have positive effects on pain and function in patients with knee OA351 and neck pain.352 A meta -analysis found yoga, even as a short- term intervention, could be effective for pain and associated disability.353 A large systematic review (306 trials) identified 52 different yoga styles and techniques with the most common being hatha, Iyengar, Pranayama and integrated approaches to yoga therapy. There was no advantage to a particular style of yoga. The reviewers recommended the choice of yoga style be based on personal preference and availability. 354 In a systematic review with meta -analysis on efficacy and safety of meditative mov ement therapies (Qi gong, Tai chi and yoga) for fibromyalgia syndrome, yoga yielded significant effects on pain, fatigue, sleep, depression and health- related quality of life at final treatment, while Tai chi showed benefit for sleep.355 In an access -to-care innovation for veterans, a clinical yoga program via telehealth real -time interactive video conferencing, provided comparable satisfaction and health improvements to in-person yoga, including benefit for pain. 356 Yoga therapy safety Reported harms ass ociated with yoga for cLBP were mild to moderate,141,357 self-limiting joint and back pain comparable to physical therapy (PT).358 A systematic review and meta - analysis of RCTs found yoga to be as safe as usual care and exercise.359 No association between yoga practice and joint problems was found in a large survey of women aged 62-67.360 A review Appendices - Page A- 161of published adverse event cases associated with yoga recommends patients with medical preconditions such as glaucoma or compromised bone health work with physician and a qualified yoga teacher to adapt postures.361 Tai chi chronic pain Tai chi is a low -impact, mind -body exercise originating in China that has become increasingly popular in the West as an effective exercise for rehabilitation related to multiple medical conditions. Tai chi consists of slow prescribed movements with attention to breathing and meditative concentration. In systematic reviews with meta -analysis, Tai chi was effective for chronic pain associated with OA. 362,363 An evidence map of 107 systematic reviews on health outcomes confirmed its potential benefit for chronic pain syndromes and OA.364 Based on their systematic review, the American College of Physicians (ACP) Clinical Practice Guideline recommends Tai chi for chronic low back pain (cLBP).141,222 The US Department of Health and Human Services AHRQ found Tai chi effective for cLBP compared to placebo, sham, no treatment, usual care, or wait list controls.145 The NIH also recommends Tai chi for knee OA and fibromyalgia.307 In a RCT of 12 weeks of Tai chi with heart failure patients, decreased pain was among the physical benefits reported. 365 Tai chi safety In a review of 153 trials, adverse events related to Tai chi were not regularly monitored or reported. When reported, Tai chi did not result in any serious adverse events but was associated with minor musculoskeletal aches and pains not unlike other forms of therapeutic movment.366 Other movement therapies chronic pain: Alexander technique, Pilates, and Feldenkrais Alexander technique (AT), Pilates, and Feldenkrais are therapies developed by Frederick Alexander, Joseph Pilates and Moshe Feldenkrais, respectively. They share features of touch, directed exercise, strengthening, and awareness of posture and muscle utilization in the treatment of pain and postural problems. While there are fewer studies and reviews of these therapies, there is evidence of benefit for chronic pain. A systematic review supported the effectiveness of AT lessons in chronic back pain.367 A large three-arm randomized trial compared usual care, usual care plus acupuncture therapy (10 sessions), and usual care plus AT (14 sessions) for chronic neck pain (median duration 6 years). The acupuncture and AT groups both led to significant reductions in pain and associated disability compared with usual care, with benefit persisting at 12 months following the intervention period. 368 Appendices - Page A- 162In systematic reviews of Pilates for chronic nonspecific low back pain, significant improvement in pain relief and functional enhancement was demonstrated.369 Pilates exercise offered greater improvements in pain and functional ability compared to usual care and physical activity in the short term and improvements equivalent to massage therapy and other form s of exercise for chronic low back pain (cLBP) in the short or long term.370 A trial of post- menopausal women with cLBP compared 6 weeks of Pilates plus physiotherapy to physiotherapy alone found improvement in pain management and functional status with benefits persisting after one year. 371 Feldenkrais has demonstrated benefit in chronic pain trials for neck and scapular pain in people who are visually impaired.372 Alexander technique, Pilates, and Feldenkrais safety Adverse events related to movement t herapies are low with minor events of transient pain and muscle soreness.368,373- 375 Frequency, dosage and timing of nonpharmacologic interventions for chronic pain A recommended course of acupuncture treatment for chronic pain will depend on the patient and the term and severity of the condition. In a large meta-analysis of RCTs of acupuncture for chronic pain of the head, neck, shoulder, low back, and knee where ben efit persisted significantly (12 months) following a course of treatment, patients received on average 8-15 treatments over 10-12 weeks.208 In the Cochrane reviews recommending acupuncture for tension headache297 and migraine,298 a minimum of 6 sessions wa s required for review. Weekly treatment was common; no trials gave acupuncture more than twice per week.376 In a large meta- analysis that identified characteristics of acupuncture treatment associated with outcome, where average session time was recorded in a trial, the length of session averaged 16-45 minutes.376 Average needle insertion sites were 6 -20. Increased number of needle sites treated and more sessions were associated with better outcomes.376 Therefore, referral for acupuncture therapy is recommended for at least 8 sessions, and preferably 8-15 weekly sessions of care. For a severe or acute ambulatory pain event, initial treatment frequency may be more than once per week. Acupuncture therapy delivered in a group setting is being studied as an option for underserved populations,377 in line with research on group medical visits.378 Costs are reduced for patients and session times approximate individual practitioner-patient encounters. Patients' arrivals are staggered with care overlapping in a shared treatment space. In a systematic review and meta- analysis of massage therapy for pain, treatment dosage ranged from a single session of 1.5 minutes to daily 40-60 minute sessions for 20 weeks. 308 In Appendices - Page A- 163chronic ambulatory pain conditions, massage is usually given once per week, more frequently for a severe or acute ambulatory event. Sessions are typically 45 -60 minutes, longer if elected. Number of sessions recommended is not established in the literature. Chiropractic and osteopathic spinal mani pulation reviews include single sessions trials, trials of 4 -7 session over 2 weeks to 5 months up to 12 sessions or more a month with or without subsequent maintenance.145 Once a week sessions for 4 -6 weeks was slightly superior to back school or physical therapy for chronic low back pain.379 The most studied mindfulness intervention is MBSR, which is structured as 8 weekly group sessions.222,324,380 Movement therapies like Tai chi and yoga are typically given in group session, and have been studied in a term of intervention from 1-5 sessions per week for 6 weeks to a year for Tai chi362,366 and as 12 weekly sessions of 75 minutes for yoga.358 Lifestyle behaviors, self- efficacy chronic pain Self-efficacy is a psychological construct based on Social Cognitive Theory, which describes the interaction between behavioral, personal, and environmental factors in health and chronic disease. The theory proposes that patients' confidence in their abili ty to perform specific health behaviors influences their engagement in and actual performance of those behaviors, which in turn influences health outcomes .365 The evidence for the impact of healthy lifestyle choices \u2014what we eat, drink, think, feel and do\u2014on our health outcomes has become a major focus of current research. We are all born with a genome, a set of genes we inherit from our parents. Epigenetic changes happen when genes within our genome are turned on and off by environmental factors before and after conception. Epigenetic changes have been shown to be passed from generation to generation. Altered gene expression rather than genetic code accounts for the majority of risks to health outcomes. The NIH cites the following environmental factors as ca uses of epigenetic changes: exercise, diet, nicotine, alcohol, chemical exposures, medications and stress. 381 Though pain specific studies are scarce,382 there are many studies that document the relationship of healthy behaviors to improved overall health and a reduction of disease, such as diabetes, atherosclerosis, and obesity,383 that are associated with pain conditions.384,385 The relationships are complex, multifactorial and have reciprocal influence on each other. For example, obesity is associated with inflammation386 and musculoskeletal disorders involving connective tissue structures, including bones, joints and soft tissue s of the musculoskeletal system.387,388 At the same time, persistent or severe pain impedes weight loss in patients enrolled in weight management programs compared to none- to-moderate pain. 389 Poor blood sugar control in type II diabetes leads to delayed h ealing, neuropathic pain and vascular complications all of which increase the difficulties that patients have with exercise that can benefit diabetic control. Optimal lifestyle choices can improve health and pain and are tantamount to healthy outcomes. Appendices - Page A- 164Studies have shown that healthy life choices, such as dietary changes, self -engaged stress management, smoking cessation, exercise, and supportive relationships with others can impact depression, hypertension, heart disease, cholesterol, obesity, diabetes and prediabetes, and cancer.390,391 Success with healthy lifestyle choices improves patient self -efficacy and is also found to improve the length of leukocyte telomeres,392 associated with healthy aging and longevity.393,394 A large scale mu ltiyear study, The European Prospective Investigation Into Cancer and Nutrition -Potsdam Study (EPIC), studied 23,000 people for 7.8 years to evaluate the impact of four lifestyle factors on health \u2014never smoking, a BMI under 30, physical activity for at least 3.5 hours a week, and eating a healthy diet that includes vegetables, fruit, whole grain bread and low meat consumption.395 Subjects with all four factors at baseline had reduced their risk of diabetes by 93%, myocardial infarction by 81%, strokes by 50%, and cancer by 36%, and had a 78% lower overall risk of developing a chronic disease. All of these diseases impact pain and healing. Lifestyle behaviors can affect biology as well as self -efficacy and therefore can be viewed as a key factor impacting pai n. Nutrition and pain Nutrition science is not new and though it has long been recognized that nutritional status can either promote or reduce body -wide inflammation396,397 and can promote healing or inhibit it, most medical encounters for pain do not address diet in a meaningful way. As there is a growing awareness of the impact of nutritional status on overall health, there are more studies of nutrition and pain.398-400 An anti- inflammatory diet is one that is high in non -starchy vegetables, fruits, leg umes, nuts and seeds, healthy oils and whole grains with low levels of animal protein consumption. This type of diet balances tissue pH levels for optimal mitochondrial enzyme functioning and has been shown to have health benefits.401 Mitochondrial dysfunction in turn is being recognized as a root cause of many illnesses including pain related conditions.402-404 Dietary antioxidants are essential for optimal mitochondrial health405 and the basic science literature has thousands of articles on 'targeting antioxidants to mitochondria' within the last 10 years alone.406 Turmeric, its derivative curcumin, and ginger, a related tuber, are extensively studied in both food and supplement form for pain patients. Turmeric is used for a wide variety of painful and inflammatory conditions including peri- operative pain407 with opioid and NSAID musculoskeletal pain;411 and inflammatory bowel disease.412,413 Ginger is studied for its effect on nausea414,415 but also for pain,416-418 including joint pain419 and primary dysmenorrhea.420 Though ginger and turmeric combine the actions of plant-based antioxidants and COX inhibition they are very well tolerated. Whereas pharmaceutical nonsteroidal anti- inflammatories (NSAIDs) cause very significant morbidity 421,422 and mortality,67 ginger and turmeric do not show the same side effects profile.408,418,423 This is likely, at least in part, because NSAIDs have been shown to inhibit the initial step in healing which is an inflammatory one.424 A recent systematic review of curcuminoids for musculoskeletal pain found that in the studies Appendices - Page A- 165comparing curcuminoids to nonspecific NSAIDs, the evidence was moderate to high for non- inferiority of the curcuminoid intervention.411 Curcuminoids were equal to NSAIDs in terms of pain improvement without the long- term risks related to morbidity and mortality of NSAIDs, situating curcuminoids as a viable oral pain medication option Micronutrient deficiency is prevalent in the US,425 associated with the extensive consumption of highly processed foods. Although consumption of meals from fast food restaurants is decreasing, there has been a compensatory increase in retail purchase of highly processed foods.426 Symptoms associated with deficiencies, especially when sub -clinical, are nonspecific and include fatigue, irritability, aches and pains, decreased immune function and heart palpitations. 425 Supplementation of deficient nutrients helps overall health and is being studied for its effects on pain. The following is by no means a comprehensive listing, but touches on some of the most prevalent deficiencies. Vitamin D is one of the best studied micronutrient deficiencies associated with pain and delayed healing. Skin pigmentation, obesity, northern latitudes and other yet unidentified factors lead to Vitamin D deficiencies. Deficiency of Vitamin D is often found in chronic pain sufferers, and is correlated with muscle fatigue risk factors.427 While no definitive mechanism for how Vitamin D influences chronic pain development is known, supplementation of Vitamin D may benefit chronic pain. 428 It poses a low health risk, is well accepted, inexpensive and offers numerous health benefits.429 A rapi d dose of Vitamin D 3 attenuates inflammation, epidermal structure damage and redness from acute sunburn.430 Magnesium is also seen as a common micronutrient deficiency, which is being studied for its relationship to muscle spasm, systemic inflammation, ins ulin resistance and diabetes, hypertension, and neuropathic pain. There have been positive trials using magnesium infusions for migraine and many emergency rooms employ this intervention. 431,432 Magnesium has also been studied as an NMDA (N- methyl-D- aspar tate) receptor blocker in the treatment of neuropathic pain.433,434 A review of the concomitant use of magnesium with opioids in animals suggests that magnesium may potentiate opioid analgesia while also mitigating some of the adverse effects of opioids in cluding the development of hyperalgesia, improving outcomes in neuropathic pain.435 Fish oils high in omega- 3 fatty acids, also called polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), are associated with reduced pro -inflammatory prostaglandins.436 A 2012 meta- analysis concluded that PUFAs at doses over 2.7 gm/day for over 3 months reduced NSAID consumption in rheumatoid arthritis patients.437 The north American diet is high in omega- 6 fatty acids which are proinflammatory. Vitamin B12 (cobalamin) deficiency has long be en recognized as a cause of neurological disorders including pain. At present, we are only able to measure serum B12 which may or may not reflect B12 levels in the tissues where it is active. There are over 20 recognized genetic abnormalities affecting the cobalamin transport proteins required for intracellular delivery of B12 to tissue targets including mitochondria. Some are severe leading to early failure to thrive Appendices - Page A- 166In the year 2000, the number of deaths related to poor diet and ph ysical inactivity were 15 -16 % of total deaths in the United States, while continuing to increase.'446 and death and others are states where B12 is insufficient for cellular funct ion despite normal serum levels.438 Other lifestyle factors Many medications have an adverse effect on micronutrient levels and the health of the microbiome, the mass of microorganisms mainly housed in the gut. Elie Metchnikoff, Nobel Laureate in 1908 for the discovery of cellular immunity, also identified the micr obiome as a major determinant of health. Its role in protecting optimal intestinal permeability, modulation of body-wide inflammation, nutrient absorption, and abdominal pain in inflammatory bowel diseases is being widely studied.197 Poor nutrition and man y drugs can adversely affect the microbiome. Proton pump inhibitors deserve special mention in this regard since they are widely used for prolonged periods and their devastating effects on nutritional status has long been unrecognized. The FDA has issued warnings of profound deficiencies in magnesium and calcium, B12 and protein absorption. PPIs also adversely disrupt the microbiome and increase the risk of pathologic dysbiosis and enteric infection such as food poisoning and clostridium difficile. 439 Long term use of PPI medication increases risk of death.440 Important behavioral factors such as physical activity level, sleep and stress management can have direct and indirect impact on the experience of pain. Physical activity can be practitioner or instructor directed as in physical therapy, acupuncture therapy, chiropractic, osteopathy, yoga, tai chi, or other movement systems. Additionally, daily physical activity can be and often is self- directed. Physical activity has been shown to increase strength, balance and coordination, reduce pain and improve motor function and mood for patients with hip and knee OA. 441-443 Sleep disorders are commonly seen in pain patients. The disorders may follow or precede the onset of pain.444 Sleeplessness has been shown experimentally to induce a generalized state of hyperalgesia, a 'fibromyalgia -like syndrome'.445 Both pain and pain medications can cause sleep disorders. Sleep apnea is a risk factor for many conditions such as diabetes and hypertension and can be aggravated by medications that are often prescribed for pain patients. Improved sleep leads to improved resilience for pain. Stress has long been reported by patients to be an aggravator of pain. Appendices - Page A- 167Economic benefits of nonpharmacologic therapies in the treatment of pain Full economic evaluations, reported as cost- effectiveness analyses (CEA), cost -utility analyses (CUA), and cost -benefit analyses (CBA), often compare costs and health effects between two or more therapies.447 Low back pain, knee OA and headache are among t he most common and costly chronic pain conditions responsible for a significant economic burden on the healthcare system. There have been extensive economic evaluations of acupuncture therapies for pain conditions. Acupuncture has been shown to be cost- effective in the treatment of chronic, persistent low back pain.28,207,211,448 -450 A cost -effectiveness analysis of nonpharmacologic treatments for knee OA found acupuncture to be one of the more clinically and cost- effective therapies at the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) QALY (quality adjusted life years) thresholds294 when done alone or together with exercise- based PT.451 In a large trial, acupuncture was not only effective in the treatment of neck pain but benefits lasted beyond the three -month study duration, per international cost-effectiveness threshold values, showing acupuncture to be a cost- effective treatment strategy.292 And while using acupuncture (12 treatments over three months) for migraine and chronic headache incre ased cost to the UK NHS health service, there was improved health -related quality of life over the year that patients were followed that was favorably cost -effective compared to other NHS provided therapies.452 Similarly, the longevity of benefit for acupuncture in chronic pain was evaluated in a meta -analysis of 20 trials and over 6000 patients and showed that clinical benefits of acupuncture were sustained at 12 months after a single course of treatment. Improvements in pain were 90% sustained at 12 months in trials compared to usual care and 50% sustained in trials that compared to sham,286 with implications for reduction in health care utilization over that period. An update to that meta -analysis of 7 additional years of trials (39 trials, 20,827 patients) confirmed previous findings.288 The effects of acupuncture were found to persist over time with only a small decrease, approximately 15%, in treatment effect at one year after randomization or 9 -10 months after the completion of treatment. A novel finding was additional confirmation of benefit for acupuncture over sham on upper body musculoskeletal pain, neck and shoulder pain. A curious and compelling finding in a large trial performing a 1 to 1 'propensity score match' (a statistical matching technique that attempts to estimate the effects of a treatment by accounting for the covariates that predict receiving the treatment) of 58,899 patients who received acupuncture for fibromyalgia to 58,899 who did not have acupuncture found the cumulative incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD) was significantly lower in the acupuncture cohort independent of age, sex, comorbidities or statins used. 453 Systematic reviews have shown manual therapy is a cost -effective treatment for adults with whiplash -associated and neck pain -associated disorders320 and is also more cost- effective for improving low back and shoulder pain than general practice care that included exercise, stabilization and or advice.321 Appendices - Page A- 168An inclusive review of effective nonpharmacologic therapies for chronic low back pain (33 studies) found cost-effectiveness for combined physical and psychological treatments, medi cal yoga, information and education programs, acupuncture therapy and spinal manipulation.211 An earlier review of 26 studies found cost- effectiveness for treatments consistent with the ACP guideline of interdisciplinary rehabilitation, exercise, acupunctu re therapy, spinal manipulation and cognitive behavioral therapy for sub- acute and chronic LBP.454 Group acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) was found cost -effective for fibromyalgia when compared to medication in a 6 month RCT.455 There may be a commo n perception that nonpharmacologic therapies are an 'add on' expense, however, an analysis of the scope of economic benefits changes this perception. There is evidence of cost -effectiveness and costs savings through avoided high tech conventional care, lower future healthcare utilization, and reduction of productive loss for employers.447 A study by the State of Washington found that even with a substantial number of people using insurance benefits for nonpharmacologic therapies, the effect on insurance expenditures was modest.118 In a follow-up study of WA state insured patients with back pain, fibromyalgia and menopause symptoms, users of nonpharmacologic therapy providers had lower insurance expenditures than those who did not use them.119 Finally, a cost -analysis of an interdisciplinary pediatric pain clinic found interdisciplinary treatment that included acupuncture, biofeedback, psychotherapy and massage with medication management reduced inpatient and emergency department visits and resulted in hospita l cost savings of $36,228/patient/year and in insurance cost savings of $11,482/patient/year.456 The findings of the current cost analysis supports that over the course of just one year, participation in an outpatient individually- tailored interdisciplinar y pain clinic can significantly reduce costs by more than the cost of the intervention itself. Course of treatment and cost for inpatient acute care Inpatient acute pain care can follow a course of as little as one treatment to several treatments, as in daily treatment over the course of a hospital stay. Inpatient acupuncture sessions can be given at a patient's bedside and sessions can last from 20-45 minutes or longer and is recommended in the 24 hours or less before surgery, after surgery, and daily as requested by inpatients or their caregivers. An integrative medicine approach using yoga therapy, holistic nursing techniques and a 'healing environment' used in inpatient oncology had an immediate term cost benefit from reduced use of antiemetic, anxiolytic and hypnotic medication costs in the amount of $156/day/patient. If extrapolated to the number of patients, beds and days of operation for the unit studied this would result in a savings of nearly one million dollars a year. 457 Appendices - Page A- 169Course of treatment and costs for outpatient chronic pain Projections of costs for a course of treatment of an evidence-based nonpharmacologic therapy will vary depending on the geographic area, health system, and access to care options. First, a course of care recommendation would be based on studies as well as systematic reviews and meta- analyses of effectiveness trials. A recommended course of treatment for chr onic pain will depend on the patient and the term and severity of the condition. In a large meta-analysis of RCTs of acupuncture for chronic pain of the head, neck, shoulder, low back, and knee where benefit persisted significantly (12 months) following a course of treatment, patients received on average 8 -15 treatments over 10- 12 week s. 208 In the Cochrane Reviews recommending acupuncture for tension headache297 and migraine,298 a minimum of 6 sessions was required for inclusions in the review. Weekly treatment was common; no trials gave acupuncture more than twice per week. 376 Based on these studies, referral for acupuncture therapy is recommended for at least 8 sessions, and preferably 8-15 weekly sessions of care. For a severe or acute ambulatory pain event, initial treatment frequency may be more than once per week. Acupuncture therapy cost per session varies from $60-120458 or more, with the initial session longer and higher in cost. A course of ambulatory care of 10 sessions then can range from $700.00 to $1300 or more. Acupuncture therapy delivered in a group setting is being studied as an option for underserved populations,377 in line with research on group medical visits,378 and group- style self - management interventions.459 Costs are reduced, with care overlapping in a shared treatment space. Group sessions can be less than half the cost of an individual session. Chiropractic and osteopathic manipulation sessions are structured as individual care with additional costs of techniques like ultrasound that may be applied by an assistant. Session can be more than once a week to once a week for maintenance. Costs of sessions vary from $35 to $106 460 or more for 30 minutes with averages $65-$70 depending on the region of the country. Charges may increase with a- la-carte fees for interventions in addition to manipulations, such as applicat ions of heat or cold, for example. Massage therapy is generally offered in weekly sessions with costs varying from $60-$90 or more for a 60 -minute session, less for shorter sessions, more for longer sessions. Fees also depend on the site, whether a clinic, gym, spa, hotel or practitioner's office. Movement therapies like Tai chi and yoga are typically given in group sessions, and have been studied in a term of intervention from 1-5 sessions per week for 6 weeks to a year for Tai chi362,366 and as 12 weekly sessions of 75 minutes for yoga.358 Session fees can range from $10 - 20, with prices reduced with purchases of multiple sessions or more if private or semi- private sessions. Similarly, sessions for Pilates, Feldenkrais or Alexander technique are paid as individual sessions or reduced if bought as a package for multiple sessions. Pilates costs anywhere from $15-$55 for 45-minute group mat classes, $35-$85 for group classes using equipment, and private sessions costing upwards of $50-$150 per one-hour session.461 Feldenkrais is offered as private, semi -private or group sessions with costs varying from $50 to $90 for private and $10 to $25 for classes.462 Alexander technique sessions vary in cost Appendices - Page A- 170depending on country or region but are generally on par with massage therapy costs if given in private sessions, less if given in a group setting. MBSR has been shown to be cost- effective and cost -saving for patients with low back pain.212 An 8 -week course of MBSR ranges from $500 to $600 or more depending on the area of the country. In general, the costs of evidence-based nonpharmacologic options are nominal compared to medical costs of treating chronic pain with risk mitigation and greater potential for engaging patients in ongoing self- care. Recommendations Education, treatment and research Many in medicine and policy decision -making acknowledge the crisis in pain and pain care detailed in this paper and seek evidence-based solutions for successful comprehensive pain management. Currently most of the nonpharmacologic strategies reviewed here are underutilized due to lack of evidence dissemination, education and reimbursement. It is time for civilian medicine to join the call to action of military medicine outlined by Schoomaker and Buckenmaier in 'If not now, when? If not you, who?' urging the immediate incorporation of effective nonpharmacologic modalities and active self -care because of their safety, effectiveness and acceptance by patients. 463 The goal in these recommendations and the call to action that follows is to increase awareness, access and utilization of safe, effective nonpharmacologic treatments through education of practitioners and patients; dissemination of and reimbursement for evidence-based treatment options; and to promote ongoing research focused on the therapeutic and economic impact, in the short and long term, of comprehensive care practices. Education The training of physicians and health care providers must include current pain mechanisms and all evidence -based treatment options for pain including effective nonpharmacologic options as stand -alone first line of care and as part of individualized comprehensive pain care. This includes individualized pain care that is patient- centered and evidence -informed 1. Patient -centered care focuses on each person's unique healthcare needs and experiences by asking a. How do you manage pain now and in the past? b. What nonpharmacologic strategies have you used? c. What are you interested in exploring? 2. Practitioners should become familiar with nonpharmacologic modalities and licensed independent practitioners in their system and or area of practice. Appendices - Page A- 171Treatment: nonpharmacologic therapy frequency, dosage and timing While physicians are famil iar with dosage of medications, evidence-informed frequency, 'dosage' and timing of nonpharmacologic therapies is less well disseminated. Inpatient care is recommended to be daily care or every other day when staggered with another available nonpharmacologic intervention. In acute extreme pain that is not well managed, a second same or different treatment may be needed in a single day. Evidence-based nonpharmacologic options for inpatient acute pain care include: 1.Acupuncture therapy, massage therapy, mind /body interventions such as music therapy, transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation (TENS). 2.Daily inpatient access to effective nonpharmacologic care is recommended. Recommendations and referral must take into account a patient's unique presentation and circumstances in terms of access and coverage. Even when not covered by insurance, a course of nonpharmacologic treatment may have a longitude of benefit that exceeds short term benefit of medications that are accompanied by adverse events and addiction li ability. Evidence-informed nonpharmacologic options for chronic pain include : 1.Acupuncture therapy, chiropractic and osteopathic care, massage therapy, physical therapy, mind/body and movement therapies, cognitive behavioral therapy 2.Referral to a course of effective nonpharmacologic care is recommended. Research The call for research includes studies on the timing, dosage, frequency, longitude and combinations of care in the development of a comprehensive pain care model for both the inpatient and outpatient setting. Stakeholders must petition and support evidence-informed policy guidelines to increase access to and coverage for effective nonpharmacologic options as an essential part of comprehensive pain care. Appendices - Page A- 172The Consortium Pain Task Force goals in a call to action are to: increase awareness of effective nonpharmacologic treatments for pain train healthcare practitioners and administrators in the evidence base of effective nonpharmacologic practice advocate for policy initiatives that remedy system and reimbursement barriers to evidence -informed comprehensive pain care and promote ongoing research and dissemination of the role of effective nonpharmacologic treatments in pain, focused on the short and long term therapeutic and economic impact of comprehensive care practices SECTION 3- CALL TO ACTION As detailed in this paper, documented in the literature and accepted by health professionals and researchers, the crisis in pain care and aspects of current pain management strategies are having enormous detrimental impacts on patients, the health system and society.1,2 In response to the grim statistics about pain care and the opioid epidemic, health care professionals, policy makers, researchers and multiple major health organizations and government agencies are moving in the right direction. The IOM,1 NAM,2 NIH,4 the CDC,193 The Joint Commission,194 the military,463 the FDA,195 the ACP 196 and the former US Surgeon General464 concede that past strategies and the use of opioid medications have not remedied but rather exacerbated chronic p ain, abuse, addiction, illness behavior and disability and call for evidence -based, comprehensive pain care, to include nonpharmacologic therapies. While there is consensus that pain care must drastically improve and prioritize evidence- based nonpharmacol ogic treatments, there is a need for an informed strategy that includes all evidence -based and comprehensive pain care. Currently, most of the nonpharmacologic strategies outlined in the preceding review are underutilized due to inadequate dissemination of evidence, professional and public education and inadequate reimbursement. This paper is a bold call to action for policy makers, hospitals and health systems, insurers, primary care providers and other licensed health practitioners and health care educators to lead in effecting this change. Appendices - Page A- 173POLICY: Federal and stat e policy should increase access to and reimbursement for evidence- based nonpharmacologic therapies Based on the literature, stakeholders must petition and support evidence-based policy guidelines to increase access to and coverage for nonpharmacologic options as an essential part of comprehensive pain care. Federal policy : Currently, there is evidence of effectiveness, cost -effectiveness, cost - savings and risk mitigation for evidence-based nonpharmacologic options. Nonpharmacologic therapies for pain are now recommended by the NIH, FDA, TJC, CDC and ACP. Federal reimbursement policy needs to be based on current evidence of effectiveness, cost -effectiveness and risk mitigation and include nonpharmacologic care. State policy : States need to adopt policies of coverage and plans for access to pain care based on current evidence of effectiveness, cost -effecti veness, cost -savings and risk mitigation that includes effective nonpharmacologic therapies. Policy should require private insurers to cover evidence -informed nonpharmacologic therapies for acute and chronic pain. BEST PRACTICES: Identify and develop cli nical models that integrate evidence- based nonpharmacologic therapies for pain Develop, optimize, incentivize and coordinate care across disciplines with non- discriminatory access to evidence -based nonpharmacologic therapies, as stand- alone first line of care and as essential part of comprehensive care. EDUCATION: Deliver evidence- based training to learners and graduates of the health care system in all disciplines on pain and effective nonpharmacologic treatments for pain As recommended by the National Academy of Medicine (NAM), pain -related education for all health professionals who provide care to people with pain must become a national mandate.82 Academic health care education should train students and health practitioners on the evolving understanding of pain and its complexities, including physical and psychiatric comorbidities and substance abuse disorder (SUD) as well as evidence -based frequency, 'dosage' and timing of effective nonpharmacologic therapies. Health care practitioners require educatio n and practical changes in practice models to enable them to be responsible to inform and educate patients on evidence-based comprehensive models of pain care including self- efficacy, patient responsibility, self- care and lifestyle choices. Appendices - Page A- 174RESEARCH: Identify and fund research to evaluate health outcomes and economic impact of comprehensive pain care that includes effective nonpharmacologic therapies The call for research includes studies on the timing, dosage, frequency, longitude of benefit and combinations of care in the development of a comprehensive pain care model for both the inpatient and outpatient setting. NIH, NCCIH, AHRQ, CMS and other agen cies and foundations should seek to fund investigation of comprehensive models of pain care and their impact on health outcomes, potential opioid sparing and reduction of opioid liability overuse and dependency. DISSEMINATION: Stakeholder groups need to engage the media and foster public awareness of comprehensive pain care options that include evidence- based nonpharmacologic therapies Academic organizations, pain societies, medical societies, patient advocacy groups, insurance carriers, and the media hav e important roles in the dissemination and education of their members and the public regarding the benefits of nonpharmacologic options of pain care. Dissemination facilitates general and individual patient-practitioner conversations on options for persona l comprehensive pain care.

Abstract: Despite wide use in clinical practice, acupuncture remains a controversial treatment for chronic pain. Our objective was to update an individual patient data meta-analysis to determine the effect size of acupuncture for 4 chronic pain conditions. We searched MEDLINE and the Cochrane CentralRegistry of Controlled Trials randomized trials published up until December 31, 2015. We includedrandomized trials of acupuncture needling versus either sham acupuncture or no acupuncture controlfor nonspecic musculoskeletal pain, osteoarthritis, chronic headache, or shoulder pain. Trials wereonly included if allocation concealment was unambiguously determined to be adequate. Raw datawere obtained from study authors and entered into an individual patient data meta-analysis. Themain outcome measures were pain and function. An additional 13 trials were identied, with datareceived for a total of 20,827 patients from 39 trials. Acupuncture was superior to sham as well asno acupuncture control for each pain condition (all P<.001) with differences between groups close to .5 SDs compared with no acupuncture control and close to .2 SDs compared with sham. We alsofound clear evidence that the effects of acupuncture persist over time with only a small decrease,approximately 15%, in treatment effect at 1 year. In secondary analyses, we found no obvious as-sociation between trial outcome and characteristics of acupuncture treatment, but effect sizes ofacupuncture were associated with the type of control group, with smaller effects sizes for sham con-trolled trials that used a penetrating needle for sham, and for trials that had high intensity of interventionin the control arm. We conclude that acupuncture is effective for the treatment of chronic pain, withtreatment effects persisting over time. Although factors in addition to the specic effects of nee-dling at correct acupuncture point locations are important contributors to the treatment effect, decreases The Acupuncture Trialists' Collaboration is funded by an R21 (AT004189I and an R01 (AT006794) from the National Center for Complementaryand Alternative Medicine at the National Institutes of Health to Dr.Vickers) and by a grant from the Samueli Institute.

Variations in the effect size of acupuncture in different trials are driven predominantly by differences in treatmentsreceived by the control group rather than by differences in the characteristics of acupuncture treatment. Perspective: Acupuncture is effective for the treatment of chronic musculoskeletal, headache, and osteoarthritis pain. Treatment effects of acupuncture persist over time and cannot be explained solelyin terms of placebo effects. Referral for a course of acupuncture treatment is a reasonable optionfor a patient with chronic pain. \u00a9 2017 by the American Pain Society Key words: Acupuncture, chronic pain, meta-analysis, osteoarthritis, back pain, neck pain, migraine. Acupuncture remains a controversial treatment for chronic pain, largely because of a provenance outside biomedicine. Traditional acupuncture theory invokes nonanatomical structures such as merid-ians and nonphysiological processes such as the flow ofqi energy. Although many contemporary practitioners donot rely on such concepts, there remains a dearth of dataon how insertion of needles at specic points on the bodycould lead to long-term decreases in pain. Acupunctureundoubtedly has short-term physiological effects, severalof which are relevant to pain, 7,76,119but there is as yet no explanation as to how such effects could persist. We previously reported an individual patient data meta- analysis of high-quality trials of acupuncture for chronicpain. 93Differences between acupuncture and control in trials without sham (placebo) control were statistically aswell as clinically signicant. Acupuncture was signi-cantly superior to sham control, suggesting thatacupuncture effects are not solely explicable in terms ofplacebo, although these differences were relativelymodest. We have separately reported secondary analy-ses examining whether characteristics of acupuncturetreatment 66or control groups68influence effect size, and whether the effects of acupuncture treatment persist overtime. 69In this article we update our previous analyses now including studies published during the past 7 years. Methods The full protocol of the meta-analysis92and the results of the rst individual patient data meta-analysis includ-ing randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published up toNovember 2008 93have been published. The literature search was repeated to identify eligible RCTs publishedbetween December 2008 and December 2015. Trials wereconsidered eligible if they accrued patients with non-specic back or neck pain, shoulder pain, chronicheadache, or osteoarthritis; pain duration was at least4 weeks for musculoskeletal disorders; at least 1 groupreceived acupuncture needling and 1 group receivedeither sham acupuncture or no acupuncture control; theprimary end point was measured more than 4 weeks afterthe initial acupuncture treatment; and allocation con-cealment was determined unambiguously to be adequate.Principal investigators of eligible studies were asked toprovide raw data. These raw data were used to repli-cate all analyses published in the original RCT publicationto ensure data accuracy. Each trial was reanalyzed usinganalysis of covariance with the standardized primary endpoint (scores divided by pooled SD) as the dependent vari-able, and the baseline measure of the primary end pointand variables used to stratify randomization as covariates.The primary outcome for each study was that identi-ed by the responding author of each study. The effectsizes for each study were then entered into a meta-analysis using the metan command in Stata (version 13,StataCorp, College Station, TX). Fixed effects as well asrandom effects estimates were calculated. Fixed effectsweights were calculated using inverse-variance weight-ing, and random effects weights were calculated usingthe DerSimonian and Laird method. We prespecied thatmeta-analyses would be conducted separately for com-parisons of acupuncture versus sham and acupunctureversus no acupuncture control, and within each pain type,and the hypothesis test would be on the basis of the xedeffects analysis. In the original article, trials for which in-dividual patient data were not available were includedas a sensitivity analysis; in this update, we include summarydata for such trials in the main meta-analysis and excludethem as a sensitivity analysis. As secondary analyses, we examined whether charac- teristics of acupuncture treatment modied treatmenteffects. Trial-level as well as patient-level analyses wereperformed. For trial-level analyses, we used random effectsmeta-regression to test the effect of each characteristicon the main effect estimate using the Stata commandmetareg. For patient-level analyses, we created a linearregression as for the main analysis of effect size, but in-cluded the characteristic and an interaction term betweenthe characteristic and treatment allocation. The coef-cient was then entered into a meta-analysis. In bothanalyses, random effects estimates and 95% con-dence intervals were reported; Pvalues were on the basis of the xed effects analysis. We also analyzed the effectof acupuncture relative to different types of sham acu-puncture and different types of no acupuncture controlgroup. Three comparisons of sham acupuncture were in-vestigated: penetrating needle versus nonpenetratingneedle as well as non-needle sham; nonpenetratingneedle versus non-needle sham; and the use points versus nonacupuncture points amongtrials using nonpenetrating or non-needle sham. For shamarms using penetrating needles, there was also a com-parison done between the use of deep needle penetrationand shallow needle penetration. We entered the effectsize and standard error for each trial into a meta-regression along with the type of sham acupuncture usedin that trial. For this analysis, smaller effect sizes indi-456 The Journal of Pain Acupuncture for Chronic Pain Appendices - Page A- 204cate a smaller difference in effect between verum acupuncture and sham acupuncture, implying that thetype of sham acupuncture used is more active and there-fore more similar to verum acupuncture. For the analysisof acupuncture effect relative to the no acupuncturecontrol group, we used meta-regression to compare theeffects of trials using no acupuncture control groups char-acterized as high intensity, usual care, or low intensity.We also repeated our previous analyses exploring pos-sible effects of publication bias and exploring differencesbetween sham acupuncture and no treatment. Results Systematic Review Our systematic review93was updated to include trials published after November 2008 and before December 31,2015. We identied 75 additional RCTs, of which 13 wereeligible (Fig 1). These 13 studies include 4 trials 19,56,75,85 included as summary data only in a sensitivity analysisin our rst report. Data Extraction and Quality Assessment Individual patient data for 2,905 patients were re- ceived from 10 of these 13 studies and included patientsfrom the United States, Australia, China, Germany, andthe United Kingdom. For 1 of the 3 studies for which wedid not receive data, the statisticians involved in the RCTfailed to respond to repeated inquiries despite ap-proval for data sharing being obtained from the principalinvestigator. For the other 2 studies, the trial authors werecontacted and invited to participate but we received nofurther response. These 3 studies were included in theanalysis as summary data only using the published esti-mates of effect size. 31,70,75Two trials from the original systematic review for which data were not received werealso included as summary data in these analyses. 23,74 A total of 20,827 patients were included in the total 39 trials (Table 1). The trials comprised 25 comparisonswith 16,041 patients of acupuncture and no acupunc-ture control, and 26 comparisons with 7,237 patients of acupuncture and sham acupuncture control. Of the trials on musculoskeletal pain, most had an eligibility crite-rion of a minimum 3 or 6 months' pain duration. Amongthose for which individual patient data on chronicity wereavailable, the median duration was 4 years (quartiles: 1.1years, 10 years). There were 2 trials for which the timeperiod between rst symptom and evaluation of outcomecould theoretically have been <3 months on the basis of eligibility criteria and timing of assessment. For Irnich et al,the duration of disease was \"4 to 52 weeks\" for 19% ofpatients and >1 year for the remainder. 41In the case of Kleinhenz et al, no data were provided on chronicity,however, the indication was rotator cuff tendinitis, whichis rarely treated in the acute phase. 52We conclude that all but a trivial proportion of patients included in the Figure 1.

None of the 10 new trials included in thisanalysis had dropout rates of >25%. Meta-Analysis Forest plots for acupuncture against sham acupunc- ture and against no acupuncture control are shownseparately for each of the 4 pain conditions in Fig 2 and Fig 3. Fixed effects weights are reported in Figs 2 and 3; forest plots with random effects weights reported are pre- sented in Supplementary Figs 1 and 2 . Meta-analytic statistics are shown in Table 2. Consistent with the results of the originally published meta-analysis, acupuncture is found to be statistically superior to control for all analy- ses (P<.001). Effect sizes in the updated analyses are similar to those in the original analyses, with effect sizes chang-ing by .02 for most comparisons. Effect sizes are close to .5 compared with no acupuncture control and .2 com-pared with sham. To illustrate these effect sizes in moreclinically applicable terms, if baseline pain score in a typicalRCT was 60 on a scale of 0 to 100, with an SD of 25, follow-up scores might be 43 in a no acupuncture control group,35 in a sham acupuncture group, and 30 among true acu-puncture patients. If response was dened as a painreduction of 50% or more, response rates would be ap-proximately 30%, 42.5%, and 50%, respectively. Also inkeeping with the original analyses, signicant hetero-geneity was found in 5 of 7 comparisons. Signicantheterogeneity remained for sham-controlled musculo-skeletal pain and osteoarthritis (P =.001 and P<.001, respectively) even after excluding the outlying Vas et altrials. 89-91There was also signicant heterogeneity for all indications in the comparison of acupuncture with no acu-puncture control. Heterogeneity is further explored (seethe section on \"Modiers of Trial Outcome\"). Sensitivity Analyses Prespecied sensitivity analyses are also shown in Table 2. The exclusion of the RCTs by Vas et al89-91repeats our previous nding that the effect sizes for compari-son with sham are similar for musculoskeletal pain,osteoarthritis, and chronic headache. However, there arenow sufcient trials for a meta-analysis of shoulder paintrials without inclusion of Vas et al 90and the effect size for this indication is clearly much greater. There is alsoa large effect size for sham controlled neck pain trialswhen these are analyzed separately from back pain. Mostother sensitivity analyses had little effect on the main nd-ings. Analyses incorporating assessment of patientblinding, missing data, or trials without individual patientdata, all had results very similar to the primary analysis.Because the primary outcome included in the analysis wasthe outcome specied by the trial authors, we also per-formed a sensitivity analysis restricted to a single end point(pain intensity) at a xed follow-up time (2-3 months afterrandomization). Results were again very similar apart fromsham-controlled trials of musculoskeletal pain (Table 3),inwhich effect size decreased from .30 to .13, but this appears to be attributable to there being only 5 of 11 trials that measured pain intensity at 2 to 3 months, andthe trials excluded happened to be those with the largereffect sizes. We combined all trials into 1 meta-analysis for all in- dications to assess the possible effect of publication bias.As in the original analyses, we found some evidence thatsmaller studies had larger effect sizes for the sham com-parison (P =.024), but not for the no acupuncture comparisons (P =.75). No signicant asymmetry was seen after excluding the Vas trials 89-91and shoulder pain trials35,52,75,90from the sham comparison (n =21,P=.13), and also when excluding any trials with fewer than 100patients (n =21,P=.069). We found that the difference between acupuncture and control would become non-signicant only if there were 51 and >100 unpublished trials with 100 patients and effect sizes in favor of controlof .25 SD for sham and no acupuncture control, respectively. We also repeated our exploratory analysis comparing sham control with no acupuncture control. In a meta-analysis of 12 RCTs that had sham as well as noacupuncture control arms, the effect sizes for sham were.39 (95% condence interval [CI] =.33-.45) and .45 (95% CI=.29-.61) for xed and random effects, respectively (P<.0001 for tests of effect as well as heterogeneity). Modiers of Trial Outcome In addition to updating the primary analyses, we also updated previously published analyses on how charac-teristics of the acupuncture and control interventionsinfluence trial outcomes. Trial-level and patient-level char-acteristics are shown in Tables 4 and 5, respectively. Acupuncture Characteristics Analysis We updated previously reported analyses examining whether characteristics of acupuncture treatment modi-ed the effect of acupuncture relative to control. Theseanalyses include trial-level analysis, on the basis of char-acteristics described in the study protocol, as well aspatient-level analyses, on the basis of data related to theindividual patient. The results are shown in Table 6.W e didnot nd any obvious association between trial outcome and characteristics such as the style of acupunc- ture (traditional or Western), use of xed versus individualized point selection, or the use of electricalstimulation. The only clear nding was a dose-responseeffect to number of acupuncture treatments in trials witha no acupuncture control group (increase in effect sizeof .10 per 5 sessions, 95% CI =.01 to .21, P=.001).Vickers et al The Journal of Pain 459 Appendices - Page A- 207Figure 2. Forest plots for the comparison of acupuncture with no acupuncture control. There were fewer than 3 trials for shoul- der pain, so no meta-analyses were performed. Weights reported are xed effects weights calculated using inverse variance weighting.460 The Journal of Pain Acupuncture for Chronic Pain Appendices - Page A- 208Sham Acupuncture Control Analysis We also updated a previously published analysis in- vestigating the effects of acupuncture relative to different types of sham acupuncture and no acupuncture controlgroups. Differences in effect between acupuncture andthe different sham acupuncture groups are shown inTable 7. The largest difference in effect between acu-puncture and sham acupuncture was seen in trials using nonpenetrating needles, whereas the smallest differ - ence was seen in trials using needle penetration. Signicant differences were found between trials usingpenetrating needle sham and trials that usednonpenetrating or non-needle sham (difference in SD = .30, 95% CI =.60 to .00,P=.047), although this result was sensitive to the exclusion of the outlying Vas trials 89-91 (difference in SD =.07, 95% CI =. 2 4t o. 1 0 ,P =.4, Table 8), 2 of which used nonpenetrating controls. No Acupuncture Control Analysis In addition to updating the analysis comparing types of sham acupuncture control, we also updated the analy-sis comparing types of no acupuncture control. Weupdated the categorization of no acupuncture controlgroups, and categorized trials as having a high-intensity,usual care, or low-intensity control group. In a \"high-intensity\" control group, patients received a speciedcourse of protocol-guided treatment. For instance, theUnited Kingdom Acupuncture, Physiotherapy and Exer-cise (APEX) trial by Foster et al 33is considered a high- intensity control because patients were randomized toreceive a course of individualized, supervised physicaltherapy plus acupuncture versus physical therapy alone.In a trial with \"usual care\" control, patients are able toaccess whatever care they might reasonably receiveoutside of the study. As an example, in the UnitedKingdom National Health Service (NHS) study, patientswere randomized to \"use\" versus \"avoid\" acupunctureand could receive whatever other treatments were offeredto them. 95A control group was dened as \"low-intensity\" if patients were not allowed to receive certain treat-ments that might otherwise be available. For instance,the Acupuncture Randomized Trials for low back pain andosteoarthritis limited treatment of pain in the controlgroup to oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs(NSAIDs), excluding other types of treatment, such as Figure 3. Forest plots for the comparison of true and sham acupuncture. Weights reported are xed effects weights calculated using inverse variance weighting.Vickers et al The Journal of Pain 461 Appendices - Page A- 209Table 2.

Signicant differences were found between acupuncture and control for all types ofno acupuncture control group. Notably, however , in trials that had high-intensity control groups, acupuncture hadsmaller effect sizes compared with those with low-intensity controls groups (difference =.81, 95% CI =1.26 to.36,P=.0004); similarly, in trials with usual care control acupuncture had smaller effect sizes than trials with alow-intensity control group (difference in SD =.65, 95% CI=.98 to .31, P=.0002, Table 8). Time Course of Acupuncture Effects Analysis We updated a previously published analysis assessing change in the effects of acupuncture over time relativeto sham acupuncture and no acupuncture control.69 Number of weeks of acupuncture treatment and the time points used in this analysis are reported in Table 9.A total of 14 trials and 4,124 patients were included in the analysis of acupuncture versus no acupuncture control. The xed effects estimate for the between group com-parison of acupuncture versus no acupuncture controlsshowed a decrease in the effect size of acupuncture of.019 SD per 3 months (95% CI =.041 to .003, P=.096, P=.011 for heterogeneity, Fig 4A). With a difference between acupuncture and no acupuncture control of approximately .5 SD, this is equivalent to approxi- mately a 15% decrease in acupuncture effect relative to control at 1 year after randomization, which wasusually between 9 and 10 months after the end of treat-ment. In the analysis of acupuncture versus shamacupuncture, a total of 21 trials and 6,276 patients wereincluded. There was a nonsignicant decrease of .012SD per 3 months in acupuncture relative to sham acu-puncture (95% CI =.035 to .011, P=.3,Fig 4B), approximately a 25% decrease in acupuncture effect at 1 year after randomization. Signicant heterogeneityamong trials was seen (P<.0001). The previous analysis reported that the decrease in effect of acupuncture rela-tive to sham was driven by the decrease in neck paintrials (a decrease of .587 SD per 3 months, 95% CI = .767 to .406, P<.0001). We also analyzed the change in acupuncture relative to sham excluding these trialsand found a nonsignicant decrease of .003 SD per 3 months (95% CI =.026 to .020, P=.8) with no signi- cant heterogeneity among trials (P =.12). Hence almost all the decrease in acupuncture effects in this analysisseems attributable to neck pain. As a sensitivity analysis, we repeated the analyses in- cluding only trials that reported a signicant differencebetween acupuncture and control, because trials thatshowed no difference between groups cannot show areduction in acupuncture effects over time. Nine trialswith 2,997 patients were included in this analysis forthe comparison between acupuncture and no acupunc-ture controls. A smaller and still nonsignicant decreasein the effect of acupuncture was found (.008 SD per 3months, 95% CI =.034 to .018, P=.5) and heterogene- ity between trials was reduced (P =.082). None of the newly included trials showed a signicant effect of acu-puncture versus sham and so this analysis of sham-controlled trials with a signicant effect contains thesame 7 trials and 1,450 patients and has the same resultsas reported in the original publication ( .049 SD per 3 months, 95% CI =.086 to .013, P=.008, heterogene- ityP<.0001). Discussion We updated an individual patient data meta-analysis of high-quality trials of acupuncture for chronic pain with7 additional years of data. An additional 10 studies wereincluded with nearly 3,000 patients. In total, our analy-ses include 39 studies and 20,827 patients. The resultsconrm and strengthen previous key ndings that acu-puncture has a clinically relevant effect compared withTable 5.

Moreover, we conrmed that, although the effects of acupuncture are not completelyexplicable in terms of placebo effects, factors other thanthe specic effects of needling at correct acupuncturepoint locations are important contributors to acupunc-ture treatment benet. Effects of acupuncture appear topersist over at least a 12-month period. Heterogeneity continues to be an obvious aspect of our ndings, with the results of trials varying by more thanwould be expected by chance. We have presented datathat heterogeneity is predominately driven by differ-ences between control groups rather than by differencesbetween acupuncture treatment characteristics. We didnot nd any obvious differences between the results oftrials depending on treatment characteristics such as styleof acupuncture, duration of treatment sessions, or train-ing of acupuncturists. In contrast, we found evidence thateffect sizes of acupuncture were smaller for sham-controlled trials with penetrating needles and for noacupuncture controlled trials in which patients receivedhigh-intensity care (eg, a trial of acupuncture plus physi-cal therapy vs physical therapy alone). In some cases,heterogeneity was also driven by a set of outlying trialswith large effect sizes. We have presented these analy-ses with and without the outlying trials to provide allnecessary information for interpreting these results anddrawing conclusions. Another novel nding is the higher than average effects of acupuncture on upper body musculoskeletal pain. Wenow have sufcient data to conduct a meta-analysis forneck pain and for shoulder pain, even after exclusion ofoutlying trials. The effect sizes versus sham, .57 for shoul-der and .83 for neck pain, were much larger than for lowback pain, osteoarthritis, and headache, although we alsosaw evidence that treatment benets did not persist forneck pain. Since publication of our results, there has been no substantive critique of our methodology in the peer-reviewed literature. The main issue under discussionseems to be whether the effect size of acupuncture isTable 6.

Wehave previously argued in favor of the former, on thegrounds that the clinical decision made by a referringclinician in discussion with their patient is not betweenacupuncture and sham but between acupuncture andno acupuncture. Our argument is given the context ofthe excellent safety prole of acupuncture, 65evidence that the nonspecic effects of acupuncture are particu-lar to acupuncture and are not easily reproduced, 46,54 and evidence provided here and elsewhere9that some interventions used as sham acupuncture may be physi-ologically active. It is also illustrative to compare our results with those of other interventions routinely used in clinical prac-tice. For instance, in one meta-analysis of NSAIDs forosteoarthritis of the knee, the effect size for NSAIDs versusplacebo for trials that did not preselect NSAID respond-ers was .23 10; for chronic low back pain, the effect size for NSAIDs was <.20.29 We nd several implications for research. In terms of the methodology of subsequent acupuncture trials forchronic pain, we nd that the balance of evidence is togive a higher dose of acupuncture in terms of a greaternumber of treatments in trials without sham control. Al-though the nature of the control group in trials willnaturally be driven by the research question, investiga-tors should be aware of the evidence that control armsthat incorporate a relatively intense level of interven-tion, such as when acupuncture is added into an intensiverehabilitation regimen, tend to lead to smaller effect sizes,as do sham controls that involve needle penetration.Further research is warranted on whether acupunctureis particularly effective for upper body musculoskeletalTable 7.

An associated hypothesis is whether there are sub- types of other chronic pain indications that havedifferential response to acupuncture. It would natu-rally be ideal to know before referring a patient fortreatment whether, say, the type of back pain they areexperiencing is one that would be amenable to treat-ment with acupuncture. We will also repeat our previouscall for research on how best to incorporate acupunc-ture into the multidisciplinary care of chronic painpatients. Conclusions We have conrmed that acupuncture has a clinically relevant, persistent effect on chronic pain that is not com-pletely explained by placebo effects. Referral for a courseof acupuncture treatment is therefore a reasonable optionfor a patient with chronic pain.

The themes of the questions and applicant group responses were: Where on the body is point injection therapy performed, near the head and neck, and are there additional risks? Response was that it is performed on muscles and trigger points and are performed everyw here acupuncture is performed. Some injections are to the face and neck, for instance for facelifts . There is a risk of allergic reaction to substances being injected. The a pplicant group hasn 't heard of an adverse reaction. What is the emergency protocol, c all 911 and then treat? The response was t hat an acupuncturist is taught in point injection therapy training to call 911 and administer epinephrine and oxygen to stabilize the patient until emergency help arrive s. Can you provide examples of patient confusion regarding dry needling? The applicant group gave examples of a dry needle company in Kirkland that markets what they call dry needles to physical therapists in Washington even though i t's not legal. Another story was provided of a p atient who received dry needling from a physical therapist in Colorado a nd then asked his acupuncturist here if she was able to perform dry needling as an acupuncturist. Can you clarify the issue with CPT codes ? Are you clarifying the scope for billing purposes? The response was that it' s not for billing purposes since the CPT code is already in the scope of practice of acup uncture. What are the Washington State Medical Association 's (WSMA) concerns about local anesthetics? The response was that they requested c larifications on when local anesthetics would be used. They said some of it can be worked out in rule to provide specifics instead of it being for broad use. The intent is for it to be used during trigger point w ork and is the Appendices - Page A- 242majority of where this would be use d for patient comfort. They stated they w ill work with WSMA on addressing their concerns and using best practices. Don't you worry that listing specific modalitie s and diagnoses may limit your scope? The response was that they are trying to figure out how to explain ancient practices into Western terminology. Physical therapists state since they are using w estern terminology, acupuncturists don't do it. Acupuncturists are s till trying to state what acupuncture is in terms patients will understand. There is a lack of mutual understanding of acupuncture practice so they w ant to ensure these techniques apply without listing every technique they do. Why do you need to add treat ment substance use disorders when that's a diagno sis? The response was that there are reimbursement and awareness issue s with Medicare and Medicaid for acupuncturists performing treatment. Why the need for the c larifications (in general) The responses were that the s cope doesn 't fully reflect how acupuncture is practiced in the west and they are t rying to capture more details of what they do. Physical therapy comments show they believe acupuncturists don't perform dry needling and that it's a physical therapy procedure. We want to ensure it's clear we also do it. Patients may not read our regulations but other practitio ners might. They don 't understand our training and what we do. This would show them we are doing these procedures and are trained to do them. The applicant group also provided follow up after the hearing to include their requirement to notify patients what is in their scope of practice, in RCW 18.06.130 and WAC 246 -803-300 (follow up comments are at the end of this hearing summary). Public Testimony Six physical therapists signed in or testified in opposition to the proposal and two signed in with concerns. Reasons for their opposition included: Adding dry needling to the acupuncture definition is anticompetitive , appearing to give acupuncturists the sole rights to perform these procedures. The 2016 sunrise review that proposed adding dry needling to the physical therapy scope of practice stated that it fit within the physical therapy scop e if adequate education and training were included in the law. Adding intramuscular needling and dry needling to the points stimulated by acupuncture needles doesn't make sense because these are practices not \"points. \" Adding dry needling is a violation of antitrust law. Appendices - Page A- 243 There is no evidence of patient confusion regarding acupuncture and dry needling in states where physical therapists are authorized to perform the procedure (citing a Florida State Oriental Medicine Association vs. department of health case where the administrative court found no evidence of patient confusion) . It's clear that acupuncture and Eastern medicine are based in traditiona l Chinese medicine, whereas physical therapy is based on movement science based in Western medicine. The dry needling proposal will harm the public by blocking access to the procedure by other licensed health care providers. They cited a North Caroline lawsuit against the physical therapy board that ended up in the state Supreme C ourt which ruled dry needling was part of the practice of physical therapy in that state. Panel follow up: The panel asked questions about whether physical therapists believe the acupuncture statute can restrict the practice by ot her professions, stating they can't do that. The r esponse was that it could take litigation like North Carolina to fight other profe ssions trying to own a modality. They stated fundament agreement that it can' t be done in the acupuncture law but stated they want to avoid litigation to prove it. They also st ated they don't believe acupuncture and dry needling are identical and cite the 2016 dry needling sunrise that found that acupuncture and dry needling are distinct techniques . They include arguments for why dry needling is not acupuncture and why it shouldn't be in cluded in the scope clarification. (These are not relevant to this sunrise review and so aren't listed in detail). Acupuncturists In addition to the five members of the applicant group, e ight acupuncturists signed in or testified in support of the proposal for the following reasons: The scope of practice needs to be clarified so that it includes n oninsertion tools because acupuncture is currently defined as insertion of a needle. This leaves out things like Japanese acupuncture, which does not include insertion of a needle, which also raises concerns i nsurance may not cover this procedure . Acupuncturists want to ensure adequate training for dry needling but no t restrict others from practicing it within their legal scope of practice. Epinephrine should be added because it's very cost effect ive to get it in syringes as compared to an epinephrine autoinjector. The other substances are very effective in point injection therapy. There is a very low risk of an adverse reaction but an acupuncturist may be committing malpractice if they don't have them ready to use for and emergency. Appendices - Page A- 244 There is a large communication gap around acupuncture practice and the scope of practice has been vague. Other professions are trying to c o-opt this practi ce by call ing it something else so this needs to be addressed in statute. Some history was provided on the use of hypodermic needles in the past and how the practice has involved. The CMS CPT Code Committee equates dry needling to trigger point acupuncture so it's invalid to say they don 't share a specific therapeutic needling technique to treat musculoskeletal conditions. It's the same CPT code. Acupuncture isn't covered by Medicaid for substance use disorder treatment. Auricular acupuncture is very effective for treatin g PTSD in refugees and veterans . Panel follow up: The panel asked follow up questions of those testifying about : Why acupuncturists can't use the term dry needling already without a change to the statute . If ashi points are already in the definition of acupuncture , why does it need to be added, especially if acupuncturists believe the term is being us ed incorrectly and is redundant. How another profession adding dry needling to their scope would prevent acup uncturists from performing it? The r esponse s were that some acupuncturists already use the term \"dry needling \" because t hey have to educate patients on what they do and on their level of their education and need to use terms patients and other types of providers understand. A lso, other providers don't understand the work of acupuncture and try to define what acupuncture is without understanding it. They added that they want to clarify their scope of practice in statute f or legislators as well who don 't understand wha t is in their scope of practice, and that this is a preventative measure to ensure physical therapists don't say dry needling is physical therapy, not acupuncture. It was added that these clarifications have all become high profile due to insurance reimbursement and substance use disorder treatment due to the opioid crisis . Acupuncturists want to ensure it's clear they can provide substance use disorder treatments. They also want to ensure if physical therapists pass a bill for dry needling that it wouldn't preclude acupuncturists from performing it. Other Professions The Washington Association of Naturopathic Physicians (WANP) discussed the scope of practice issue with \"including, but not limited to ...\" whic h appears to expand the scope. They stated it Appendices - Page A- 245leaves it o pen and bro ad and could cause confusion. They requested the acupuncturists e nsure it's it remains tied to As ian medicine. They also stated that i njection of substances needs to be clearly limit ed to point injection therapy. They supports oxygen and epinephrine for emergency purposes but request it's clear oxygen is limited to emergency purposes since there are other uses for it . They added that acupuncturists need to include continuing education. The Washington State Medical Association (WSMA) stated they e ncourage inclusion of acupuncturists in treating pain. They listed some concerns regarding some of the terms and have brought them to the attention of WAEMA who agree d to work with WSMA . Concerns with diagnosing and treating disease outside Easte rn medicine - the definition change doesn't include this context - need to amend the draft language to add this context back in. \"including , but not limited to \" is too broad. Not opposed to local anesthetics being added but need to ensure they can 't be used for their own value but are within point injection therapy.

As a consequence of integrated medicine, there is n ew e merging lan guage in Western medical terminology t o describe a spects of A c upuncture a nd E astern Medicine. As our c urrent RCW i s written, i t does n ot take this n ew d evelopment i nto consideration a nd this is misleading and inaccurate. Our academic t raining in corporates the p rinciples o f Western medicine alo ng with Acupuncture a nd E astern medicine.1 B y including the terminology i n our scope a nd c learly spelling out that i t is within t he scope a cupuncture, we ar e declaring that modern d escriptions o f our practice a re als o within our scope.

Many Dry Needling classes won't accept acupuncturists to take their classes, while they will accept other me dical professionals that have no previous experience working with needles therapeutically . There are companies that sell Dry Needles, which are acupuncture needles but marketed as Dry Needles specific to the technique with information specific to PT's. 2 This is misleading to the public as well as other health professionals. Patients and other healthcare professions should be aware that this service is readily available to the public from Acupuncturists and Eastern medicine practitioners , and we should be allowed to take the Dry Needling classes from other professionals as well. Another example of lack of clarity around who does Dry Needling was a patient of mine that came from the UW pain clinic after receiving a treatment from a Doctor there. This technique is within the scope of MD's, but she was not aware that it is a part of the practice of acupuncture that MD's do. In the patient medical record from the pain clinic, it referred to this technique as Trigger Point needling - so we must also be clear that this terminology is included. Acupuncture is an overarching term for a system of medicine that is based in Acupuncture and Eastern medical (AEM) theory. This involves medical theories as well as practices and techniques that are all based on the principles of AEM medicine. The technique s of acupuncture; which involve therapeutic insertion and non -insertion techniques also ha ve quite a few modalities that are considered within the definition of acupuncture: Acupuncture and Eastern medicine: I acupuncture practice of therapies and modalities ________________________I_______________________________________________ I I I I I I Japanese Auricular Reducing tech Tonifying tec h Dry Needling/IM S Neutral tech This is a partial list of needle -based therapies that are included within the practice of acupuncture. Of these therapeutic techniques Dry Needling / Intramuscular stimulation/ Trigger Point and Motor Point stimulation are the only ones that are currently described more commonly in Western medical terminology (the Eastern terminology relates to ashi points , hua tou jia ji points; using \"bringing fire to the mountain\" technique.) Because of this difference in language there is a lot of confusion. For furt her explanation of this please see the following 248Several claims have been made that Dry Needling is not acupuncture which furthers the confusion . In just considering the statements submitted to the DOH from physical therapists: Please refer to the testimony of Susanne Michaud where she states that acupuncture and dry needling are distinct techniques and that she would never send a patient to an acupuncturist for dry needling, but she will send them to ND's and physiatrists. The testimony of Paul Killoren PT, also states that dry needling is uniq ue from acupuncture. Comments from David Bond states that he questions whether our scope \"should include the techniques or terms \"intramuscular needling\" or \"dry needling\" in their scope of practice at all. These are terms from techniques from western med icine and physical therapy\" and goes on to say that in his professional opinion these are different from acupuncture. In the statement from PTWA, they declare that the practice of Acupuncture is different from Physical Therapy - which is true. But both o f our medical professions perform some similar techniques and modalities and we also use the same billing codes when we do so. There is an overlap between the profession s even while we practice from different diagnostic principles. We both do manual the rapy for example- And again we see a statement \"that dry needling and intramuscular needling are different from acupuncture.\" This failure of medical professionals to accept that Dry Needling is a technique currently practiced by Acupuncture and Eastern Medicine Practitioners and taught in our schools is a misunderstanding that requires clarity. Just as there is overlap for manual therapy, there is an overlap for dry needling and intramuscular stimulation. We are in agreement with physical therapists that this technique is very useful, we see the benefits literally every day. With the opioid epidemic, which is really a pain epidemic, these treatments are beneficial for a large number of people. It is important that medical professionals, insurance co mpanies and the public all have clarity about what this treatment is, who can benefit from it and most importantly where they can go to get it. This is the reason for the scope clarification - in accordance with the requirements for the Sunrise Review; the public should be able to easily be able to identify qualified practitioners that have the correct levels of training and education to perform this technique in Washington state. Furthermore, this would clarify that we as Acupuncturists and Eastern medicine practitioners are qualified and competent practitioners of this technique to other medical professionals as well as Health Insurance providers . This may be even more important when the CPT codes that correspond to the needling technique come out in 2020. These codes refer to Dry Needling and Trigger point needling, further specifying that the technique i s non-retention, non -injection needling. With the growing awareness of this technique much research is being done by other (than AEMPs) healt hcare professionals to consider all of the benefits, and there are many. Many studies with positive results are focuse d on headaches 3, which is a diagnosis code that recently got removed for Acupuncturists under Regence. If insurance companies aren't awa re 3 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4486992/ Appendices - Page A- 249that we are doing this technique, they could further deny us payment for this and patients wouldn't be able to choose an AEMP for their full breadth of scope. As we move forward into the healthcare system and integrated care, it is important for us as practitioners to show clearly what our scope of practice is so that medical providers better understand our scope and patients will have the most options and opportunities to get the care they need by well qualified practitioners. A clarification of the case in Florida; the courts there decided that Dry Needling was clearly not within the scope of PT's because the procedure of a needle piercing the skin was not within the scope of physical therapists in the state of Florida. 4 A clarification of the case in North Carolina: there it was determined that Dry Needling was within the scope of physical therapists. The anti- trust case was not about the use of the terminology, but the attempt of acupuncturists to stop physical therapists from practicing thr ough the dissemination of cease and desist letters.5 (To be clear: we have no intention of limiting the practice of others and are merely trying to clarify our scope) Thank you for your consideration of this matter. We hope to come to better mut ual understanding of each other's professions in order to work better together through these clarifications. Charis Wolf LAc, AEMP Dipl Ac, MSTCM, PhD -s President, WAEMA Representative to the Americian Society of Acupuncturists Public Education Committe e, American Society of Acupuncturists I wanted to provide the WAC reference associated with our statement regarding the requirement to inform the patient of the AEMP scope of practice: WAC 246-803-300 Patient notification of qualifications and scope of practice. East Asian medicine practitioners in the state of Washington must provide to each patient prior to or at the time of the initial patient visit the qualifications and scope of practice form. The form must include : (1) The East Asian medicine practitioner's education.

[Statutory Authority: Chapter 18.06 RCW \u00a7 246 -803-300, filed 8/22/11, effective 9/22/11. ] And here is the RCW. It appears that acupuncturists are the only profession that is required to present their scope of practice to a new patient. According to Vicki Brown this dates back to 1985 when acupuncturist first gained licensure. RCW 18.06.130 Patient information form \u2014Penalty . *** CHANGE IN 2019 *** (SEE 1865 -S.SL) ** * (1) The secreta ry shall develop a form to be used by a person licensed under this chapter to inform the patient of the scope of practice and qualifications of an East Asian medicine practitioner.

Appendices - Page A- 251Leslie Emerick Attached are the comments from WAEMA in response to all the feedback we got. Please let us know if you have any further questions - The Washington Acupuncture and Eastern Medicine Association (WAEMA) would like to respond to additional comments made at the Acupuncture and Eastern Medicine Su nrise Review Hearing on August 2, 2019. We would like to start with why a clarification of scope falls under a Sunrise Review Criteria. State laws require that Acupuncture and Eastern Medicine Practitioners (AEMPs) provide a copy of their scope of practice at the time a person first becomes a patient. Here is an example that the department has suggested practitioner use when initiating treatment with a patient: Patient Notification of Qualifications and Scope of Practice Sample Form (PDF) In response to Kat ie Wolt's statement at the hearing that \"patients don't know or care what is in the Acupuncture Scope of Practice and that perhaps education is needed instead of a clarification in state law.\" We strongly disagree that a patient does not know or care what is in the AEMPs scope of practice. The patient notification form is where the education of a patient receiving acupuncture begins. A patient should be educated when they review the scope of practice to reduce confusion that acupuncturists treat substance abuse disorder, that they use Japanese \"non -insertion\" needles for patients who may be medically fragile or do not tolerate needles well, that trigger points, dry needling and intramuscular stimulation are all part of the scope of practice of AEMPs and that is why it is needed in statute. In response to Jeb Shepard, WA State Medical Association comments and Bob May, WA Naturopathic Physicians: Both associations expressed concerns regarding the term \"including, but not limited to\" as too broad. WAEMA has su ggested alternative language to both associations to review that would be more specific in the bill draft. WSMA also requested that the language related to \"treat and diagnose\" mirror the language in RCW 18.06 (SHB 1865) and we will be revising our bill draft to reflect the highlighted changes below: (1) \"Acupuncture\" or \"Eastern medicine\" means a ((health care service utilizing acupuncture or Eastern medicine diagnosis and treatment to promote health and treat organic or functional disorders and includes t he following)) holistic system of medicine often referred to as traditional Chinese medicine, Eastern medicine, and by other terms, which includes a variety of traditional and modern therapeutic treatments including, but not limited to, such as, the practice of acupuncture techniques and herbal medicine to maintain and promote wellness, prevent, manage, and reduce pain, treat substance use disorder, and diagnose and treat disease to promote health and treat organic or functional disorders. Both association s expressed concerns with the injection of \"local anesthetics, oxygen and epinephrine\" and requested additional clarification. We propose the following change to the bill language to address their concerns: Appendices - Page A- 252(((l))) (m)Point injection therapy, as defined in rule by the department. Point injection therapy includes injection of substances, limited to saline, sterile water, herbs, minerals, vitamins in liquid form, ((and)) homeopathic and nutritional substances, and local anesthetics consistent with the practice of acupuncture or Eastern medicine for reduction of pain during point injection therapy injections and with training to be further defined in rule. An acupuncturist or acupuncture and Eastern medicine prac titioner using point injection therapy who has met the training and education requirements established pursuant to RCW 18.06.230 may use local anesthetics, oxygen, and epinephrine for potential emergency purposes, such as an allergic or adverse reaction, f or patient care and safety. Bob Mays stated that Acupuncture and Eastern Medicine Practitioners (AEMP) are not required to complete continuing education consistent with other direct access health care providers. As of July 28, 2019, SHB 1865 Acupuncture an d Eastern Medicine addresses this issue by requiring CE's, with the number of hours to be determined in rule. The intention of WAEMA is to have CE requirements consistent with the national NCCAOM requirements of 60 hour every 4 years. In response to Susann e Michaud, PT, we are suggesting the following modifications to address their concerns about the location of \"intramuscular needling and dry needling\" in the bill draft language and have agreement with the PTs that this language would be acceptable: (a) ((Acupuncture, including the)) Use of presterilized, disposable needles, such as filiform needles, and other acupuncture needles, syringes, or lancets to directly and indirectly stimulate meridians and acupuncture points ((and meridians)), including ashi poi nts, motor points, trigger points, intramuscular needling, dry needling, and other nonspecific points throughout the body; (b) Use of electrical, mechanical, or magnetic devices to stimulate meridians and acupuncture points ((and meridians)), including ashi points, motor points, trigger points, intramuscular needling, dry needling, and other nonspecific points throughout the body; (c)Intramuscular needling and dry needling of trigger points and other nonspecific points throughout the body in accordance with Acupuncture and Eastern medicine training; We also have concerns about her statement that AEMPs \"slipped in\" the term trigger point and Ashi points to recent rulemaking at DOH around their scope of practice. This was a very thorough public meeting rulemaking process that PTWA was represented at and where they opposed the language being added to a scope clarification. We strongly disagree with her contention that this language gives acupuncturists exclusive purview over dry needling and intramuscular stimu lation. Currently two bills waiting for a public hearing before the Senate and House Health Care committees, SB 5642 and HB 1260 Intramuscular Needling, would expand the scope of practice for PTs. The only limit is their ability to get the bill passed thr ough the state legislature. Her threats of a lawsuit based on the North Carolina class action is not a precedent in this case. If the PT's are able to pass legislation that provides for adequate training and an adequate clinical component, then the association would be more amenable to supporting it in their scope of practice. We are not opposed to continuing the dialogue with the Physical Therapy Association of Washington (PTWA) and met with them numerous times over the past few years in facilitated conve rsations to resolve our differences. The contention is not around whether they can or should practice dry needling Appendices - Page A- 253and intramuscular stimulation, it is around the number of hours for educational and clinical training for the safe practice of dry needling and intramuscular stimulation. Washington state law allows the PTs to expand their scope of practice through legislation. All health care practitioners in the state must adhere to these state laws governing professions. Medical doctors, osteopaths and ARNPs are already performing needling with a filiform needle. Neither this proposed bill or current law restricts other professions from passing legislation to add to their scope of practice. Current law states: RCW 18.06.045 Exemptions from chapter. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prohibit or restrict: (1) The practice by an individual credentialed under the laws of this state and performing services within such individual's authorized scope of practice; We also suggest that RCW 18.06.045 Exempti ons from chapter, applies to the comments by Fuji McPherson who owns the Acupuncture and Integrative Medicine Institute (AIMI) that teaches ARNPs \"medical acupuncture\". As an owner of a school that gains financial benefit from the teaching of acupuncture to advance practice nurses, he has already gained acceptance within the ARNP scope of practice to use filiform needles for the purpose of medical acupuncture. WAEMA would like to reiterate that in our Sunrise Review Applicant Report it states: This proposal is not intended to limit other professions from gaining access to acupuncture techniques legislatively with appropriate training, it only assures that these terms will also be understood as the practice of acupuncture, not to be superseded or disallowed b y alternative definitions that may arise in the future. This proposal only impacts the scope of practice for licensed acupuncturists in Washington state. It is our understanding that the Physical Therapy Association of WA has concerns regarding a statemen t in the Sunrise Applicant Report underlined below: 2. Explain how the proposal addresses the problem and benefits the public (refer to RCW 18.120.030(4)). RCW 18.120.030 requires that the public and consumers clearly understand the profession and the treatments that they provide under state law. Other professions using acupuncture (filiform) needles therapeutically are practicing acupuncture under a different name causing confusion for the public. We want to assure that any use of acupuncture (filiform) n eedles for therapeutic purposes is considered acupuncture under the law. Public safety could be at risk with unauthorized use of acupuncture (filiform) needles, coupled with inadequate training and potentially operating outside of their scope of practice. As stated above, it is not the intent of the association or Sunrise Review to limit the procedure of dry needling and intramuscular stimulation to only Acupuncturist and Eastern Medicine Practitioners, but to clearly include it in their scope of practice. Although it is too late to amend the Sunrise Applicant Report, the association would like to suggest broader language be included or substituted to assist in this clarification. Instead of \"is considered acupuncture under the law\" replace with \"is considered within the scope of acupuncture under the law\". Appendices - Page A- 254WAEMA would like to point out that there are numerous examples of why clarification around dry needling and intramuscular stimulation are needed in the \"Information Summary and Recommendations Physical Th erapy Dry Needling Sunrise Review December 2016\" The Sunrise Act (RCW 18.120.010) says a health care profession should be regulated or scope of practice expanded only when: Unregulated practice can clearly harm or endanger the health, safety or welfare o f the public, and the potential for the harm is easily recognizable and not remote or dependent upon tenuous argument; Physical Therapy Dry Needling Sunrise Review Department Analysis: \"The department finds that dry needling is an invasive procedure with potential serious risks of patient injury and death\" and \"There are inherent risks from any practitioner puncturing the skin with acupuncture needles and the department must ensure adequate training to safely perform these procedures while avoiding rare b ut serious adverse events.\" Physical Therapy Dry Needling Sunrise Review First Criterion: Unregulated practice can clearly harm or endanger the health, safety, or welfare of the public. The proposal does not meet this criterion. Physical therapists are c urrently a thoroughly regulated profession with substantial training in the treatment modalities under their current scope of practice that includes up to 1,500 hours of supervised clinical training. The proposal as written adds an invasive procedure with the potential for serious risks of patient injury without offering adequate protections to the public. The definition of dry needling appears to fall under the EAMP scope of practice and EAMPs have extensive training in needling techniques and safety. However, that does not mean other providers shouldn't also use these needles if they have adequate training and statutory authority to do so. Overlaps between scopes of practice are sometimes appropriate if evidence of adequate training to protect the public is included. The department found during this review that although the proposal submitted does not meet the sunrise criteria, dry needling may fit within physical therapy treatment of myofascial pain and movement impairments with adequate training that includes a clinical component. The public cannot be effectively protected by other means in a more cost -beneficial manner. There have been numerous television news stories about dry needling in Washington state, most recently on King 5 News (later identified as happening in a different state), which are in the public arena that does not clarify the need for appropriate training and clinical hours. WAEMA has attempted to correct the misinformation and educate the public but does not have the resources to count er the extensive reach of a television audience in Washington state. We hope to have the ability to educate the public through clear legislation that demonstrates the extensive training and clinical experience required for inserting filiform needling into patients. WAEMA Analysis: Clearly the unregulated practice of dry needling can harm or endanger the health, safety or welfare of the public, and the potential for the harm is easily recognizable. Currently the terms \"dry needling and intramuscular stimulation\" are not specifically stated in the scope of practice for physical therapists or AEMPs. It is not clear to the public that this is a regulated practice in Washington state. Appendices - Page A- 255AEMPs have the clinical hours and training necessary to safely perform these procedures that include inserting a filiform acupuncture needle into patients for therapeutic purposes. For these reasons, we request that the department support our request for c larification that AEMPs clearly have the clinical hour and training necessary to perform the practice of dry needling and intramuscular stimulation. The public needs and can reasonably be expected to benefit from an assurance of initial and continuing professional ability; WAEMA wants to guarantee that the public can reasonably be expected to benefit from an assurance of initial and continuing professional ability that AEMPs have the adequate training to provide dry needling and intramuscular stimulation by clearly stating it in their statute. The concern regarding harm or endangerment to public safety from the use of dry needling or intramuscular stimulation comes from the lack of clinical hours and training. AEMPs have the appropriate training to safely provide this treatment. Recommendations Physical Therapy Dry Needling Sunrise Review December 2016: The department does not support the applicant's proposal as submitted to add dry needling to the physical therapy scope of practice. It does not meet the sunrise criteria for increasing a profession's scope of practice. Rationale: The applicant did not demonstrate that 54 hours of training is sufficient to ensure professional ability of physical therapists to perform dry needling, which is an invasive pro cedure with potential serious risks of patient injury. The HumRRO analysis did not address a minimum level of training or assess current training programs for adequacy. There is no supervised clinical experience requirement. Physical therapists have va st training, including supervised clinical experience, in anatomy and physiology. However, physical therapist training does not include use of needles in treatment. The applicant report states that the majority of education necessary to perform dry need ling is taught in entry -level physical therapy doctoral education. However, not all physical therapists practicing in Washington have completed doctoral level training and a doctorate is not required for licensure. In addition, there are other challenges to implementing the proposed bill, SB 6374: The definition of dry needling in the bill is problematic, specifically the statement \"Dry needling does not include the stimulation or treatment of acupuncture points and meridians.\" The physical location of myofascial trigger points, muscular, and connective tissue often correspond with acupuncture points and meridians. Section two does not limit the dry needling endorsement to physical therapists who have received their Doctor of Physical Therapy (DPT) d egree, even though the applicant report uses doctoral level training as the basis for its assessment of physical therapists' substantial training in anatomy and physiology. The current physical therapy statute and rules allow full licensure with a baccalau reate physical therapy degree, or a baccalaureate degree plus an advanced physical therapy degree or certificate. Appendices - Page A- 256Physical Therapy Dry Needling Sunrise Review Second Criterion: The public needs and can reasonably be expected to benefit from an assurance of initial and continuing professional ability. The proposal does not meet this criterion. There are adequate laws and rules in place to assure the public of physical therapists' initial and continued professional ability to practice within their current sco pe of practice. The proposal does not contain similar assurances. The applicant has not provided evidence that the proposal provides assurance of initial and continuing professional ability for physical therapists to perform dry needling safely.... For these reasons we ask that the department support the clarifications and scope expansion we request to help educate our patients and the public about the training of AEMPS in Washington state and the need for additional patient safety and comfort through the addition of the new scope expansion for Point Injection Therapy. Charis Wolfe - member of applicant group From Other Stakeholders: Please find the attached letter from one of my patients regarding confusion over who can practice dry needling. I want to share with you some confusion I experienced regarding who can administer dry needling. I have experienced pain/discomfort in my right hip for several months. Initially, I was diagnosed with having bursitis. I received an injection of cortisone in my hip area. That brought some relief. I also have been going to Physical Therapy. After several PT sessions, the Physical Therapist recommended I return to the Sports Medicine doctor. During that visit with the Sports Medicine doctor, he mentioned that he could provide a technique called \"dry needling\" where he would insert needles into the area and then provide electric stimulation to that area. I agreed to this procedure. It was very helpful and I had immediate relief. When I saw Jessica for my acupuncture appointment, I shared with her that the Sports Medicine doctor had done dry needling and how it resembled acupuncture, but with the electric impulse. I was not aware that this type of application is part of what can be done by acupuncture. I am glad that my acupuncture therapist educated me that this is a technique she can perform. I have had this treatment twice and have experienced elimination of the pain I had been experiencing in my hip. Bette Hubbard I'd like to add my support to the recommendations put forward in the WAEMA proposal. I've been in private practice for 30 years, and have training in traditional Chinese and Japanese style s of acupuncture, as well as point injection therapy and orthopedic acupuncture.

The terms have traditionally been used by western medicine practices and made popular in the United States by physicians and physical therapists. Please consider the effectiveness, affordability, and fact this technique used by many different industries of healthcare providers can safely, and quickly, help Washingtonians treat and manage pain, dysfunction, and chronic musculoskeletal disorders conservatively, with unbelievably positive outcomes. Please do not block myself and other people that manage chronic symptoms from effective, affordable care, allowing one profession to capitalize on a treatment style and technique. Jacqueline Berg I am writing to submit my comment regarding the Sunrise Review- Acupuncture and Eastern Medicine Scope of Practice. As a healthcare provider trained out of state OR and CA and receiving my clinical Doctorate, I have seen first- hand the benefits that \"intramuscular needling\" and \"dry needling\" can provide to people in pain when performed by an expert in the musculoskeletal system, as physical therapists and physicians are. It concerns me that this proposed expanded scope of practice will take ownership of these terms and limit the options of citizens of Washington State to receive effective, safe, conservative care from others outside of the field of Eastern Medicine. It is by believe that these tools are effective and safe to use in the hands of skilled providers including physical therapist and physicians. Ownership of words although seem small make large changes to my personal scope of practice. Professionally, I have become an expert in the musculoskeletal system and have spent hours of rigorously studying. I believe by changing this language would take away from my ability to provide evidence based quality care and ultimately taking away from WA citizens and their ability to receive effective care. Brielle Kadrmas, PT, DPT Thank you for considering written comments during this Sunrise Review process regarding expansion of Acupuncture and Eastern Medicine Scope of Practice to include \"dry needling\" and \"intramuscular Appendices - Page A- 261needling\". As the licensing board, DOH committee, and members of the WA legislature are aware - there have been several efforts to expand physical therapy scope of practice to include dry needling in WA over the past several years. These attempts have been unsuccessful to this point with much resistance from acupuncture and eastern medicine practitioners, and unfortunately has put WA behind the 40+ other states who have now allowed the practice of dry needling by PTs and other clinical doctoring professions. Allowing one profession to monopolize a tool (monofilament needle) ultimately impacts the healthcare consumer the most, by limiting access to cost-effective and non-pharmaceutical therapies. I oppose the current proposal and the applicant's rationale to increase acupuncture scope of practice to include \"dry needling\" and \"intramuscular needling\" on both procedural and practical grounds. For brief background, I currently live in WA and have been a physical therapist for almost 10 years, graduating from Regis University with my Doctorate in Physical Therapy in 2010. Originally from CO, and with licensure in other states (which allow needling), I was trained in dry needling in 2011 and have been an educator for Kinetacore Education since 2014. Since that time, as faculty I have instructed over 100 dry needling weekend intensives and have lectured nationally on the topic. First, procedurally I do not believe the applicant party has adequately fulfilled the proposed criteria in RCW 18.120.010. Assertions of public confusion over needling modalities contributing to public harm is unsubstantiated, not only in WA, but in other states and countries. Additionally, large scale clinical research and liability claim data from the largest healthcare insurer in the US clearly state physical therapists performing dry needling does not introduce a statistically significant increase in severe adverse event occurrence. The applicant party also fails to delineate education, training, and cost- beneficial implications for traditional acupuncture techniques versus dry needling. Secondly, the applicant party's attempt to adapt all needling procedures (any use of a filiform needle) as practically defined as 'acupuncture' is not only unprecedented and categorically false, but anti - competitive and ultimately harmful to multi-disciplinary methodological advancement and healthcare consumer access. Again, it is worth citing over 40 US states have legislatively allowed physical therapists and chiropractors the ability to adapt dry needling into their scope of practice as decidedly unique from acupuncture. In 2018, a federal anti-trust lawsuit ruling between the North Carolina Acupuncture Licensing Board (NCALB) and North Carolina Board of Physical Therapy Examiners determined that dry needling is unique from acupuncture, that it is within the scope of physical therapy practice, and acupuncture efforts to restrict this physical therapy practice violate anti-trust regulations. Furthermore, the contention that other therapeutic professions lack adequate training and knowledge to have the ability to use filiform needles is absurd considering the academic and clinical curricula for these doctoring professions (DPT, DC, MD) is extensively more than the master's level training of the applicant group -- specifically education in anatomy, neuroanatomy, histology, physiology, standard precautions, critical inquiry, orthopedic and neuromusculoskeletal management. \"We want to assure that any use of acupuncture (filiform) needles for therapeutic purposes is con sidered acupuncture under the law\" Ultimately, it seems the intent of the Department of Health Sunrise Review process should be to advance practice scope and innovations in healthcare, it should NOT be used as a tool to restrict other professions with inherent exclusivity of a modality or tool. Appendices - Page A- 262Thank you for considering commentary on this topic and denying the current proposal of acupuncture and eastern medicine scope of practice expansion. Paul Killoren PT, DPT, CSCS I am writing to voice my concern regarding the additions of the ownership of terms \"Dry Needling\" and \"Intramuscular Needling\" to the Acupuncture and Eastern Medicine scope of practice in our state. These terms are specific to the practice of Physical therapists around the nation in regards to successfully treating patients with intramuscular disruption and pain, and are not to mention specifically differentiated from the practice of Acupuncture and various forms of Eastern Medicine practice. I advise and hope to see that comments made about this issue are heard and understood as we as healthcare professionals look to progress the care of our patients to the most appropriate, specific and correct treatment we can provide as a whole. Sean Locke PTA, BS, CSCS I am writing to submit my comment regarding the Sunrise Review- Acupuncture and Eastern Medicine Scope of Practice. As a healthcare provider trained out of state (Utah and Texas) and receiving my clinical Doctorate, I have seen first-hand (as both the patient and provider) the benefits that \"intramuscular needling\" and \"dry needling\" can provide to people in pain when performed by an expert in the musculoskeletal system, as physical therapists and physicians are. It concerns me that this proposed expanded scope of practice will take ownership of these terms and limit the options of citizens of Washington State to receive effective, safe, conservative care from others outside of the field of Eastern Medicine. Nicholas Chamley PT, DPT, OCS I have been practicing acupuncture services (in particular auricular acupuncture) to patients a chemical dependency clinic that also dispensed Methadone and Buprenorphine. I believe that the most effective treatment is the chemical dependency clinic MAT (medication assisted treatment) for people who have dependency problems. This treatment provides medications and counselling sessions to people who have drug dependency problems. The treatment is a lengthy process, so while they are going through MAT, patients continues to suffer from physiological (eg. back pain, neck/shoulder pain, other various pain) and psychological (eg. depression, anxiety, stress). Therefore, we provide a holistic approach to support people. I believe that acupuncture is a practice that helps people who are struggling to stay in the chemical dependency program. People who stay in the program have a greater chance of recovery. I see many clients who are satisfied with their acupuncture treatments because it helps them manage their pain without the use of medications. Acupuncture treatment, in conjunction with MAT, plays a significant role in client's success on their long journey of recovery. Yoji Kobayashi Appendices - Page A- 263I am writing in support of specifically including language in the clarification of our acupuncture scope of practice regarding the use of contact needling and non-insertion tools such as teishin , enshin and zanshin that are commonly used in Japanese-style acupuncture (which I practice and teach around North America). Thes e specific needle therapy tools have existed for millenia and are described in Ling Shu chapter 1. (The Ling Shu is the name of the earliest known book on acupuncture, published around 200 BC, which explains the theory of meridians integral to the practice of acupuncture as well as acupuncture techniques, pathology and treatment for many diseases.) The word, Zhen Jiu which was incorrectly translated as \"acupuncture\", should actually have been translated as \"needle therapy and moxibustion\". In the West, we are primarily familiar with filiform acupuncture needles (used for insertion), but in fact there are myriad types of needles that have historically been used in East Asian medicine including the teishin (\"sesame seed ended needle\"), enshin (\"round headed needle\") and zanshin (arrow headed needle) which are described in the Classics for non-insertion purposes (pressing, scraping, tapping, etc.) and widely used by Japanese-acupuncture stylists. It is most commonly used in pediatrics as it is comfortable and safe to receive, as well as with sensitive patients and the elderly. Regarding auricular acupuncture, as co-founder and team leader of Seattle Acupuncture for Veterans, a group that provides free treatment to veterans and their families, we routinely use auricular acupuncture (primarily the NADA protocol) for treatment of PTSD, anxiety, depression and addiction cravings. The Pentagon has embraced the employment of \"Battlefield Acupuncture\" which uses a specific acupuncture protocol involving the ear. (I am currently working on a research trial with the founder of Battlefield Acupuncture, Richard C. Niemtzow, MD, Ph.D., MPH, Colonel (ret), USAF, MC, FS, Integrative Medicine Consultant to the USAF Surgeon General, Director, USAF Acupuncture & Integrative Med Center Joint Base Andrews, Maryland, Assistant Professor Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, Former President AAMA. Editor- in-Chief: Medical Acupuncture, Senior Military Editor: Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine. ) Research supporting the efficacy of auricular acupuncture for treatment of PTSD, chemical dependency, cravings and pain is growing, as well as the evidence base for acupuncture and East Asian medicine generally. I am happy to respond to any questions you may have and apologize that I am unable to come to Tumwater in person on August 2 to testify. Brenda Loew I would like to submit my DISPUTE comments to the: Sunrise Review - Acupuncture and Eastern Medicine Scope of Practice. I am a licensed physical therapist with nearly 15 years practice experience, and 3.5 years practicing as a dry needling practitioner while working in Nevada. Physical Therapist in the majority of states in our country have the ability to offer these services to our populous, and Washington residents deserve the same capacity. I have personally seen the consistently positive results that integrating dry needling has contributed to the recovery of a person 's function within the overall care under a physical therapist. We (physical therapist) are appropriately trained through our formal education and post-graduate Appendices - Page A- 264coursework, are able to competently educate patients, and safely implement dry needling to the neuro- musculoskeletal population. I fully support the state of Washington establishing dry needling specific educational and training requirement similar to other states in our country. These other states have made the legal decision and/or opinion that physical therapist and other non-east Asian medical practitioners/acupuncturist are fully competent, with additional post-graduate training, to offer dry needling services. Presently I am relocating from Nevada, where I have been a dry needling practitioner, back to Washington State and hope in the near future to competently offer dry needling services (once fully legalized) to the residents of Washington State. Warren Womack PT, DPT My name is Dave Bond, and I am a licensed physical therapist in Washington State. I would like to submit a comment for the sunrise review of the acupuncture and eastern medicine scope of practice in this state. I question whether it is appropriate for acupuncturists and eastern medicine practitioners to have the techniques or terms \"intramuscular needling\" or \"dry needling\" in their scope of practice at all. These terms are for techniques from western medicine and physical therapy. In my professional opinion, intramuscular/dry needling are different than acupuncture. The framework for understanding human anatomy and physiology, indications for use of techniques involving stimulation of tissues with monofilament needles, and proposed mechanisms of action for these interventions are quite different for acupuncture compared to intramuscular or dry needling. Beyond my objection to adding intramuscular and/or dry needling to the acupuncturist and eastern medicine practitioner scope of practice, I am resolute in asserting that this profession should NOT be the only one in Washington State authorized to use these interventions. It is clear that medical and osteopathic physicians have the training, expertise, and knowledge to safely use intramuscular/dry needling to treat their patients. It is also clear that physical therapists are adequately educated and use intramuscular/dry needling safely and legally in many, many jurisdictions throughout the United States. It is reasonable to presume, in due time and following due process of the legislature and/or Department of Health, that there is a possibility for intramuscular/dry needling to be codified as part of the physical therapist scope of practice in Washington State. Pleased do NOT add \"dry needling\" or \"intramuscular needling\" to the practice act for acupuncturists and eastern medicine practitioners in Washington State. MORE IMPORTANTLY , if the sunrise review decides to include these terms and techniques in the scope of practice for acupuncturists and eastern medicine practitioners, then it should also clearly describe that other professions may also perform these techniques if they are provided for within relevant practice acts. Thank you for considering my position on this matter. Feel free to contact me by phone or email should you have questions, concerns, or wish to discuss the matter further. David B. Bond, PT, DPT Appendices - Page A- 265My name is Matthew Stuckey, I'm a licensed acupuncturist in Bellingham. I wanted to shine a light on the current work acupuncturists have been doing, in particular, for chemical dependency. In 2013, I worked at Wai`anae Coast Community Mental Health Center for their chemical dependency program on O'ahu using the auricular acupuncture protocol developed by the Nationa l Acupuncture Detoxification Association (NADA). I currently use the same acupuncture protocol for Swinomish Health Services at Didgwalic Wellness Center, which runs a Methadone program in Skagit County. At Unity Care Northwest in Bellingham, one of Bellin gham's community health centers, I work with patients in chronic pain. I've been asked by the Chemical Dependency counselor and head of Behavioral Health to collaborate with their new chemical dependency Suboxone program. In all of these locations, acupuncturists like myself have been sought out to provide care by willing and eager physicians, nurses, and counselors. All over the country, both in-patient and out-patient chemical dependency clinics have been using acupuncture for decades. Patients continue to say that it helps them. We all need to employ whatever methods we can in this addiction crisis. As acupuncturists, we have a role as well. Matthew Stuckey, Lac I write on behalf of Washington State Orthopedic Association where we have been made aware that there is a pending sunrise review regarding expansion of the scope of practice acupuncturist/traditional Chinese medicine providers. We would like to comment on this review and express some concerns that the proposed expansion raises for us. We don't believe that acupuncturists are fully trained in anatomy physiology, and pharmacology. We therefore feel that the proposed expansion of scope to include injecting pharmacologic substances (local anesthetic) may put patients at risk. We also don't believe that acupuncturist are well trained in physical examination and diagnosis nor do they have access to the broad spectrum of diagnostic tools that are used in modern medicine. Without training in and an understanding of the broad spectrum of human disease, It is very concerning that acupuncturist are requesting expanding their scope to include diagnosing and treating disease. The concern is obviously for missing important diagnoses or making erroneous diagnoses which may lead to improper or delayed treatment. While we recognize the value of alternative therapies as part of the spectrum of care, we believe the current proposals extend the scope of \"traditional Chinese medicine\" into very much \"non traditional\" territory which could cause unintended harm to patients. Nicholas Rajacich I have c oncerns regarding the proposed Sunrise proposal outlining the statutory criteria in chapter 18.120 RCW and proposed change to the acupuncture and eastern medicine practitioner scope of practice . The problem identified in the applicant report which is to clarify the definition of acupuncture is not needed and it appears the request is aimed specifically to exclude other health professionals from preforming care that is within their scope of pract ice. Where the definition of and proposal tries to claim needles are only to be used by acupuncturist. I do not believe the scope of practice should be used to regulate the instruments used but rather provide a Appendices - Page A- 266framework for the practice itself. Therefore, the definition of acupuncture is not needed to add the substances or how the current education and training for the health profession adequately prepares practitioners to perform the new skill or service (refer to RCW 18.120.030(4)). The current proposal cites clarifications of existing scope of practice. All of which establishes a limited criteria covered only with the completion of a master's level training provided by Washington states' approved acupuncture schools such as Bastyr University and othe rs. The education ranges from 1,500 hours minimum to over 2,000 hours of training depending on the area of focus within the acupuncture and Eastern Medicine profession. A licensed acupuncturist must be board certified with the NCCAOM to practice in WA Stat e This proposal applies to changes made after 1983 and is clearly targeted to support WEAMA attempts to reverse the decision by the Nursing Care Quality Assurance Commission (NCQAC) to authorize the procedure of acupuncture into the Nurse Practitioner sc ope of practice based on the same criteria of training used by MD Acupuncturist established prior to 1983 to intentionally avoid conflict with the AMA while suppressing and reversing the decision by NCQAC approved in November of 2017. The proposal regard ing the nature and duration of training should be restructured to account for Medical Doctors (MD)s who already include acupuncture within their scope of practice, Nurse Practitioners (NP) and Physician Assistants (PA) who have already completed and meet t he requirements for licensure in the State of Washington, and have completed an additional 300 hours of a cupuncture training (which is the same criteria used for MDs) to safely perform the clinical procedure of acupuncture therapy using Chinese Medicine t heory . The educational requirement cited in the WEAMA proposal only reflects the standards of training for candidates with no training in western medicine , acupuncture and Chinese Herbal therapy, which accounts for the criteria for a minimum of 1,500 hou rs and 2,000 hours of training and accounts for a 3 -4 year training requirement. The education and training currently available to Nurse Practitioners in WA State to meet the approved 300 hour ac upuncture training requirements established by the NCQAC in 2017, includes the same level of training in theory included in the Master's degree program for Licensed Acupuncturist and over 100 hours of clinical and practicum experience to insure clinical competency, is accredited by the ANCC, and requires 18 months of training which is over 50% of the time required to complete a Master's degree in Acupuncture. In addition, continuing education opportunities remain available to graduates that will meet the same criteria for license renewal and Continuing Education ( CE) credits required to renew licensure as an NP. The training program currently available to NP in WA State is approved and accredited by the ANCC for 360 CE credits with the attached curriculum and training criteria. The nature and duration of the tr aining includes a substantial amount of supervised practicum training and 100 hours of clinical observation by a licensed acupuncturist to insure competency and is required for training certification. Appendices - Page A- 267Based on the existing training program and the criter ia already established by the NCQAC, it is my opinion that the WEAMA proposal for a sunrise review be either changed to reflect and acknowledge the decisions of the NCQAC or revoke d.
