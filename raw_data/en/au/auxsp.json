Herbal medicine has evolved from a time when many foods and beverages were known to supported human health. How do I know the herbs are safe? Seed to Shelf consciousness is an approach to tracking herbs and maintaining accountability from the origin as seeds, through maturation, harvesting, processing and testing, until the herbs are delivered to you. Emily Smith Acupuncture employs herbal formulas from companies that follow safety processes to assure purity, potency, quality, and ultimately, clinical efficacy. Steps to Wellness Symptomatic Care During this stage, the primary aim of treatment is alleviating the symptoms causing you to seek treatment. Once your symptoms are relieved you will move on to Corrective Care. Think of your body as a garden. In this stage, we are removing the weeds (symptoms) so that cultivating and replenishing the soil (physiology) and plants can happen. Corrective Care In order to restore your health, we must collaborate to determine the underlying cause of your condition, beyond simply addressing the symptoms. This means assessing the root of your condition\u2014continuing the body as a garden analogy, we cultivate the soil for the success of new seeds and prevent the return of the weeds. Using appropriate methods and formulas, the roots of the weeds are extracted and the roots of healthy plants thrive in rich soils. Corrective care reveals what has been contributing to the symptoms so you feel empowered to maintain the long term health of your garden. Prophylactic Care The final phase of your treatment includes Maintenance Therapy. Your doctor will prescribe tonics and other formulas to keep your immune system strong and resilient. The final phase of treatment is ongoing. After all, you will understand what contributes to your sustainable self-care and vibrant health so consistent care is less important than your ongoing self-care with intermittent support. In our analogy, the soil of our reclaimed garden is well fertilized and aerated to facilitate physiological function, mental clarity and sustainable energy. Restoring balance to your overall health prevents the return of symptoms (weeds) and represents a healthy foundation upon which you thrive. Supplements While many people take numerous supplements and industry marketing and \"supportive evidence\" for their claims, simple alive foods and beverages can serve us all well. In the event that particular essential nutrients are lacking, the temporary use of a few supplements can vastly improve some troublesome conditions. Because there are so many varieties of supplements available, particular care with regards to quality and dosage cannot be over stated. We will review your lab work and/or symptoms to help you decide which supplements may be most beneficial. "}
