Let food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food.Hippocrates Background Of Naturopathic Medicine Week As we are talking about Naturopathic Medicine Week, we must cover the history of naturopathic medicine or Naturopathy. It also refers to a unique form of alternative medicine. Talking about the etymological definition, the word, 'naturopathy' consists of two different words- 'natura' and 'pathos'. The word, 'natura' is a Latin word and it means 'root for birth'. On the other side, 'pathos' that is actually a Greek word refers to 'natural healing'. Hippocrates is known as the 'Father of Medicine'. He started practicing these natural remedies when the term did not even exist. Naturopathic has a very inextricable relation with the Natural Cure movement that took place in the 19th century in Europe. It was in the 1880s when Thomas Allinson advocated 'Hygienic Medicine' in Scotland. He started promoting exercise and a [natural diet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturopathy) and he also encouraged people so that they could avoid tobacco as well as overwork. It was in 1895 when John Scheel coined the term; 'naturopathy' and then Benedict Lust purchased this. Later in 1902, Lust actually founded the American School of Naturopathy in New York. Reports say that during the 1800s, the concept of Naturopathy came to the United States from Germany.
