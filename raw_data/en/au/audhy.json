Some of the most common vaccination-related misconc eptions are addressed here. The \"Overloaded Immune System\" Misconception Perhaps the most common misconception is that a chi ld's immune system can be \"overloaded\" if the child receives multiple vaccines at once. This concern first began to appea r as the recommended childhood immunization schedul e expanded to include more vaccines, and as some vaccines were co mbined into a single shot. However, studies have re peatedly demonstrated that the recommended vaccines are no m ore likely to cause adverse effects when given in c ombination than when they are administered separately. Some parents decide to \"spread out\" the time period during which their children receive vaccinations \" just in case\" this misconception is accurate. However, there is no sci entific evidence to support this approach, and dela ying vaccinations puts children at risk of contracting preventable disease s. The \"Disappeared Diseases\" Misconception Some people assume that because diseases like polio have disappeared from the United States, it's no l onger necessary to vaccinate children against them. However, polio is still widespread in other parts of the world, and c ould easily begin re-infecting unprotected individuals if it were re-introduced to the country. Another example is measles, which has become rare in the United States: U.S. outbreaks of the disease have occurred when Americans traveling to countries where measle s remains widespread brought the disease back with them. With adequate v accination rates, most of these types of outbreaks can be prevented. But if vaccination rates drop, \"imported\" cases of prevent able diseases can begin to spread again. In the ear ly 2000s, for example, low vaccination rates in England allowed measles to bec ome endemic once again after earlier vaccination ra tes had halted its continuous transmission in the country. The \"More Vaccinated Than Unvaccinated People Get S ick\" Misconception When there's an outbreak of a disease that's rare f or a given area, such as measles in the United Stat es, unvaccinated people aren't the only ones at risk. Because no vaccinatio n is 100% effective, some vaccinated individuals wi ll get the disease as well. In fact, during an outbreak, the number of vaccinat ed individuals who get sick will often outnumber th e unvaccinated people who get sick. This, however, is not because vaccines ar e ineffective, but because there are so few people who avoid vaccination in the first place. Look at the numbers for a hypothet ical outbreak: You have a group of 500 people who have been expose d to an outbreak of a rare disease. Of those 500 pe ople, 490 have been vaccinated; 10 have not. Different vaccines provide different rates of protection, but in this case, l et's assume that 98 of every 100 people who are vaccinated will successfully dev elop immunity against the disease. When exposed to the outbreak, all 10 of the unvacci nated individuals get the disease. What about the 4 90 who were vaccinated? Based on the assumption of 98 of every 100 people d eveloping successful immunity (leaving two of the 1 00 unprotected), about 10 of the 490 vaccinated individuals will get the d isease\u2014the same as the number of unvaccinated indiv iduals. Those numbers, however, don't take into account the percentage of vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals who got sick. Of those who fell ill, 10 had been vaccinated and 10 h ad not. But the 10 who had been vaccinated are only (10 / 490) = 2% of the individuals who had been vaccinated in the populati on of 500. The 10 who hadn't been vaccinated are (10 / 10) = 100% of those who weren't vaccinated. The final results of the ou tbreak, therefore, look like this: Population size: 500 Vaccinated individuals: 490 Unvaccinated individuals: 10 Percentage of vaccinated individuals who fell ill: 2% Percentage of unvaccinated individuals who fell ill : 100% The \"Hygiene and Better Nutrition Are Responsible f or the Reduction in Disease Rates, Not Vaccination\" Misconception Improved hygiene and nutrition, among other factors , can certainly lower the incidence of some disease s. Data documenting the number of cases of a disease before and after the i ntroduction of a vaccine, however, demonstrate that vaccines are overwhelmingly responsible for the largest drops in disease rates. Measles cases, for example, numbere d anywhere from 300,000 to 800,000 a year in the United States betw een 1950 and 1963, when a newly licensed measles va ccine went into widespread use. By 1965, U.S. measles cases were be ginning a dramatic drop. In 1968 about 22,000 cases were reported (a drop of 97.25% from the height of 800,000 cases in just three years); by 1998, the number of cases ave raged about 100 per year or less. A similar post-vaccination drop occur red with most diseases for which vaccines are avail able. Perhaps the best evidence that vaccines, and not hy giene and nutrition, are responsible for the sharp drop in disease and death rates is chickenpox. If hygiene and nutrition alone were enough to prevent infectious diseases, chicke npox rates would have dropped long before the introduction of the varicel la vaccine, which was not available until the mid-1 990s. Instead, the number of chickenpox cases in the United States in the ear ly 1990s, before the vaccine was introduced in 1995 , was about four million a year. By 2004, the disease incidence had dropped by about 85%. The \"Natural Immunity Is Better Than Vaccine-acquir ed Immunity\" Misconception Some people argue that the immunity gained from sur viving a natural infection provides better protecti on than that provided by vaccines. While it's true that natural immunity lasts longer in some cases than vaccine-induced immunity can, the risks of natural infection outweigh the risks of immunization for every recomm ended vaccine. For example, wild measles infection causes encephal itis (inflammation of the brain) for one in 1,000 i nfected individuals, and, for every 1,000 reported measles cases, two individuals die. The combination MMR (measles, mumps, and rube lla) vaccine, however, results in encephalitis or a severe allerg ic reaction only once in every million vaccinated individuals, while preventing measles infection. The benefits of vaccine-acquired immunity extraordinarily outweigh the serious risk s of natural infection, even in cases where boosters are required to maintain im munity. Additionally, the Hib (Haemophilus Influenzae type b) and tetanus vaccines actually provide more effective immunity than natural infection. Last update 10 Feb 2014 "}
