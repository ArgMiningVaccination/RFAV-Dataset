Learn More We required you to arrive at least a 2 days before your retreat so you have a chance to acclimatise to the altitude of Cusco. Many people feel the effects of the altitude. If you arrive the day of your retreat, we will not be able to give you Ayahuasca and you will have to change your retreat for the next available date. Unfortunately a refund will not be possible. We want to prevent people getting altitude sickness while under the effect of Ayahuasca as this is a serious health risk. You must book your own hotel room for the night between the acclimatisation day and the day of the retreat. We can recommend several places that are able to take care of everything including transfer from the airport to the hotel. On the retreat day we will look to meet at [Plaza Nazarenas](https://goo.gl/maps/4wSt3BeRNeA7HYkZ9) at 9:30am and from there we will travel by shuttle bus to the retreat centre. Please eat breakfast based on juice and fruits (NO bread and dairy products). As Ayahuasca is a potent form of medicine it can occasionally have interactions with other medications or drugs. We therefore recommend that you find a natural way to detoxify your system at least two weeks before the start of the retreat. Following the recommended diet is essential to your safety. The cleaner your body is, from the list of items above, the less \"purging\" you will need to do in order to clean your body. Practicing dietary discipline is seen, from a shamanic perspective, as showing respect to the medicine and is believed to lead to more insight and less difficulty in the session. For your spiritual and mental preparation before your retreat, we recommend you meditate, pray, do yoga or practice any disciplines familiar to you from your own religion, practice, or faith. If you do not have a religious practice, try an honesty prayer in the morning and at night, it can be very helpful! As the founder of Etnikas says, you can have the best shamans in the Universe (Christ, Buddha, Krishna,) conducting ceremonies for you, but if you don't want to change, nothing will happen. No one but you can change your destiny, not even God. He is the father not boss. Only you have the power to change your destiny. You, in fact, are your own best shaman in the universe. The best attitude to approach the retreat with is to be as positive as you can. The right attitude should include honesty, love, patience, humility, respect, courage and a strong mental / spiritual determination. Approaching the retreat with these values will result in a much more fruitful experience. When you pray, do not ask for miracles to mysteriously occur. Instead, ask for opportunities to create miracles with your own hands. To enhance the healing and cleansing of your body healers recommend a healthy diet for two weeks following your retreat. This includes avoiding; All retreats are held in what is referred to as 'Noble Silence'. We work in 'Noble Silence' to allow for a greater degree of concentration allowing internal work to be addressed without distraction. You will only be able to speak during the times of group discussion, however, you are welcome to talk to the shaman on an individual level when you feel it necessary. You are also welcome to talk to the assistant at any stage should you need help with any matter. We ask that you respect the noble silence for the sake of others. Many people come to our retreat with a serious intention to work on their healing. Our 3 day ayahuasca retreats have been developed with both Andes Qero and Amazonian Shipibo Shaman.
