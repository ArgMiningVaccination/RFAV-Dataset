The starting dose will be 1.875ml (0.75 gr of EPA+DHA) and the dose will be doubled on week 2. | Dietary Supplement: Omega-3 Fatty Acids | Children will be administered 3.75ml of the liquid formulation of Nutra Sea HP (containing 1.5 gr of EPA+DHA). The starting dose will be 1.875ml (0.75 gr of EPA+DHA) and the dose will be doubled on week 2. The parents may choose to give this as a single dose or split it to two doses if stomach upset occurs. This formulation is double distilled and has very little fishy taste, which will make it more palatable for children and will make creating a matching placebo a simpler process. Other Name: Nutra Sea HP | Placebo Comparator: Placebo | Children will be administered 3.75ml of the liquid formulation of Placebo. The starting dose will be 1.875ml and the dose will be doubled on week 2. | Dietary Supplement: Placebo | Children will be administered 3.75ml of the liquid formulation of Placebo. The starting dose will be 1.875ml and the dose will be doubled on week 2. The parents may choose to give this as a single dose or split it to two doses if stomach upset occurs. This formulation is double distilled and has very little fishy taste, which will make it more palatable for children and will make creating a matching placebo a simpler process. Other Name: Placebo Comparator - Change From Baseline in the Pervasive Developmental Disorder-Behavioral Inventory (PDDBI) - Autism Composite Score [ Time Frame: Baseline and 24 Weeks ] The PDDBI measures autism symptomology. The autism composite score was used as the primary outcome measure for autism symptom severity. PDDBI Autism Composite Scale Range: Minimum Range = 10 (lower autism symptom severity) Maximum Range = 100 (higher autism symptom severity) The Autism Composite is calculated from the sum of T-scores of the Sensory/Perceptual Approach Behaviours, Ritualisms/Resistance to Change, Social Pragmatic Problems, and Semantic/Pragmatic Problems domains subtracted by the sum of T-scores of the Social Approach Behaviours, and Expressive Language domain then converted into the Autism Composite as a T-score. Mean change between baseline and week 24 is reported. A negative change indicates improvement - Change From Baseline in the Behaviour Assessment System for Children (BASC-2) - Externalizing Problems Composite [ Time Frame: Baseline and 24 Weeks ] The BASC-2 externalizing problems composite measures hyperactivity and aggressive behaviours. Primary domain: Externalizing Problems composite Problems Composite Range: Minimum 10 (lower externalizing problems) Maximum Range: 120 (higher externalizing problems) The Externalizing Problems composite is computed from the sum of t-scores from the hyperactivity and aggression subscales then converted into the externalizing problems composite t-score. Mean change between baseline and week 24 is reported. A negative change indicates improvement. - Number of Participants Classified as Responders by the Clinical Global Impression - Improvement (CGI-I) [ Time Frame: 24 weeks ] The CGI-I is a seven-point scale that provides a clinician rating of global improvement and as such is already inherently a measure of change. It requires the clinician to assess the degree to which the participant's illness has improved or worsened relative to a baseline state before the intervention. Change is rated as: 0- Not assessed - Very Much Improved - Much Improved - Minimally Improved - No Change - Minimally Worse - Much Worse - Very Much Worse Participants are classified as responders if their CGI-I score was 1 or 2 and non-responders for CGI-I scores of 3 to 7. - Change From Baseline in the Vineland Adaptive Behavioral Scales (VABS) - Adaptive Functioning Composite [ Time Frame: Baseline and 24 Weeks ] The VABS is a measure of adaptive behavior in daily settings. Secondary measure domain: The adaptive functioning composite describes an individuals overall functioning Adaptive Behaviour Composite Standard Score Range: Minimum range: 20 (low adaptive functioning) Maximum range: 160 (high adaptive functioning) The adaptive behaviour composite standard score is computed from the sum of standard scores from the communication, daily living skills, socialization and motor skills domains and converted into the adaptive behavior composite standard score. Change in the adaptive behaviour composite standard score from baseline to week 24 is reported. Positive change indicates improvement. - Change From Baseline in the Preschool Language Scale (PLS-4) - Total Language [ Time Frame: Baseline and 24 Weeks ] The PLS-4 is a language measure that provides a global assessment of a child's language functioning abilities, receptive and expressive language. Secondary outcome measure domain: Total language standard score Total Language Standard Score Range: Minimum range: 50 (lower language abilities) Maximum range: 150 (higher language abilities) The total language standard score is computed from a sum of the auditory comprehension and expressive communication standard scores, then converted into the total language standard score. Change of total language standard scores from baseline to week 24 is reported. Positive change indicates improvement Choosing to participate in a study is an important personal decision.

DSM-IV criteria for an autism spectrum disorder, (Autistic disorder, Asperger syndrome or PDD-NOS) will be established by a clinician with expertise with individuals with ASD based on parent interview, Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADO) and Autism Diagnostic Interview (ADI-R) - If already receiving stable non pharmacologic educational, behavioral, dietary and or/ natural health product interventions during the preceding 3 months prior to Screening, will not electively initiate new or modify ongoing interventions for the duration of the study unless the child's condition is worsening or their turn comes up on the treatment waiting list. - Have normal physical examination and laboratory test results at Screening. If abnormal, the finding(s) must be deemed clinically insignificant by the Investigator. - The parents must be able to speak and understand English sufficiently to allow for the completion of all study assessments. Exclusion Criteria: - Patients born prior to 35 weeks gestational age. - Patients with any primary psychiatric diagnosis other than autism at Screening. We are aware the most primary psychiatric disorders are unlikely to be diagnosed in this age group - Patients with a medical history of neurological disease, including, but not limited to, epilepsy/seizure disorder (except simple febrile seizures), movement disorder, tuberous sclerosis, fragile X, and any other known genetic syndromes, or known abnormal MRI/structural lesion of the brain. - Patients with a medical condition that might interfere with the conduct of the study, confound interpretation of the study results, or endanger their own well-being. Patients with evidence or history of malignancy or any significant hematological, endocrine, cardiovascular (including any rhythm disorder), respiratory, renal, hepatic, or gastrointestinal disease, or coagulation have been off pharmacotherapy for less than 6 weeks. - Patients who are participating in another clinical trial - Patients on anticoagulants - Patients who know that they will initiate or change nonpharmacologic interventions during the course of the study. - Patients unable to tolerate venipuncture procedures for blood sampling. - Patients taking Omega-3 supplements who have not discontinued treatment for six weeks prior to entering into the study. - Patients who have allergies to any of the ingredients in omega-3 (study product) or the placebo.
