ACF programs aim to empower families and individuals to increase their economic independence and productivity; encourage strong, healthy, supportive communities that have a positive impact on quality of life and the development of children; create partnerships with front-line service providers, states, localities and tribal communities to identify and implement solutions that transcend traditional program boundaries; improve access to services through planning, reform and integration; and address the needs, strengths and abilities of vulnerable populations including people with developmental disabilities, refugees and migrants.
