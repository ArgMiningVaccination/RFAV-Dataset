THE FIRST 100 YEARS In 1856, Amos Kendall, a postmaster general during two presidential administrations, donated two acres of his estate in northeast Washington, D.C. to establish a school and housing for 12 deaf and six blind students. The following year, Kendall persuaded Congress to incorporate the new school, which was called the Columbia Institution for the Instruction of the Deaf and Dumb and Blind. Edward Miner Gallaudet, the son of Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet, founder of the first s chool for deaf students in the United States, became the new school's superintendent. Congress authorized the institution to confer college degrees in 1864, and President Abraham Lincoln signed the bill into law. Gallaudet was made president of the institu tion, including the college, which that year had eight students enrolled. He presided over the first commencement in June 1869 when three young men received diplomas. Their diplomas were signed by President Ulysses S. Grant, and to this day the diplomas of all Gallaudet graduates are signed by the presiding U.S. president. In 1894 the name of the college portion of the institution was changed to Gallaudet College in honor of Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet and through an act of Congress in 1954, the entire institu tion became known as Gallaudet College. A TIME OF EXPANSION In 1969, President Lyndon Johnson signed an act to create the Model Secondary School for the Deaf (MSSD). That same year, the secretary of the U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare and Gallaudet President Leonard Elstad signed an agreement authorizing the establishment and operation of MSSD on the Gallaudet campus. A year later, President Richard Nixon signed the bill that authorized the establishment of Kendall Demonstration Elementary School. Today, the two schools are part of Gallaudet's Laurent Clerc National Deaf Education Center, which is devoted to the creation and dissemination of educational opportunities for deaf students nationwide. By an act of the U.S. Congress, Gallaudet was granted university status in October 1986. Two years later, in March 1988, the Deaf President Now (DPN) movement led to the appointment of the University's first deaf president, Dr. I. King Jordan, '70 and the Board of Trustees' first deaf chair, Philip B ravin, '66. Since then, DPN has become synonymous with self -determination and empowerment for deaf and hard of hearing people everywhere. ACCREDITATION HISTORY OF GALLAUDET 7 In the 1990s, a generous contribution from the W.K. Kellogg Foundation enabled the University to construct the Kellogg Conference Hotel at Gallaudet University, which has become a popular venue for meetings, seminars, receptions, and other events for both on- and off -campus groups. The new millennium has brought events such as the Deaf Way II festival that attracted 10,000 deaf, hard of hearing, and hearing people from around the world; the opening of the technology -rich I. King Jordan Student Academic Center; and, thanks to the generosity of James Lee Sorenson, chair of Sorenson Development, Inc., the James Lee Soren son Language and Communication Center, a unique facility that provides an inclusive learning environment totally compatible with the visu -centric \"deaf way of being.\" The University's undergraduate students can choose from more than 40 majors leading to ba chelor of arts or bachelor of science degrees. A small number of hearing undergraduate students -up to five percent of an entering class -are also admitted to the University each year. Graduate programs at Gallaudet are open to deaf, hard of hearing, and hearing students and offer certificates and master of arts, master of science, doctoral, and specialist degrees in a variety of fields involving professional service to deaf and hard of hearing people. Through the University Career center, students receive internships that provide a wealth of experiential learning opportunities. Recent internships were offered at Merrill Lynch, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, National Institutes of Health, and the World Bank. Students also benefit from an array of services provided by such campus units as the Burstein Leadership Institute, Language Planning Institute, Hearing and Speech Center, Cochlear Implant Education Center, and the Center for International Programs and Services. Today, Gallaudet is viewed by deaf and hearing people alike as a primary resource for all things related to deaf people, including educational and career opportunities; open communication and visual learning; deaf history and culture; American Sign Language; and the impact of technology on the deaf community. The Gallaudet University Mission Statement Gallaudet University, federally chartered in 1864, is a bilingual, diverse, multicultural institution of higher education that ensures the intellectual and professional advancement of deaf and hard of hearing individuals through American Sign Language and English. Gallaudet maintains a proud tradition of research and scholarly activity and prepares its graduates for career opportunities in a highly competitive, technologi cal, and rapidly changing world. The Vision of Gallaudet University Gallaudet University will build upon its rich history as the world's premier higher education institution serving deaf and hard of hearing people to become the university of first choice f or the most qualified, diverse group of deaf and hard of hearing students in the world, as well as hearing students pursuing careers related to deaf and hard of hearing people. Gallaudet will empower its graduates with the knowledge and practical skills vi tal to achieving personal and professional success in the changing local and global communities in which they live and work. Gallaudet will also strive to become the leading international resource for research, innovation and outreach related to deaf and hard of hearing people. Gallaudet will achieve these outcomes through: A bilingual learning environment, featuring American Sign Language and English, that provides full access for all students to learning and communication A commitment to excellence in le arning and student service A world -class campus in the nation's capital Creation of a virtual campus that expands Gallaudet's reach to a broader audience of visual learners An environment in which research can grow, develop, and improve the lives and knowl edge of all deaf and hard of hearing people worldwide The Gallaudet Credo Gallaudet's Vision Statement expresses what the University aspires to become and achieve as the world's premier academic institution for deaf and hard of hearing people. Implicit in our vision are core values that serve as guiding principles for the way members of the campus community teach, study, work and live. The Gallaudet Credo identifies and realizes those core values. The Gallaudet University campus community includes students , faculty, teachers and staff, all of whom share certain common goals and values that we all believe enrich our academic environment. The community's primary goal is to prepare students to be informed, literate, productive MISSION AND GOALS 8 and responsible citizens. In purs uit of this goal, community members pledge to uphold the following values: We believe that education is a dominant influence on our lives and recognize that learning is a lifelong quest. Therefore we will practice academic and personal integrity and work to create a positive and welcoming environment that is open to the free exchange of ideas among members of our community. We believe that every person should be treated with civility and that our community is strengthened by the broad diversity of its mem bers. Therefore, we will promote and applaud behaviors that support the dignity of individuals and groups and are respectful of others' opinions. We will especially discourage behaviors and attitudes that disrespect the diversity of individuals and groups for any reason including religion, race, ethnicity, gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, hearing status, or language and communication preference. We believe that as members of the Gallaudet community we are the recipients of a proud and rich heri tage, as well as contributors to and benefactors of our institution's bright future. Therefore, we will strive to bring credit to our community and ensure that the institution flourishes and succeeds in its mission. Federally chartered in 1864, Gallaudet University is an institution of higher learning that promotes the intellectual and professional advancement of deaf and hard -of-hearing students from diverse and multicultural backgrounds in a bilingual environment using both A merican Sign Language (ASL) and English. The mission of Undergraduate Studies at Gallaudet University is to be the premier center of learning for deaf and hard -of-hearing students. Our graduates will become respected members and leaders of their communitie s throughout the United States and the World. Undergraduate Studies at Gallaudet University provide all students with a rigorous and integrative education that promotes competence and in- depth knowledge in both the General Studies and major curricula. General Studies courses are predominantly taught as thematic interdisciplinary course, addressing the Gallaudet University Student Learning Outcomes . Major -level courses continue to expand on these five learning outcomes and also provide students with discipline -specific competence, preparing them for competitive careers and/or graduate education. Gallaudet University was founded with the unique purpose of providing visually accessible hi gher education for deaf and hard of hearing students. As such, Gallaudet has always been a bilingual institution with instruction taking place through American Sign Language and English. In 2007, the Board of Trustees affirmed Gallaudet's commitment to ASL /English bilingual education through the University's mission statement. The mission commits the University to fostering an intentional, inclusive and supportive environment designed to develop students' academic discourse, critical thinking and career preparation. Gallaudet's bilingual educational environment is founded on the following four principles: Principle #1: Access Since its founding in 1864, the cornerstone of the educational design at Gallaudet University has been direct, visually accessible communication among all participants in academic settings. The use of two visually accessible languages - ASL and written English - provides the most universally effective means of direct communication for all Gallaudet students. Principle #2: Inclusion Gallaudet University welcomes academically qualified students from diverse language and educational backgrounds and abilities. Typically, Gallaudet students begin their higher education with varying degrees of proficiency in ASL and English, similar to the r ange of language abilities seen among students in bilingual universities throughout the world. Learning opportunities inside and outside of the classroom guide students toward developing their full linguistic potential. These opportunities include classes and support services for improving students' skills in signed , written and spoken communication . Principle #3 Academic Discourse As it applies to Gallaudet, bilingualism does not mean that students have fewer opportunities to learn and use English; rathe r, just the opposite is true. Through an intentional and integrated use of ASL and English in the classroom, students are provided with multiple approaches to develop UNDERGRADUATE STUDIES MISSION BILINGUAL EDUCATION 9 academic discourse, an essential component of lifelong learning and success in the workfo rce. Research shows bilingualism offers a significant intellectual resource, providing students with increased cognitive flexibility and self-awareness of language use. Thus, the bilingual environment at Gallaudet provides a richer context for university -level interaction. Principle #4: Social and Cultural Resource In addition to cognitive benefits, bilingualism supports personal development by enhancing students' social and cultural experiences. By being a member of a Gallaudet's bilingual community, stude nts enjoy opportunities to form lasting social bonds with their deaf, hard of hearing and hearing peers. Rather than leading toward isolation, bilingualism at Gallaudet extends the reach of students' life experiences, especially as the use of a sign language facilitates participation in deaf communities throughout the world, opening access to a greater global awareness. Communication on Campus Gallaudet University is committed to creating a climate of respect with regards to communication on campus. While no formal policies dictate communication behaviors, two key principles underpin a climate of respect. Principle #1: Welcome and support new and emerging signers New and emerging signers are welcomed as full members of the Gallaudet community, and will be supported in their efforts toward improving their ASL skills. Principle#2: Ongoing commitment to improve All members of the community commit to improve communication skills in ASL in order to create a barrier - free, visually accessible environment through out campus. Classroom Communication: Undergraduate: Instruction at Gallaudet takes advantage of cutting -edge technology, which allows a language -rich learning environment. Students and faculty strive to communicate as clearly as possible, modeling and de veloping habits of academic discourse in ASL and English. Graduate: The ASL proficiency requirements of each graduate program vary. Check individual programs for information relating to ASL proficiency. On the whole, the Graduate School encourages clear and accessible communication for all through the refinement of academic discourse in ASL and English. American Sign Language Support Services: Undergraduate: Gallaudet University New Signers may enroll in the American Sign Language Program , and will also receive support in ASL and General Studies courses to develop their ASL proficiency. Students in these classes are eligible to receive tutoring in ASL skills through the Tutorial Instructional Program . Students may receive services from ASL Diagnostic and Evaluation Services . Graduate: Consult individual graduate programs for ASL proficiency requirements. Students may receive services from ASL Diagnostic and Evaluation Services . English Text Support Services Students may request captioning services f or classes from Academic Technology. See Captioning Services in the Services and Activities chapter of this catalog. Gallaudet University is a unique institution. Charter ed by the United States Congress in 1864 with the mission of offering higher education to deaf and hard of hearing individuals, it has since become a global leader of a distinctive community. Gallaudet's charge is even more important now. Just as the popul ation of the nation has changed and continues to change, so too the population of deaf and hard of hearing individuals has changed and continues to change. Deafness is diverse and dynamic. Deaf and hard of hearing persons include people of all experiences, backgrounds, races, ethnicities, and religions. Given its mission, Gallaudet University has a responsibility to an increasingly diverse deaf and hard of hearing population. Although every university must address diversity to survive, Gallaudet University must be prepared to do more. Deaf and hard of hearing individuals were long denied equal opportunity, solely because they were deaf or hard of hearing. Such injustice was often compounded by further discrimination on the basis of race, gender, and other a spects of personal identity. Building upon more than a century of traditions, Gallaudet University will take an active role in providing genuine DIVERSITY GUIDELINES 10 social justice to all deaf and hard of hearing persons. Gallaudet not only acknowledges the problems of the pa st and responds to the practical circumstances of the present, but also understands that our shared future is guided by basic principles of fairness, mutual respect, and commitment to each other. The University will continue to strive to make its ideals co ncrete. Gallaudet will reach out, in the United States and around the world, to deaf and hard of hearing persons everywhere. Deafness knows no borders. Gallaudet University as an institution embraces diversity. Deaf and hard of hearing individuals are bes t served by reaching deeply and widely into their experiences. Just as they seek to be heard, so must we listen to those with different views and beliefs. A university has an obligation to be a place where all views can be shared freely and any belief can be discussed respectfully, allowing the exchange of ideas to flourish. Accordingly, Gallaudet will integrate diversity into every aspect of its operations. This statement on diversity is only part of an ongoing process in which all members of the universit y participate. Gallaudet's excellence and survival depends on respecting, honoring and embracing the diversity that exists within the university community. The guidelines below are designed to frame university -wide efforts on diversity. Guidelines The Gall audet University Board of Trustees recognizes that the pursuit of excellence is intertwined with a commitment to diversity at all levels. To advance toward excellence in diversity, we instruct the administration to implement these guidelines which address three broad areas of action: 1) student diversity and learning; 2) faculty diversity and teaching, research and service and 3) a strong, safe and just campus community. The Board of Trustees expects that the administration will use these guidelines and wil l develop additional means of accomplishing these goals: The Gallaudet student body will be reflective of the different ways that deaf and hard of hearing individuals live in society. The University will actively seek to recruit students of color, and students with different communicative pursuits as well as other dimensions of diversity and will endeavor to provide a supportive environment on campus for all students. In the next century, deafness as a condition will change. Our plans for the universi ty cannot be limited to within our national borders; we must broaden our outlook to include deafness on a global scale, to welcome individuals from societies outside the US and around the world. The education of young deaf and hard of hearing children has always been a part of Gallaudet University's mission. Gallaudet will continue to promote students' fundamental skills including communication, literacy, science, mathematics and technology competence. Gallaudet is also committed to contributing to the wel l-being of our students, including strong emotional lives, an appreciation for cultural diversity, a sense of safety and justice, and support for their different life goals. The University is responsible for creating environments that nurture the developme nt of young children into adults, and will recruit and support teachers whose skills make these environments possible. Gallaudet faculty will be recruited on the basis of excellence in scholarship and teaching. The University will endeavor to support the activities of faculty members toward this goal in a variety of ways, including but not limited to: creating post -doctoral fellowships for young deaf and hard of hearing scholars; providing institutional support for faculty research and for relationships wi th research bodies within and outside of the university; promoting professional development, including efforts to improve pedagogy; and recognizing academic service toward these goals. Gallaudet's commitment to excellence and diversity should extend to the recruitment and retention of students; recruitment, selection and professional development of faculty and administrators; and the development of a pool of potential deaf and hard of hearing candidates for faculty positions at Gallaudet and elsewhere. Gallaudet recognizes that its students and faculty are supported by a broad network of staff and other support personnel, and will endeavor to promote diversity among all staff and support personnel, as their influence and contribution in all aspects of the campus are broad and meaningful. Gallaudet recognizes a responsibility to gather and evaluate data showing both the progress in diversity that has been made and the work that is still to be done. Gallaudet will focus especially on generating data about the deaf and hard of hearing that does not exist elsewhere. 11 Welcome to Gallaudet University!

Students who do not attend International Business Registration or che ck in with RSIA before the last day of the add/drop period will be encumbered and not be permitted to register until the following semester. 23 Full Course of Study A full course of study means 18 credits per semester for English Language Institute (ELI) st udents, 12 credits for undergraduate students, and 9 credits for graduate students. *If an international student drops below a full course of study without prior approval from RSIA, it will be reported to the USCIS through SEVIS and the student will be con sidered \"out of status.\" The student may apply to USCIS for reinstatement only if the violation resulted from \"circumstances beyond his or her control.\" Acceptable reasons for applying for reinstatement, as specified by USCIS, include \"serious injury or i llness, closure of the institution, or natural disaster.\" International students are not permitted to audit courses unless it is in addition to an already established full course load. International students unable to complete a full course of study in a t imely manner may apply through RSIA for a program extension. Students must apply 30 days before the completion date on their Form I- 20 or DS -2019. Once a student consults with RSIA about the need for a program extension, RSIA will ask the student's academi c advisor for endorsement of the student's request. A student may be able to enroll for fewer credit hours if she/he: Is in the final semester of the course of study and does not need to enroll full time to meet degree requirements. Is taking all available courses to meet graduation requirements. Is in the first academic year and is having difficulty with the English language or reading requirements. Is in the first academic year and is unfamiliar with American teaching methods. Has been advised to drop a c ourse because of improper course level placement. Has specially documented medical conditions. *Important Note : Only the Designated School Official (DSO) or Responsible Officer (RO) can authorize a reduced credit load. Academic and ELI advisors do NOT have this authority. Online Courses The use of online courses is an integral part of most universities' academic curriculum. However, U.S. federal regulations limit the number of online courses that an F -1 student can count towards a full -time course load dur ing a required semester. F -1 and J -1 students are required to maintain a full course of study that leads to the attainment of a specific educational or professional objective. F-1 students can count only one online class (3 credits) per semester toward the full course of study requirement. This means, for example, that if an undergraduate student is enrolled for 12 credits, only 3 may be online credits (three 3 -credit courses = 9 credits in class + one 3 -credit course online = 12 credits). However, if the student is taking more than 12 credits, she/he may take additional credits online (9 credits in class + 3 credits online = 12 [full course of study requirement met] + 6 additional credits online = 18 total credits). A student who takes 6 credits in class and 6 credits online would be in violation of the full course of study requirement and would lose his/her F -1 status and have to apply for reinstatement. International students in their last semester who have only one course left to take must physically take that course on campus, a regulation governing F -1 students. J-1 students cannot use online or distance education classes to satisfy the full course of study requirements. All classes a J -1 student --undergraduate or graduate --registers to take require physical classroom attendance. Class Attendance Policy To maintain legal status, international students are responsible for regular attendance in all classes in which they are offic ially enrolled. The University's class attendance policy can be found at the link: Class Attendance Policy It is the student's responsibility to notify instructors of any situation that causes him/her to miss class. The student is to notify the instructor through official University email; the student is also required to check email frequently for communication from instructors or RSIA. Communication from a personal email account is not acceptable. USCIS and the Department of State require the University to report any international student in breach of the attendance policy. The University Faculty is bound by federal regulations to report to RSIA if a student stops going to class for two weeks or more without a compelling reason. RSIA, in turn, is required to report the student to 24 SEVIS within 21 days of when the student ceased attending class. Before RSIA reports to SEVIS, the student and the Academic Advisor will be contacted via em ail to ascertain the circumstances for the classroom absence. If there is no response from the student within five (5) working days, the student's immigration status (F -1/J-1) will automatically be terminated Grading Policy As long as an international stu dent is registered, attending all classes and meeting Gallaudet University's academic standards, the student is considered to be maintaining status and making normal progress. A student placed on Academic Suspension will no longer be considered enrolled in full-time study or pursuing an educational objective, and therefore not maintaining status. A student placed on Academic Probation or Suspension who is not able to complete his or her program by the completion date may not be eligible for an extension of stay, unless there is a compelling academic or medical reason to support the extension request.

It is the policy of Gallaudet University that the administration must collect all amounts due under promissory notes. Failure to satisfy the financial obligations spelled out in the pro missory note may result in the administration's turning the student account over to a collection agency. Furthermore, the administration will deny the student future registrations and withhold grades, transcripts, and degrees until full payment is received . Student Financial Responsibility and Student Aid The University recognizes its role in fostering personal initiative, planning, and responsibility in financial affairs as an integral part of the educational process. The administration believes each stude nt has the primary responsibility for arranging financing and payment of his or her charges. Each student will, therefore, be held responsible for his or her bill. Gallaudet University maintains an Office of Financial Aid to make every effort possible to p rovide financial aid to any deserving student eligible to attend the Institution. This aid may be in the form of scholarships, grants -in-aid, loans, or part -time employment. Further, this office provides assistance to help the student as much as possible i n his or her application for funds available from federal government programs, from state vocational rehabilitation offices, and from other agencies and organizations. Financial Appeals Students who believe that the inability to pay off their previous prom issory notes is due to a rare, extraordinary circumstance (e.g., unexpected major medical emergency and expense) may appeal to the administration for additional time to pay off their balance for fall and spring semesters. Additional information concerning the appeal procedures is available from the Student Financial Services office. Students must understand that submitting an appeal form is no guarantee that it will be approved. Those whose appeals are turned down will be requested to leave the University u ntil their debts are paid in full. Chapel Hall, Room G02 Web: Financial Aid Email: financial.aid@gallaudet.edu Gallaudet Uni versity makes every effort to provide financial aid to students who are able to demonstrate that they are in need of assistance to continue their education on a postsecondary level. With the exception of grant- in-aid and Gallaudet scholarships, (which are limited to regular full -time, degree- seeking students), financial aid is awarded to students who are degree -seeking and who are eligible for Title IV programs. Financial assistance is based on the following calculation: Student Cost of Attendance o minus (-) student/family contribution (EFC) o minus ( -) other outside resources equals (=) financial need for which aid may be awarded The student/family contribution is calculated using the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), which is a standard met hod of determining contributions from taxable and nontaxable income and assets. All applicants for financial aid through Gallaudet must submit both the Gallaudet Institutional Financial Aid Application (IFAA) and the FAFSA. The FAFSA also serves as an appl ication for a Federal Pell Grant. Parents and students may obtain estimates on college costs, savings plans and expected family contribution and other financial information at: www.finaid.org/c alculators/ (external website, not affiliated with Gallaudet University) DEBT COLLECTION POLICIES FINANCIAL AID 40 Educational Costs The purpose of financial aid is to assist in covering educational costs. Costs include tuition, fees, room, books, board, transportation, and an average allowance fo r personal expenses (for the period of time the student is enrolled). Financial aid is not intended to meet all living costs and students need to be prepared to meet their own non- educational living needs while they attend school. The maximum financial aid cost of attendance for the 2016 - 2017 academic year is $36,218.00 for undergraduate students and $42,376.00 for graduate students. Financial aid from all sources cannot exceed this amount. Application Prospective students may apply for financial aid; however, review of financial aid applications will occur only after admission is granted. Currently enrolled students can obtain financial aid applications, during the spring semester, for the following academic year at the Financial Aid Office or online ( see below). Initial Award Notifications are mailed to each applicant regarding the decisions made on his or her application. Revised award notices and all other Financial Aid notices are sent via campus email. Awards also may be viewed by accessing BISON ( bison.gallaudet.edu ). All applications for financial aid may be accessed online at http://www.gallaudet.edu/Financial_Aid/Applications_a nd_Other_Useful_Links.ht ml Application Deadlines The Financial Aid Office accepts applications at any time before or during the academic year; however, there are priority deadlines that are enforced for the awarding of any institutional grants and scholarships. For the 2016 -2017 academic year, these priority deadlines are July 1, 2016, and January 12, 2017. Funds are awarded on a first come, first - served basis; so it is important to apply long before the priority deadlines. Institutional funds may be exhausted before the priority deadline dates. Applications received after the priority deadline dates will be reviewed for federal grant, federal work study (FWS), and federal loan eligibility (if a loan request has been made). Financial Aid Eligibility In order to establish eligibili ty for Title IV Programs, such as Federal Pell Grant, Federal College Work -Study, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG), Federal Perkins Loans, and Federal (subsidized and unsubsidized) Stafford Loans, a student must be enrolled in a degree- seeking program at Gallaudet. The student must meet the requirements of U.S. citizenship. With the exception of unsubsidized Stafford, Grad PLUS, and Parent PLUS loans, all of the federal programs are need -based. In order to receive assistance from t hese programs, the student must: Be making satisfactory progress toward the completion of a degree in his or her field of study. Not be in default on a Perkins or Stafford Loan. Not owe repayment on a Pell Grant or Perkins Loan. Must not have met lifetime limits for Pell Grants or loans. 41 Eligibility for University and Federal Aid Programs UG GRD U.S. INT'L F/T H/T P/T REPAY GIFT DEG SPEC PELL x x x x x x x FSEOG x x x x x x x FWS x x x x x x x PERKINS x x x x x x x STAFFORD x x x x x x x Parent PLUS x x x x x x GRAD PLUS x x x x x x Grant -In-Aid x x x x x x SCHOL x x x x x x x UG Undergraduate Student P/T Less than 6 credit hrs GRD Graduate Student (Master's/Ph.D.) REPAY Aid is a loan and must be repaid U.S. Citizen or eligible non -citizen GIFT Aid does NOT require repayment INT'L International student DEG Must be enrolled in a degree -seeking program F/T Full-time student (12 hrs. UG, 9 hrs. Grd) SPEC Not degree -seeking, or non -degree credits - not eligible for any financial aid H/T At least 6 cr. hrs 42 In order to continue receiving any federal financial aid, students must: 1) be meeting the University's grade point average standards of minimum scholarship and 2) be successfully earning at least 70% of attempted degree credit hours. Please Note: these standards apply to all students, regardless of whether or n ot the student previously received financial aid. Undergraduate Students Students pursuing bachelor's degrees must complete their degree programs within a maximum timeframe. The maximum timeframe cannot exceed 150% of the published length of the program measured in credit hours attempted. The majority of undergraduate programs at the University require that students earn a minimum of 120 degree credit hours. The maximum timeframe for these programs is 180 attempted hours (120 x 150%). Students accepted into programs requiring more than 120 hours for a degree will have a higher limit. Institutional scholarship funding is extremely limited. Please note that regardless of the 150% maximum time frame for Federal financial aid eligibility, undergraduate students may only receive institutional funds for a maximum of five years. After the 5th year of attendance, students will no longer be considered eligible for institutional funds such as scholarships and Grant -in-Aid. In addition to the overall maximum t imeframe above, students must maintain a cumulative grade point average of 2.0 and be successfully earning at least 70% of attempted hours (ratio of cumulative earned degree credit hours to cumulative attempted* degree credit hours) each time Satisfactory Academic Progress is assessed (end of each semester, including summer). *Attempted hours are those hours for which students are still officially registered at the conclusion of each semester's Add/Drop period so WD courses will be included in this calculat ion. Graduate Students Students enrolled in master's degree programs are allowed a 3 year full time maximum timeframe to complete their degrees. Doctoral students are allowed a 6 year maximum timeframe (4 years for coursework, 2 years for dissertation activities). In addition to the overall maximum timeframe above, students must maintain a cumulative grade point average of 3.0 and be successfully earning at least 70% of attempted hours (ratio of cumulative earned degree credit hours to cumulative attem pted* degree credit hours) each time Satisfactory Academic Progress is assessed (end of each semester, including summer). *Attempted hours are those hours for which students are still officially registered at the conclusion of each semester's Add/Drop peri od so Incomplete, WD, WP and WF courses will be included in this calculation. Failure to meet standards Students not meeting the standards (outlined above) or placed on AP by the Registrar will be placed on financial aid warning for one semester, during which aid may be received. If, at the end of the warning semester, a student once again does not meet the SAP requirements or is again placed on AP by the Registrar he or she will be ineligible for federal financial aid unless he or she successfully appea ls (see Appeals below) for reinstatement of federal aid, at which point the student will be placed on financial aid probation for one semester. If the minimum standards are not met by the end of the probationary semester, required GPA is not met for the second year requirement (see Second Year Requirement below), all credit hours attempted are failed in a semester (see Course Failures below), probationary status has been granted two times and standards are again not met, all degree requirements are met but student chooses not to graduate, or if maximum timeframe is exceeded* students will be ineligible for financial aid (this includes Federal Pell Grant, Federal Perkins, Stafford, and PLUS Loans, Federal SEOG, and Federal College Work -Study) until such time as the student once again meets the established standards. *Students exceeding maximum timeframe will ineligible for all future financial aid regardless of meeting established standards. Second Year Requirement (Undergraduate) At the end of the second academic year of study (fourth semester of attendance at Gallaudet), undergraduate students must have a cumulative grade point average of 2.0. Students who do not meet this requirement will not be granted a warning/probationary semester and will not be eligible for financial aid until the necessary cumulative grade point average is attained and other standards are met. SATISFACTORY ACADEMIC PROGRESS FOR FINANCIAL AID 43 Course Failures Students who fail all credit hours attempted (or fail all credits in combination with course withdrawals, WD, and course a udits, AU) will not be granted a warning/probationary semester and will not be eligible for financial aid until the necessary cumulative grade point average is attained and other standards are met. Appeals Students who do not meet the established standar ds for financial aid may submit a written appeal to the Financial Aid Office if there were circumstances which affected academic progress and which were beyond the student's control. Course failures or unsuccessful attempts to complete condition courses ar e NOT valid reasons for appeal. Appeals must include the circumstances under which the student did not meet the requirements and what has changed in the student's situation that would allow the student to meet SAP standards by the next evaluation. Academ ic Information Course Withdrawals (WD, WP, WF): Courses from which a student withdraws after Add/Drop will be counted toward enrollment, attempted hours, and maximum timeframe. Incomplete Grades (INC): Incomplete grades will be counted toward enrollment, attempted hours, and maximum timeframe. Students who end a semester with incomplete grades will be re- evaluated for financial aid eligibility at the University deadline for INC grades. If the incomplete grades are not completed within the University published deadline the student will automatically be placed on the appropriate SAP status (warning or ineligible) based on prior SAP performance and the student is responsible for notifying the Financial Aid Office to have financial aid eligibility re- evaluat ed again once the incomplete grades are updated. If a student is placed on warning for INC grades at the University deadline and then the final grades become WD or all F's at a later date, any federal aid released for the subsequent semester will be rescinded (including loans). No Grade (NG): Courses receiving NG will be treated similar to INC grades and will be counted toward enrollment, attempted hours, and maximum timeframe. Students who end a semester with NG will be re -evaluated for financial aid eli gibility at the University deadline for INC grades. If a grade is not posted within the University published deadline the student will automatically be placed on the appropriate SAP status (warning or ineligible) based on prior SAP performance and the stu dent is responsible for notifying the Financial Aid Office to have financial aid eligibility re- evaluated again once the NG is updated. If a student is placed on warning for NG at the University deadline and then the final grades become WD or all F's at a later date, any federal aid released for the subsequent semester will be rescinded (including loans). Transfer Credits: Course credits transferred from other institutions will be considered hours earned and attempted for the purpose of determining the 70 % earned credits completion rate (student pace) and maximum timeframe. Repeated Courses: Students may repeat courses, to attempt to achieve a higher passing grade, one time without penalty. Any course, in this scenario, repeated more than once will not count toward enrollment. Students receiving a failing grade (F) may repeat the course as many times as necessary until it is passed. Repeated courses will be considered hours earned and attempted for the purpose of determining the 70% earned credits comp letion rate and maximum timeframe. Audited Courses: Students do not earn any academic credit for audited courses. They do not count toward enrollment status or in the calculation of student pace unless a course was changed to Audit status after Add/Drop. In this case they will be treated the same as WD courses. Double Majors and/or Minors: Students pursuing a double major/minor will be expected to complete all degree requirements before reaching maximum timeframe. Change of Major: Students who change t heir majors will be expected to complete all degree requirements before reaching maximum timeframe. Graduate Students Taking Undergraduate Courses Graduate students taking undergraduate coursework will be awarded financial aid based ONLY on the number of Graduate degree credits. To qualify for federal and institutional aid programs, graduate students must be enrolled in at least 6 credit hours of Graduate coursework. ENROLLMENT AND ELIGIBILITY 44 Summer Students Some limited financial aid is available for summer school, which is considered to be the \"last\" semester of the award year for financial aid. Students who desire to apply for summer school aid must complete a Summer IFAA (in BISON). Summer school aid will be awarded only to students who have completed the FAFSA and Gallaudet Summer IFAA, and registered for classes. Summer aid is awarded to eligible students for degree- credit coursework only. Non -degree credit Sign Language courses and credits offered through other University departments/colleges wil l not be supported by financial aid. Summer aid will not cover coursework which is repeated. Summer financial aid is limited. Students taking summer courses should not depend on financial aid alone to cover summer charges. Undergraduate Students Beginning Graduate Program in Summer Undergraduate students who plan to begin a Graduate Program in Summer, and who have been enrolled as undergraduate students in fall and/or spring, MUST COMPLETE A FAFSA FOR THE SAME AWARD YEAR AS A GRADUATE STUDENT. FAFSA results for undergraduate students are invalid for awarding graduate level financial aid. Adjusted FAFSAs must be filed by the beginning of May for the prior Academic Year. For example, a student who is an undergraduate in Fall 2016 - Spring 2017 and who starts a graduate program in Summer of 2017 MUST correct their 2016- 2017 FAFSA (before May if possible) to reflect graduate level status. It is essential that undergraduate students beginning a Graduate Program in Summer. See Financial Aid about requirements and applications even before acceptance into a graduate program. Online Students Students taking online courses may receive financial aid funding (if otherwise eligible); however the cost of education used to determine financial aid eligibility for on - line class funding will include tuition, fees, and books only. Transportation costs, personal expenses, room, and board are not included in determining the amount of financial aid funding, and are not considered to be relevant costs associated with on -line study. Students may choose to live in University housing while taking on -line study; however the expenses related to dorm residence will not be included in financial aid calculations or in the amount of aid granted. In order to be considered for the full cost of e ducation and applicable financial aid, students must be taking a minimum of six credits per semester (in their degree program) of resident (lecture) classes in combination with online classes. International Students International students must document suf ficient support from personal or private resources in order to obtain valid immigration permits; therefore, no aid is awarded to first year international students. International students are expected to be responsible for meeting education expenses for the entire length of their programs. Very limited aid is available to international students. Assistance through the University is provided only with documentation of unexpected reductions or cancellations of previously planned support. Awards determined by t he Gallaudet Financial Aid Office are made to eligible students who are full time and degree seeking only. These awards will depend on availability of funds and individual need. International students who are receiving ongoing family/private support or assistance through other University departments may not be eligible for financial aid. Special/Visiting Students Special students are not eligible for financial aid. Students who are attending other institutions and who are enrolling at Gallaudet for one or two semesters are considered to be visiting or special students and are not eligible for financial aid. In some cases, students' home institutions will agree to transfer any aid for which they are eligible to Gallaudet via a Consortium Agreement; however, all visiting students must apply for aid at their home institutions, not at Gallaudet. Visiting students should discuss their plans with the Financial Aid Office at their home schools (degree granting institution) prior to attending Gallaudet. Financial aid will be disbursed only when the University add/drop period is completed and student enrollment is verified. Financial aid is based on student enrollment status as of the last day of the add/drop period. In addition, all required documentation must be received (e.g., tax transcripts) before aid will be released for individual students. All financial aid administered by the University must first be used to cover University charges; refunds of financial aid will not be given to stude nts until all semester charges are satisfied. All grants and scholarships are credited directly to students' accounts. Loan checks for FINANCIAL AID PROCESSING 45 Federal Stafford, Perkins, and PLUS loans must be endorsed by the borrower, if not received electronically, and submitted to the University cashier so that the loans can be credited against charges. Loan checks may not be deposited into private checking or savings accounts, or otherwise negotiated by students. Because financial aid is not disbursed at the beginning of the se mester or released to students as a refund until all charges are satisfied, it is essential that students be financially prepared to cover expenses for books and usual living costs with personal funds. Overawards The Financial Aid Office is charged with th e responsibility for compliance with federal aid program guidelines, which include ensuring that students do not receive more aid than that for which they are eligible (exceeding the \"financial need\" amount). In cases where a student has been awarded finan cial aid and other financial assistance received exceeds the financial need amount, the Financial Aid Office must reduce or cancel any aid it has awarded to avoid \"overawards\" of federal aid. Students who are awarded institutional grants, and subsequently receive departmental assistantships, stipends, VR support, waivers, or outside assistance, may have their institutional grants reduced. Institutional grants are limited, and if awarded without knowledge of \"other\" assistance, may be reduced to make grant funds available to students who do not receive such other assistance. It is essential that students notify the Financial Aid Office of any assistance expected or received from outside sources (private scholarships, VR); or from other University department s or offices (such as tuition scholarships/waivers, stipends, grants, or other assistance/scholarships) in order to determine what effect, if any, this assistance will have on aid awarded by the Financial Aid Office. Campus Communication All students are i ssued a campus post office box and e -mail account. Students are advised that all communications from the Financial Aid Office are sent to the campus post office box or via campus e -mail once the semester has started. Students need to check their paper mail and e -mail frequently in order to get essential information from this Office. Financial aid will be delayed or terminated if students do not respond to requests for information or other required activities sent to the post office box or through Gallaudet e-mail. Gallaudet post office boxes, addresses, and e -mail accounts are maintained in Gallaudet's central database, and this information determines where our communications are sent. Students must be sure that this information is current and accurate. Any changes to this information should be made through the Registrar's Office The following Grant and Scholarship programs are available: Pell is a grant (gift aid) to undergraduate students. This program is limited to students who have not yet received a bachelor's degree. The grants vary in amount depending on the student's expected family contribution (EFC) figure, cost of attendance, enrollment status, and on authorized funds. Pell Grants range from $299 to $5815 for the 2016- 2017 academic year. This program is a grant or gift awarded by the school to undergraduate students who have \"exceptional financial need\", as determined by the FAFSA -generated Expected Family Contribution (EFC). Grants are limited to students who are enrolled at least half time in a degree -seeking program, and who are PELL Grant eligible. Average grants range in value from $100 to $4000 per academic year, depending upon individual need and available funding. The University makes available from its general income a limited number of grant -in-aid awards to full -time, degree- seeking undergraduate and graduate students who are U.S. citizens or permanent residents. Th ese grants are used for tuition, unit fee, and campus -based living expenses (room and board). GRANTS AND SCHOLARSHIPS FEDERAL PELL GRANT FEDERAL SUPPLEMENTAL EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY GRANT (FSEOG) GALLAUDET GRANT -IN-AID 46 GIA is supplemental to the student's personal funds, the support provided by parents, and possible financial aid from state agencies. Also included in the student's resources are any federal grants, Federal Perkins Loan, Federal Work Study, or Federal Stafford Loans. Remaining funds from the academic year are used to provide summer session grants for students enrolled full time during either semester of the preced ing academic year. Summer applications are available during the spring semester. Any part of such a grant that cannot be used to cover charges will be cancelled. Grant -in-aid cannot be released to students as refunds. As part of the total financial aid package, scholarships funded by clubs, organizations, individual donors, and foundations are awarded annually. Scholarships are awarded to those students who meet the eligibility requirements and who submit the appropriate application s (FAFSA and the IFAA). Students applying for a scholarship must be full time and degree- seeking. The Financial Aid Office matches student applicants with scholarships, based on donor purpose and other criteria. Students do not need to apply for indivi dual scholarships. The FAFSA and IFAA serve as scholarship applications. State Grants and Scholarships Several states provide scholarships and grants, based on need. For information about state resources, students should ask their state department of edu cation or regional vocational rehabilitation counselor. Some information is available in the Office of Financial Aid for students from the District of Columbia, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Vermont. Undergraduate - The Gallaudet University Admissions Office offers merit - based scholarships to deaf and hard of hearing students whose scholastic and personal achievements are exemplary. All newly admitted incoming freshmen and transfer applicants will automatically be considered for all merit - based scholarships. No separate forms are necessary. Scholarship winners will be notified by the Admissions Office. Timely responses to admission and of merit -based scholarship awards are important because of the limited number of available merit -based scholarships. Graduate - The Graduate Departments offer merit -based scholarships to deaf and hard of hearing students whose scholastic and personal achievements are exemplary. All newly admitted incoming graduate ap plicants will automatically be considered for all merit -based scholarships. No separate forms are necessary. Scholarship winners will be notified by the Graduate School Dean. Timely responses to admission and of merit - based scholarship awards are important because of the limited number of available merit -based scholarships. For more information, see Scholarships At -A-Glance . The following loan programs are available: The Perkin s Student Loan is a low -interest (5 percent) subsidized federal loan administered by Gallaudet. Perkins loans are available to students who have \"exceptional financial need.\" Undergraduate students may borrow a maximum of $5,500 per year, depending on the availability of funds and individual financial need. Graduate/Professional students may borrow a maximum of $8,000 per year, depending on availability of funds and individual financial need. The aggregate Federal Perkins Loan Program limit is $27,500 for a student who has not yet completed a program of undergraduate study and $60,000 for a graduate or professional student, including loans borrowed at the undergraduate level. Repayment begins nine months after a student graduates, withdraws, or drops below half time. (Grace periods may vary for less -than -half-time students.) Students are allowed up to 10 years to repay, with a minimum monthly payment of $40 (depending on date of loan disbursement and aggregate amount borrowed). Deferments, forbearance, and/ or cancellation of payments are available to eligible students and must be requested. NEED-BASED SCHOLARSHIPS MERIT SCHOLARSH IPS LOANS FEDERAL PERKINS LOAN 47 The Federal Stafford Loan programs provide \"fixed\" low interest loans to student borrowers. Subsidized Stafford Loans are those for which the gove rnment pays the interest while a student is enrolled at least half time (a minimum of six credit hours toward the student's degree program) or in applicable loan deferment status. Unsubsidized Stafford Loans are those that are not need -based, and the stude nt is responsible for paying the interest that accrues during in- school and deferment periods. Interest rates vary, depending on Stafford Loan history and the date on which the loan is disbursed, but are not higher than 8.25%. Variable interest rates are set each June. For prior borrowers with outstanding loan balances, interest rates will be the same for previous loans. For loans disbursed after July 1, 2016, interest rates will be \"fixed\" at 3.76% for Undergraduate Subsidized Loans. Undergraduate Unsubsi dized loans will be \"fixed\" at 3.76%. All Graduate Stafford loans will be \"fixed\" at 5.31%. * Origination Fee for loan disbursement for Direct Subsidized & Unsubsidized Loans: On or after October 1, 2015, and before October 1, 2016 1.073% Loan Fee On or after October 1, 2016, and before October 1, 2017 1.068% Loan Fee Undergraduate students may borrow subsidized loans up to $3,500 per year as freshmen, $4,500 per year as sophomores, and $5,500 per year as juniors and seniors. Dependent undergraduates m ay also borrow an additional $2000 per year in Unsubsidized Stafford Loans. Graduate students are not eligible to borrow subsidized Stafford loans. (Actual loan amounts may be less, depending on individual student eligibility.) Repayment begins six months after the student graduates, withdraws, or drops below half -time attendance. Independent undergraduate and graduate students may borrow additional unsubsidized Stafford Loans once subsidized limits are reached (and if otherwise eligible). The maximum amo unts of additional unsubsidized loans that can be borrowed are: freshmen and sophomores - $6,000 juniors or seniors - $7,000 graduate students - $20,500 These are maximums only; actual unsubsidized loan amounts are determined according to individual student eligibility. Stafford Loans are disbursed in two payments, usually one per semester. One semester loans may be disbursed in two payments; the first at the beginning of the semester (or after approval) and the second after the mid -point of the semester. Loan requests can be made through your BISON account. Students who have outstanding Stafford loans should contact the Financial Aid Office to discuss future borrowing resources. Repayment begins six months after a student withdraws, LOA, graduates, or dr ops below half - time attendance (including internship and dissertation enrollment). Students with Unsubsidized Stafford Loans will be responsible for the interest that accrues during the six-month grace period. Deferments are available and depend on the loa n date. Questions about your deferments should be directed to the holder of your loan. Loan Deadlines Federal Stafford and PLUS Loans must be requested by the end of November for the fall semester and the end of April for the spring semester. This is neces sary so that adequate time is given to process loan applications, promissory notes, and the receipt of loan funds. Under no circumstances will a loan be awarded/processed for a semester that has ended, unless the student is fully enrolled for a subsequent semester in the same academic year. Loans will not be processed to cover outstanding charges for a prior semester in order to enroll. Students who owe a balance from a previous semester will have to satisfy all debts to the University before a loan will be processed. Students who have completed the fall semester with an outstanding balance above $1,000 may not enroll for the spring semester, and therefore are not considered \"students\" for the purpose of loan requirements. For this reason, it is essential th at students apply for loans early, and well before the semester ends. Master Promissory Notes Students who are first- time Federal Stafford Loan borrowers, or students who are borrowing at Gallaudet for the first time (e.g., transfer students) are required to complete and sign a Master Promissory Note (MPN) at the time of their initial Direct Loan application. Stafford Loans FEDERAL STAFFORD LOANS 48 will be canceled for students who do not complete the MPN requirements within 30 days. (Loan funds will not be approved or disbursed by the Department of Education without a signed promissory note.) Student Loan Counseling Federal law requires institutions to inform students of their borrower rights and responsibilities. To meet this federal requirement, students may be required to complete an entrance interview/counseling session. The loan Entrance Interview may be obtained at: http://www.studentloans.gov . Students cannot receive their Federal Stafford Loan funds until they have met this federal requirement. After linking to the website, students should follow the instructions carefully. If a student is unable to complete the entrance loan counseling session on the web, the student may complete it in the Financial Aid Office. Entrance Loan Counseling session is required of all first -time Gallaudet loan borrowers at the time of application. Entrance counseling may be completed in person or on the web. The loan reques t will not be processed until this requirement is satisfied. Exit Loan Counseling is required of Stafford Loan borrowers who withdraw, drop below half - time (6 credits), or graduate. Exit Loan Counseling may also be completed in person, or on the web at: www.studentloans.gov Failure to complete the exit loan counseling requirements will result in a \"hold\" on transcripts, grades, and diplomas. PLUS loans are loans that are borrowed by parents on behalf of their dependent undergraduate students. This program gives parents with good credit histories an opportunity to borrow an amount each year that does not exceed the student's cost of educ ation minus any financial aid received. The PLUS interest rate is variable but cannot exceed 9 percent for loans disbursed on or after October 1, 1992. For PLUS loans first disbursed after July 1, 2016, the interest rates will be fixed at 6.31%. PLUS loan s are disbursed in two payments and are made co-payable to the borrower and Gallaudet University. Any paper checks are forwarded to the borrower for endorsement and must be returned to Gallaudet to be applied to any of the student's outstanding institution al charges. Any amount in excess of the outstanding charges will be refunded to the borrower. PLUS loans are not subsidized, and interest and principal repayment begins within 60 days of the loan disbursement, once it's fully disbursed. Deferment of principal and/or interest may be available on PLUS loans. Borrowers should contact their PLUS loan servicer for further information. *Origination Fee for loan disbursement for Direct PLUS loans: On or after October 1, 2015, and before October 1, 2016 o 4.29% Loa n Fee On or after October 1, 2016 and before October 1, 2011 o 4.27% Loan Fee Students who do not qualify for Federal Stafford or PLUS loans (or who have reached annual maximum limits) may consider applying for a Private Educational Loan (some times called Alternative Loans). These loans are not subsidized, but offer competitive interest rates and deferment options. These loans also may be used to cover previous outstanding balances to the University, depending on the student's last enrollment p eriod. All applications for private loans must be requested by the end of November for the fall semester and the end of April for the spring semester. Eligibility and guidelines will vary among private loan providers. For more information, contact the Fin ancial Aid Office. FEDERAL PARENT LOANS FOR UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS (PLUS) PRIV ATE LOANS 49 Additional resources for funding your education may be available through the following programs and opportunities: Students who have worked a full -time job in the past, but had to leave because of their d isability, may be eligible to receive disability benefits from the Social Security Program (FICA Tax). Benefits also may be received if one of the following is true: The student is under 18 (disabled or nondisabled), and one or both parents are receiving S ocial Security benefits or are deceased (Child Benefits). The student is a disabled student, over 18, who became disabled before the age of 22, and one or both parents are receiving Social Security benefits or are deceased (Disabled Adult/Child Benefits). Students who feel that they may be eligible for any of the benefits listed above should apply through their local Social Security Office. Supplemental Security Income (SSI) SSI is a federal program of financial assistance that is administered by the Social Security Administration. In order to be eligible for SSI, the student must meet two major requirements: The student must have a mental or physical disability (e.g., deafness) that prevents him or her from working. and The student must have little or no re gular income or property of great value. The amount of income and property he or she can have depends upon his or her living arrangement and the state of which he or she is a resident. Both of these eligibility requirements must be met by the student. Just having a disability is not enough; the student must be able to prove that the disability prevents him or her from working in a substantially gainful job. If he or she has worked for a period of time and voluntarily quit or has good work skills, the student may not be eligible for SSI, since his or her disability does not prevent him or her from working. Individuals who are over 18 and full -time students will have only their income (not their parents' income) counted for eligibility. When students are proven eligible, they will receive a monthly check to assist them in meeting their living expenses. They also may be eligible for medical assistance from the state in which they permanently reside. They can work and receive SSI at the same time, but their monthly amount will be reduced, depending on their job earnings. Students who feel that they may be eligible for SSI may apply through any local Social Security Office. Vocational Rehabilitation (VR) is a program that exists in each state to help individuals who have a hearing loss or other disabilities. VR may be able to provide financial assistance to help with the cost of college and may also provide assistance fo r hearing aids, glasses, and other disability -related devices. To be eligible for VR, students must have a disability that limits their ability to obtain or advance in a job, and there must be some indication that VR services will be able to help better pr epare them for future employment. Students who think that they may be eligible for VR services should apply to the VR agency in their home state. Many VR agencies have changed their policies and will not authorize support until they have received the resu lts of all financial aid applications. This means that many students may start the semester without any VR authorization. It is absolutely necessary that students apply for all financial aid programs early and inform their VR counselor of the results as so on as they are known. Students should check with their VR counselor to see if any authorizations will be sent to Gallaudet before financial aid results are known. If a student's VR authorizations are not received by Gallaudet before registration, the stud ent will be expected to pay his or her expenses or sign a promissory note before he or she can register. When the student's financial aid and VR assistance come through, the student will be reimbursed for any payments made. It is extremely important that e ach student talk with his or her VR counselor prior to each semester to find out what assistance he or she may or may not be receiving. Students should not assume that the VR assistance will automatically be sent to the University. If any agency is supply ing funds or assistance directly to a OTHER RESOURCES SOCIAL SECURITY VOCATIONAL REHABILITA TION 50 student, rather than to Gallaudet, Gallaudet considers that the student is paying for his or her expenses. Students expecting any VR support for books and supplies should come prepared to buy these materials with thei r own money. Many times the VR authorizations are not received in time for students to have credit at the bookstore. Students should keep all receipts received; they will be reimbursed by the Student Financial Services. The University Financial Aid Office will not make loans for books and supplies. Students or vocational rehabilitation counselors who have any questions should contact the Financial Aid Office. This program is designed to assist students who must earn part of their ed ucation costs by working part time. The amount a student can earn under FWS is determined on the basis of need and the amount of funds available in the program. Federal Work Study students are paid on an hourly basis every two weeks. The salary begins at minimum wage and can be increased depending on the nature of the job and the job requirements. Eligibility for this program is determined by the Office of Financial Aid. The FWS program is funded annually by the Federal government; however, the amount of f unding varies year to year. FWS funds may become exhausted before the end of the year, depending on the number of students employed, the cumulative total of hours worked and the hourly rates paid. Department heads, supervisors and students should be aware that FWS funds may not provide support for the entire academic year, and that if FWS funds are exhausted continued employment will be at the full expense of the employing department. Departments and students will be notified if and when FWS funding will ce ase. Gallaudet University is committed to America's veterans and has a long history of serving them. Each academic year it is important to check on the U.S. Veteran's Affairs weblink to see wh ich major programs of study are approved by the VA and if Gallaudet University is participating in the Yellow Ribbon Program. Applicants must apply, if they are eligible, for educational benefits under the Post - 9/11 GI Bill with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. All veteran education beneficiary applicants must obtain the VA Certificate of Eligibility (COE). The COE must be given to the VA School Certifying Official (SCO) for university student VA records. The COE includes a veteran's status, inform ation for educational benefit eligibility and the required classifications used for VA educational certifications. Students may only apply for the Yellow Ribbon program in an academic year that Gallaudet is participating. Students eligible for VA education al benefits will need to request semester enrollment and program certification processing with the university VA listed SCO. As semester academic program compliance must be on record - each student will be required to have their advisor submit a record cop y of the student's annual program evaluation and checklist or complete the \"Student Advisory Program Compliance Form for VA Educational Certification\" Certifications of any type including VA certifications require a student to have active term status. Cert ifications to the VA must be submitted within 30 days of the start of a semester. Students are therefore required to submit VA certification requests by the end of add/drop periods each semester. If an initial certification is submitted on behalf of the student by the SCO - the official certification in the 'dual certification' process can be updated to official enrollment status but can only be submitted when a student has completed both course registration and their business registration by university policy. Students are required to notify the VA School Certifying Official of any changes in status with Gallaudet University regarding their major program of study. o Seeking to be a 'guest student' at another institution while attending Gallaudet FEDERAL WORK STUDY (FWS) VETERANS EDUCATION BENEFITS 51 o If withdrawing from the university (i.e. transferring or ending college studies) o When a campus judicial matter is pending and/or determined o When charged or incarcerated for a crime Additional information about the Post- 9/11 GI Bill and Yellow Ribbon Program, as well as the VA's other educational benefit programs, can be obtained by visiting the VA's website or by calling 1(888) GIBILL -1 (or 1(888)442- 4551). The Financial Aid Office is required by federal statute to recalculate federal financial aid eligibility for students who withdraw, drop out, are dismissed, or take a leave of absence prior to completing 60% of a payment period or term. The federal Title IV financial aid program funds must be recalculated in these situations. If a student leaves the institution prior to completing 60% of the semester, the financial aid office recalculates eligibility for Title IV funds and institutional fun ds. Recalculation is based on the percentage of earned aid using the following Federal Return of Title IV funds formula: Percentage of payment period or term completed The percentage of payment period or term completed is the number of days completed up to the withdrawal date divided by the total days in the payment period or term. (Any break of five days or more is not counted as part of the days in the term.) This percentage is also the percentage of earned aid. Funds are returned to the appropriate fede ral program based on the percentage of unearned aid using the following formula: Aid to be returned Aid to be returned is: 100% of the aid that could be disbursed minus the percentage of earned aid multiplied by the total amount of aid that could have been disbursed during the payment period or term. An example: A student withdraws after 44 days. This number is divided by the total days in the semester: 44/110 = 40%. This student has \"earned\" 40% of his/her financial aid. If the student has received $6000 in grants, scholarships and/or loans, 40%, or $2,400 is earned, and the remaining $3,600 must be returned. If a student earned less aid than was disbursed, the institution would be required to return a portion of the funds and the student would be required to return a portion of the funds. If a student earned more aid than was disbursed to him/her, the institution would owe the student a post- withdrawal disbursement which must be paid within 120 days of the student's withdrawal. Keep in mind that when Tit le IV funds are returned, the student may owe a debit balance to the institution. The institution must return the amount of Title IV funds for which it is responsible no later than 45 days after the date of the determination of the date of the student's withdrawal/LOA. Refunds are allocated in the following order: o Unsubsidized Direct Stafford Loans (other than PLUS loans) o Subsidized Direct Stafford Loans o Federal Perkins Loans o Direct PLUS Loans o Federal Pell Grants for which a Return of funds is required o Federal Supplemental Opportunity Grants for which a Return of funds is required o Other assistance under this Title for which a Return of funds is required (e.g., LEAP) UNIVERSITY FINANCIAL AID REFUNDS TO INSTITUTIONAL AND TITLE IV PROGRAMS 52 Definition: Return to Title IV (R2T4) calculation - A required calculation to determine the amount of aid earned by the student when the student does not attend all days scheduled to complete within a payment period or term (Student is considered to be a withdrawal, whether any credits were completed or not.) Overaward [not the same as Return to Title IV calculation] - A required recalculation of Pell Grant and other aid types due to student dropping or not attending credits required for the status awarded (full -time, three -quarter time, half -time, less than half -time); required at any point information received that changes student status. Reductions in aid will always be required for students whose status changes due to dropped classes or classes not attended beyond the course census date. Return of Title IV funds for programs offered in modules A Module is defined as a course or group of courses in a program that does not span the entire length of the payment period (semester), i.e. 8 week online sessions or summer sessions. Gallaudet University, Financial Aid Office will track enrollment in eac h module to determine if a student began enrollment in all registered courses. If a student officially drops courses in a later module while still attending a current module, the student is not considered as withdrawn based on not attending the later modul e. However, a recalculation of aid based on a change in enrollment status may still be required. If a student in modular classes provides written confirmation to a school at the time of ceasing attendance that the student plans to attend another course later in the semester, the student is not considered to have withdrawn if the next schedule class the student is to attend begins within 45 days of the last class the student attended. Unofficial Withdrawals All financial aid is awarded to students with the expectation that they will attend classes for the entire semester or award period. Students who cease attending classes but who do not officially withdraw (identified by failing grades for all attempted credits) will be considered as having \"unofficially w ithdrawn\", and will be subject to financial aid cancellation according to the date attendance ceased as provided by faculty (or, at a 50% unearned rate if attendance information is not available.). This means, regardless of charges for the period, a student who has ceased attending classes will be considered to have unofficially withdrawn and will have a percentage of his/her financial aid cancelled (based on attendance data), and may be subject to repayment of any financial aid disbursed. If any loans have been disbursed, repayment requirements may take effect as of the unofficial withdrawal date. Students who cease attending classes and are considered as unofficial withdrawals will NOT BE ELIGIBLE for financial aid for the subsequent semester; and/or unti l future semester courses have been completed and satisfactory academic progress standards are met. A copy of the Academic Standards for Financial Aid is available on the Financial Aid website ( financiala id.gallaudet.edu ). Students should be aware that they need to file an official withdrawal with the Office of the Registrar if they cannot, or choose not, to attend classes throughout the semester. Undergraduate students who unofficially withdraw and wish to be reinstated must apply for readmission through the Registrar's Office. Graduate students who unofficially withdraw and wish to be reinstated must apply for readmission through the Graduate Admissions Office. PLEASE NOTE : a withdrawal from all or any of your courses could result in a negative effect on your Satisfactory Academic Progress. Please view the section on Standards of Academic Progress (SAP) for Financial Aid located on this page. 53 Registrar's Office www.gallaudet.edu/registrar Chapel Hall 101 Gallaudet University strives to make the registration experience as smooth as possible. The Registrar's Office serves as the first point of contact for students related to course enrollment, student record keeping, grading procedures, academic status, and graduation. The Registrar's Office also assists with transfer credits. Graduate students are served by both the Registrar's Office and the Graduate Admissions . Policies for undergraduate and graduate students at Gallaudet University are established by the Council on Undergraduate Education (CUE) and the Council on Graduate Education (CGE) . CUE and CGE are faculty -led committees that set academic standards and policies. CUE and CGE review proposals submitted by departments and programs for changes in the curriculum, program requirements, and new or change d courses. CUE and CGE then recommend curriculum changes to the University Faculty Senate. Approved changes are posted in the catalog for the next academic year. Key registration resources include this catalog and: Academic Calendar, http://www.gallaudet.edu/registrar/academic - calendars Online Student Information System, bison.gallaudet.edu Course Schedule, courseschedule.gallaudet.edu People Directory, people.gallaudet.edu Online Learning System (Blackboard), my.gallaudet.edu There are some requirements that are to be met prior to course registration. Students are required to submit Health History, meet with their Academic Advisor(s) and have a clear balance or fina ncial agreement before they can begin the Course Registration process. Health History Before enrolling, all Gallaudet University students must submit a health history form to Student Health Services (SHS). Students cannot register for classes until the form has been submitted and approved as providing the requirement proof of immunizations. Student Health Services (SHS) does not provide immunizatio n services, and students will be referred to an off -campus clinic that provides immunizations at the student's expense. District of Columbia law also requires students under the age of 26 at the time of matriculation to provide proof of the following immu nizations: Varicella (Chickenpox) or documentation of the disease Tetanus/Diphtheria within the past 10 years Measles, Mumps, Rubella (MMR) twice at age 12 months or older or evidence of immunity by titre; Tuberculin (Mantoux) PPD 5 TU within twelve months prior to enrollment Salk Polio vaccine within the past five years or evidence of oral polio vaccine (TOPV) series Hepatitis B and Meningococcal Students over the age of 26 at the time of matriculation are required to have had a Tetanus/Diphth eria booster within the past 10 years and the Tuberculin (Mantoux) PPD 5 TU within twelve months prior to enrollment. REGISTRATION AND POLICIES PROCEDURES PRIOR TO REGISTRATION 54 Academic Advising Students should meet with their academic advisor prior to registering for courses. Students can find the name of their advisor when they login to the BISON web site, or by consulting their academic department or appropriate advising office. Undergraduate Students with Declared Majors: Consult your faculty advisor in the academic department. Undergraduate Students w ith Undeclared Majors and Special Students: Consult the Academic Advising Office. Graduate Students: Consult your faculty advisor in the academic department. Graduate Special Students: Consult the Assistant Dean, Graduate School Curriculum, Policy, and Operations. Business Registration (Fee Payment) Per Gallaudet University's policy, the account balance must be paid in full each semester at posted dates before the student can register for courses and enroll for the next semester or obtain diploma and tr anscript upon graduation. Student may still register for the next semester if they have made arrangements with the Student Finance Services and signed a Promissory note. Gallaudet University does not offer deferral or payment installment plans. Students have full access to their student financial account via login to http://bison.gallaudet.edu . New Students Registration for new undergraduate students occurs during New Student Orientation (NSO) through the Office of Academic Advising . Registration for new graduate students occurs during Graduate Student Orientation (GSO) during academic department meetings. Continuing Students Registration for continuing undergraduate students (those without remedial English courses) and for graduate students is conducted online thro ugh the BISON Student Information System, http://bison.gallaudet.edu . Students who are taking remedial English courses will register with their Academic Advisor. Continuing students are encouraged to register for courses for the following semester as soon as registration opens (in April for the following Fall semester and in November for the following Spring semester). The earlier you register, the better your course schedule is likely to be - and th e better the University can plan for your needs. Readmitted Students Registration for readmitted students is done via the Readmission Advisor in the Academic Advising Office, SAC 2220 for undergraduates and via the Graduate Admissions, Kendall 101. Students Returning from Leave of Absence (RLOA) Undergraduate students must contact the LOA/WD Specialist at the Registrar's Office. Graduate students must notify their academic department, the Dean of the Graduate School, and the Registrar's Office if th ey plan to return from Leave of Absence (RLOA). Second Degree Students (Undergraduate Students Only) If your first degree is from Gallaudet, contact your major advisor within your major department for course registration. If your first degree is not from Gallaudet, please refer to the course registration procedure for \"New Students\". Course Changes: Add, Drops Undergraduate students may add or drop a course during the first week of a semester. Courses may be dropped through Thursday of the first week of cl asses; courses may be added through Friday of the first week of class. No changes in registration for courses may be made after the close of the first week, except for reasons beyond the student's control. There is a $5 fee for each successful transaction during the designated add/drop period. Graduate students may add or drop a course during the first two (2) weeks of classes. No changes in registration for courses may be made after the close of the second week, except for reasons beyond the student's cont rol. There is a $5 fee for each successful transaction during the designated add/drop period. COURSE REGISTRATION 55 Online 8 -Week Session Course Changes Gallaudet University and Online Consortium of Independent Colleges & University (OCICU) online students' add and drop perio d for enrolling in 8 -week online session courses ends on the last day of the first week of each 8 -week session. To be eligible for financial aid, students must maintain their same level of enrollment as stated below: Enrollment Chart for Financial Aid Eligibility Award Programs Enrollment Status for Sessions A and B Full-Time Three -Quarter Time Half -Time Less-Than- Half Time Undergraduate: Undergraduate: Graduate/Professional: Graduate/Professional: 9 credits 8 credits 6-7 credits 1-5 credits For the purpose of Title IV Federal Student Aid, enrollment status is determined at the end of the first add/drop period of each semester. For online courses, both 8-week sessions are together considered to be equivalent to one semester. Thus, if a student aid recipient who is registered for both sessions either (1 ) completes the first session, but drops a course from the second, or (2) drops a course from the first session, but goes on to complete the second session, the student may be subject to the U.S. Department of Education's Federal Return of Title IV Funds c alculation. If the student's enrollment status level changes, financial aid may be prorated or reduced. Furthermore, a student in situation (2), above, must confirm in writing that he or she will return for the second session, or risk losing all Title IV f unding for the semester. All students who receive financial aid and are considering dropping or withdrawing from courses are advised to consult with the financial aid office. Course Audit Students desiring to attend a class and participate in the class activities without earning a grade for the course and without earning credit toward a degree may audit the course. Enrollment as an auditor is permitted only after students otherwise eligible to enroll in the course on a credit basis have had an opportuni ty to do so. To audit a course, the student must obtain permission from the instructor before enrolling, registering, and paying the normal tuition and fees. Decisions to audit a course and registration must be made prior to the first day of classes. Audited courses are not counted as credit courses, and grades are not included in the calculation of institutional or degree grade point averages, but are recorded as \"AU\" in official transcripts upon successful completion of the course, or \"ANC\" for unsucce ssful completion, as reported by the instructor. Repeated Courses Undergraduate Courses: Students may repeat a course once. Both attempts will appear on the student's transcript, but only the attempt with the higher grade will be used for computing the cre dit and grade earned for the course. With approval of the student's department chair or program director, an equivalent consortium course may be taken to replace the course taken at Gallaudet. Graduate Courses: Graduate students who receive an unsatisfact ory grade (e.g., C, F, or WF) in a course satisfying a program requirement, may repeat the same course with permission of the department only one time. Course Cancellation Gallaudet reserves the right to withdraw any course not elected by a sufficient numb er of students. Study Day Study Day is a day set aside for students to prepare and study for final exams. It is also a time for faculty to hold review sessions or office hours to be available to help students. This day typically occurs the day after the last class day of each semester. No classes or final exams will be scheduled or administered at any time on Study Day. 56 Final Exams Final exams will only be offered during the official exam period, following the Final Exam Schedule distributed by the Regist rar's Office. The official exam period is listed on the Academic Calendar each year. Exceptions to this policy must be in writing and have the approval of the department chair and dean. Course Withdrawals Procedures for course withdrawals differ for under graduate, graduate and PST students. In the case of withdrawing from all courses, resulting in zero (0) credits, refer to either the Leave of Absence (LOA) or the University Withdrawal procedure. Details on course withdrawals are provided under Undergraduate Policies and Graduate Policies in this catalog. Undergraduate or graduate students withdrawing from a PST course must email or fax their written withdrawal to ccs@gallaudet.edu or or (202) 651- 5987 (fax). There is no refund of tuition and fees. Undergraduate and graduate courses offered in the University are numbered as follows: Below 100 Non -degree courses 100- 199 Primarily Freshman courses 200- 299 Primarily Sophomore courses 300- 499 Primarily Junior and Senior courses 500- 599 Courses designed for both upper division undergraduates and graduate students 600- 699 Dual -listed graduate level courses 700- 799 Master's level graduate courses 800- 899 Doctoral level graduate courses Double numbers separated by a hyphen (321 -322) indicate a two -semester course that must ordinarily be taken in sequence. Double numbers separated by a comma (441, 442) indicate a two -semester course that may be taken for either one semester or both semesters. Figures in parentheses following course titles show credit in semester hours. 500- Level Courses 500- level classes are open t o upper division undergraduate and graduate students. They may be listed as program requirements for undergraduate or graduate programs and may be applied as electives in undergraduate or graduate programs, with permission of the department. Graduate stude nts in 500 -level classes will be expected to complete graduate -level work. 600- Level (Dual -Listed) Courses Dual -listed courses, listed in both undergraduate and graduate catalogs, are defined as graduate level courses that are open to advanced undergraduat e enrollment. Dual- listed courses carry a 600 -level number in both catalogs and have the same course descriptions. Requirements are identical for graduate and undergraduate students. Dual - listed courses may be included in graduate programs. Cross -Listed Co urses Cross -listed courses are courses that are defined at two different levels or that are defined and listed by two different programs or departments. Cross -listed courses typically meet together for class sessions and thus are scheduled at the same time and location. There are several possibilities for cross -listed courses. 1. A course may be cross -listed as both undergraduate (400- level) and graduate (700 - level) courses. Requirements may be different for students in the 400 - and 700- level courses, but they will meet together for lectures and thus be scheduled as one class. 2. A course may be cross -listed as two levels of graduate study: 700- level (master's) and 800 -level (doctoral). Requirements may be different for students in the 700 - and 800- level cou rses. 3. A course may be cross -listed in two or more departments in order to provide an opportunity for students to collaborate and learn in an interdisciplinary environment. Cross -listing also provides a separate course number (e.g., BUS 341, COURSE NUMBERS 57 PHI 341 Busin ess Ethnics), so that student transcript indicate the discipline in which the student majored. Cross -listed courses appear in listings for each program with a notation that they are cross -listed. 4. An undergraduate or graduate course may be cross -listed wit h a PST prefixed course in order to provide educational opportunities for non- degree seeking students. The requirements for the PST section will be defined by the undergraduate or graduate section. Undergraduate and Graduate Credit Courses Courses listed in this catalog are credit courses which have been approved by the Faculty Governance process (either the Council on Undergraduate Education or the Council on Graduate Education). In general, they may be applied to Gallaudet University deg rees and graduate certificate programs, unless there is a specific restriction linked to a particular course. Undergraduate Non -Degree Courses Courses with numbers lower than 100 are remedial courses, offered in English and Mathematics. These courses may not be applied to Gallaudet University degrees. Professional Studies Courses Gallaudet University offers a wide range of professional studies courses that bear the prefix PST. PST courses carry Gallaudet University credit, but are not applied toward a Gallaudet University degree or certificate program. Degree seeking students often take PST classes to supplement their current studies, but credits earned will not be factored into the graduate or undergraduate GPA. Other universities and accrediting organiz ations may accept PST credits, but students wishing to transfer credits should check to determine the applicability of the coursework at their home institution. Some PST courses are offered as clusters that lead to professional certificates. Enrichment Co urses Summer and Enrichment Programs offers learning -for- pleasure courses throughout the academic year. Some courses offer students Continuing Education Credits (CEU's). Enrichment courses may not be applied toward Gallaudet University degree programs. Graduate Independent Study Courses Students may pursue independent coursework for academic credit through the opportunity to study one -on- one with an instructor possessing unique expertise in a field of study. An independent study course is offered at the di scretion of the proposed instructor, the program coordinator, and the department chair. There are two types of independent study - directed studies and individualized studies. Directed Studies Directed Study is designed to substitute an existing course not offered in the semester in which the student wishes to enroll. The material covered in a directed study course is the same as that covered in the existing course. Modifications may be necessary to deliver the content and assignments at an individual leve l, and not all courses can be modified. Courses that can be modified tend to be non -traditional courses (e.g. guided research courses, internships, practicums, and clinical duties). Directed study courses use original course titles as assigned by the depar tment and course numbers 799 for masters -level and 899 for doctoral -level classes. Directed studies may be substituted for core degree requirements at the program's discretion. Individualized Studies Individualized Study is intended to be an extension of an existing program of study. Providing the student with an opportunity to pursue/research a subject in a manner not possible in an existing course, an individualized study course's content should be supplemental to the curriculum and should align with pro gram -level student learning outcomes or domains. Individualized study courses use course numbers 799 for masters -level and 899 for doctoral -level classes. Individualized studies enable advanced study of a topic of interest to the student and the faculty m ember, not covered in the curriculum and may only satisfy elective course requirements.

Note : A completed Registrar's Office Graduate Student Independent Study Form (http://www.gallaudet.edu/registrar/forms ) and syllabus must be submitted to the Office of the Dean of the Graduate School before the add/drop period ends to register for an Independent Study.

Students assume an obligation to conduct themselves in a manner compatible with the University' s function as an educational institution. Students also have an obligation to report any suspected crime or serious violations of the University Code of Conduct to the Department of Public Safety or other appropriate University official, especially if such crimes or serious violations may result in significant harm to individuals or property loss or damage. To fulfill its functions of imparting and gaining knowledge, the University retains the right to maintain order within the University and to address, th rough appropriate disciplinary procedures, conduct that adversely affects the University community or the University's pursuit of its educational objectives. Student conduct is not considered in isolation within the University community but as an integr al part of the educational process. Developing citizenship, respect for others, and responsible social behavior are part of the University's commitment to the education of the whole person; it is expected that student behavior will reflect well on self, br ing credit to the University, and to contribute positively to student and University life. This includes upholding all published University policies, rules, and regulations. It is clear that in a community of learning, the willful disruption of the educ ational process, destruction of property and/or interference with the orderly processes of the University, or with the rights of other members of the University community, for example, cannot be tolerated. Ignorance of a rule or regulation will not be an acceptable defense, so we urge you to become familiar with the Student Code and the conduct expectations of Gallaudet University students in general.

At Gallaudet University, a service animal is defined as any dog that is individually trained to do work or perform tasks for the benefit of an individual with a disability, including a physical, sensory, psychiatric, intellectual, or other mental disability. Other species of animals, whether wild or domestic, trained or untrained, are not service animals for the purposes of this definition. The work or tasks performed by a service animal must be directly related to the handler's disability. The crime deterrent effects of an animal's presence and the provision of emotional support, well-being, comfort, or companionship do not constitute work or tasks for the purposes of this de finition. Owners of service animals must formally register the animal with the Service Animal Evaluator (service.animal@gallaudet.edu ) at least thirty (30) days prior to arriving on campus to allow for p rocessing and clearance. Gallaudet's policy on service animals can be at is committed to creating and maintaining a living and learning environment free from all forms of harassment, exploitation, intimidation, and/or violence, including sex discrimination, intimate partner abuse, stalking, all forms of sexual misconduct, and the D.C. crimes of intimate partner violence, intra -family violence, sexual abuse, and stalking. All members of the University community are expected to conduct themselves in a manner that demonstrates respect for the rights of others. The Gender -Based and Sexual Misconduct Policy and Procedures intend to define community expectations, SERVICE ANIMALS INTERIM GENDER -BASED AND SEXUAL MISCONDUCT POLICY AND PROCEDURES 65 to reaffirm these principles, and to provide recourse for those ind ividuals whose rights have been violated. Creating a safe environment is the responsibility of all members of the University community. The University is committed to addressing sexual misconduct, intimate partner abuse, stalking, and other forms of gender -based discrimination, fostering an environment that promotes prompt reporting of all types of sexual misconduct, intimate partner abuse, or stalking, and ensuring the prompt, fair and impartial resolution of all complaints from the initial assessment and investigation to the final outcome. Every member of the University community has a responsibility to become familiar with this policy and procedures. As a recipient of Federal funds, the University is required to comply with Title IX of the Higher Edu cation Amendments of 1972, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in education programs and activities. Sexual misconduct as defined in this policy, is a form of sex discrimination prohibited by Title IX and will not be tolerated at Gallaudet. Such discrimination includes, but is not limited to: sexual harassment, sexual misconduct (including sexual assault), sex or gender -based bullying, hazing, stalking, and intimate partner abuse (including domestic violence and dating violence). Resolution o f complaints of such discrimination is intended to bring an end to harassing or discriminatory conduct, prevent its recurrence and remedy the effects on the victim and the community. Gallaudet takes the necessary steps to reduce the need for reactive intervention by providing preventive and risk education and training and by preparing and disseminating educational print material, videos, workshops, training seminars and academic course offerings related to sexual misconduct, intimate partner abuse, and s talking. Gallaudet encourages reporting of incidents and also attempts to eliminate pressure that might lead students to choose to not report a sexual misconduct, intimate partner abuse, or stalking incident or to minimize its seriousness by providing a pr ocess whereby the parties involved are treated with dignity; privacy and confidentiality are maintained to the fullest extent possible; allegations of sexual misconduct, intimate partner abuse, and stalking are investigated promptly and thoroughly; and tha t students are provided with full support and assistance.

The Student Grievance Procedures rely on the good fa ith of all involved to achieve a reasonable resolution of grievable actions. C. Any student who believes he/she has grounds for a grievance shall make an attempt in good faith to resolve the problem through early informal discussion of the matter with the academic, administrative, or staff member directly involved. A timely response to the student's complaint should occur within fifteen (15) days of initial contact. Flexibility should be given or considered during times when school is not in session, during summer breaks, and if extenuating circumstances exist (e.g. medical emergencies, sabbaticals). D. If the student is not satisfied with the early informal discussion of the matter with the academic, administrative, or staff member directly involved, the student shall attempt to resolve the grievance through either of the following channels: 1. In the case of faculty, through the chairperson of the unit (department or program) that offers the course, and the unit's pertinent procedures, and if resolution stil l cannot be attained, the Dean of the School. 2. In the case of professional or support staff or administrative personnel, through the employee's supervisor, and if resolution still cannot be attained, through that person's immediate supervisor (or to a higher administrative authority), if feasible. E. The Student Grievance Coordinator, the grievant's academic advisor and/or the campus ombuds may be consulted for assistance at any point in these informal discussions if the grievant so desires. V. ALTERNATE AVENUES FOR NON - GRIEVABLE ACTIONS A. Student(s) can file a grievance against another student through the Office of Student Conduct (OSC) in Ely Center #103.

Students should follow the procedures for matters covered under other University p olicies that contain complaint, grievance, hearing, and/or appeal procedures (such as FERPA or the Academic Integrity Policy, for example). H. Non -grievable concerns can be brought to the campus ombuds. The Office of Ombuds is available as an informal, independent, impartial and confidential conflict management resource. Please click on this to go to the website for the Office of the Ombuds. I. WHISTLEBLOWER HOTLINE To support the Board of T rustees' mandate to report possible misconduct (known as \"whistleblower policy\"), the University and the Clerc Center have a whistleblower hotline through EthicsPoint . The Board's overarching goal is for people to sp eak up for a better Gallaudet -- to come forward with rule or policy violations or safety concerns so we can correct them. Please read the Section 1.15 Policy on Reporting Suspected Misconduc t (Whistleblower Policy) in the Gallaudet University Administration and Operations Manual. The link to the EthicsPoint website is: Ethics Point VI. STANDING TO FILE A GRIEVANCE A student has standing to file a grieva nce under these procedures if he/she is enrolled in a course or was a student during the semester (or summer/intersession) prior to the time of filing, provided that person has attempted to resolve his or her complaint informally through those procedures d iscussed in Section IV above. VII. INITIATION OF FORMAL GRIEVANCE PROCEDURES A. If a resolution of the problem is not achieved through the informal procedures, the student may request an official examination of the facts by presenting a completed grievance form to the Student Grievance Coordinator . To complete the form, the student must prepare a specific written statement of how the decision or action is unfair and harmful to the grievant and list the University policies, regulations, or rules that have been violated. A brief narrative (including the names of individuals and/or departments and how they are involved, specific dates, times, and other relevant information) is required to support the allegations made. The student should also specify the remedies requested. Remedies under these procedur es are generally limited to restoring losses suffered by a student or making changes in University policy, practice, procedures or training. Monetary damages, fines or penalties, or disciplinary action against an individual who is the subject of the grieva nce are not remedies available to the student under these guidelines. The Student Grievance Form may also be obtained from the Student Grievance Coordinator. The Student Grievance Coordinator may assist the student in preparing the grievance document to ensure its clarity. B. In addition, the Student Grievance Coordinator will determine if the grievance is a resubmission of a previously decided grievance. If t hat is the case, the student will be informed that the matter is not grievable. C. The Student Grievance Coordinator shall forward a copy of the completed Student Grievance Form submitted by the student to each member of the faculty, administration, or st aff named in the grievance, along with a copy of the Student Grievance Procedures. D. Within fifteen (15) business days (days that are not University recognized holidays, or weekends) of receipt of the completed form, the Student Grievance Coordinator shall verify on the Grievance Form confirming that informal efforts have been made to resolve the issue from the immediate supervisor and higher administrative authority. The completed form will be submitted by the Student Grievance Coordinator to the Chair of the Student Grievance Board. VIII. TIME LIMIT ON FILING A GRIEVANCE A grievance must be filed with the Student Grievance Coordinator no later than the end of the following semester after the occurrence of the action on which it is based. For example, an alleged grievance that occurred during the Spring semester can be filed before the end of the following Fall semester. IX. PROTECTION AGAINST RETALIATION Under no circumstances will the filing of a grievance result in retaliation by the party being grieved against or his/her department. Any student who has been retaliated against should contact the Student Grievance Coordinator immediately. If appropriate, the Department of Public Safety (DPS) should be contacted as well. X. STUDENT GRIEVANCE BOARD A. Composition: The Student Grievance Board will be composed of the Dean of Student Affairs, who is the non - voting Chair, and twenty -six members: six members of the faculty selected by the University Faculty Chair; six professional staff under Academic Affairs app ointed by the Provost; six professional staff appointed by the Vice President of Administration and Finance, four undergraduate students selected by the President of the Student Body Government (SBG), and four graduate students selected by the President of the Graduate Student Association (GSA). This Student Grievance Board serves as a pool, from which 5 -member hearing panels are 68 appointed. B. Training: All members of the Student Grievance Board will be trained on the hearing process. The training will be provided by Student Affairs and will be similar to the training given to Student Conduct Board members by the Office of Student Conduct. C. Qualification of Student Grievance Board Members: Faculty members must have tenure. Staff members must have been em ployed at Gallaudet for at least one year. Undergraduate students must have a minimum GPA of 2.7, be at least a junior, and must have no significant or recent disciplinary incidents, Graduate students must have no significant or recent disciplinary inciden ts. D. Term of Service: Members of the Student Grievance Board shall serve for one (1) calendar year and may be reappointed. E. To facilitate the grievance process, the Dean of Student Affairs and Academic Support appoints the Student Grievance Coordinat or, who serves as the support staff for the Student Grievance Board. F. Conflict of Interest: In the event of any conflict of interest which will be identified through self -declaration by any of the Board members regarding a particular potential grievance or by membership or affiliation with a department or program in which the grievant or respondent is a member of, the individual will recuse himself or herself from the Board on that matter. Panel members should have no personal interest in the outcome of the proceedings, and should not have any personal involvement in earlier stages of the matter. The Student Grievance Board Chair will rule on any challenges regarding conflict of interest. G. Maintenance of Records: The Student Grievance Coordinator will be responsible for maintaining all records of the Student Grievance Board. The records for each grievance will be maintained for a period of four (4) years after the final recommendation has been rendered. H. Legal Advice: The Chair of the Student Grievan ce Board, on behalf of the Board, may seek legal advice from the Office of Risk Management and Insurance and/or informal advice from the Ombuds. I. Student Grievance Hearing Panel 1. The Chair of the Student Grievance Board will appoint five Board members, none of whom may have a conflict of interest, which includes two teaching faculty members or professional staff (depending on whether the grievance is against a faculty or staff member), and two student members, to review a particular grievance. The appoin ted professional staff member will be a member of the Division of which the defendant is a member; while the appointed student members will be either graduate or undergraduate students, following the student status of the student filing the grievance. The fifth member could be a faculty member or a staff member, following the wishes of the defendant. The Chair of the Student Grievance Board will communicate the names of the members of the Student Grievance Hearing Panel to each party. The Chair of the Stude nt Grievance Board serves as the non -voting (and sixth) member and as the chair of the Student Grievance Hearing Panel. 2. Either party will have the right to exercise one preemptory challenge, in writing to the Chair of the Student Grievance Board within three academic days, against any of the chosen appointed members of the Student Grievance Hearing Panel. If such challenges are accepted by the Chair of the Student Grievance Board, the member(s) will be replaced. 69 XI. DETERMINATION OF GRIEVABILITY A. The Chai r will convene the Student Grievance Hearing Panel within fifteen (15) academic days after receiving the completed Student Grievance Form (see Appendix B) from the Student Grievance Coordinator confirming that efforts have been made to resolve the issue in formally. The Panel will determine by majority vote of those present whether the grievant has standing to file and whether a grievable act, as defined in these procedures, is alleged in the grievance filing. B. All parties involved in the grievance will b e notified in writing, by the Chair of the Student Grievance Board, as to the determination of grievability. A finding by the Panel that no grievable action is alleged or that the grievant lacks standing to file will conclude the proceedings. This determin ation by the Panel will be final. If the Panel finds that a grievable action is alleged and that the grievant has standing to file, the Chair will schedule a hearing to be held by the Student Grievance Panel within ten (10) academic days. XII. HEARING PROC EDURES A. The full five- member Student Grievance Hearing Panel and the Chair must be present for the hearing to proceed. All hearings will be closed to the public. Witnesses are to be present only during the time in which they are introduced at the beginni ng of the hearing or give their statement and will remain outside the hearing room until called. In a closed hearing, only the grievant and respondent, the advisors, and members of the Student Grievance Hearing Panel may be present. The grievant and respondent will be provided with the dates and times of the hearing and given the opportunity to hear any information presented. Should the respondent elect not to appear, it shall be held in the absence of the respondent. In such instances, all information in s upport of the grievance will be presented and considered in the absence of the respondent. If the grievant does not appear within a half hour of the scheduled hearing, the hearing proceedings will conclude. The complaint will be dismissed unless a valid ex cuse (as determined by the Student Grievance Hearing Panel) is presented within 48 hours. B. An advisor, with prior notification to the Chair of the Student Grievance Hearing Panel and the other party, may accompany either party to the dispute provided th at the advisor is a member of the campus community. A member of the campus community is defined as faculty or staff currently employed or full -time students currently enrolled in the University. The grievant and the respondent are each responsible for pres enting their own information and therefore, advisors are not permitted to speak or to participate directly in the hearing. Advisors may confer with the grievant/respondent only when there is not a question on the table or a response pending from either party. Failure of an advisor to appear for either party shall not constitute grounds for a continuance of the hearing. C. Either party to the grievance may bring witnesses to a hearing. The names of the witnesses will be provided to all parties prior to thei r appearance, but the unavailability of a witness shall not constitute grounds for a continuance of the hearing. Written or video statements may be permitted from witnesses unable to attend the hearing. Such statements must be made available in advance of the hearing. D. Prior to the hearing, both parties will have the right to inspect and review all information pertinent to the grievance. Formal rules of evidence are not applicable in Student Grievance hearings. Any information or testimony the Panel believes to be relevant may be considered. E. The Student Grievance Hearing Panel will determine whether the respondent is responsible for a grievable action as defined in these guidelines. The Panel's determination shall be made on the basis of whether it is more likely than not (preponderance of the evidence) that the respondent violated published policies, rules, or procedures, and if so, will make recommendations or offer remedies. The Panel will then prepare its written report, which will consist of the P anel's findings and recommendations. F. Within ten (10) academic days of the conclusion of the hearing, the Chair of the Student Grievance Hearing Panel will ensure that the Student Grievance Panel Report is completed, and shall send copies to the parties involved in the grievance, an appropriate senior administrator, and the Student Grievance Coordinator. XIII. DISCIPLINARY ACTION Although disciplinary action against an employee is not a remedy available to a student who files a grievance under these guid elines, the University reserves the right to impose discipline on its employees as a result of determinations made through the grievance process. Any such discipline will be imposed only after the Student Grievance Hearing Panel has completed its report and the appeal period has expired. Such discipline, if imposed, will be handled by the employee's supervisor, and may not be appealed by the employee under these grievance procedures. Such appeals will be made in accordance with appropriate staff or faculty procedures or guidelines. Such information is confidential and will not be shared with the student grievant at any time. 70 XIV. APPEALS A. Within ten working days after receipt of the Student Grievance Panel's decision, either party to the grievance may ap peal the decision to the Provost or the appropriate Vice -President receiving the report. The decision of the Student Grievance Panel may be appealed on the grounds that: 1. the Student Grievance Hearing was not conducted fairly and in conformity with prescribed procedures which made it unfair. However, deviations from designated procedures will not be a basis for submitting an appeal unless significant unfairness results, 2. the decision was not supported by substantial information; that is, the facts of the case were or were not sufficient to establish that a grievable action occurred, and/or 3. the recommended remedies to the student were insufficient or excessive. B. The appeal must be submitted in writing, must indicate the grounds in which he/she is appealing, a nd provide a clear rationale for appealing. The Chair of the Student Grievance Board will share relevant information and records of the hearing to the Provost or the appropriate Vice -President. There is no requirement that the person handling the appeal me et with the grievant or the respondent. The Provost or the appropriate Vice -President will make a final decision on the grievance within 15 working days of receiving the appeal. This decision will be in writing. The Provost or the appropriate Vice -Presiden t can uphold, modify, or reverse the decision of the Student Grievance Panel. XV. CONFIDENTIALITY OF GRIEVANCES A. All information in the grievance process is confidential and protected by the Federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, and cannot be further disclosed. B. All materials developed in the course of the grievance investigation and hearing will be placed in a confidential, non- personnel file, to be maintained by the Student Grievance Coordinator. None of these materials may be removed f rom the file or copied unless needed for compliance with appropriate administrative or legal requirements. These materials will not include any records of actions taken against an employee by the University as a result of the determination(s) made through the grievance process. XVI. FALSE GRIEVANCES The purpose of these guidelines is to provide a mechanism to address legitimate student complaints and grievances. However, false grievances undermine the purpose and effectiveness of these guidelines/this polic y. Accordingly, persons who knowingly bring false grievances may be subject to disciplinary action through the Office of Student Conduct. Allegations of false grievances must be reported within 30 working days after the grievance was resolved. The fact tha t a grievance may not result in a finding that an employee has violated a University policy, rule, or procedure, or has otherwise acted in a manner resulting in unfair treatment of a student is not alone sufficient information that the grievance was knowingly false. XVII. PROVISIONS FOR AMENDING THE GRIEVANCE GUIDELINES/POLICY Authority to amend these Student Grievance Procedures rests with the Provost in consultation with the Gallaudet University Faculty Senate, Staff Advisory Council, Student Body Governm ent and Graduate Student Association. Approved - September 3, 2010 71 Catalog Year Requirements Candidates for bachelor's degrees are expected to graduate under general studies provisions of the catalog in effect at the time of admission. Students must complete the requirements of a major/minor based on the catalog year requirements in effect for that major/minor at the time of declaration of the major/minor. Transfer and readmitted students are expected to follow the catalog ye ar requirements in effect at the time of readmission for both the general curriculum chosen and the major/minor. Each academic department has its own criteria that govern the courses needed to satisfy the remaining degree requirements. A readmitted studen t must receive approval for general studies and general elective credits from his/her academic advisor and the director of Academic Advising. For major courses, students must receive approval from the major department chair and the Dean of their college. Declaration of Major Students are expected to declare a major officially after satisfactorily completing 50 college degree semester hours (not including institutional credits). Transfer students with more than 50 degree hours may complete one year of residency before declaring a major. Students who have completed pre -major courses and who have decided on a major during their first year are strongly encouraged to declare a major as early as possible. For timely progress to graduation, some majors require comp letion of particular major courses within the first two years. For instance, students pursuing Bachelor of Science degrees in science, mathematics, and information technology should begin specific coursework in their first year and are best served by decla ring their majors early. Double Major Students desiring a double major will be advised in each major by the advisor in each of the departments of their major choices. A student may receive two different degrees simultaneously. If the requirements are compl eted for a degree outside of the student's declared major, the student's transcript will reflect the fact, although a second degree will not be awarded. Undergraduate Students in Graduate Courses Under certain conditions, undergraduate students may enroll for graduate classes. In general, this requires advanced undergraduate standing, permission of the academic advisor, and permission of the department and instructor offering the course. Undergraduate students in graduate classes must complete exactly the same requirements as graduate students. In addition, undergraduate students must have met all prerequisite requirements for the graduate course in which they wish to enroll. If the graduate class is to be used to fulfill requirements of a bachelor's degre e, the same credits may not be applied to a graduate degree from Gallaudet University later. If the credits are to be applied to a graduate degree, they should be excluded from the undergraduate credit count. Graduate Students in Undergraduate Courses Und er certain conditions, graduate students may enroll for undergraduate classes. In general, this requires permission of the department and instructor offering the course. Graduate students in undergraduate classes must complete exactly the same requirements as undergraduate students. In addition, graduate students must have met all prerequisite requirements for the undergraduate course in which they wish to enroll. Undergraduate courses will not be counted towards either the total credits earned or any of the graduate degree requirements. Second Undergraduate Degrees First Degree from Gallaudet To satisfy the requirements for a second baccalaureate degree at Gallaudet University, a student must complete a minimum of 30 additional semester hours after satisfyi ng requirements for the first degree, and he or she must also satisfy the requirements of a major other than the major declared for the first baccalaureate. Grade points earned in the first degree will not apply in determining the scholastic eligibility wh ile a student is enrolled for a second degree. No student, however, will be permitted to complete the second degree under a catalog or supplement issued more than three years prior to the date of completion of the second degree. A student returning to Gall audet for a second degree must submit a letter from the appropriate department chair granting permission to enroll in that major. UNDERGRADUATE POLICIES 72 First Degree from Another Institution Students who have previously earned a B.A., B.S., or higher degree from another colleg e or university must satisfy only the second B.A. or B.S. degree's major requirements and the major prerequisites. Grade points earned in the previous degree(s) will not apply in determining scholastic eligibility while a student is enrolled for a second d egree. Students who have previously taken courses at another college or university may request from the appropriate department chairperson that these courses be transferred. Lower -Division Students Students with Conditions who are required to take non -credit courses in English and/or Mathematics Freshmen who have earned 24 or fewer semester credits Sophomores who have earned 25 -55 semester credits Upper -Division Students Juniors who have earned 56 -89 semester credits Seniors who have earned 90 or more semester credits Second baccalaureate students who possess a recognized baccalaureate degree and are enrolled in an undergraduate degree program Full -Time Undergraduate Student minimum of 12 credits per semester maximum o f 19 credits per semester, unless the student obtains permission from the Academic Dean of the college or school Part -Time Undergraduate Student less than 12 credits per semester Not eligible for dormitory residence, unless the student obtains permission t o reside in a dormitory from the Director of Residence Life and Dean of Student Affairs. Degree- Seeking Undergraduate Student Degree- seeking students are those admitted for undergraduate study and pursuing a program of study leading to an undergraduate de gree. Undergraduate Students with Conditions Students admitted with English conditions may be allowed to take 100 -level or higher courses with permission from their academic advisor, based on a list of courses approved by the academic departments. Students admitted with conditions have two semesters to satisfy the criteria established by the English Department and Mathematics Program for placement in general studies courses (credit -bearing courses). Exceptions can be made by the Conditions Review Committee . The Condition Review Committee will evaluate the student's progress, review the recommendations of the chairs of the English Department or the Mathematics Program, and make recommendations about continued enrollment. Non -Degree Special Undergraduate Stud ent Special students are those who are enrolled in undergraduate courses, but are not pursuing a program of study leading to an undergraduate degree. Students must request special student status from the Registrar's Office each semester. Non -degree speci al students are not limited in the number of semesters they may attend Gallaudet. If special students later wish to apply for admission to the undergraduate program, they must satisfy the requirements for undergraduate admission. Visiting Undergraduate Stu dent Students currently enrolled at another college, university, or community college may take courses at Gallaudet for up to two semesters and transfer all credits earned back to their home institutions. Visiting students often attend Gallaudet in order t o enhance their current understanding of and involvement within the deaf community. Requirements for visiting students are: sophomore, junior, or senior status at their home institution a GPA of at least 2.5 or higher working knowledge of American Sign Language (ASL) UNDERGRADUATE STUDENT CLASSIFICATIONS 73 Exchange Undergraduate Student Students currently attending Oberlin College in Oberlin, Ohio or McDaniel College in Westminster, Maryland may attend Gallaudet through the Exchange Student Program for one semester. Requirements for exchange students are: junior or senior status at their home institution a GPA of 3.0 or higher working knowledge American Sign Language (ASL) Approved by CUE 1/29/2013 The unit of semester credit is defined as university -level credit that is awarded for completion of coursework, the transfer of coursework from another institution, or the evaluation of college -level prior learning. One credit hour (at least 50 minutes) reflects an amount of work represented in the intended learning outcomes and verified by evidence of student achievement for these learning outcomes. A credit hour is awarded on the basis of one of three sets of criteria. 1. For in -class courses: The completion of one credit hour of classroom or direct faculty instruction and a minimum of two credit hours of out- of-class student work each week for one semester (15 weeks); or 2. For online, hybrid, and accelerated courses: The com pletion of an equivalent amount of faculty instruction and student work, as stipulated above in paragraph (1), that may occur over a different amount of time; or 3. For other academic activities: The completion of an institutionally sanctioned academic activi ty (e.g., externship, practicum, internship, independent study, studio work, laboratory work, fieldwork, and pre -dissertation/thesis work) that is equivalent to the amount of work stipulated in paragraph (1), that may occur over a different amount of time. Traditional in -class Credit Bearing Course or Online Course (Per Semester) Non -Traditional Credit Bearing Experience (e.g. Internship, Independent Study) (Per Semester) Credit Hours Earned Minimum amount of Instruction Time Required Minimum Amount of Time Required Outside of Class/Instruction Time Amount of Time required for all Activities (Note: this is the same as the previous two columns combined) 1 Credit 12.5 hours 25 hours 37.5 hours 2 Credits 25 hours 50 hours 75 hours 3 Credits 37.5 hours 75 hours 112.5 hours 4 Credits 50 hours 100 hours 150 hours 5 Credits 62.5 hours 125 hours 187.5 hours For example, in a three credit hour traditional in -class course, students spend 150 minutes in class per week for 15 weeks, resulting in 37.5 contact hours for the semester. Students are expected to engage in reading and other assignments outsides of class for at least 5 hours per week, which adds up to 75 hours. These two sums should result in total student engagement time of 112.5 hours for the course. In a three credit internship, these hours may be allotted differently. For example, the student may spe nd 1 hour a week for 15 weeks in meetings with their supervisor, work at their placement 4 hours a week for 15 weeks, and spend at least 37.5 hours during the semester on planning and documentation. The total student engagement time is the same (i.e., at l east 112.5 hours). Note that these time SEMESTER CREDIT HOUR POLICY 74 allotments are minimums, not maximums. All credit -bearing experiences (except dissertation -related hours/courses) require syllabi, which will include the number of credit hours, class meeting times or minimum numbe r of hours required at an alternative site, and a schedule of required assignments. Students enrolled in undergraduate programs must be registered for classes continuously from the time of admission until the completion of all degree requirements. Summer sessions in which there are no program requirements are not included. Students must be enrolled during the semester they complete the requirements of an incomplete course. The only status options for a student wishing to take no courses during an academic semester are \"leave of absence\" (LOA) or withdrawal from the university. If the student withdraws from the university, the student must reapply in order to return to the university. Undergraduate students may register f or UCE 499 if they have met the University's criteria for \"Continuous Enrollment.\" Registration for Continuous Enrollment must be completed through the Registrar's Office with an approval signature from the student's major advisor. The fee for a semester o f registration with UCE 499 Continuous Enrollment is $100. Staff and faculty who register for Continuous Enrollment are also assessed the $100 fee. UCE 499 Continuous Enrollment may be taken only once, and earns a student no credit. Students who register for Continuous Enrollment receive a grade of NG (no grade) at the end of the semester. A continuous enrollment status may not be continued for a second consecutive semester, and if requirements for degree award are not satisfied in the approved Continuous Enrollment period, the student will be denied degree(s) and must reapply to complete their program. Failure to enroll in courses in any given semester, including Continuous Enrollment, will result in termination from the University. A student wishing to return later will need to apply for readmission to Gallaudet University The following grading system applies to undergraduate courses. Grade Quality Points per hour of credit Used in GPA Suggested Equivalence Definition A 4.0 Yes 93 and above Excellent A- 3.7 Yes 90-92 B+ 3.3 Yes 87-89 B 3.0 Yes 83-86 Good B- 2.7 Yes 80-82 C+ 2.3 Yes 77-79 C 2.0 Yes 73-76 Satisfactory C- 1.7 Yes 70-72 D+ 1.3 Yes 67-69 D 1.0 Yes 60-66 Poor F 0.0 Yes Below 60 Failing XF 0.0 Yes Academic Integrity Policy Violation INC 0.0 No Incomplete NG 0.0 No No Grade (UCE499) P 0.0 No Pass NP 0.0 No No Pass (No Credit) IP 0.0 No In Progress (No Credit) UNDERGRADUATE CONTINUOUS ENROLLMENT UNDERGRADUATE GRADING SYSTEM 75 WD 0.0 No Withdraw (No Credit) AU 0.0 No Audit (No Credit) ANC 0.0 No Audit Not Completed (No Credit) NS 0.0 No Not Yet Submitted Incomplete (INC) Grades A grade of Incomplete (INC) is given when a portion of a student's required coursework has not been completed and evaluated at the end of the semester due to illness, or other unforeseen, but fully justified reasons, and earning credit is still possible. When this is the case, the INC form (available electronically at Faculty Center in Bison ), including required supporting documentation and signatures, must be submitted to the registrar's office before the last da y of classes. A student will not receive an incomplete grade for poor, incomplete, or failing work, or willful non -attendance of class. Students with an INC grade must complete the coursework and receive a grade by the end of the seventh week of the follo wing traditional semester. Incomplete grades given during summer school must be removed during the following fall semester. Otherwise, the \"INC\" grade automatically becomes an \"F\". The time for removing an incomplete grade may be extended one time. The student must petition for an extension prior to the deadline following the reported incomplete. The student must have the approval of the course instructor, academic advisor, and dean of the school in which the student is enrolled. Pass (P) and No Pass (N P) Grades Pass and No Pass grades are assigned only in courses approved for such grading. Regular letter grades apply to all other courses. To earn credit in a Pass -No Pass course, a student must receive a grade of \"P.\" In Progress (IP) Grades For certai n approved courses, an In Progress grade (\"IP\") is given to students who make satisfactory progress but who do not yet have sufficient skill to pass the course or skills examination. Upon completion of the course, a final grade is assigned for that semeste r. However, the former IP grade(s) will not be deleted from the student's record. Grades for Repeated Courses Students may repeat a course once. Both attempts will appear on the student's transcript, but only the attempt with the higher grade will be used for computing the credit and grade earned for the course. With approval of the student's department chair or program director, an equivalent consortium course may be taken to replace the course taken at Gallaudet. Change of Grade A change of grade may be made only in the case of a clerical or other administrative grading error. An appeal for a change of grade must be initiated by the student and must be approved by the instructor, department chair, and academic Dean. Grade Reports Grade reports are availab le for students to view and print in BISON . Grade Point Average (GPA) The GPA is calculated by dividing the total grade points by the total number of credit hours for courses receiving letter grades. F or each letter -grade -bearing course, the grade points are obtained by multiplying grade equivalent (4.0 - 0.0) and credit hours. Only grades for courses taken at Gallaudet University, through the Consortium of Universities of the Washington Metropolitan Ar ea, or through approved exchange programs are used in GPA calculations. Transfer credit grades are not calculated into your Gallaudet GPA. GPA is noted in grade reports and permanent student records. There are two kinds of grade point averages in use at Gallaudet University: Degree GPA and Institutional GPA. Degree Grade Point Average (DGPA) The DGPA includes the letter grades from all courses numbered 100 to 699. DGPA is calculated for students enrolled in degree courses (with no more than one non - degree course). The DGPA is used to determine academic standing, eligibility for graduation (cumulative DGPA 2.0 or better), Dean's list (semester DGPA), and/or for degree with distinction (cumulative DGPA). Institutional Grade Point Average (IGPA) The Instituti onal Grade Point Average includes the letter grades from all undergraduate courses, including non- degree courses numbered below 100 (developmental mathematics and English language courses). The IGPA is only calculated for students who are enrolled in non -degree English classes and is used to determine academic standing. 76 President's Scholars Undergraduate students whose cumulative degree grade point averages (GPA) are 3.4 or above for the preceding semesters and who have earned at least 15 degree credits at Gallaudet are recognized as President's Scholars. Students whose overall cumulative GPAs are 3.8 or above are given the distinction of being named Summa Cum Laude Scholars; students whose cumulative GPAs are 3.6 and above are named Magna Cum Laude Scholars; and those with cumulative GPAs of 3.4 or above are named Cum Laude Scholars. Dean's List Juniors, seniors, second -degree -seeking students, visiting students whose semester GPAs are 3.5 or above, and freshmen and sophomores w hose semester GPAs are 3.25 or above are placed on the Dean's List for that semester, as long as the student did not receive a failing or incomplete grade in any course taken in that semester. A student must have earned at least 12 degree credit hours in a semester to be eligible for the Dean's List. An exception to this rule is made for some majors in education doing student teaching. Degree with Distinction Those students who graduate with a degree GPA of 3.8 or higher shall receive their degrees summa cu m laude; for those at 3.6 or above, magna cum laude; and for those at 3.4 or above, cum laude. One -half of the course hours required for graduation (60 credit hours) must be taken at Gallaudet. The only exception to the 60 credit hour minimum is for first-degree transfer students who have earned 40 - 59 semester hours at Gallaudet; these students will be awarded a degree with the appropriate distinction only if their GPA from Gallaudet and their GPA from all institutions previously attended meet the cumul ative GPA requirements stated above. Degree with Honors Degrees may be given with General University Honors, University Capstone Honors, Departmental Honors, or a combination. General University Honors and Capstone University Honors are awarded to students who have completed courses prescribed by the Honors Program. Departmental Honors are awarded to students who have completed the honors requirements prescribed by a department. Academic Integrity Defined Academic integrity grows from the longstanding traditions of the world university community. Academic integrity is defined as a firm adherence to the code or standard of values of the University and the individual professions. - Academic freedom is a commitment on t he part of students, faculty, staff, and administrators even in the face of adversity, to five fundamental values: honesty, truth, fairness, respect, and responsibility. Commitment to academic honesty encourages the mutual respect and moral integrity that our University community values and nurtures. Standards of the University Related to Undergraduate Students' Academic Integrity Undergraduate students must demonstrate behaviors that are consistent with th e standards of the University as published in the Gallaudet Undergraduate Catalog, the Student Handbook, and the academic departments and academic support units. These behaviors include, but are not limited to, tact, civility, sensitivity to the needs and interests of others, sound judgment, respect for others, and timely attention to academic responsibilities. Failure to meet these standards reflects adversely upon the undergraduate student's suitability for academic study and may be grounds for dismissal from the University. The University can function properly only if its members adhere to clearly established and articulated values related to academic integrity. Undergraduate students enrolled in graduate courses are subject to the Graduate School Academ ic Integrity Policy. UNDERGRADUATE ACADEMIC HONORS UNDERGRADUATE ACADEMIC INTEGRITY POLICY UNDERGRADUATE ACADEMIC INTEGRITY STUDENT STANDARDS 77 Graduate students enrolled in undergraduate courses are also subject to the Graduate School Academic Integrity Policy. Faculty, students, staff, and administrators share equally in the responsibility for maintaining standards related t o academic integrity. Violations of Academic Integrity Violations of academic integrity reflect negatively on the undergraduate student, the academic program, and the University; thus, academic dishonesty in all its forms cannot be tolerated. Academic integrity encompasses many principles: respect for intellectual property, fair use, and adherence to the canons of scientific inquiry and reporting. Academic integrity may be violated any number of ways. Common examples of academically dishonest behavior include, but are not limited to, the following: Cheating Cheating is the intentional use of or attempt to use unauthorized materials, information, or study aids in any academic exercise. This may include, but is no t limited to: copying from another student's work; representing material prepared by another as one's own work; submitting the same work in more than one course without prior permission of the instructors; using electronic devices to communicate and/or access information during exams; procuring or using stolen evaluation materials; violating rules governing the administration of examinations; or violating any rules relating to academic conduct of a course or program. Fabrication or Misrepresentation Fabrication is the provision or use of any false or altered information, data or citation in an academic exercise. Misrepresentation is giving incorrect or misleading information or failing to disclose relevant information. Fabrication or misrepresentation of academic records may include, but is not limited to: making a false statement regarding one's academic credentials, concealing material information, and/or forging someone else's signature, forging a University academic document or record (also a crime ), tampering with computer records, falsifying academic information on one's resume, and/or falsifying communications about class absences, missing assignments, exams or other course expectations and requirements. Plagiarism Plagiarism is the use or repres entation of the words, ideas, or sequence of ideas of another as one's own in any academic exercise. Information stored on a computer system or portable device or sent electronically over a network is the private property of the individual who created it. Dissemination of information, without authorization from the owner of said information, is a violation of the owner's right to control his or her own property and is considered a form of attempted theft. Plagiarism may include, but is not limited to: copy ing another person's paper, article, computer work, or assignment and submitting it as one's own; quoting, paraphrasing, or summarizing and utilizing someone else's ideas without attribution; copying or downloading (cyber -plagiarism), in part or in whole, articles or research papers or using ideas or information found from other sources and not giving proper attribution. Facilitation of Academic Dishonesty Facilitation of academic dishonesty is to knowingly or passively allow one's work to be used by anoth er without appropriate attribution. It also includes participation in or the failure to report known or suspected instances of academic dishonesty. UNDERGRADUATE ACADEMIC INTEGRITY VIOLATIONS 78 Impeding Academic Progress Impeding academic progress includes, but is not limited to: denying others acc ess to scholarly resources; providing false or misleading information; making library material unavailable to others by stealing or defacing books or journals or by deliberately misplacing or destroying materials; or altering electronic files that belong to another without prior permission. Computer Misconduct Computer misconduct is the violation of rules regarding appropriate computer usage, as established by Gallaudet Technology Services (GTS). XF Transcript Course Grade Notation for Violations of Academic Integrity An instructor who determines that the appropriate sanction for a student who has violated academic integrity is a failing grade for the course may record a grade of \"XF.\" For purposes of grade point average calculation, an XF will be treated in the same way as an \"F.\" The XF grade shall be recorded on the student's transcript with the notation \"Failure Due to Violation of the University's Academi c Integrity Policy\". XF grades must be reported to the instructor's department chair. No student who has a grade of XF shall be allowed to participate in any university -sponsored extracurricular activity or organization until the XF is removed. GSPP or CL AST Dean will notify the Registrar, the student's academic advisor(s), all relevant program directors, coaches, and faculty/staff advisors of student organizations regarding a student's XF grade and their ineligibility to participate in extracurricular act ivities until further notice. The student can appeal the XF grade by following the same procedures described in the Post -Department Student Appeals Process above. After an XF grade has appeared on the student's transcript for twelve months, the student may request to have the XF grade removed. A request to remove the XF grade from the transcript will only be considered by the Academic Integrity Committee if the student has not been found responsible for any other action of academic dishonesty or similar dis ciplinary offense at Gallaudet University or any other institution. The student's request should include a written explanation of the reason(s) the XF should be removed. The Academic Integrity Committee is not obligated to approve the student's request. I n this instance, the XF grade remains on the student's transcript. If the student repeats the course, and the XF has not been removed by the previous process, both the new grade and XF will appear on the transcript. If the course has not been repeated with a passing grade and the appeal to remove the XF grade is approved, the student's XF course grade converts to an \"F\" grade. If the student repeats the course, and the XF has been removed, the new course grade replaces the XF. Department, Faculty, and Student Responsibilities Related to Academic Integrity: University -wide Responsibilities The above provisions are general, and apply to all academic units. Any member of the Gallaudet community who witnesses a violation of academic integrity is responsible for reporting these violations to the Academic Integrity Committee. Academic Department Responsibilities Academic departments and support units will inform their undergraduate students of the standards of acad emic integrity and of practices of responsible research and scholarship of their discipline. This information will be disseminated through a combination of mediums such as student handbooks, the Gallaudet Undergraduate Catalog, and related websites. Specif ic departmental responsibilities include the following: informing students about their responsibility to understand the Academic Integrity Policy in the Gallaudet Undergraduate Catalog and to strictly adhere to it. All academic departments will include a s ection on their syllabi referring to the academic integrity policy and the expectation that students adhere to this policy. informing students where the applicable professional code of ethics can be accessed and the need to adhere to those codes. informing students about the procedures and channels of communication within the department related to academic integrity complaints and appeals. UNDERGR ADUATE ACADEMIC INTEGRITY COURSE GRADES UNDERGRADUATE ACADEMIC INTEGR ITY RESPONSIBILITIES 79 Academic Support Unit Responsibilities Staff who work in academic support units (e.g., Academic Advising, Office for S tudents with Disabilities, Career Center, Academic Technology, Tutorial and Instructional Services) are responsible for reinforcing the policies of academic integrity. Specific academic support service responsibilities include: informing students about t heir responsibility to understand the Academic Integrity Policy in the Gallaudet Undergraduate Catalog and to strictly adhere to it. informing students where the applicable professional code of ethics can be accessed and the need to adhere to those ethics . Staff are also responsible for reporting incidents of academic integrity violations to the course instructor(s). Procedures for addressing suspected violations of the academic integrity policy outside the context of a particular course are the same as t hose described for suspected violations occurring within a course. If the incident is not course related, staff should report it to the appropriate unit head or Dean. Sample incidents include but are not limited to: forgery on documents (e.g. advising forms, resumes, etc.); use of unauthorized aids (e.g. calculators, notes) during an examination; suspected duplication of assignments; or suspected misuse of technology Faculty Responsibilities Faculty will determine the content, organization, and cond uct of their courses and adhere to the published content of such courses as they appear in the current year's Gallaudet Undergraduate Catalog. In the classroom, faculty will encourage students to engage in free inquiry and open expression of reasonably rel ated content. They will inform students of the content, schedule, requirements, evaluation procedures, and grading policies employed in the course and of times, outside of class, when they are available for student consultation. Faculty will evaluate stude nts fairly and without bias. Evaluation will adhere to the course goals, design, and timeframe described in the course syllabi. They will provide appropriate and timely feedback to the student about the quality of their work. Faculty will include expectations of academic honesty in their syllabi with references to the Academic Integrity Policy in the catalog. They will model the appropriate application of the principles of academic integrity in the presentation of classroom materials and will make all reaso nable efforts to promote academic integrity through course and evaluation design, protection of materials, testing environment, and regular revision of evaluation materials. Faculty will deal with suspected instances of academic dishonesty in accordance wi th University policy. Student Responsibilities Undergraduate students are responsible for reading them Gallaudet Undergraduate Catalog, including the Academic Integrity Policy in this catalog, and are expected to engage in free inquiry and open expression of subjects reasonably related to the content of the course. They will familiarize themselves with the content, schedule, requirements, evaluation procedures, and grading policies employed in each of the courses in which they are enrolled. Students have th e right to, and are encouraged to, talk to the person and/or the relevant department chair or unit director, if they have a concern that a faculty member, staff member or student may have violated the academic integrity policy. Undergraduate students will participate in class activities as defined by the faculty member for purposes of facilitating academic or professional development. They will complete course requirements on time and in a manner consistent with the course requirements. Undergraduate studen ts will make all reasonable efforts to promote academic integrity, by refraining from dishonest practices and by reporting known instances of dishonesty to the appropriate faculty person. Students are subject to the actions brought by faculty who suspect i nstances of academic dishonesty or other breaches of academic standards. Students may appeal such faculty actions through the undergraduate student appeals process described in the section called \"Student Responses to Academic Integrity Violation Allegations.\" Procedures for Handling Suspected Violation(s) of Academic Integrity Occurring Within or Outside Course Violations of Academic Integrity in Classes A course instructor who suspects a student of academic dishonesty has the obligation to deal with the situation directly and quickly. The instructor will meet with the student to discuss the perceived violation and to determine what, if any, extenuating circumstances exist. The UNDERGRADUATE ACADEMIC INTEGRITY PROCEDURES 80 sanctions imposed and remedies recom mended depend upon the circumstances surrounding the incident and the severity of the offense. Sanctions may include: failing an assignment, receiving a reduced grade in the course, or other academic sanctions deemed to be appropriate. The instructor may also decide to impose more severe sanctions, such as: failure of the course resulting in the grade of XF (indicates violation of academic integrity policy) or recommendation for suspension or dismissal from the University. Remedies may include: requiring a substitute assignment, repeating the assignment under supervised conditions, and other academic remedies deemed appropriate. The instructor or staff member is required to prepare a written letter to the student detailing the charge(s) and the sanctions a nd/or remedies. The letter will state clearly: the nature of the offense, the date of the offense or the date it was discovered, evidence to support the offense, the date and nature of the meeting with the student to address the offense, the proposed sanction, any proposed remedy that is required of the student, and the expected outcomes of the remedy. The letter to the student will be hand delivered or sent to the campus post office where the student must sign to receive the letter (electronic messa ges are not acceptable for this purpose) to the student within five academic days after meeting with the student. Copies of the letter must be sent to the academic advisor, program director (if appropriate), department chair, and the academic dean. All sanctions except the recommendation for suspension or dismissal can be resolved between the faculty or staff member and the student. If there is a recommendation for suspension or dismissal, department procedures for recommending suspension or dismissal are f ollowed. All recommendations for suspension or dismissal are sent to the Academic Integrity Committee by the department chair. Violations of Academic Integrity Outside of the Class Context Procedures for addressing suspected violations of the academic inte grity policy outside the context of a particular course are the same as those described above for suspected violations occurring within a course. The exception is that the faculty member, staff member, or student contacts the appropriate course instructor or unit head, depending on the nature of the offense, who will meet with the accused student. The department chair or unit head will evaluate the merits of the complaint by interviewing both the complainant and the student who is being accused. If the violation is verified, the department chair or unit head will proceed as described above by preparing a formal letter with copies to the appropriate academic dean and the advisor. Staff working in academic units (e.g., Academic Advising, OSWD,Career Center, Ac ademic Technology, and Tutorial and Instructional Programs, etc.) are responsible for informing students about their need to understand the Academic Integrity Policy in the Gallaudet Undergraduate Catalog and to strictly adhere to it. Appeal Process The student has the option of appealing to the department chair or unit head within ten academic days if he or she disagrees with the accuser's decision. If the person accusing a student of a violation of academic integrity is the department chair, or if a department chair or unit head is proposing sanctions or violations, a student's appeal should be made to the Academic Integrity Committee. Petition for Appeals should include: a clear rationale for the appeal, al ong with all appropriate documents that support the rationale for the appeal. the written statement of sanctions or remedies imposed by the faculty member, the written decision of the accuser, and all relevant communications. a statement of the student's d esired outcome of the appeal (e.g., dismissal of the charge, modification of sanction or remedies imposed), or if the student is proposing an alternative plan for remediation. Appeals to Department Chairs and Unit Heads The department chair or unit head ev aluates the student's appeal in terms of: whether the sanctions or remedies were arbitrary or capricious; whether the accuser followed the Academic Integrity Policy and whether the student had adequate advance notice and opportunity to respond. If the UNDERGRADUATE ACADEMIC INTEGRITY APPEALS 81 depa rtment chair or unit head wishes to have an in person meeting with the accuser and the student to discuss the appeal, the student has the right to bring an advocate to this meeting (Qualifications and roles of the advocate are explained later in this polic y). The department chair or unit head decides whether or not to support the student appeal and responds in writing to the student and instructor or staff member within ten academic days after receipt of the written appeal. Copies of the decision will be se nt to others copied by the instructor or staff member in the original letter as well as the student's major chair or academic advisor. The student has the option of appealing to the Academic Integrity Committee within ten academic days if he or she disagrees with the department chair or unit head's decision The appeal should include any information the student deems to be important to counter the allegation of a violation of academic integrity. The accuser has the option of appealing to the Academic Integ rity Committee within ten academic days if he or she disagrees with the department chair or unit head's decision.

Appeals to the Academic Integrity Committee The Academic Integrity Committee will review letters of appeal and any additional documentation [e.g., letters to student from faculty member, program director (if appropriate), and department chair]. The committee may decide: (1) to refuse the appeal, in which case the recommendation made by the department chair or unit head will stand, or (2) to accept the appeal, and conduct a hearing to address the appeal. All committee decisions will be communicated i n writing to the student within ten academic days. The Academic Integrity Committee chair hand delivers a letter to the student and all parties or sends the letter through the campus post office where the student must sign to receive the letter. The Commit tee will communicate in writing to all parties within ten academic days, after receiving written materials from the accused student. The Academic Integrity Committee is empowered to modify sanctions and remedies based on their review. These modifications may be more severe than the initial sanctions or remedies and could include a recommendation for suspension or dismissal from the University. The student or accuser may appeal to the dean of the school in which the department resides (i.e. GSPP or CLAST) i f he or she disagrees with the decision of the Academic Integrity Committee. Appeals to the Dean The dean will review letters of appeal and any additional documentation [e.g., letters to student from faculty member, program director (if appropriate), depar tment chair, and the Academic Integrity Committee].

The Acade mic Integrity Committee is empowered to modify sanctions and remedies based on their review. These modifications may be more severe than the initial sanctions or remedies and could include a recommendation for suspension or dismissal from the University. A student requests a removal of the XF grade from their transcript (see \" XF Transcript Course Grade Notation for Violations of Academic Integrity \"). A department chair recommends suspension or dismissal from the University as a consequence for academic integrity violations. The academic dean informs the committee chair of two or more incidents of academic integrity violations by a student. The committee reviews letters documenting infractions p rovided by the academic dean. One of two actions may take place: (1) The committee may decide that the infractions were handled appropriately and no further action is required; or (2) The committee may decide there is reason to be concerned about recurring offenses of academic integrity and conduct a hearing, which may result in additional sanctions, including suspension or dismissal from the university. Conduct of Meeting of the Committee A regular time is reserved for meetings of the Academic Integrity Committee, as agreed by committee members; however, the committee members will convene to perform their functions (above) or to engage in training and preparation. All meetings are held in the strictest confidence. Records of the meetings are kept in the o ffice of the academic deans. The decision/outcome of the meeting will be communicated to the department chair, program director (if applicable), advisor, and faculty member following the hearing described in number eight below. Reports to CUE are of general nature, for example, types of incidents and how they were resolved. At least three members (two faculty and one student) must be present to conduct a hearing. The Academic Integrity Committee chair presides over all meetings. The dean of CLAST provides clerical support to keep records and assist with documentation and letters following each meeting. Meetings must be held within ten academic days upon receiving an action item. During the Academic Integrity Committee hearing, the student and the instructor will present their case. The student has the right to bring witnesses and an advocate to the hearing. The advisor, program director and department chair may be included if pertinent. The Academic Integrity Committee's decision will be communicated by letter to all parties. The letter will be hand delivered or sent to the campus post office where the student must sign to receive the letter. Copies will be sent to the instructor, department chair or program director, the Registrar and the Dean of the college from which the action originated. Qualifications and role of the advocate: The advocate's primary role is one of moral support for the accused. The advocate must be a member of the Gallaudet staff, faculty, or student body. During any meetings, the advocat e is only allowed to address the accused and may not directly address any other members of the meeting or hearing.

World Language and Cultures Department: Career Center stipends for International Study: The Career Center awarded these stipends to support the students' work with Deaf communities abroad. The students were selected by the World Languages and Cultures department based on their academic excellence and the quality of their international internship projec ts. 87 Good Academic Standing A student is in good academic standing when the student maintains a cumulative grade point average of 2.0 or better. Assessing Academic Progress Students have the right and responsibility to seek f eedback about their academic performance from their instructors and academic advisors at any time during the academic term. Immediately after the sixth week of a fall or spring semester (or after the third week of an eight- week online session), academic p rogress reports are sent to all students. Students having any problems, or performing below a \"C\" level in any course, should confer with their instructors and academic advisors. These reports are not noted in official transcripts. In addition, students wi th semester GPAs below 2.0 will be alerted on their end of semester or academic term grade reports. This \"Academic Alert\" is not noted in official transcripts. Students are encouraged to seek the help of their academic advisors to improve their GPAs in succeeding academic terms. Academic Warning A freshman student is placed on Academic Warning when the student's cumulative GPA falls between 1.75 and 1.99 at the end of any semester or summer term. Freshmen on Academic Warning are required to meet with their academic advisors to discuss possible modification to their course load, extracurricular activities, and/or employment, and to seek tutoring or other academic support to improve performance. Academic Probation A student is placed on Academic Probation if the student's cumulative GPA is below 2.0 at the end of the semester or summer term. A freshman is placed on Academic Probation if the cumulative GPA falls below 1.75 for the first time or if a freshman has been previously placed on Academic Warning and his/her cumulative GPA remains below 2.0 for the second time. While on Academic Probation, the student must have a semester GPA of 2.0 or higher to enroll the following semester. The student remains on Academic Pr obation until his or her cumulative GPA improves to 2.0 or above. A student on Academic Probation whose semester GPA falls below 2.0 is automatically suspended. Nevertheless, if a student on Academic Probation makes a semester GPA of 2.0 or better, but has a cumulative GPA below 2.0, he/she shall remain on Academic Probation. The Registrar will place students on Academic Probation on course registration hold. This hold will prevent the student from implementing any course registration processes (register/a dd/drop) until they have seen their Advisor and implemented an Academic Probation Contract/Success Plan for the following term. Students on Academic Probation are required at the beginning of the semester to meet with their advisors to sign academic probat ion contracts/success plans designed to improve their scholastic performance in the upcoming semester. The academic probation contract/success plan will address the following issues: Course load - students will be required to take a manageable course load. This stipulation may mean limiting the course load to 12 credit hours. Academic Support - students will be required to document participation in academic support activities (tutoring to workshops, for example). Extracurricular activities - students will n ot be permitted to participate in extracurricular activities, except for selected Intramural Activities determined in consultation with the student's academic advisor. Employment - students may be required to limit employment. Students who fail to meet the requirements of their academic probation contracts contract/success plans may be suspended from the University at any time during the semester. Such suspensions will be determined by the Academic Intervention Team. Academic Suspension A student may be a cademically suspended for either of two circumstances: A student on Academic Probation whose semester GPA falls below 2.0 is placed on Academic Suspension and is ineligible to be readmitted before one full academic year has elapsed since his or her suspens ion. (For example, a student suspended after a fall semester can not enroll at the University until the spring semester of the following year, at the earliest.) UNDERGRADUATE ACADEMIC STANDING 88 A student admitted with condition(s) who has not satisfied the condition(s) and who has not bee n recommended by the Condition Review Committee for continued enrollment as a degree - seeking student will be suspended. That student may re -enroll as a degree -seeking student only after satisfying the condition(s). Reporting Unsatisfactory Academic Perform ance Academic Alert, Academic Warning, Academic Probation, and Academic Suspension appear only on the students' term grade reports and unofficial transcripts. Appealing Academic Suspension Due to compelling and verifiable circumstances such as personal, family, medical, psychological, or any other emergency or special academic consideration, a student subject to Academic Suspension may request a hearing before Faculty -Student Affairs Committee. If the committee so decides, the student may be permitted to return for an additional semester on Academic Probation. Except for extenuating circumstances such as personal or family medical/psychological emergency, a student who is suspended for academic reasons cannot be readmitted before three terms (including the s ummer term) have elapsed. Students wishing to appeal to Faculty -Student Affairs Committee should contact the Registrar's Office for forms and deadlines. Gallaudet University administers placement tests for new undergraduate st udents to determine appropriate course placement in ASL, English, and Mathematics. Placement in American Sign Language (ASL) Courses The ASL Placement Test is used to determine appropriate placement for new undergraduate students in one of three credit -bearing courses: (1) ASL 111 - American Sign Language I and II, (2) ASL 112 - American Sign Language III and IV or (3) GSR 103 - American Sign Language and Deaf Studies. The ASL Placement Test covers each students' linguistic knowledge of ASL with respect to both production and comprehension. The test is computer -based, and all answers are in multiple -choice format. Test results are calculated soon after the student completes the test. The ASL Placement Test is not the same as the ASLPI (ASL Proficiency Interview), which is an admission and/or graduation requirement for various undergraduate and graduate programs. Placement in English Courses The ACT -English/Reading scores and/or SAT -Verbal scores are use d to determine appropriate placement for undergraduate students in ENG 050 - English Language Study (non -credit bearing course), ENG 070 - English Language Study: Reading and Writing Skills (non- credit bearing course) or GSR 102 - Critical Reading and Writ ing or higher (credit -bearing courses). Placement in Mathematics Courses The Mathematics Placement Test is used to determine appropriate placement for new undergraduate students in MAT 040 - Pre-College Mathematics (non- credit bearing course) or GSR 104 - Quantitative Reasoning Approach or higher (credit -bearing courses). Information about undergraduate students with conditions is provided under \" Student Classifications \" in this catalog. Regular attendance and participation is an obligation assumed by every student registered for courses at Gallaudet University. Faculty establish attendance policies for their own classes and these policies will be clearly stated in their course syllabi. S tudents must attend the first week of classes to verify their enrollment. Students, who are registered for class and who fail to attend the first week of scheduled classes, may be dropped from the course by the instructor. Online 8 -Week Class Attendance Students, who are registered for 8 -week online class and who fail to participate the first week of the session, may be dropped from the course by the instructor. Please refer to the refund policy to dete rmine the tuition and room charges. UNDERGRADUATE PLACEMENT TESTS CLASS ATTENDANCE 89 Gallaudet University has a legal obligation under the American with Disabilities Act (ADA) to provide reasonable accommodations for students with disabilities. Students who seek course a ccommodations, modifications, or substitutions can find guidelines and procedures for obtaining accommodations based on their disabilities on the Office for Students with Disabilities (OSWD) web site, http://www.gallaudet.edu/office -for- students -with- disabilities . The Reasonable Accommodation policy is also online here . To graduate from Gallaudet, students are expected to be \"in r esidence\" for at least 24 credits once they have achieved senior status. This means that, once students have completed 90 credit hours, they must take at least 24 more credit hours at Gallaudet, not transferred from another university. For the purposes of this residency requirement, courses taken through the Consortium of Universities and Colleges of the Washington Metro Area (CUWMA) and the Online Consortium of Independent Colleges and Universities (OCICU) are considered Gallaudet courses. To earn a major, students must complete at least half of the major requirements at Gallaudet. To earn a minor, students must also complete at least half of the minor requirements at Gallaudet. Additional general studies courses may be required to satisfy Gallaudet Univers ity degree requirements. Note that some departments may have additional residency requirements for their majors. The student must indicate any institution(s) previously attended on the Application for Admission (or re - admission) to Galla udet University in order for that coursework to qualify for consideration as transfer credit. No transfer credit can be considered in the future if the institution(s) is not listed on the application, unless with Prior Permission. There are different ways students can transfer credits to Gallaudet to apply towards degree programs. Gallaudet will consider credits from any institution. Students may earn credits toward graduation by taking tests in specific subjects under the College Level Examination Progra m or through the Advanced Placement Program provided by the Educational Testing Service (www.CollegeBoard.com ). Prior Permission for transfer credit may be arranged. Transfer students must meet the resid ency requirement, which requires residency for the senior year (at least 24 credits). To earn a major, students must complete at least half of the major requirements at Gallaudet. To earn a minor, students must also complete at least half of the minor requ irements at Gallaudet. Additional general studies courses may be required to satisfy Gallaudet University degree requirements. Note that some departments may have additional residency requirements for their majors. Evaluation / Re -evaluation Process Gallaudet University only processes transfer credits with official transcript(s). The evaluation process may take approximately two (2) weeks. Course equivalencies are requested and approved by respective academic departments. The Transfer Credit Specialist at the Registrar's office will process the official transfer information. Pre -approved transfer credits may be requested for re- evaluation. Contact the Transfer Credit Specialist at the Registrar's Office for further information. To allow for timely schedu ling your first semester of classes here at Gallaudet, we impose a deadline of August 1st (Fall semesters) and December 1st (Spring semesters) for all college transcripts to be submitted to the Admissions office, who in turn will hand the transcripts to the Transfer Specialist in the Registrar's Office for evaluation. ACADEMIC ACCOMMODATIONS POLICY SENIOR YEAR RESIDENCE TRANSFER CREDITS 90 Developmental Credits (English and/or Mathematics) Gallaudet does not accept any developmental English courses for transfer (College level courses tend to be numbered 100 or higher.) English as Second Language (ESL) or English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) courses are considered developmental and are not transferable. Developmental mathematics courses may be considered for waivers at Gallaudet. Credits Conversion Gallaudet Universit y operates under the semester system. All transfer credits from post -secondary institutions not on the semester system (eg: quarter hours) will be converted to semester credits. Refer to the Conversion Chart on Registrar Office's webpage. International Credits Gallaudet recognizes the need to prevent enrolling in courses that have been taken elsewhere at institutions you've attended previously therefore we make every effort to evaluate your coursework thoroughly and fairly to determine if transfer credit can be awarded. Credits from International (non- USA) college / universities vary and will be evaluated individually. The University requires that all international students with transfer work obtain a course -by-course evaluation from any of the following pre -approved US -based credentials evaluators: AACRAO International Education Services (fee: $190) World Education Services (fee: $160) NOTE: Students must ensure their request for service is the course -by-course evaluation ; this would provide the name of the course, the credits earned, and the US grad e equivalent. Also, students must submit a course syllabus, translated into English, for all courses taken. The syllabus must contain the following: 1. Course title 2. Course number 3. Start and end dates of each course 4. Description of the course, including each t opic covered 5. Name of textbook(s) used including title, author, edition, and date of publication. Courses, for which course syllabi/course descriptions have not been submitted, will be granted transfer as general electives and will not be applicable to any major requirements. For those courses listed on the transcript with no grades or scores, grades of C - or below, Pass/Fail scores, Audit, or for 0 credit hours are not eligible for transfer credit. To allow for timely scheduling your first semester of cl asses here at Gallaudet, we impose a deadline of August 1st (Fall semesters) and December 1st (Spring semesters) for all college transcripts to be submitted to the Admissions office, who in turn will hand the transcripts to the Transfer Specialist in the Registrar's Office for evaluation. Please refer to the Transfer Credits webpage for more information on transfers. CREDITS BY EXAMINATION Most examinations are provided by Coll egeBoard and include, but not limited to, Advanced Placement (AP), and College Level Examination Program (CLEP). Contact the Transfer Credit Specialist in the Registrar's Office for Gallaudet's policies. The institutional code number for both CLEP and AP is 5240 for scores to be sent to Gallaudet University. College Level Examination Program (CLEP) The College Level Examination Program (CLEP) gives you the opportunity to receive college credit for what you already know by earning qualifying scores on each examination, as judged by the appropriate department. Information on the CLEP, as well as the procedure for applying, can be obtained online at clep.collegeboard.org . Information about transfer credit and the process can be obtained from the Transfer Credit Specialist in the Registrar's Office. 91 Advanced Placement Tests University credit will be given for Advanced Placement (AP) tests with scores of 3.0 or better, and Honors credit will be given for scores of 4.0 or 5.0. These shall be considered as transfer credits and thus will not be counted in the grade point average. Information on available AP tests and obtaining AP scores can be found at APcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/controller.jpf . Informatio n on procedures for transferring AP credits can be obtained from the Transfer Credit Specialist in the Registrar's Office. Refer to Registrar's Office AP information webpage for list of equivalencies at Gallaudet. If you are interested in taking classes during semester or summer breaks at any college or university (other than cons ortium member institutions) and wish to transfer these credits to Gallaudet, please contact the Registrar's Office for information about Prior Permission Transfer Credit. You should be currently enrolled for fall or spring terms at Gallaudet and expect to continue at Gallaudet the following semester. Transfer courses awarded credit may satisfy University requirements, but neither the grade nor the credits earned are considered in calculating your GPA, with one exception. If the transfer course is equivalent to a Gallaudet course that you previously failed, the University recognizes that you have indeed passed that course, and the prior failing grade and course credit are removed from calculation of your GPA. Here is the procedure for prior approval of your transfer credits: Give the Registrar's Office a complete course description of each course. Fill out the Prior Permission for Transfer Credit form, available at the Registrar's Office. Obtain the exact Gallaudet University equivalent course and approval signature from the respective department chair. Drop off the Prior Permission for Transfer Credit form to the Transfer Specialist at the Registrar's Office. The Transfer Specialist will sign the form and give you copies for you and your advisor. Contact th e other school to arrange for the course. Earn a grade of C or better so that credit will be transferred. Submit a copy of an official transcript upon completion of the course to the Transfer Credit Specialist at the Registrar's Office. For Passing (P) gra des: you must provide evidence (preferably from the university catalog) that the university only gives a Passing grade to students who earned a letter grade of C or higher. If the university gives a Passing grade to students who pass the course (the letter grade could range from A+ to D -), the transfer credits for the course will not be granted. Upon receipt of the official transcript, the Transfer Credit Specialist feeds and posts the transfer credits in the PeopleSoft system. The Prior Permission for Tran sfer Credit form and any other paperwork when completed are filed in your file. Students may withdraw from individual courses within the first half of the semester, summer session, or non - traditional term in which the cours e is offered. No students will be allowed to withdraw from a course after the first half of the semester, summer session, or non - traditional term has passed, except for compelling and verifiable circumstances, in which case the student must obtain the per mission of the course instructor and the appropriate dean. Students may not withdraw from the same course more than once. This policy does not apply to a student who takes a leave of absence or withdraws from all courses during a semester, summer session, or non - traditional term. Once the withdrawal form is filed with the Registrar's Office, \"WD\" will appear on the student's official transcript. Withdrawal procedures for undergraduate students taking PST courses are outlined on the Center for Continuing and Online Education website. Students who request a withdrawal from all classes, resulting in zero (0) credits, must complete a Leave of Absence (LOA) o r University Withdrawal form through the Registrar's Office, or will be considered as an \"unofficial withdrawal\" and will have to apply for readmission if they desire to be reinstated. If in any circumstances, the student does not fill out an official wit hdrawal and has failing grades (\"Fs\") or a combination of \"Fs\" and \"WDs\" for all courses and has PRIOR PERMISSION TRANSFER CREDIT UNDERGRADUATE COURSE WITHDRAW ALS 92 stopped attending those courses, the student is considered unofficially withdrawn from the University. Students who are unofficially withdrawn and wish to be r einstated must apply for readmission through the Registrar's Office. Forms are available on the Registrar's Office web site at http://www.gallaudet.edu/registrar/forms . A student in good academic standing who is a U.S. citizen or a permanent resident of the U.S., and who intends to stop taking courses for a period of time, may request a Leave of Absence (LOA). Immigration laws do not permit international st udents without permanent residency to apply for LOA status. To initiate an LOA, students must apply through the Registrar's Office before the course withdrawal deadline of the affected semester. After the course withdrawal deadline, students with compell ing and verifiable reasons (for example, medical, family, and/or financial issues) may obtain an LOA or withdraw from the university with permission of the appropriate dean, resulting in WD grades for courses in progress. Not obtaining such permission can result in the assignment of failing grades (\"F\") in all unfinished courses. The length of time permitted for the LOA may not exceed three consecutive academic semesters (excluding summer). If a student is granted an LOA during a semester, that semester w ill count as one of the three consecutive semesters. Students should be advised that financial aid will be recalculated if the student takes a leave of absence prior to completing 60% of the semester. See the Financial Aid section of this catalog for details. When the student is ready to return from LOA, the student must contact the LOA/WD Specialist at the Registrar's Office to initiate the process of return. Students may enroll for classes at the end of their approved leave without applying for readmission. If the three semester limit has expired, the student must apply for readmission. Once a student has taken an LOA and returned to the university, any subsequent requests for LOAs must be approved b y the dean. Students finding it necessary to withdraw from the University are required to submit a completed withdrawal form, which they can obtain from the Registrar's Office, after meeting with the LOA/WD Sp ecialist. The WD form requires signatures from different offices on campus. A withdrawal becomes official when it has been accepted by the Registrar. Students can withdraw from the University through the eighth week of classes. A \"WD\" will appear on the student's official transcript for all courses the student was enrolled in. See the \"Refunds After Withdrawal from the University\" description in the \"Fees and Financial Services\" section of this catalog for information on refunds. After the eighth week st udents may withdraw with permission of the appropriate dean and with compelling and verifiable reasons. Unauthorized withdrawal from the University can result in the assignment of failing grades (\"F\") in all courses. A student is considered to have \"unoff icially withdrawn\" from the University if the student receives failing grades (\"F\") or a combination of \"F\" and \"WD\" in all classes, and has stopped attending all classes during the semester (based on attendance dates provided in their grade reports). Stud ents who are unofficially withdrawn and wish to be reinstated must apply for readmission through the Registrar's Office. Readmission for a Second Undergraduate Degree Students who have received a degree from Gallaudet may return to pursue a second degree. Students should apply through the Registrar's Office. They should complete an application form and submit it along with a $50 non- refundable application fee. All stude nt debts must be cleared before the application deadline. Students should also submit a letter from the appropriate department chair UNDERGRADUATE LEAVE OF ABSENCE (LOA) UNDERGRADUATE WITHDRAW ALS FROM THE UNIVERSITY UNDERGRADUATE READMISSION 93 granting permission to enroll in that major. To satisfy the requirements for a second baccalaureate degree at Gallaudet Un iversity, a student must complete a minimum of 30 additional semester hours after satisfying requirements for the first degree, and he or she must also satisfy the requirements of a major other than the major declared for the first baccalaureate. Grade points earned in the first degree will not apply in determining the scholastic eligibility while a student is enrolled for a second degree. No student, however, will be permitted to complete the second degree under a catalog or supplement issued more than thr ee years prior to the date of completion of the second degree. Students who obtained a bachelor's degree at an institution other than Gallaudet and want to pursue a second degree, must apply through the Office of UG Admissions . Readmission After Withdrawal Students who withdraw from the University without obtaining a leave of absence (LOA), an expired LOA, or were discontinued; and wish to resume studies at the University must apply for readmissio n. Students applying for readmission can find readmission application materials online, and may contact the Registrar's Office for additional information. An application fee of $50 payable to Gallaudet U niversity must accompany the application. All outstanding debts must be paid in full before applying for readmission. Readmission After Suspension Students who are academically suspended due to GPA below 2.0, and who wish to be reinstated must apply for readmission through the Registrar's Office, which includes an appeal to Faculty -Student Affairs Committee. A student readmitted after academic suspension is placed on academic probation and is subject to all requirements and conditions of that status. Former students who were academically dismissed or suspended and who apply for readmission will be placed on academic probation. They will be required to follow academic procedures described under Academic Probation. Students who are academically suspended due to conditions, and who wish to be reinstated must complete the required conditions prior to applying for readmission. Conditions may be satisfied by taking only the remedial course at Gallaudet as an Undergraduate Special Student, if the student's GPA is 2 .0 or above, through the Undergraduate Admissions Office; or by taking a course at another college/university and transferring to Gallaudet. Once the required condition(s) have been met, the student may then apply for readmission through the Registrar's Office. The student must appeal to Faculty -Student Affairs Committee with evidence of completed conditions. Students who are academically suspended due to conditions, and also have a GPA below 2.0, should contact the Registrar's Office for more information. Students who have been suspended for disciplinary reasons must write a letter of appeal to the Office of Student Conduct, obtain permission before applying for readmission, and provide evidence that th ey have met the conditions of the suspension. Academic Clemency Undergraduate students who are readmitted to Gallaudet University after a separation of three or more years may request that grades and credits previously earned at Gallaudet University, totaling no more than 18 credits, be removed from the calculation of their cumulative grade point average. These grades and credits will not be counted toward graduation requirements. This request for clemency must be made during the student's first semest er following readmission. The student should request this clemency through the Registrar's Office; the Registrar will then seek the approval for such clemency from the appropriate deans. Approval is not automatic or guaranteed. Information about commencement ceremonies can be found online at commencement.gallaudet.edu. Graduation Checklist and Application Students who expect to complete requirements for an undergraduate degree must file the online application for graduation and submit it to the Registrar's Office. The deadline for filing the graduation application is stated in the University's academic calendar. Seniors who have filed a graduation application online will receive an explanation of procedures for gradua tion. The Registrar's Office will review the advisement report and note any requirements still outstanding. Students are responsible for meeting with their faculty advisor to review the advisement report and make arrangements to complete any outstanding requirements. The Registrar's Office will notify students of UNDERGRADUATE APPLICATION FO R GRADUATION 94 their eligibility or ineligibility to graduate and participate in the graduation ceremony. Six (6)- Week Grace Period At the end of the term, undergraduate degree candidates are given six weeks in w hich all issues/conflicts that are delaying degree conferral must be resolved. Eligible circumstances include incomplete or in -progress grades, course substitutions/waivers and program completion memos, transfer of credit to be posted, and dropping an unme t minor. If the issue is resolved by the end of the six - week deadline, your degree, diploma and transcript will still be issued for the applied official graduation date. Please keep in mind that certain circumstances are not eligible to be resolved during this six -week grace period, for example, incomplete internships. 6 Week Grace Period Date Calculation: May - last day of classes for spring term + 6 weeks Aug - last day of classes for summer term + 6 weeks Dec - last day of classes for fall term + 6 week s Graduation Fest Gallaudet's Graduation Fest is a one -day event for potential graduates to access each area, office, or department to ensure they have made the necessary arrangements to graduate. Included are representatives from the Bookstore, Student Fi nancial Services, Campus Life, the Office of the President, Alumni Office, Career Center, Graduate School, and others. Graduation Fest is usually held in February or March. Description of Graduate Hooding and Commencement Ceremonies Graduate Hooding typically occurs the day prior to the Commencement Ceremony. At the Hooding, Graduate students who have met all the requirements are awarded a distinctive hooding to add onto the graduation gown to wear at the Commencement Ceremony. The Commencement Ceremony us ually is on Friday, one week after the final exam week. All eligible Undergraduate or Graduate students will receive notice of their completion during the ceremony. Participation in Commencement Ceremony Once the application for graduation has been filed, students who have completed all work toward their degrees are automatically eligible to participate in the commencement ceremony. Students who are eight or fewer credit hours short of completing their degrees will be permitted to participate in the ceremon y if they are registered for summer school. Information on the commencement ceremony is sent only to those students who apply for graduation. Academic Attire Academic attire is required of all candidates at commencement exercises. Students who choose to or der cap and gowns from the Bison Shop (Gallaudet bookstore) must do so during the annual \"Graduation Fest\" in February/March. Gowns may be picked up through commencement day. Degree with Distinction Those students who graduate with a degree GPA of 3.8 or higher shall receive their degrees summa cum laude; for those at 3.6 or above, magna cum laude; and for those at 3.4 or above, cum laude. One -half of the course hours required for graduation (62 credit hours) must be taken at Gallaudet. The only exception to the 60 credit hour minimum is for first-degree transfer students who have earned 40 - 59 semester hours at Gallaudet; these students will be awarded a degree with the appropriate distinction only if their GPA from Gallaudet and their GPA from all institu tions previously attended meet the cumulative GPA requirements stated above. Transcripts and Diplomas Students may obtain transcripts of their academic records from the Registrar's Office. There is a $17.25 fee for each official transcript. Transcripts wil l be released only by signed request. No transcripts will be issued to a student who owes money or who has any outstanding obligation to the University. In compliance with Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), Gallaudet University will not mak e copies of transcripts on file from other colleges and universities. Diplomas are issued only once, and any errors must be brought to the attention of the Registrar's Office within 90 days of receipt. 95 Faculty may recommend that a student who passes away while pursuing a degree be awarded a posthumous degree. To qualify for a posthumous degree, the student must have been a senior (90 credit hours or more completed) who had earned at least 24 credits from Gallaudet University. The student must also have been in good academic and disciplinary standing. Students receiving posthumous degrees will be briefly recognized during their cohort's commencement, separate from the awarding of all other degrees. The posthumous degree will be mailed to the student's family. Procedure: The Posthumous Degree Recommendation Form should be submitted to the program coordinator for that student's major. The request must be approved by the program coordinator, department chair, dean, and provost. Division of Academic Affairs Communication Access Policies and Guidelines Last Revision: May 1, 2014 Refer Questions To: Office of the Provost Introduction 1. The Division of Academic Affairs is one of the university's heaviest consumers of communication access services, broadly defined as interpreting and captioning. In recent years, each new undergraduate and graduate cohort has included increasingly greater numbers of stude nts for whom American Sign Language and Deaf culture are new or emerging concepts. In addition, Gallaudet enrolls a growing number of students with additional disabilities who request communication access services through the university's Office for Students With Disabilities (OSWD). Finally, every year, the Division hires faculty, administrative and professional staff, and support staff who are new signers. 2. Enrollment and retention are two of the university's five strategic priorities, so it is in our best interest to enroll and retain students who need communication access services. At the same time, this has resulted in dramatically rising costs. It has become necessary to institute more rigorous tracking of communication access requests and costs. Th is document sets out policies and guidelines to guide administrators, requesters, and consumers. Scope These policies and guidelines apply to faculty, staff, undergraduate and graduate students, and visitors in all academic departments and units within t he Division of Academic Affairs that use communication access services. Philosophical Framework The following philosophical framework was used to develop these guidelines: Gallaudet University is a bilingual educational institution with the focus on a r ich student experience that promotes students' current and future successes. Because the majority of students rely on visual modes for accessing communication and direct communication is the ideal norm, each faculty, staff person, and student of the Gallau det community is accountable for direct, effective, meaningful, and accessible communication in the various aspects of University life. As Gallaudet strives to achieve the ideal norm, it is recognized that some members of the University community, particu larly some of those who have recently been introduced to American Sign Language, require the prudent and efficient use of University resources in order to ensure that they can participate in effective and meaningful communications that promote student succ ess until such time they become capable of directly communicating in ASL with other Gallaudet community members. This philosophical framework was derived from careful review of the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Gallaudet University Sign Communicati on Statement, the Gallaudet University Language and Communication Expectations Recommendations, the Gallaudet University mission and vision statements, and the Gallaudet Strategic Plan. It is subject to revision as the university itself evolves. POSTHUMOUS DEGREE COMMUNI CATION ACCESS POLICIES 96 Defini tion of communication access services 1. Gallaudet University provides communication access services via interpreting and captioning through Gallaudet Interpreting Service (GIS), a unit of the Division of Administration and Finance. 2. Communication access services are provided in a variety of situations, b oth on -campus and off -campus. These situations in clude, but are not limited to: a. Academic classes b. Practica, internships, externships, student teaching, a nd other \"field\" activities c. Telephon e calls and teleconferences d. Meetings e. Lectures, panels, symposia, face -to-face conferenc es, videoconferences, webinars f. Performances g. Athletic events h. Official University functions (Convocation, Commencement , dissertation defenses, etc.) i. Miss ion-critical activities j. Crisis and emergency situations 3. The following types of interpreting are provided. a. Ame rican Sign Language to English b. Eng lish to American Sign Language c. deaf -blind (including tactil e, tracking, and close vision) 4. The f ollowing typ es of captioning are provided. a. Communication access realtime translation (CART) b. TypeWell, also known as C -Print or Text Interpreting c. live caption ing d. transcription services 5. GIS will make efforts to provide other specialized communication access services, such as international interpreting, trilingual interpreting, or cued speech, if requests are submitted in a timely manner and qualified providers are available. Shared Responsibility for Communication Access The University ha s an affirmative responsibility to meet the communication access needs of its present and future students. Enrollment Management and demographic research units must make every effort to project future enrollment trends. This will help the division to alloc ate its communication access resources and contain costs. Each member of the Academic Affairs community has a responsibility to work cooperatively, patiently, and respectfully so that everyone understands and is understood in classes, meetings, and other situations, both formal and informal. Determination of optimum communication modality must be a collaborative endeavor among faculty, staff, and students to ensure that each Academic Affairs community member has full access. Related Documents: Student Attendance Requirements ; Student Agreement Forms - Academic Settings and Non -Academic Settings , Acade mic and Student Affairs Student Attendance Requirements Students who use communication access services for a long -term class or required activity (defined as a field placement, practicum, internship, or externship), must attend regularly and on time . Individual departments may instate superseding policies/requirements; however, those policies must be clearly communicated to the student and to Gallaudet Interpreting Service (GIS). Timely cancellations. Students must inform GIS of any expected absences three or more business days prior to their occurrence. Late cancellations. Late cancellations are those that are reported to GIS with less than three business days notice. Emergency situations. Students who miss class or a required activity because of an unforeseen illness or emergency must inform the instructor, GIS, and the requesting department (for undergraduate students, the Office of Academic Advising; for graduate students, their home dep artment or the department offering the class or required activity) as soon as possible. Typically, instructors and administrators will excuse illness and/or emergency situations. STUDENT ATTENDANCE REQUIREMENTS 97 Tardiness.

Many individual academic departments have also developed their own learning outcomes; check with the departments for details. Undergraduate studies at Gallaudet University provide all students with a rigorous and integrative education that promotes competence and in- depth knowledge in both the General Studies and major curricula. General Studies are predominantly taught as thematic interdisciplinary courses, addressing the Gallaudet University Student Learning Outcomes. Major -level course s continue to expand on these five learning outcomes and also provide students with discipline -specific competence, preparing them for competitive careers and/or graduate education. Language and Communication Students will use American Sign Language (ASL) and written English to communicate effectively with diverse audiences, for a variety of purposes, and in a variety of settings. Critical Thinking Students will summarize, synthesize, and critically analyze ideas from multiple sources in order to draw well - supported conclusions and solve problems. Identity and Culture Students will understand themselves, complex social identities, including deaf identities, and the interrelations within and among diverse cultures and groups. Knowledge and Inquiry Students wi ll apply knowledge, modes of inquiry, and technological competence from a variety of disciplines in order to understand human experience and the natural world. Ethics and Social Responsibility Students will make reasoned ethical judgments, showing awarenes s of multiple value systems and taking responsibility for the consequences of their actions. They will apply these judgments, using collaboration and leadership skills, to promote social justice in their local, national, and global communities. A candidate for graduation with either a B. A. (Bachelors of Arts) or B. S. (Bachelor of Science) must fulfill the following requirements successfully: 1. 37 hours of General Studies Requirements (GSR) 2. A minimum of 120 hours, includi ng the requirements of a major listed in the catalog 3. A minimum of 2.0 cumulative grade point average (GPA), unless major departments or programs use higher cumulative GPA standards. Students must follow the requirements set by respective departments or pro grams they are enrolled in. 4. A one -year residency requirement 5. A satisfactory record of conduct 6. Career Development (GSR 110) The following general education requirements apply to students matriculated (admitted and registered) during or after Fall 2007. Students matriculated before Fall 2007 should refer to the archived catalog of record for the academic year in which they were admitted. General Studies Requirements (GSR) UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION UNDERGRADUA TE DEGREE REQUIREMENTS GENERAL STUDIES REQUIREMENTS 100 General Studies Overview The general studies program requires students to take 37 credits in this general education program. All courses in the curriculum emphasize skill development in critical thinking, language, and communication. Developing and refining these competencies is the goal of every course stud ents take in the program. The new General Studies curriculum includes four components: Freshman Foundation courses (4 courses, total 12 credits): GSR 101, 102, 103, and 104 Career Development (1 course, total 1 credit): GSR 110 Integrated courses (5 cour ses, total 20 credits): GSR 150, 210, 220, 230, and 240 Capstone Experience (1 course, total 4 credits): GSR 300 Freshman Foundation The Freshman Foundation is the first General Studies component. Under this component, students take four Freshman Foundatio n courses: First Year Seminar (GSR 101) Critical Reading and Writing (GSR 102) American Sign Language and Deaf Studies (GSR 103) Quantitative Reasoning (GSR 104) The four foundation courses will give you the fundamental tools to progress toward the five student learning outcomes. You will improve your communication and problem -solving skills and start thinking about your own identity and college life. Career Development Career Development (GSR 110) The career development course will give you the foundation to explore and plan your future career. Integrated Courses - Part One Interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary courses have become common practice with many colleges and universities across the nation. Courses are traditionally taught alone as a discipline, separate from the other, for instance, as a history course, an English course, or a mathematics course. However, with integrated courses being multi - or interdisciplinary, the focus is on a central topic with two or three faculty from, say the History, English, or Sociology Departments, teaming up to teach the course. Faculty members can voluntarily design and offer integrated courses as long as they meet the appropriate five competencies. With a multi - or interdisciplinary approach and because a specific topic is explored in detail and from the perspectives of different disciplines such as business, communication studies, and psychology, it hones critical thinking skills. Each integrated course will be 4 or 5 credits and will address some or all of the five competencies. Introductory course GSR 150: Introduction to Integrated Learning Integrated courses GSR 210: Comparing Multicultural Perspectives GSR 220: Methods of Multiple Disciplines GSR 230: Scientific & Quantitative Reasoning in Context GSR 240: Ethical Decisions and Actions These learning courses are required at numerous institutions of higher learning across the nation. Learning courses emphasize applying learned content and skills to solve real -life, real world dilemmas. For example, s tudents could volunteer to help restore the Chesapeake Bay by understanding the delicate estuary and its ecological significance for the metropolitan DC area including Maryland and Virginia. They could volunteer by planting trees or transplanting oyster sh ells into the Bay. General Studies Capstone Experience The third and final component of the General Studies curriculum is the Capstone Experience. The Capstone Experience is a \"wrap -up\" course. You take the General Studies Capstone course when you complete all other General Studies Requirements. The course includes all five competencies and will challenge you to apply your knowledge and skills to solve real world problems through a project, artifact, or substantial work experience. Gallaudet will invite com munity groups, both on -campus and off - campus, to present problems and needs. You will be on project teams to research, plan, and implement innovative solutions. 101 The General Studies Program works with academic departments to modify one or more of the depart ment courses to satisfy the General Studies interdisciplinary focus and GSR course Student Learning Outcomes. Students may enroll in these course sections to satisfy a GSR course requirement; they may also satisfy major or minor requirements. However, cred its earned are not duplicated; a maximum of 4 credits may be earned for taking a cross -listed course. After review and approval by the General Studies director, specific course sections will be cross -listed on the course schedule for a given semester and indicated in the section's course description. A section of a course listed in the catalog as 3 -credit may be offered as 4 - credit, for the purpose of cross -listing with GSR courses. These sections will include the contact and overall student engagement hou rs required for a 4 -credit course. Departments may offer a 3 -credit course as a 4 -credit course, for the purpose of cross -listing with GSR courses, a maximum of 3 times before they must propose changing the relevant departmental course in the catalog to (3 - 4) credits or (4) credits.

FIRST YEAR EXPERIENCE 179 Overview Web: General Studies Program Dr. Leslie Rach, Director Jordan Student Academic Center, Room 1225 The general studies program requires students to take 37 credits in this general education program. All courses in the cur riculum emphasize skill development in critical thinking, language, and communication. Developing and refining these competencies is the goal of every course students take in the program. The new General Studies curriculum includes four components: Freshm an Foundation courses (4 courses, total 12 credits): GSR 101, 102, 103, and 104 Career Development (1 course, total 1 credit): GSR 110 Integrated courses (5 courses, total 20 credits): GSR 150, 210, 220, 230, and 240 Capstone Experience (1 course, total 4 credits): GSR 300 Freshman Foundation The Freshman Foundation is the first General Studies component. Under this component, students take four Freshman Foundation courses: First Year Seminar (GSR 101) Critical Reading and Writing (GSR 102) American Sign Language and Deaf Studies (GSR 103) Quantitative Reasoning (GSR 104) The four foundation courses will give you the fundamental tools to progress toward the five student learning outcomes. You will improve your communication and problem -solving skills and s tart thinking about your own identity and college life. Career Development Career Development (GSR 110) The career development course will give you the foundation to explore and plan your future career. Integrated Courses - Part One Interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary courses have become common practice with many colleges and universities across the nation. Courses are traditionally taught alone as a discipline, separate from the other, for instance, as a history course, an English course, or a mathematics course. However, with integrated courses being multi - or interdisciplinary, the focus is on a central topic with two or three faculty from, say the History, English, or Sociology Departments, teaming up to teach the course. Faculty members can voluntarily design and offer integrated courses as long as they meet the appropriate five competencies. With a multi - or interdisciplinary approach and because a specific topic is explored in detail and from the perspectives of different disciplines such as busin ess, communication studies, and psychology, it hones critical thinking skills. Each integrated course will be 4 credits and will address some or all of the five competencies. Introductory course GSR 150: Introduction to Integrated Learning Integrated cour ses GSR 210: Comparing Multicultural Perspectives GSR 220: Methods of Multiple Disciplines GSR 230: Scientific & Quantitative Reasoning in Context GSR 240: Ethical Decisions and Actions These core competency courses are required at numerous institutions of higher learning across the nation. Learning courses emphasize applying learned content and skills to solve real -life, real -world dilemmas. For example, students could volunteer to help restore the Chesapeake Bay by understanding the delicate estuary and its ecological significance for the metropolitan DC area including Maryland and Virginia. They could volunteer by planting trees or transplanting oyster shells into the Bay. General Studies Capstone Experience GSR 300: Capstone The third and final compone nt of the General Studies curriculum is the Capstone Experience. The Capstone Experience is a \"wrap -up\" course. You take the General Studies Capstone course when you complete all other GENERAL STUDIES 180 General Studies Requirements. The course includes all five competencies and will challenge you to apply your knowledge and skills to solve real -world problems through a project, artifact, or substantial work experience. Gallaudet will invite community groups, both on -campus and off - campus, to present problems and needs. You w ill be on project teams to research, plan, and implement innovative solutions. No Undergraduate Majors or Minors are offered.

Web: Department of Government and Public Affairs School of Education, Business, and Human Services Dr. David Penna, Chair Hall Memorial Building, Room S235J Government or political science in the broadest sense is the study of how governments work and how they affect people (and how people affect them) on the local, national, and international levels. Political scientists are conc erned with the structures of governments, the decision -making process in governments, the policy governments make, and the cultures in which governments function. Some specific topics that can be studied at Gallaudet include political parties, the legislat ure, political theory, the presidency, interest groups, civil rights and liberties, the governments of Europe and developing nations, international relations, American foreign policy, and others. The department emphasizes both knowledge in the area of gove rnment and current events, and skills in research, communication, and critical thinking. A government major is often seen as a useful preparation for law and teaching, journalism, federal government service, state and local government, and good citizensh ip. The skills and knowledge emphasized are useful in many other fields. Washington, D.C., is an ideal place to study politics, and students are helped and encouraged to make extensive use of the city's academic, cultural, and governmental resources. The d epartment also uses the University's work -study program to find work placements that will broaden students classroom experience. Pre -law advising is offered to students who wish to attend law school.

Prerequisite: Permission of the department chair Web: Sociology Program College of Arts and Sciences Dr. Sharon Barnartt, Program Coordinator Hall Memorial Building, Room S134A Sociology provides a variety of courses to meet the needs of students majoring in sociology as well as students seeking to satisfy their general studie s requirements. Sociology is an important part of a liberal arts education, and students interested in elective courses to complete their degree requirements will find many upper -division sociology courses that complement courses offered in other departmen ts. Sociology is a social science that is concerned primarily with studying social behavior and human groups. Among other things, sociology looks at how groups influence individual behavior, how groups cooperate or conflict with one another, and how societ ies are established and change. Sociologists are also concerned with social problems that occur in societies such as crime, discrimination, poverty, and inadequate health care. Sociology emphasizes how society (rather than bad people ) contribute to proble ms such as these. Gallaudet offers a general major in sociology as well as a major in sociology with a concentration in criminology. Minors are available in sociology and criminology. A major in sociology provides a basis for graduate study in sociology, law, criminology, and related fields. Undergraduate training in sociology is also valuable for students interested in social work, secondary school teaching, business careers, and careers in public service. SOCIOLOGY 204 Alpha Kappa Delta International Sociology Honor Society: Founded in 1920, the name Alpha Kappa Delta was chosen because the letters represent the first letters of the three classical Greek words that embody the function of the society. They are anthropos, meaning mankind; katamanthano, meaning to exami ne more closely or acquire knowledge, and diakoneo meaning to do service. Thus, the motto of AKD is \"To investigate humanity for the purpose of service.\" To be initiated into AKD a student majoring in sociology must be junior or senior, have completed at least four sociology courses, have a 3.0 overall GPA, be in the top 35% of their class, and have a 3.0 GPA in their sociology courses.

Dudis, Chair Sorenson Language and Communication Center, Room 3208 The Department of Linguistics offers a minor in Linguistics as well as masters -level and doctoral programs. The Department of Linguistics is unique in that all students and faculty in the department share an abiding interest in the study of American Sign Language (ASL). The ongoing, innovative research carried out by the linguistics faculty and graduate students is contributing substantially to what is known about the structure and use of sign languages. ASL is not only the subject of faculty and student research, but also the language of communication in the classroom. Typical linguistics degree programs at other universities focus exclusively on spoken languages. In our program, students study both spoken and signed languages, with considerable emphasis on ASL. This provides students with a broad understanding of language with a specialist's understanding of ASL. While the Lin guistics Department does not have an undergraduate major, undergraduate students can design a self-directed major in a linguistics - related field. If interested, please make an appointment with Dr. Mary Thumann, Undergraduate Linguistics Program Coordinator (mary.thumann@gallaudet.edu ).

Readings and discussion throughout the course will reflect the perspective that acquisition studies on a broad variety of languages, both signed and spoken, are crucial for developing accurate theories of language structure and use. Application of concepts from lectures and discussion is developed through student analysis of L1 and L2 data. Prerequisites: For UG students: LIN 301, 302; for MASLED GRAD students: B or above in ASL 724 or permission of the instructor and MASLED program coordinator; for other GRAD students, permission of the instructor. LIN 521 - Introduction to Cognitive Linguistics (3) This course is an introduction to the cognitivis t approach to linguistics, in which language and thought are taken to be grounded in basic human experiences and to grow out of the nature of the physical brain and body. Unlike some linguistic approaches, cognitive linguistics treats form and meaning as i nterrelated on all levels of linguistic structure. Topics include conceptual blending, metaphor, depiction, frame semantics, human categorization, mental spaces, and cognitive/construction grammar. Prerequisites: LIN 101, 263 LIN 522 - Psycholinguistics of Sign Languages (3) Deaf and hearing people around the world acquire, produce and perceive sign languages. This course takes an in-depth look at how they acquire, produce and perceive sign languages. Psycholinguistics generally covers three domains: acqui sition, use (perception and production) and brain studies. This course focuses on perception and production, as well as brain studies (aka neurolinguistics). With respect to production, we will examine studies that focus on \"slips of the hands\", both spont aneous and induced. With respect to perception, we will look at both online and offline cases. For brain studies, we will discuss both behavioral and imaging studies. Prerequisites: For UG students: LIN 101, 263, 301, 302; for Grad students: Permission of Instructor LIN 525 - Cognitive Linguistics and Translation (3) This course applies cognitive linguistic notions to a variety of issues in translation and other language contact domains within signed language communities. Cognitive linguistics posits an und erstanding of language as being usage based with meaning grounded in human experience and with linguistic units at multiple levels all contributing to meaning. This course will explore the implications that these and other cognitive linguistic concepts car ry with them for how we understand meaning, how we interact with each other through language, and how both form and meaning are influenced when languages and language communities are in contact. Prerequisite or Co- requisites: For UG students - LIN 301, 302; or permission of instructor; for GRAD students - permission of instructor. LIN 537 - Iconicity and Depiction (3) In this course, students are introduced to a descriptive framework with which to identify and analyze iconicity and depiction in ASL and oth er signed languages. The first part of the course focuses on depiction typology, covering role - shifting, constructed action and dialogue, classifier constructions/depicting verbs, aspectual constructions, metaphorical depictions, and other imagistic uses o f space. In the second part of the course, we examine depiction in artistic and academic settings as well as in everyday conversations and narratives. Prerequisites: LIN 101, graduate student status, or permission of the instructor. 224 LIN 537 - Iconicity a nd Depiction (3) In this course, students are introduced to a descriptive framework with which to identify and analyze iconicity and depiction in ASL and other signed languages. The first part of the course focuses on depiction typology, covering role - shifting, constructed action and dialogue, classifier constructions/depicting verbs, aspectual constructions, metaphorical depictions, and other imagistic uses of space. In the second part of the course, we examine depiction in artistic and academic s ettings as well as in everyday conversations and narratives. Prerequisites: LIN 101, graduate student status, or permission of the instructor. LIN 541 - Introduction to Sociolinguistics (3) Sociolinguistics is the discipline that studies the interaction of language and social life. This course will examine the major areas of sociolinguistics, including multilingualism, language contact, variation, language policy and planning and language attitudes. Methodological issues pertaining to the collection of soci olinguistic data will also be examined. The application of sociolinguistics to education, the law, medicine and sign language interpretation will be covered. All issues will be considered as they pertain to both spoken and signed languages. Prerequisites: For UG students: LIN 101, 263, 301, 302; for Grad students: Permission of Instructor LIN 543 - Bilingualism (3) This course explores bilingualism, with a special emphasis on bilingualism in the Gallaudet community. We will examine the place of bilingualism and multilingualism in the world, both historically and currently; the linguistic structure and features of bilingualism; social constructions of bilingualism; the acquisition of bilinguality, from the perspectives of both first - and second language acqui sition; and we will explore the functions and meanings of bilingualism in communities. For each topic, we will examine the current state of the field, first from the perspective of spoken language bilingualism and then from the perspective of signed langua ge (mixed modality) bilingualism, with special emphasis on the situation at Gallaudet University. Prerequisites: For UG students: LIN 101, 263, 301, 302; for Grad students: Permission of Instructor LIN 545 - Language as Social Practice (3) This course is a theoretical introduction to the study of language as social practice. It is social theory for those interested in language. It is also appropriate for anyone wishing to understand the place of language in recent social thought. There are no prerequisites. Topics include language and semiotics, speech acts and performativity, language and embodiment, relativity and difference, units and structures of participation, language and practice theory, discourse genres, and reference. Students will be expected to m ake their own connections in a final paper between the theories introduced in the course and their \"home disciplines,\" such as Deaf Studies, Interpreting, Education, Linguistics, and other, related fields. Prerequisite or Co- requisites: For UG students: LIN 301, 302; or Permission of Instructor; for Grad students: Permission of Instructor. LIN 555 - Applied Linguistics as Engaged Research (3) This seminar format course offers a broad introduction to the study of the various ways linguists apply their work through engagement with communities outside of academics. We will consider what makes linguistic work \"applied\": where applied linguistic research questions come from, who participates in applied linguistics, how we use and share our research knowledge, a nd what kinds of engagement with wider communities are possible. The goal of the course is to better understand how we can apply our own linguistic knowledge and approaches in order to engage ever more deeply with deaf communities. Prerequisite or Co- requi sites: For UG students - LIN 301, 302; or permission of instructor; for GRAD students - permission of instructor. LIN 572 - Language Documentation (3) This seminar will explore language documentation with an emphasis on practices related to the documentati on of signed languages. We will first examine different ways language documentation (sometimes called \"documentary linguistics\") has been conceptualized by researchers. We will then look at work that has been done in signed languages (including field work and signed language corpora) along with examining theoretical concepts and specific case studies in the literature. We will also examine signed language data sets available to researchers online. Prerequisite or Co- requisites: For UG students - LIN 301, 302; or permission of instructor; for GRAD students - permission of instructor. 225 LIN 585 - Prosody in Sign and Spoken Languages (3) This course introduces students to the theories and methods of analyzing prosody in signed and spoken languages. These prosod ic features play a critical role in human communication and have a wide range of functions, including expression at linguistic, attitudinal, affective and personal levels. Prerequisites: For UG students: LIN 101, 263, 301, 302; for Grad students: Permissio n of Instructor LIN 595 - Special Topics (1 -3) Grading System: letter grades only. LIN 661 - Brief Introduction to the Structure of American Sign Language (1) A survey of the major features of the linguistics structure and social uses of American Sign Language. The course will cover four major topics: (1) Phonology: The Study of the Raw Materials of Signs, an examination of the structure of the physical signals of ASL, the customary patterns for combining them, and influence of signs on one another in connected discourse; (2) Morphology; Building and Storing Words, the study of the basic meaningful units of ASL, including discussions of word creation, compounding, borrowing, affixation, and numeral incorporation. A discussion of the use of space in ASL, including an examination of verbs with subject and object agreement and of spatial -locative verbs; (3) Syntax: Building Sentences, the word order of ASL sentences, nonmanual syntactic signals, and discourse structures; and (4) Sociolinguistic Applications, a discussion of language variation and language contact in the deaf community. LIN 662 - Survey of American Sign Language Phonology (1) This course has four parts. Part one covers basic phonetic notation and includes practice in the phonetic description of lexical signs of ASL. This will include an examination of hand configurations, placements, orientations, nonmanual signals, and two -hand relationships. Part two deals with phonological processes, including movement epenthesis, hold deletion, metathesis, assimilation, location neutralization, and weak hand deletion. Part three examines phonotactic patterns within the lexicon of ASL, focusing on permissible combinations of phonetic elements. Part four considers the nature of phonological change and historic al shifts in the structure of the lexicon. LIN 663 - Morphology of ASL Verbs (1) This course will focus on the use of space and the behavior of verbs that use space in meaningful ways in American Sign Language. Major topics will include an examination of the signing space and the four functions of a locus, syntactic versus topographical space, mental representations of space, identity shift, a detailed examination of indicating verbs, locative verbs, classifier predicates (including discussions of imagery, verb roots, categories of classifier handshapes, and types of representations), and aspectual inflections that operate by changing the movement of verbs in space. LIN 664 - Survey of American Sign Language Syntax (1) This course begins by examining the var ious roles of nonmanual signals within ASL grammar and ASL discourse. This leads to the role of nonmanual signs in helping to determine the structure of ASL sentences. Next, the course examines the order of constituents within ASL sentences, including topi cs and topicalization, subject pronoun copy, deletion of subjects and objects, and the placement of tense markers. The next section of the course focuses on the use of space in ASL discourse, verb classes based on how space is used, verb agreement, and conceptual mapping. The course concludes by examining subordination and specific types of ASL syntactic structures including relative clauses, conditional clauses, and related constructions. LIN 665 - Sociolinguistics of the Deaf Community (1) This course provides an overview of the major areas of sociolinguistics and of current sociolinguistic thinking, with a focus on the Deaf community. It begins with an introduction to the field, followed by a look at bilingualism and language contact phenomena, including lexical borrowing, code -switching, code -mixing, diglossia, pidgins, and creoles. Following this look at intralanguage phenomena, the focus turns to the internal and external constraints upon them. Discourse analysis is then examined, with a focus on language and social interaction and the structure of conversations. Language attitudes are then discussed, followed by a look at language policy and planning. 226 LIN 670 - Introduction to First Language Acquisition by Children (1) This course introduces students to the processes by which children acquire their first language, focusing on the major milestones of phonological and syntactic development. Children everywhere accomplish the task of learning their native language by the age of 5. They succeed despite the cognitive limitations of their age and follow the same general patterns of development regardless of what language they are learning. The efficiency with which children acquire language suggests some degree of innate linguistic knowledge, or a 'language instinct.' This course will overview some of the major research discoveries of how children combine this language instinct with information provided by the environment to acquire their native language. Course topics will include babbling and early phonetic development by infants, acquisition of word order, questions, and word meanings. A final segment of the course will explore the acquisition of sign languages and the ways in which deaf children's signing development parallels that of spoken language in hearing children. LIN 671 - Introduction to Acquisition of Sign Language (1) Modern linguistic theory, traditionally based on research conducted on spoken languages, has benefited greatly from recent linguistic investigation of sign languages. Findings of sim ilarities between spoken and sign languages reaffirm their equivalent status as fully natural languages, while differences point to areas where existing theory must be expanded. This course introduces students to the acquisition of ASL as a first language by deaf children and the unique contributions this research makes to general theories of language development. As background preparation, we will begin with a broad overview of important milestones in the acquisition of spoken language by hearing children. This will be followed by a short discussion on the effects of modality (oral/aural vs. gestural/visual) on the acquisition process. The remaining two- thirds of the class will be devoted to language development in the gestural/visual modality. Readings and lectures will center on the acquisition of phonology and selected syntactic phenomena, including nonmanuals and questions. The course will end with a discussion of delayed exposure to sign language and its effects on acquisition, a topic of great importan ce to the field of Deaf education. Prerequisite: LIN 670 LIN 699 - Independent Study (1 -3) Grading System: letter grades or pass/fail at the option of the instructor.

Riddick, Chair Field House, Room 144E The Physical Education and Recreation Department offers a major in physical education and recreation, and minors in recreation and sport p rogramming and athletic coaching at the undergraduate level. In an era in which health care costs have become one of the largest single expenditure in the U.S., the central importance of physical activity and active lifestyles in preventing and improving a wide variety of health conditions is now well understood. The Physical Education and Recreation major prepares students to become leaders in promoting health -enhancing physical activities. Students acquire professional content knowledge and develop sk ills in planning, leading, and managing recreation, sports, and physical activity programs in a variety of community settings. The major prepares students for careers related to active lifestyles that contribute to an improved quality of life. The major program emphasizes Gallaudet University's unique approaches to bilingual communication that accommodate Deaf, hard of hearing and hearing individuals. Graduates are prepared for entry -level position in the areas of physical education, recreation, and spor ts, as well as continuation of study at the graduate level. The undergraduate program will prepare students to continue their preparation beyond the B.S. degree in management level training within the recreation profession, the expanding fitness industry, or education. Students are required to complete two internship experiences. Fieldwork opportunities are available with a variety of recreation, afterschool and summer youth programs, as well as athletics. If a student is interested in pursuing teacher certification, additional courses and practicum experience beyond the physical education and recreation major will be required, including enrolling in an accredited teacher preparation undergraduate or graduate program. While no university degree ensures employment, graduates who have tailored their programs and work experiences to market opportunities have done well in securing relevant career positions. It is the department faculty's goal to develop and maintain close ties to the profession to help stud ents become leading candidates for jobs upon graduation.
