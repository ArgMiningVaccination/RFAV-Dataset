Acupuncture is an art that relies on the wisdom of traditional Chinese medicine to identify patterns that are causing an imbalance. It involves the insertion of very fine needles into specific acupuncture points to encourage balance and to support the body's innate power to heal itself. Acupuncture retrains the nervous system by releasing chemicals that affect pain locally as well as systemic processes affected by hormones in muscles, the spinal cord, and the brain. This process changes the way your body experiences symptoms like pain, anxiety, headaches, allergies, or menstrual irregularities. Retraining your nervous system occurs over a series of treatments and has a cumulative effect making acupuncture more effective when you are seen more often. Over time, it helps to increase resilience to stress, immune depletion, and other ailments so that you experience long-term body health. "}
