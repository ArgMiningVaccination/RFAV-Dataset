The US Food and Nutrition Board's published Tolerable Upper Intake Levels for Vitamin B6 state that adults over the age of 19 shouldn't consume more than 100 mg of vitamin B6 per day (even if they're pregnant or breastfeeding) [1]. But, what happens when you take too much vitamin B6? How can you avoid vitamin B6 toxicity in the first place? Let's dive deeper.

The National Institute of Health notes that [1]: If you suspect that you're experiencing B6 toxicity, it's critical that you stop taking the supplements right away. It could be the key to alleviating your symptoms. So, how do you make sure you're getting enough B6 without risking vitamin B6 toxicity?
