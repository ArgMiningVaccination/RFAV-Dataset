Three previous editions have been released. Originally developed in 1988 in support of the postsecondary transcript study in the National Longitudinal Study of the High School Class of 1972 (NLS- 72) (Adelman, 1990) , the taxonomy was updated 1993 for the High School and Beyond Study (HS&B) (Adelman, 1999) and again in 2000 for the National Educational Longitudinal Study (NELS:88/00) (Adelman, 2003; 2004). The 2010 College Course Map (CCM:2010) was updated in 2009 in support of two postsecondary education transcript collections . The 2009 Postsecondary Education Transcript Study (PETS:09) incorporated transcript collections for the 2004/09 Beginning Postsecondary Education Students Longitudinal Study (BPS:04/09) and the 2008/09 Baccalaureate and Beyond Study (B&B:08/ 09). This publication describes how the newest version of the College Course Map was updated and provides a listing of all the course codes used for PETS:09. Earlier editions of the College Course Map were developed using faculty review groups in major disciplinary areas (e.g. , mathematics, business, chemistry, allied health, English , etc.). These groups were provided descriptions from course catalogs and used NCES postsecondary transcript data to develop recommendations on coding and decision rules. CCM :2010 c ourse codes were updated by integrating selected courses from the College Course Map (CCM) (Adelman, 200 3) into the 2010 Classification of Instructional Programs ( CIP) taxonomy from NCES. PETS codes were represented by six digits in keeping with the CIP taxonomy: the first 2 -digits indicated the most general category; the first 4 -digits narrowed the focus to a subcategory; and the complete 6-digit code provided the most specific definition of the subject. Figure 1 provides a visual representation of the structure of the codes. Figure 1. CIP code diagram: 2009 NOTE: CIP = Classification of Instructional Programs. SOURCE: U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, 2004/09 Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study (BPS:04/09). Course codes in the CCM taxonomy, which used the same 6- digit structure as the then -current CIP, were developed through extensive transcript analysis and with input from expert advisors, including postsecondary faculty familiar with the fiel ds of study. To create a comprehensive course coder for PETS:09, content from the CCM was merged with the 2010 CIP in two ways: (1) course codes found in the CCM without equivalents in the CIP were added as new codes, and (2) CCM codes with equivalent CIP codes were reviewed and, when additional details or examples were found, they were added to the CIP definitions. The first method resulted in the addition of 352 unique CCM course codes to the CCM:2010. These additions were placed alongside related topics in the 2- digit Introduction 2 2010 College Course Map category and 4 -digit subcategory structure common to both the CCM and CIP taxonomies. To make these additions easily identifiable, the last 2 digits in their codes used a unique numbering scheme, starting with 98 and descending as needed. An example can be seen in code 01.0698 in figure 2. The second method for integrating the CCM and the 2010 CIP resulted in adding content to the definitions of 316 CIP codes. The additional text increased the likelihood of identifying appropriate course codes using the keyword searchable coding system used in the BPS:04/09 and B&B:08/09 transcript collections . In instances where a CIP code was elaborated, the CCM content was placed at the end of the CIP definition. Finally, in addition to content from the CC M, 47 general and other codes were added to the CCM:2010 using fifth and sixth digit values of \" 00\" for general and \" 99\" for other, when these codes were not already present in the CIP. Figure 2 illustrates a representative set of codes in the CCM . Figure 2. Course codes layout in the CCM:2010 code s: 2009 NOTE: Bold text represents content and codes added from the College Course Map taxonomy (CCM). SOURCE: U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, 2004/09 Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study (BPS:04/09). The course codes are divided in the following families or course clusters, which are consistent with the 2010 CIP system for classifying programs: 01 Agriculture, Agriculture Operations, And Related Services 03 Natural Resources and Conservation 04 Architecture and Related Services 05 Area, Ethnic, Cultural, Gender, and Group Studies 09 Communication, Journalism, and Related Programs 10 Communications Technologies/Technicians and Support Services 11 Computer and Information Sciences and Support Services 12 Personal and Culinary Services 13 Education 14 Engineering 15 Engineering Technologies and Engineering- Related Fields 16 Foreign Languages, Literatures, and Linguistics 19 Family and Consumer Sciences/Human Sciences 22 Legal Professions and Studies Introduction 2010 College Course Map 3 23 English Language and Literature/Letters 24 Liberal Arts and Sciences, General Studies and Humanities 25 Library Science 26 Biological and Biomedical Sciences 27 Mathematics and Statistics 28 Military Science, Le adership and Operational Art. 29 Military Technologies and Applied Sciences 30 Multi/Interdisciplinary Studies 31 Parks, Recreation and Leisure Studies 32 Basic Skills and Developmental/Remedial Education 33 Citizenship Activities 34 Health -Related Knowled ge and Skills 35 Interpersonal and Social Skills 36 Leisure and Recreational Activities 37 Personal Awareness and Self -Improvement 38 Philosophy and Religious Studies 39 Theology and Religious Vocations 40 Physical Sciences 41 Science and Technologies/Tech nicians 42 Psychology 43 Homeland Security, Law Enforcement, Firefighting and Related Protective Services 44 Public Administration and Social Service Professions 45 Social Sciences 46 Construction Trades 47 Mechanic and Repair Technologies/Technicians 48 Precision Production 49 Transportation and Materials Moving 50 Visual and Performing Arts 51 Health Professions and Related Programs 52 Business, Management, Marketing, and Related Support Services 53 High School/Secondary Diplomas and Certificates 54 Histo ry 60 Residency Programs 90 Other Courses Code Categories This section describes each six -digit code used to classify postsecondary education courses in the BPS:04/09 and B&B:08/09 studies.1 01 Agriculture, Agriculture Operations, and Related Services 01.0000 Agriculture , General.
