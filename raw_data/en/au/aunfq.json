While there are some similarities between the two, these are several unique differences which can help you to determine the cause of your symptoms. Typical allergy symptoms consist of sneezing, nasal congestion, postnasal drainage, a runny nose, watery or itchy eyes, and a cough. While some allergy symptoms, such as nasal congestion and a cough, can also be symptoms of COVID-19, these symptoms are usually accompanied by respiratory symptoms and a fever if you do have COVID-19. Most people do not typically experience respiratory symptoms as a result of allergic rhinitis unless they have underlying allergic asthma. Allergies also do not generally cause symptoms of fatigue, which is common with COVID-19. Sneezing, which is a common allergy symptom, is not typical of COVID-19. Patients who believe that they are experiencing symptoms of hay fever or know that they will experience symptoms soon should consider managing with nasal sprays, antihistamines, nasal rinse, eye drops, etc. If you are being treated with immunotherapy to manage symptoms of allergic rhinitis, you should also continue to receive your allergy shots regularly. Above all you should trust your knowledge of your own body. If symptoms feel different from your typical allergy symptoms then you should consider reaching out to your primary care provider to discuss your concerns. You should also contact your primary care provider if symptoms do not improve or worsen despite use of medication or if any additional symptoms, such as a fever, appear. If you have never experienced allergies in the past but find yourself suffering this fall from nasal symptoms or other COVID-19 related symptoms, such as fever or fatigue, you should consider getting tested for COVID-19. Below is a chart designed to help you navigate your symptoms a little more easily. Tips for managing allergies during COVID-19 Although it may seem like second-nature to rub your itchy eyes or wipe your nose when you are suffering from allergies, remember to not touch your face as this can help to spread germs from your hands to the eyes, nose, or mouth. Instead, you should wash your hands for twenty seconds before using a tissue to wipe. You should then wash your hands again for another twenty seconds. You can also take measures to ensure that you track less pollen into the house when you return home. Some ways to do this are to remove your shoes at the door before entering the house, wash your clothes after you spend time outdoors, and take a shower before bed so that no symptom-causing particles are transferred to your bedding. It's also best if you keep your windows shut so that allergens remain outside. Even if you are not going outside frequently, it can be a good idea to take your usual allergy treatment as a preventative measure. This will help to prevent allergy flares which could be confused with COVID-19. Being proactive will then often help to control and prevent breakthrough symptoms. If problems do arise, our clinic is also available to speak with you either through a telehealth or an in-person appointment. COVID-19 and Asthma We understand that patients with asthma can be especially concerned when it comes to contracting COVID-19. In order to help prevent exacerbations of your asthma during COVID-19, it is important to continue to take your prescribed medications and to follow your physician prescribed asthma action plan. Try to avoid any known triggers for your asthma. In following these steps, you can help to reduce any inflammation in your airway which will help to minimize the risk for exacerbations. Masks will not make asthma worse so it's also important to remember to wear a mask when leaving your home. Patients should exercise excess caution when using nebulizer treatments during COVID-19. As nebulizers aerosolize droplets from your airway, you should make sure that no one is in the room during or after where you performed the treatment until a few hours later. This is due to the fact that the virus, along with other microbes, may be transmitted into the air by the nebulizer. If others do need to be in the room, they should wear a mask. Nebulizers should also be cleaned thoroughly following use to ensure that no microbes remain trapped in the device. Strong emotions are known to trigger asthma attacks, so make sure you are taking time to focus on your mental health. If you are feeling stressed, overwhelmed, or anxious you should try to participate in stress-relieving activities such as meditation or yoga. You may also consider reaching out to your primary care provider if feelings persist. Final Takeaways We recognize that this is a challenging and scary time for many patients. We encourage you to reach out if you have any questions or concerns whatsoever and to keep in mind that we are available for either telehealth or in-person appointments. Please let us know if we can help you in any way during this time and we hope that you and your families will continue to stay safe and healthy. "}
