The shortened life of platelets bec ause of immunologic damage (antibodies absorbed by platelets) and insufficient compensatory increased function of the bone marrow result in reduced number of platelets in the peripheral blood. There are three forms of ITP: acute, chronic and persistent. The acute form occurs in 80-90% of cases with bleeding episodes lasting a few days or weeks, but no longer than 6 months. The new 2011 ASH guideline increased this period to one year. It is t ypical for the phenomenon of bleeding that it starts suddenly and without any other sign of illness. The most frequent acute form appears betw een the second and fourth year and it usually occurs after acute viral infections. Children older than 10 years of age, like adults, often have th e chronic form associated with other immunologic disorders. Hemorrhagic manifestations include: petechiae, purpura, epistaxis, gastrointestinal and ary bleeding. They depend on the grade of thrombocytopenia, although there is no strict correlation between the number of platelets and volume of bleeding. In cases of acute ITP in children, usually there are two therapeutic options or therapies of choice: corticosteroids and high d oses of intravenous immunoglobulin. In cases of distinctive hemorrhagic syndrome, there are also indications for platelet transfusion. Nowadays splenectomy is more restricted, because one third of cases are unsuccessful. (Turk Arch Ped 2012; 47: 8-17) Key words: ITP, 10.4274/tpa.1659 Tiraje Celkan stanbul University Cerrahpaa Medical Faculty, Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, stanbul, Turkey Introduction Immune (idiopathic) thyrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is an acquired disease which develops as a result of shortening ofplatelet life span by autoantibodies produced against plateletsand is characterized by thrombocytopenia clinically. In immunethrombocytopenic purpura, destruction of peripehralthrombocytes is tried to be balanced by increase inmegacariocytes in the bone marrow. However, antithrombocyteantibodies can also affect the production of thrombocytes andthus the number of megacariocytes may be decreased orproduction of thyrombocytes may be disrupted in the bonemarrow. Bleeding findings (frequently purpuric skin lesions,mucosal bleedings) develop according to the degree ofthyrombocytopenia (1). Immune thyrombocytopenic purpura usually occurs acutely in children after an infection or vaccination and tendsto improve spontaneously in a short time. However, ITP isusually a chronic disease in adults. Therefore, treatment approach is different in adults and children (2-4). Currently,there is no laboratory test which is diagnostic for ITP . Therefore, the diagnosis of ITP is usually made by excludingother causes of thyrombocytopenia (4-9). Immune thyrombocytopenic purpura is the most common reason for thyrombocytopenia in children. The actual incidenceis not known, since the disease is frequently transient. In studiesperformed in North America, the incidence in the 1-14 age groupis reported to be 7,2-9,5/100000 (1,3). In a recent studyperformed by Kurata et al.(10), it was reported that the incidencewas 1,9/100000, made a peak between the ages of 2 and 5years and occured more commonly in boys before the age of 4.ITP has a seasonal course and it occurs more frequently inwinter and in the early spring period. Race and genderdifference is not prominent (11). In 544 patients for whom weobtained adequate information in the files in our first 32-yearseries (1978-2011), the mean age was found to be 5.3\u00b13.6,male/female ratio was found to be 1.1, the rate of becoming chronic was found to be 9,3% and the rate of presentation withwet purpura was found to be 28%. While we could not find anysignificant seasonal difference, we found a slightly higher rate ofpresentation in the spring and autumn (12). In 2011, the American Hematology Association compiled its recommendations about ITP in a guideline. According to thisguideline (8): 1) The abbreviation of ITP: Purpura or red blots had been inspired from \"porphyra\" from the time of Hippocrates and thetime of Galen and means purple fish (13). Since purpura are notpresent in a great part of patients, the term immunethrombocytopenia is recommended to be used instead ofidiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. 2) The limit of thrombocytopenia has been accepted as 100 x109, because the risk of severe thrombocytopenia was foundto be 6,9% in a 10-year follow-up of adults with a thrombocytecount of 100-150 x109. When the distribution of thrombocytes innormal individuals were examined in some African-Asiancountries, the upper limit was found to range between 100 x109and 150 x109. In addition, this upper limit was found to be moreappropriate to exclude pregnancy-related thrombocytopenia. 3) Etiological evaluation in immune (idiopathic) thrombocytopenic purpura: It is divided into two groups as primary and secondary ITP according to the factors which playa role in the etiology: a) Primary ITP: Primary ITP is an autoimmune disease characterized by thrombocytopenia alone ((<100 x109). Thediagnosis of primary ITP is a diagnosis of exclusion. A definitediagnosis of ITP can not be made clinically or by laboratoryfindings. The absence of other causes of thrombocytopeniashould be manifested. b) Secondary ITP: All thrombocytopenies other than primary ITP are in this group. When it is described, the cause isrecommneded to be written in parentheses (SLE-related). 4) Periods of immune (idiopathic) thrombocytopenic purpura: Previously, ITP was classified as acute, recurring and chronicaccording to the time of thrombocytopenia. In new guidelines,these definitions are grouped as follows: a)Newly diagnosed ITP: Acute ITP is a retrospective description and the period before the presentation of the patientcan not be known. Therefore, the term\" newly diagnosed ITP\"was accepted instead of acute ITP . It was found to be appropriate to cover the first three months after the diagnosis. b) Persistent ITP: This covers the patients who are within the 3-12th months of the diagnosis and who have still no remissionor who do not stay in remission when the treatment isdiscontinued. Spontaneous remission is still possible in thisperiod. c) Chronic ITP: Patients with ITP lasting 12 months or longer are described in this group. In the old literature,thrombocytopenia lasting for more than 6 months wasconsidered as chronic ITP . However, a significant part of the group defined a chronic ITP between 6 and 12 monthspreviously was shown to achieve normal values at approximately the first year. Therefore, this period wasprolonged to one year. In addition, the probability of spontenousimprovement in chronic ITP is 30% at the fifth year and 44% atthe 10th year (14). 5) The severity of immune (idiopathic) thrombocytopenic purpura was previosly classified as mild, moderate and severeaccording to the degree of thrombocytopenia. Final guidelinesrecommend that only the subjects with clinically significanthemorrhage findings should be classified as severe ITP . Since there is no scale evaluating hemorrhage findings, this definitionis based on the decision of the physician (Table 1). a. Definition of response to treatment: for a positive response clinical findings should be improved definetely. b. Complete response: thrombocyte count>100x109 c. Response: patients with a thrombocyte count of 30- 100x109 and patients who reached at least a two-fold increaseover the baseline thrombocyte count. d. Irresponsive: patients with a thrombocyte count of <30x109 and patients who could not reach at least a two-foldincrease over the baseline thrombocyte count. e. Corticosteroid dependence: Patients with a thrombocyte count of>30x109 or patients who should use corticosteroidscontiniously or intermittantly at least for 2 months to prevent Turk Arch Ped 20 12; 47: 8-17Tiraje Celkan Childhood ITP 9 1.

Tests recommended in the American 2011 Guideline for the diagnosis of ITPbleeding. This may apply to other drugs (e.g azathioprine dependent, etc.). These patients should be accepted asirresponsive. This condition which is observed rarely in childrenlead to problems in adults. f. Refractory ITP: There are two conditions for this definition. The first condition is splenectomy. The second condition isclinical findings requiring treatment or hemorrhage findings inthe patient with thrombocytopenia after splenectomy. Thisdefinition is usually used for adults. Pathogenesis When Harrington (13) gave 9-10ml blood taken from a patient with ITP to a healthy person in 1951 for the first time,thrombocyte counts was shown to be decreased in hours. Beforethis Dameshek and Miller (13) examined bone marrow aspiratesof patients with ITP in 1946 and suggested that there was a factorwhich disrupted thrombocyte production by affectingmegacariocytes of these patients. As a result of culture of theplasma of a patient with ITP with a sample of bone marrow of ahealthy person in 1980's, disruption in growth of megacariocytesand production of thrombocytes and a moderate increase in TPOlevel in contrast to what is expected were observed. It was foundthat the life time of thrombocytes which is 9,9 days normally wasshortened up to 48-230 minutes by tracking of radiolabeledthrombocytes in the body. In these patients, thrombocyteproduction rate is increased by 4-9 fold (15). In chronic ITP , it was shown that thrombocyte destruction was minor, but productionwas inadequate and the life span of the thrombocytes which areproduced in the bone marrow and transferred to the peripheralblood was close to normal people. Studies found thatthrombocyte increase obtained with use of cortisone in patientswith chronic ITP arised from trasfer of thrombocytes to thecirculation rather than decrease in destruction. After invention ofthrombopoetin in 1994 it was proved that TPO was bound to itsreceptor found on the membran of and MAPK. When trombocytecount is high in the peripheral blood, TPO is taken bythrombocytes and few TPO remains in the circulation. However,TPO entering into the thrombocyte is decreased and its amountis increased in the peripheral blood, when thrombocyte count isdecreased. TPO stimulates megacariocytes and increasesthrombocyte production and maturation. Thus, the desiredthrombocyte count is tried to be obtained (15). Amongthrombocytopenias, the highest TPO level is obtained inamegacariocytic thrombocytopenia, as expected. The lowestTPO level is found in chronic ITP . Anti TPO antibodies are usually not present in patients with ITP . However, antibodies against TPO receptor have been shown both in patients with ITP and inpatients with systemic lupus. Immune (idiopathic)thrombocytopenic purpura is a heterogeneous disease with acomplex pathogenesis. An acute infection is frequently the firsttriggering factor of the disease (15). Possible mechanisms:1. Destruction related to antibodies Antibody-coated thrombocytes are destructed by activated Fc receptors on reticuloendothelial cells frequently in the spleen(recognition of IgG Fc part by antithrombocyte antibodies). GpIa/IIa). Theseantithrombocyte function. 2. Disrupted thrombocyte productionAntibody and cellular cytotoxicity affect the rate and amount of production. In the etiology of immune (idiopathic)thrombocytopenic purpura, inadequate production has beennoted in recent years and has been demostrated withthrombocyte kinetic studies (indium labeled autologousthrombocytes). Thrombopoetine levels were not found to beincreased with the expected rate (16). 3. T cell acitivityCD4+ T helper cells regulate B cells which release antithrombocyte antibodies. However, glycoprotein-specificantibodies are absent in 20-40% of patients with ITP . Genes involved in cell-related toxicity (granzime, perforin) (CD3+CD8+T cell) are upregulated. History and clinical findings In children, the diagnosis of ITP is made by excluding other causes of thrombocytopenia. Even in typical cases, completeblood count and peripheral smear should be repeated at regularintervals until the diagnosis is definite or improvement occurs. Ifthrombocytopenia is present from the early period of life, familialhistory is positive or marked findings are present, hereditarythrombocytopenia should be suspected. In patients with multipleautoimmune cytopenias, other autoimmune diseases includingsystemic lupus (SLE), CVID (variable immune deficiency), ALPS(autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome) should beconsidered. In older children, the rate of tendency to chronicdisease is higher. In 50-80% of patients with newly diagnosed ITP (approximately 60%), there is a history of infection (mostly viral)during the last 1-3 weeks. Non-specific upper respiratoryinfections is the most common reason in patients with ITP whichdevelops after infection. In 20% of the rubella, mumps,infectious mononucleosis, cytomegalovirus, hepatitis A, B, C,parvovirus or bacterial infection can be found. There are studiesabout ITP after vaccination (16). The mechanism is notexplained fully. While the most common vaccine responsible isreported to be measles, rubella and mumps (MMR) vaccine,recent publications that ITP also developed afterhepatitis B vaccine. Although ITP develops in the first 6 weeksafter vaccination, sometimes this period can prolong up to 9weeks. Another point which should be paid attention in a childwith immune thrombocytopenic (idiopathic) fpurpura Celkan Childhood ITP 10continue the vaccination program in a child who had received intravenous immunglobulin or steroid treatment and who hadrecovered. Although no definite data are available on thissubject, it is reported that at least one month would be a safeinterval between live vaccine and the end of corticosteroidtreatment, when prednisolone at a dose of 20 mg/day isadministered for longer than 2 weeks. If IVIG had been used fortreatment, live vaccine is recommended to be administered forat least after 8 months if the dose is low as 400 mg, after 10months if the dose is 1 gram and after 11 months if the dose is2 grams (17,18). Petechiae, ecchymoses and mucosal bleedings are associated ITP . Physical examination is normal other than purpura. Mild findings are present in 50% of the subjects.Petechias are observed in the subconjunctivae, buccal mucosa,soft palate and skin. Ecchymoses are usually observed on theanterior part of the lower extremities and on bone prominences(costae, scapula, shoulders, legs and pubic area). In addition tothis of hemorrhages, epistaxis, gingival bleeding,gastrointestinal system bleeding and hematuria may be observedespecially in the beginning of the disease (1). Severemenorrhagia, retinal hemorrhage, middle ear hemorrhage whichmay lead to hearing deficit and central nervous sytemhemorrhage which is one of the most frightening complicationsmay also occur. Hematoma and hemarthrosis are observed rarely.They may develop after intramuscular injection or severe trauma. The classification which evaluates the severity of bleeding based only signs and symptoms without considering thethrombocyte count is used more frequently in the childhood (19): A. There are no symptoms or mild symptoms are present: Very few petechiae or ecchymoses are present. There is nomucosal bleeding. Daily life is not affected markedly. 57% of thenewly diagnosed patients are in this group. B. Moderate degree: More severe skin and mucosal lesions, epistaxis and menorrhagia are present. C. Severe: Hemorrhage periods which requires transfusion or hospitalization (retinal, intracranial bleeding, menorrhagia,epistaxis, melena) are present. The quality of life is affectedseverely. Transfusion may be needed. Physical examination usually does not reveal any pathology except for hemorrhage findings. Paleness is not present unlesssevere bleeding occurs. The spleen is palpable in less than 10%of the subjects and is associated with viral infection (1). Thepresence of splenomegaly should suggest the possibility ofleukemia, SLE, infectious mononucleosis or hypersplenism. Nolymphadenopathy is found unless a triggering factor like viraldisease is present. The frequency of intracranial bleeding is and 20000/mm3in 25% and above 20000/mm3 in 2%. The period between the time of diagnosis of immune(idiopathic) thrombocytopenic purpura and the time ofintracranial bleeding is approximately 27 weeks (51% of thesubjects in the first 4 weeks, 49% between 4 weeks and 9 years). Approximately 50% of the patients with intracranialbleeding have other risc factors [cranial acid (5%), arteriovenous malformation (17%)].The most clue count, thrombocyte count is always below 150000/mm 3(<100000/mm 3according to the last guideline) and frequently <20000/mm 3in patients with diffuse findings of bleeding. MPV is increased. Anemia in relation with the amountof blood loss may be present. Thrombocytopenia found in complete blood count should be supported by peripheral smear prepared from the fingertip.Pseudothrombocyteopenia and other hematologic causesshould be excluded. In (1,23). Bone marrow examination: This is recommended only if an abnormality other than thrombocytopenia in complete bloodcount/peripheral smear or systemic findings (bone pain,unexplained splenomeglay) are present in a newly diagnosedpatient. It should also be considered in patients who have a verylow response or no response to primary care treatments (8)(Table 2, 3). On examination of bone marrow aspiration, megacariocytes are increased and frequently unmatured, there is no budding,erythroid and myeloid cells are normal, increased eosinophylesmay be observed rarely and erythroid hyperplasia is found Ped 20 12; 47: 8-17Tiraje Celkan Childhood Petechiae, <5cm ecchymosis >5cm ecchymosis Epistaxis lasting more than 20 minutes Intermittent bleeding in the gingiva, throat, GIS,Reduction in Hb below 2 g as a result ofhematuria,hypermenorrhea etc Severe Epistaxis which requires cautery or tamp Reduction in Hb >2 g as a result of bleeding in GIS, gingiva etc., suspicious organ bleedings Life-threatening bleeding Intracranial bleedings or bleeding causing hypotension and requiring >10ml/kg intravenous fluid and blood transfusionTable 2. Classification of the severity of bleedingmarked blood loss is present. If it is a typical ITP case, there is no need to perform bone marrow aspiration. However, thenecessity of performing bone marrow aspiration before steroidtreatment is still contradictory. Nevertheless, in most centers,bone marrow aspiration is performed if steroid treatment is to bestarted. Patients with acute leukemia very rarely present withthrombocytopenia alone (<0.1%) (1). However, bone marrowaspiration should be definetely performed, if atypical findings arepresent or if there is no response to treatment. The definite needfor bone marrow aspiration before starting treatment to preventmasking of other diagnoses by steroid treatment was stated in1996 guideline. In the 2011 guideline of the AmericanHematology Journal, it is stated that bone marrow aspiration isnot needed before corticosteroid treatment is started orsplenectomy is performed (proof level 2C), when there is noresponse to IVIG treatment (proof level 1B), if history, clinicalfindings and laboratory findings support the diagnosis of ITP . We still perform bone marrow aspiration in Cerrahpaa MedicalFaculty before starting corticosteroid treatment. We belive thatone should be careful when making a diagnosis of ITP incountries (including Turkey) where consanguineous marriagesare common, complete blood count is not performed regularlyand therefore previos values of the patients are not known.Thus, we have many patients in whom we made diagnosesincluding depot disease, hemaphagocytosis, myelodysplasticsyndrome and megaloblastic anemia in this way. Again, amongour patients who were followed up with a diagnosis of ITP , there are patients who were diagnosed as Bernard-Soulier, vWFdisease and portal hypertension by only deepening the history. In the coagulation profile, bleeding time is usually long, prothrombin time (PT), activated thromboplastin time (APTT)and fibrinogen level are normal. If clinically required, antinuclear antibody (ANA) and anti- ds-DNA, blood group, direct Coombs test, liver creatinine, Epstein-Barr virus, CMV , HIV andparvovirus Causes of including Fanconi aplastic anemia,myelodysplastic syndrome, Evans type 2B and drug-inducedthrombocytopenia should be excluded. Drug-related ITP is found more frequently in adults, but drugs should be interrogated in every pediatric ITP case (24). Inclinical practice, we confront thrombocytopenia most commonlyin use of anticonvulsants. In the literature, cases with use of antiinflammatory drugs, acsiximab, acetaminophen andbevacizumab have been reported (24). The relation with immune (idiopathic) thrombocytopenic purpura and H.pylori was shown in adults (25). Studiesperformed in recent years about childhood ITP elucidated thissubject. There are studies indicating that elimination of H.pyloriespecially in chronic ITP cases increased thrombocyte count(26,27). However, there are investigators who do not agree withthis (28). In 20% of children with chronic ITP , H.pylori was found and elimination of infection by treatment increased thethrombocyte count to normal values in 39% of the cases (27). Additionally, this guideline includes the following recommendations: - Antinuclear antibody test is not needed to be performed in children and adolescents with a suspicious diagnosis of ITP (2C). - In persistent or chronic ITP , it is not recommended to order H.pylori test (1B). - The first MMR vaccine should be administered at the planned time in children with a history of immune (idiopathic)thrombocytopenic purpura who have not received MMR vaccinebefore(1B). - When the time of the second dose comes in children with MMR vaccine-related or non-MMR vaccine related ITP , antibody levels should be checked. If immunity is adequate (90-95% ofthe children), the vaccine should not be administered. Ifimmunity is inadequate, MMR vaccine should be readministeredat the recommended time (1B). Treatment of acute childhood ITP The treatment of acute ITP aims to increase the thrombocytopenia which causes or may cause clinical findingsto a level which will not lead to bleeding and to keep thethrombocytopenia as short as possible rather than targeting thecause. Therefore, the aim is to obtain a thrombocyte level whichwill provide adequate hemostasis rather than achieve a normalthrombocyte count (1,23). During the thrombocytopenic period,the patient should avoid sportive activities and use ofantiaggregant drugs including aspirin and intramuscularinjections. The information that immune (idiopathic)thrombocytopenic purpura is a benign disease and improves inmost patients without problems and sequelas should be sharedwith the family and the child. Since most patients can befollowed up at home, information related to the physician to becontacted in case of bleeding should be given. The family shouldbe informed about what should be done in cases of severebleeding. Since immune (idiopathic) thrombocytopenic purpuracan last for weeks-months, the child should not fall behind atschool or daily activities. Patients without severe bleeding can befollowed up as outpatients initially with weekly intervals and thenwith longer intervals. In patients with skin eruptions alone, thereis no need to perform complete blood count at frequent intervals.However, close follow-up is appropriate for the first 7-10 days Arch Ped 20 12; 47: 8-17Tiraje Celkan Childhood ITP 12 - Bone marrow aspiration (BMA) examination is not required in children and adults with typical ITP findings (1B). - Bone marrow aspiration examination is not definitely required in patients who do not respond to IVIG treatment (1B). - Bone marrow aspiration examination is not definitely required before steroid treatment or splenectomy (2C).Table 3. Recommendations about BMA in ASH 2011 guideline (8) patients with a thrombocyte count <20000. In patients who maintain very low thrombocyte counts, but no bleeding is found,a decision of treatment can be made together with the patientand the family, if the quality of life is affected (not being able toparticipate in sportive activities, etc.). Treatment of immune(idiopathic) thrombocytopenic purpura can increase thethrombocyte count much more rapidly compared to follow-upwithout treatment (Proof level 1B) (Table 4). Treatments of immune (idiopathic) thrombocytopenic purpura usullay do not cure the underlying pathology and do notguarantee for complete remission. In addition, they have sideeffects. Therefore, currently the best treatment in ITP is \"wait andsee\" treatment (29). Treatment options should be considered inpatients with bleeding. Clinical data indicate that there is no treatment to prevent intracranial or life-threatening severe bleedings, yet. In addition,severe bleeding attacks can be found during follow-up eventhough the patient was treated adequately at the time ofdiagnosis. In the follow-up, scoring and classification ofbleeding is based on the experience of the physician. Thecountries in North Europe suggested a scoring system byshowing that problematic bleedings occured more frequently inpatients with a thrombocytopenia lasting more than 3 monthsand with a thrombocyte count of <20000/mm 3: this scoring system was based on 6 clinical findings including sudden onset(5), age<10 years (3), presence of previous infection (2),thrombocyte count < 5 x 10(9)/l, wet purpura (1) and malegender (1). High scores determine low risk (30). In immune(idiopathic) thrombocytopenic purpura, the most frighteningfinding is intracranial bleeding (ICB) leads toadministration of treatment (1,23), because morbidity with arate of up to 50% is reported in children with ITP in addition tomortality. This means that a child who has had ITP which isconsidered to be a benign disease will live the rest of his/her lifewith neurological sequela. While Rosthoj et al. (31) found noICB and severe bleeding in 500 children who were followed upfor 6 months after the diagnosis, Kuhne et al. (32) reported 3cases of ICB (0.17%) in the follow-up of 2540 children. In these 3 cases of ICB, thrombocyte count was <20 000/ mm 3at the time of diagnosis and two of them received treatment. Donatoet al. (33) found ICB in 3 of 1683 patients (0.2%). All theseclinical data do not give a clue about the lower limit of treatmentand treatment type. Thus, drug selection and the decision oftreatment are left to the physician. If immune (idiopathic) thrombocytopenic purpura is not manifested by severe clinical findings or has a courseshowing mild bleeding findings (ecchymosis and petechia),the patient can be followed up with close observationindependent of the thrombocyte count. As a matter of fact,one of the best studies on this subject was performed in ourcountry. Duru et al. (34) followed up 26 children with athrombocyte count of <20 000/mm 310 of whom (38%) had mucosal bleeding without treatment for 5-32 months andadministered treatment during the follow-up period in only twochildren who had epistaxis initially (34). In a similar study,Fujisawa (35) divided the patients who had no wet purpuraand whose thrombocyte count was between 10000 and29000 into two groups and found no difference between thetwo groups one of which was followed up without treatmentand the other one was followed up by giving oral steroid for21 days. Neunert (36) emphasized that severe bleeding wasfound in only 3 of the subjects who had no severe bleedingduring the first 28 days, although the thrombocyte count was<20 000/mm 3at the time of diagnosis in 505 of 863 patients with newly diagnosed ITP and none had ICB. Interestingly, norelation was found between administration of treatmentinitially and severe bleeding. As in adults, the subject ofwhich pediatric age group needs treatment is controversial(for example, 2-3 year-old naughty boys who stop at nothing).Under normal conditions, 75-80% of the children areexpected to enter remission in 6 months. However, Kuhne(32) reported that the disease become chronic with a rate of23% between 3 months and 12 months, with a rate of 28%between 12 months and 10 years and with a rate of >47%above the age of 10 years. Kalyoncu et al. (37) found nodifference between age groups in terms of becoming chronic,treatment response and clinical findings in their study In acute ITP , treatment options include corticosteroids, IVIG and anti-D IgG and thrombocyte suspension in conditions wherebleeding can not be stopped or in case of urgent surgicalintervention (1,23,38,39-44). In recent years, interferon,monoclonal antibodies (rituksimab) and helycobacter treatmenthave also been tried (38). None of these treatments have beenshown to prevent bleeding or prevent chronicity. In Cerrahpaa Medical Faculty, we generally follow up patients with ITP , but make a decision of treatment, when the thrombocyte count is <20000, wet purpura or bleeding ispresent. We prefer IVIG in young infants and 30 mg/kg steroidtreatment for 3 days at other ages after performing BMA. Inchronic ITP cases, we determine the method of treatment forbleeding independent of the thrombocyte count. Turk Arch Ped 20 12; 47: 8-17Tiraje Celkan Childhood ITP 13 In ITP the thrombocyte count is <20 000/mm3 and the clinical picture is limited with cutaneous bleedings. Most children improve in a very short time spontaneously without treatment Treatment is not needed in cases with mild bleeding Patients who are found to have thrombocytopenia can be followed up for a while without performing bone marrowaspiration In persistent thrombocytopenia, investigation and treatment is needed. Currently, the lower limit of thrombocytopenia is accepted to be 100 000/mm 3 The rate of treated subjects has decreased from 69% to 16%. Table 4. Points which have changed in recent years in ITP (53) Primary treatment 1.When a decision of treatment is made, it is recommended to use a single dose of IVIG (0,8-1 g/kg) or short-termcorticosteroids (proof level 1B). 2.IVIG should be preferred, if the thrombocyte count is desired to be increased rapidly (proof level 1B). 3.Anti-D is not recommended as the first-line treatment in conditions in which autohemolysis is present or bleeding-relatedanemia develops (proof level 1C). 4.Anti-D can be used as the first-line treatment as a single dose in patients in whom splenectomy can not be performedand who have a blood type of Rh+ (proof level 2B). In cases who do not respond to treatment second-line treatment options are used. 1.Rituksimab can be tried, when there is no response to first-line treatments (IVIG, anti-D, conventional dose steroid) andif there is continuing risk of bleeding (proof level 2C). 2.As in cases of chronic ITP , rituksimab can be tried as an alternative for splenectomy or in cases in whom no response isobtained with splenectomy (proof level 2C). 3.When there is no response to first-line treatments and bleeding is continuing, high dose dexamethasone can be tried(proof level 2C). 4.High dose dexamethasone can be tried as an alternative to splenectomy or in cases who do not respond to splenectomy(proof level 2C). When there is no repsonse to first-line and second-line treatments, splenectomy may be a treatment option (prooflevel 1B). Splenectomy should not be performed before the 12 thmonth after the diagnosis, if there is no life-threathening condition (proflevel 2C). Splenectomy should not be performed before one year,because there is still a chance for spontaneous remission duringthis period. 80% of the patients respond to splenectomy. Theresponse is permanent and additional treatment is not needed atleast for 5 years (1,23,38,45). Partial or transient response ispresent in patients without complete response (45). 14% of thepatients do not respond and the response may be lost in time in20% of the patients with response (45). Open or laparoscopicsplenectomy can be performed (46). Complications ofsplenectomy include bleeding, infection and thrombosis. Themortality rate is reported to be 1% in open surgery and 0.2% inlaparoscopic surgery. To predict the response to splenectomythrombocyte destruction in the spleen can be shown by usingindium-labeled autologous thrombocytes (23). Accesory spleenwhich is the most significant cause of recurrence aftersplenectomy should definetely be investigated. Vaccines forH.influenza, pneumococcus and meningococcus should beadministered at least 4 weeks before splenectomy or 2 weeksafter splenectomy. After splenectomy vaccines for pneumococcusand meningococcus should be repeated every 5 years.Vaccination may not be adequate in patients who have receivedrituximab in the last 6 months. In these patients, vaccinationshould be repeated, when B cells are improved. Aftersplenectomy thromboembolism should be prevented with acetyl saslicylic acid, when thrombocyte count is >800-1000 000/mm 3. In patients with splenectomy, prophylactic penicillin isrecommended in the first 2 years, since development of sepsis isobserved frequently in the first 2 years. However, the patientshould warn his/her physician in potentail conditions with feverand should be educated in terms of infection. Corticosteroids 1) Standard-dose prednisolone: 1-2 mg/kg/day (maximum 60 mg/day) for 2 weeks. Afterwards, the dose is tapered (shouldnot last longer than a total of 3 weeks). 2) High dose methylprednisolone (HDMP):a.7,5 mg/kg, 4 days b.15 mg/kg, 4 days or 500 mg/m 2, maximum dose 1 g/day, 3 days d.30 mg/kg/day, 3 days and 20 mg/kg, 4 days. A total of 7 days. It can be used in patients with severe bleeding risk and with a thrombocyte count of 20000 mm 3and lower. Steroids act by decreasing phagocytosis and vascular permeability in addition to preventing antibody production andantibody-antigene binding. However, they have many sideeffects. Steroids may cause hypertension, hyperglycemia,hirsutism (with long-term use), striae on the skin, increase inappetite, psychosis and gastric complaints. In recent years, short-term treatment options are preferred with a higher rate to avoidside effects: there are studies indicating that administration of 16-24 mg/m 2dexamethasone for 4 days or 4 mg/kg/day oral prednisolone for 4 days every 28 days is effective. We generallyprefer a dose of 30 mg/kg for 3 days in newly diagnosed ITP . On examination of treatment response with complete blood countdaily, >100000/mm 3is considered to be a good response. Intravenous Immunglobulin It is thought that intravenous immunglobulin has various mechanisms of action. Intravenous immunglobulin decreasesphagocytic activity in the reticuloendothelial system by inhibitingFc receptors. The dose is given as 2 g/kg divided into 2 or 5days. In recent years, it was proved that the same response wasobtained with a single dose of 0.8 mg/kg. There are studiesconducted with 0.25-0.5 mg/kg (1,23). Intravenous increases thrombocytes rapidly and the lasts for 2-4 weeks. Complications related to intravenous immunglobulin are observed rarely. Allergy, fever and shivering may occur.Headache, common cold-like clinic and a picture of asepticmeningitidis with vomiting and photophobia may develop (47). Inchildren with IgA deficiency, IVIG may lead to anaphylacticreactions. It should be kept in mind that intravenousimmunglobulin is a blood product and has a very high cost. Turk Arch Ped 20 12; 47: 8-17Tiraje Celkan Childhood ITP 14Anti-D treatment It can only be used in Rh positive ITP patients. It was shown to increase thrombocytes with success in 80% of the patients.The effect lasts for 1-5 weeks. Its side effect is development ofanemia as a result of dectruction of erythrocytes. It is a cheapertreatment compared to IVIG. The recommended dose is 50-75ug/kg by intravenous infusion. Generally, a reduciton of 0.5-1g/dl is observed in hemoglobin. However, high success rates inacute ITP have been reported with a dose of 75 ug/kg (48). Rituximab This is the second treatment method which can provide a cure other than splenectomy in immune (idiopathic)thrombocytopenic purpura. 60% of the patients respond. 40% ofthese maintain their response at the end of the first year. Therate of response decreases to 30% at the end of the secondyear. In 15-20% of the patients who respond initially, theresponse is maintained for 5 years or more. The response mayoccur between 1-2 ndweeks and 6-8 thweeks. If relaps occurs in the patients, response can be obtained again with the secondadministration. Dose: 375 mg/m 2weekly, a total of 4 doses. The most severe side effects include progressive multifocalleucoencephalopathy, serum sickness and anaphylacticreactions. New data about long-term side effects are beingobtained. Rituximab should not be used in patients with activehepatitis B. The risk of long-term B cell deficiency and lowimmunoglobulinemia (acquired hypogammaglobulinemia)should not be ignored (1,23,49). In an analysis evaluating 313ITP patients who used rituximab, a significant advers event wasreported in 19 patients (life-threatening complication in 10patients, death in 9 patients). The mortality rate was reported tobe 2.9%. It should be kept in mind that this rate is higher thanthe rate found with splenectomy (50). TPO-receptor agonists Traditional ITP treatment policies functioned to decrease increased thrombocyte destruction. However, cell culture studiesperformed in recent years showed that the increase in TPOlevels were not so high in these patients in contrast to what isexpected. Thus, the option of achieving adequate thrombocytecount by increasing production was added to treatment policies.Romiplostim and Eltrombopag increase the production ofthrombocytes by activating TPO receptor. Romiplostim is usedat a dose of 1-10 \u00b5g/kg weekly as subcutaneous injection. The response develops in 1-4 weeks. The response is maintaned aslong as the drug is continued. Eltrombopag is used orally atdoses of 25, 50, 75 mg/day. The effect starts after 2 weeks. Bothdrugs have similar effects in patients in whom splenectomy wasperformed and splenectomy was not performed. With thesedrugs side effects including headache, fatigue, epistaxis andarthralgia which can be easily overcomed are observed in 20%of the patients. However, the most important adverse effects of TPO receptor agonists include decrease in thrombocytes by10% compared to the baseline value with discontinuation of thedrug (rebound thrombocytopenia), increase in reticuline fibers inthe bone marrow and thrombotic complications. Hepaticdysfunction may be observed in 13% of the patients who useeltrombopag. Safety data related to long-term use of these drugsare not adequate yet (51). Data about use in children are verylimited (52). In addition to these commonly used drugs the following drugs are used rarely: Azathioprine: 50-150 mg/g A: can be used as 2.5-3 mg/kg/day Supportive treatments Supportive treatments which increase quality of life by decreasing bleeding findings in patients with immune (idiopathic)thrombocytopenic purpura should definetely be used. Local andsystemic use of antifibrinolytics (tranexamic acid) is beneficial incontrolling bleeding in terms of supportive treatment. It shouldnot be used in renal bleedings and kidney-related bleedings. Other treatments Various treatments have been tried in children whose thrombocytopenia and bleeding continue. However, most ofthese studies have been conducted in small patient groups. Thedrugs used have generally been tried by imitating adult studies.The use of cytotoxic drugs in treatment of ITP in children iscontroversial. In refractory patients and in and hematopoetic stem cell transplantation havebeen reported to be used in case of irresponsiveness to multipledrugs. However, these treatments are considerably toxic,expensive and side effects in long-term are not known. Inchildhood, such anticancer drugs are not frequently preferred inbenign diseases including ITP . It was shown that colchicine, vitamin C, IFN-alfa, protein A immunadsorption column, plasmapheresis, recombinant FVIIause is not beneficial in patients with ITP . Transfusion of thrombocyte suspension Life-threatening bleeding is the first rationale for transfusion of thrombocyte suspension (1). Transfusion administered atTurk Arch Ped 20 12; 47: 8-17Tiraje Celkan Childhood ITP 15normal doses may be inadequate in conditions where destruction of thrombocytes is excessive including ITP . Especially in intracranial bleeding, administration of continiousIVIG combined with thrombocyte suspension for 8 hours everyhalf an hour is recommended. With this treatment bleedingusually stops. Sometimes rFVIIa is given to control bleeding. In addition, antifibrinolytic agents (tranexamic acid) which will delay dissolving of clots may be used. References 1. Bussel J. Disorders of platelets.
