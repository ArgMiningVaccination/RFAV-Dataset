It aids in the management of oxidative and inflammatory conditions, metabolic syndrome, arthritis, anxiety, and hyperlipidemia. It may also help in the management of exercise-induced inflammation and muscle soreness, thus enhancing recovery and performance in active people. In addition, a relatively low dose of the complex can provide health benefits for people that do not have diagnosed health conditions. Most of these benefits can be attributed to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Ingesting curcumin by itself does not lead to the associated health benefits due to its poor bioavailability, which appears to be primarily due to poor absorption, rapid metabolism, and rapid elimination. There are several components that can increase bioavailability. For example, piperine is the major active component of black pepper and, when combined in a complex with curcumin, has been shown to increase bioavailability by 2000%. Curcumin combined with enhancing agents provides multiple health benefits. The purpose of this review is to provide a brief overview of the plethora of research regarding the health benefits of curcumin.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2017-10-22", "cleaned_text": "[curcumin](/search?q=curcumin); [turmeric](/search?q=turmeric); [antioxidant](/search?q=antioxidant); properties of turmeric, the source of curcumin, have been known for thousands of years; however, the ability to determine the exact mechanism(s) of action and to determine the bioactive components have only recently been investigated [ [2](#B2-foods-06-00092)]. Curcumin (1,7-bis(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-1,6-heptadiene-3,5-dione), also called diferuloylmethane, is the main found in the rhizome of Curcuma [3](#B3-foods-06-00092)]. Curcuma longa has been traditionally used in Asian countries as a medical herb due to its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory [ [4](#B4-foods-06-00092)], [8](#B8-foods-06-00092)]. [2](#B2-foods-06-00092)]. It has been shown to benefit inflammatory conditions [ [9](#B9-foods-06-00092)], metabolic syndrome [ [10](#B10-foods-06-00092)], pain [ [11](#B11-foods-06-00092)], and to help in the management of inflammatory and degenerative eye conditions [ [12](#B12-foods-06-00092), [13](#B13-foods-06-00092)]. In addition, it has been shown to benefit the kidneys [ [14](#B14-foods-06-00092)]. While there appear to be countless therapeutic benefits to curcumin supplementation, most of these benefits are due to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects [ [2](#B2-foods-06-00092), [9](#B9-foods-06-00092)]. Despite its reported benefits via inflammatory and antioxidant mechanisms, one of the major problems with ingesting curcumin by itself is its poor bioavailability [ [15](#B15-foods-06-00092)], which appears to be primarily due to poor absorption, rapid metabolism, and rapid elimination. Several agents have been tested to improve curcumin's bioavailability by addressing these various mechanisms. Most of them have been developed to block the metabolic pathway of curcumin in order to increase its bioavailability. For example, piperine, a known bioavailability enhancer, is the major active component of black pepper [ [16](#B16-foods-06-00092)] and is associated with an increase of 2000% in the bioavailability of curcumin [ [17](#B17-foods-06-00092)]. Therefore, the issue of poor bioavailability appears to be resolved by adding agents such as piperine that enhance bioavailability, thus creating a curcumin complex. [2](#B2-foods-06-00092)]. Curcuminoids have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as \"Generally Recognized As Safe\" (GRAS) [ [2](#B2-foods-06-00092)], and good tolerability and safety profiles have been shown by clinical trials, even at doses between 4000 and 8000 mg/day [ [18](#B18-foods-06-00092)] and of doses up to 12,000 mg/day of 95% concentration of three curcuminoids: curcumin, bisdemethoxycurcumin, and 2.1. Antioxidant [21](#B21-foods-06-00092), [22](#B22-foods-06-00092)]. Curcumin has been shown to improve systemic markers of oxidative stress [ [23](#B23-foods-06-00092)]. There is evidence that it can increase serum activities of antioxidants such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) recent systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized control data related to the efficacy of supplementation with purified curcuminoids on oxidative stress parameters\u2014indicated a significant effect of curcuminoids supplementation on all investigated parameters of oxidative stress including plasma activities of SOD and catalase, as well as serum concentrations of glutathione peroxidase (GSH) and lipid peroxides [ [23](#B23-foods-06-00092)]. It is noteworthy to point out that all of the studies included in the meta-analysis utilized some sort of formulation to overcome bioavailability challenges, and four out of the six used piperine. Curcumin's effect on free radicals is carried out by several different mechanisms. It can scavenge different forms of free radicals, such as reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS and RNS, respectively) [ [25](#B25-foods-06-00092)]; it can modulate the activity of GSH, catalase, and SOD enzymes active in the neutralization of free radicals [ [21](#B21-foods-06-00092), [22](#B22-foods-06-00092)]; also, it can inhibit ROS-generating enzymes such as lipoxygenase/cyclooxygenase and xanthine hydrogenase/oxidase [ [21](#B21-foods-06-00092)]. In addition, curcumin is a lipophilic compound, which makes it an efficient scavenger of peroxyl radicals, therefore, like vitamin E, curcumin is also considered as a chain-breaking antioxidant [ [27](#B27-foods-06-00092)]. Anti-Inflammatory [28](#B28-foods-06-00092)]. In addition, of reactive oxygen/nitrogen species can initiate an intracellular signaling cascade that enhances pro-inflammatory gene expression. Inflammation has been identified in the development of many chronic diseases and conditions [ [10](#B10-foods-06-00092), [19](#B19-foods-06-00092), [29](#B29-foods-06-00092), [30](#B30-foods-06-00092)]. These diseases include Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, cerebral injury, cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, cancer, allergy, asthma, bronchitis, colitis, arthritis, renal ischemia, psoriasis, diabetes, obesity, depression, fatigue, and acquired immune deficiency syndromeAIDS [ [10](#B10-foods-06-00092)]. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF-) is a major mediator of inflammation in most diseases, and this effect is regulated by the activation of a transcription factor, nuclear factor (NF)-B. Whereas TNF- is said to be the most potent NF-B activator, the expression of TNF- is also regulated by NF-B. In addition to TNF-, NF-B is also activated by inflammatory cytokines; gram-negative bacteria; various disease-causing viruses; environmental fatty acids; ultraviolet radiation; cigarette Therefore, agents that downregulate NF-B and NF-B-regulated gene products have potential efficacy against several of these diseases. Curcumin has been shown to block NF-B activation increased by several different inflammatory stimuli [ [10](#B10-foods-06-00092)]. Curcumin has also been shown to suppress inflammation through many different mechanisms beyond the scope of this review, thereby supporting its mechanism of action as a potential anti-inflammatory agent [ [10](#B10-foods-06-00092)]. 3. Arthritis [31](#B31-foods-06-00092), [32](#B32-foods-06-00092)]. Although OA was once considered primarily a degenerative and non-inflammatory condition, it is now recognized as having inflammatory aspects, including elevated cytokine levels, as well as potentially being connected with systemic inflammation [ [33](#B33-foods-06-00092), [34](#B34-foods-06-00092)]. While there is no cure, there are several pharmaceutical options for treatment; however, many are costly and have undesirable side effects. Therefore, there is increased interest in alternative treatments including dietary supplements and herbal remedies [ [35](#B35-foods-06-00092)]. Several studies have shown the anti-arthritic effects of curcumin in humans with OA and rheumatoid subjects with mild-to-moderate degree knee OA were randomly assigned to receive either curcuminoid (500 mg/day in three divided doses; n = 19) with 5 mg piperine added to each 500-mg dose or a matched placebo (n = 21) for six weeks. There were significantly greater reductions in the visual analog scale (VAS) (p < 0.001), Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) scores (p = 0.001), and Lequesne's pain functional index (LPFI) (p = 0.013) scores in the treatment group compared with the placebo group. When comparing the WOMAC subscales, there were significant improvements in the pain and physical function scores (p < 0.001), but not in the stiffness score [ [40](#B40-foods-06-00092)]. There was also a decrease in systemic oxidative stress, as measured via serum activities of SOD and concentrations of reduced GSH and malonedialdehyde (MDA), in subjects receiving the treatment as compared to the placebo [ [11](#B11-foods-06-00092)]. These improvements were not associated with changes in circulating cytokines. The authors suggest that the lack of changes in circulating cytokines, despite improvements in pain, may be because in OA, inflammatory markers in the synovial fluid may be more likely elevated than systemic markers, whereas in RA, systemic markers may be more likely to be increased. Therefore, they suggest that is more plausible that the beneficial effects of curcuminoids in OA are because of local anti-inflammatory effects rather than systemic effects. In addition, the time period of supplementation may not have been long enough. In a longer (eight months) randomized control trial, 50 subjects diagnosed with OA were assigned to receive either standard treatment as prescribed by their physician or standard treatment plus two 500-mg tablets daily consisting of a natural curcuminoid mixture (20%), containing phosphatidyl-choline (40%) and microcrystalline cellulose (40%). WOMAC, physical function, and stiffness scores decreased significantly (p < 0.05) in the treatment group compared to the control. In addition, the treatment group showed significant decreases in all markers of inflammation (soluble CD40 ligand(sCD40L), interleukin 1 beta (IL-1), interleukin 6 (IL-6), adhesion molecule 1 and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) comparing baseline to follow-up, while the control group did not [ [37](#B37-foods-06-00092)]. This study had both groups maintaining standard care, which does not address the question of whether or not supplementation with curcumin can be used instead of standard management such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS). To address this question, 367 primary knee osteoarthritis patients with a pain score of 5 or higher were randomized to receive ibuprofen 1200 mg/day or C. domestica extracts 1500 mg/day for four weeks. The mean of all WOMAC scores at weeks 0, 2, and 4 showed significant improvement when compared with the baseline in both groups. After using the noninferiority test, the mean difference (95% confidence interval) of WOMAC total, WOMAC pain, and WOMAC function scores at week 4 adjusted by values at week 0 of C. domestica extracts were non-inferior to those for the ibuprofen group (p = 0.010, p = 0.018, and p = 0.010, respectively), indicating that those taking the curcumin and those taking the ibuprofen experienced the same benefits. The group taking the NSAIDS did experience more gastrointestinal issues. This suggests that curcumin may offer an alternative to NSAIDS for patients with OA seeking treatment but experiencing negative side effects [ [12](#B12-foods-06-00092)]. This was supported by results from a pilot study showing that a dose of 2 g of curcumin had an analgesic effect in subjects with acute pain but without a diagnosis of OA. At this dose, the activity was higher than that associated with 500 mg of acetaminophen, while a lower dose (1.5 g, 300 mg of curcumin) gave only transient and often inadequate relief of pain, indicative of suboptimal therapeutic plasma concentrations. The analgesic effect of the dose achieved significance only 2 h after administration, similar to that observed for acetaminophen. In contrast, the NSAID was more rapidly acting, with the strongest pain relief being reported one hour after administration but with significant gastrointestinalsymptoms. This supports the use of 2 g (higher than needed for inflammation) curcumin for relief of pain as a potential alternative to NSAIDS [ [41](#B41-foods-06-00092)]. [42](#B42-foods-06-00092)]. 4. Metabolic Syndrome [43](#B43-foods-06-00092), [44](#B44-foods-06-00092)], suppressing [ [45](#B45-foods-06-00092)], and reducing elevated blood pressure [ [46](#B46-foods-06-00092)], inflammation [ [47](#B47-foods-06-00092)], and oxidative stress [ [48](#B48-foods-06-00092), [49](#B49-foods-06-00092)]. In addition, there is evidence that curcuminoids modulate the expression of genes and the activity of enzymes involved in lipoprotein metabolism that lead to a reduction in plasma triglycerides and cholesterol [ [50](#B50-foods-06-00092), [51](#B51-foods-06-00092), [52](#B52-foods-06-00092)] and elevate HDL-C concentrations [ [53](#B53-foods-06-00092)]. Both overweight and obesity are linked to chronic low-grade inflammation; although the exact mechanisms are not clear, it is known that pro-inflammatory cytokines are released. These cytokines are thought to be at the core of the complications associated with diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Therefore, addressing inflammation is important. In a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial with a parallel-group design, 117 subjects with MetS received either 1 g curcumin plus 10 mg piperine to increase absorption or a placebo plus 10 mg piperine for eight weeks. Within-group analysis revealed significant reductions in serum concentrations of TNF-, IL-6, transforming growth factor MCP-1) following In the placebo group, serum levels of TGF-b were decreased (p = 0.003) but those of IL-6 (p = 0.735), TNF- (p = 0.138), and MCP-1 (p = 0.832) were not. Between-group comparison suggested significantly greater reductions in serum concentrations of TNF-, IL-6, TGF-b, and MCP-1 in the curcumin versus the placebo group (p < 0.001). Apart from IL-6, changes in other parameters remained statistically significant after adjustment for potential confounders, including changes in serum lipids and glucose levels, as well as the baseline serum concentration of the cytokines. The results of this study suggest that curcumin supplementation significantly decreases serum concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines in subjects with MetS [ [11](#B11-foods-06-00092)]. In addition, the study looked at the cholesterol-lowering properties and found that curcuminoids were more effective than the placebo in reducing serum LDL-C, non-HDL-C, total cholesterol, triglycerides, and lipoprotein a (Lp(a)), in addition to elevating HDL-C concentrations. However, changes in serum LDL-C levels were found to be comparable between the study groups. The effects of curcuminoids on triglycerides, non-HDL-C, total cholesterol, and Lp(a) remained significant after adjustment for baseline values of lipids and body mass index [ [54](#B54-foods-06-00092)]. From the same study, the authors also reported markers of oxidative stress. There was a significant improvement in serum SOD activities (p < 0.001) and reduced MDA (p < 0.001) and C-reactive protein (CRP) (p < 0.001) concentrations in the group receiving the curcumin with piperine compared to the placebo group. Their secondary purpose was to perform a meta-analysis of data from all randomized controlled trials in order to estimate the effect size of curcuminoids on plasma CRP concentrations. Quantitative data synthesis revealed a significant effect of curcuminoids vs. placebo in reducing circulating CRP concentrations The authors concluded that short-term supplementation with a curcuminoid-piperine combination significantly improves oxidative and inflammatory status in patients with MetS. Curcuminoids could therefore be regarded as natural, safe, and effective CRP-lowering agents [ [55](#B55-foods-06-00092)]. [56](#B56-foods-06-00092)]. [50](#B50-foods-06-00092)]. 5. Healthy People [57](#B57-foods-06-00092), [58](#B58-foods-06-00092)]. It should be noted that this would be considered a high dose only because it is higher than what most people could obtain from consuming the spice itself [ [49](#B49-foods-06-00092)]. One study on healthy adults aged 40-60 years used an 80 mg/day dose of a lipidated form of curcumin. Subjects were given either curcumin (N = 19) or a placebo (N = 19) for four weeks. The treatment was 400 mg powder per day containing 80 mg curcumin. Blood and saliva were taken before and after the four weeks. Curcumin significantly lowered triglyceride levels but not total cholesterol, LDL, or HDL levels. There was a significant increase in nitrous oxide (NO) and in soluble intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (sICAM), a molecule linked to atherosclerosis. Inflammation-related neutrophil function increased, as measured by myeloperoxidase concentration, but c-reactive protein and ceruloplasmin did not. There was a decrease in salivary amylase activity, which can be a marker of stress, and an increase in salivary radical scavenging capacities and plasma antioxidant enzyme catalase, but not in super oxide dismutase or glutathione peroxidase. In addition, there was a decrease in beta amyloid plaque, a marker of brain aging, and in plasma alanine amino transferase activities, a marker of liver injury. This indicates that a relatively low dose of curcumin can provide health benefits for people that do not have diagnosed health conditions [ [51](#B51-foods-06-00092)]. [59](#B59-foods-06-00092)]. [60](#B60-foods-06-00092)]. This study indicates the potential for combining curcumin with other agents to achieve health benefits. [61](#B61-foods-06-00092)]. [62](#B62-foods-06-00092)]. [63](#B63-foods-06-00092)]. [64](#B64-foods-06-00092)]. 6. Side Effects [65](#B65-foods-06-00092)]. Several trials on healthy subjects have supported the safety and efficacy of curcumin. Despite this well-established safety, some negative side effects have been reported. Seven subjects receiving 500-12,000 mg in a dose response study and followed for 72 h experienced diarrhea, headache, rash, and yellow stool [ [19](#B19-foods-06-00092)]. In another study, some subjects receiving 0.45 to 3.6 g/day curcumin for one to four months reported nausea and diarrhea and an increase in serum alkaline phosphatase and lactate dehydrogenase contents [ [66](#B66-foods-06-00092)]. 7.
