During high pressure and stress, it's essential to safeguard your mental wellness.", "sitename": "Nova Scotia Organics", "date": "2022-05-12", "cleaned_text": "1. Meditate Daily I find meditation to be the best sleeping/relaxing remedy. Meditation does not mean sitting in the lotus position or doing anything special. Meditation means being \"still\" with no thoughts coming into your mind, focusing on your breathing and not thinking about anything, naturally calming your mind. If thoughts do come in when you are breathing and being still, gently push them away and try to have \"no thoughts.\" Try for 5 - 10 minutes to start and work up to half an hour. I know this sounds hard, but when you keep practicing and not allowing everyday thoughts to come into your mind, you will realize how easy and beautiful it is to have a few minutes of real peace. Don't say you can't do this. You and your body deserve this for your mental and physical wellbeing. Doing this daily, you will find that your short temper is not so short, and little things do not annoy you. The more you practice, the easier it becomes and the less stressed you are. Mediation allows your conscious mind to guide you. You can meditate with your eyes open or closed. There are no set rules. Make your own form of meditation. Listen to naturally calming music when you meditate. Some good sites include Calm and Insight Timer. Also, Dr. Joe Dispenza has some wonderful meditations online. 2. Breathe When you are pent up with stress, stop what you are doing and breathe slowly for a few minutes. This is a form of natural calming. An excellent app to help with this is Breathe2Relax. It will provide you with the technique to follow. 3. If Possible, Be in Nature If you are in a city, go to a park and sit by a tree. Or, get a plant for your apartment or office. All plants are alive and give off positive helping energy. Enjoy the positive vibes! 4. Herbal Teas Drink natural calming herbal teas, such as chamomile and lavender, instead of coffee. Caffeine can put you on edge after one cup. There are also herbal coffee substitutes such as burdock, dandelion and chicory root, which are roasted and brewed the same as coffee. 5. Eat a Nutritious and Balanced Diet Eat regularly, and don't let your blood sugar drop. Eat more vegetables and anti-inflammatory whole foods. 6. Live in the Present The more you dwell in the past or future, the more anxious you become. The past is past. Leave it behind. This does not mean you don't plan for the future. You have to have a plan to put into effect, but don't dwell on it. Move forward with your plan easily with no anxiety because it does not matter what happens. What you do with what happens is what makes the difference. The moment you start to feel stress is when things start to go off the rails. Stop and reevaluate the situation. Slow down and watch the vibrations. You will know if you are going in the right direction. 7. Get Rid of Fear and Guilt You are the master of your thoughts, so you can help manage the anxiety you are feeling. If you are fearful/anxious, take time to reflect on the reasons why you are experiencing this. Everyone else is busy going about their lives, and they may have no idea that you are experiencing the emotion of fear. The same is true for guilt. Your personal feelings of guilt can cause anxiety. Try to discover the cause/source of your guilt. Look into yourself. You will be amazed at what you discover about yourself and how beautiful you really are! 8. Chill Out! If you feel anxious, fill a sink or bowl of cold water and put your face in it for 5 seconds and repeat several times. This will help calm you naturally. 9. Center Yourself Another interesting method to naturally calm yourself in a stressful situation is to put your finger in the center of your forehead, close your eyes and start drawing a figure 8 on your forehead, but visualize your finger as a light. Start going up to the right, down and around completing the figure, back to center following the light. Then reverse and go down to the left, up and around, completing the figure back to the center. It is amazing how this works. It is very good to help naturally calm children. 10. Limit Alcohol Many people have a drink in the evening to \"calm their nerves.\" However, alcohol disturbs the sleep pattern, sometimes causing you to wake up at around 3 am, and you can't get back to sleep. Try not drinking for two weeks during the week and see the difference. You will find you have a very peaceful and long sleep. 11. Finally Sleep! If you find you can't sleep, try taking a hot shower and then turn the cold water on at the end. It will relax you and help you go to sleep calmly. In addition, natural herbs can help promote relaxation and a restful sleep. - Valerian - is traditionally used for mild anxiety, depression, stress and insomnia. - Ashwagandha - is an ancient medicinal herb best known for its ability to reduce stress. - Lemon Balm - used for its sedative and calming effect. - Chamomile - aids in helping with healthy sleep. Add all these herbs together, and we believe our Finally Sleep! formula is just what the herbalist ordered as an antidote to mild sleep problems, and it's non-habit forming... and like everything offered by Nova Scotia Organics, Finally Sleep! is USDA Certified Organic.
