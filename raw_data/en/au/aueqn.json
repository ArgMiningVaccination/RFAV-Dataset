Miso is full of probiotics as it's made of fermented soy, so it fortifies the immune system, which starts in the gut. I tend to add ginger and garlic for added anti-viral benefits. Ginger is great for nausea and aiding digestion. Shiitake mushrooms are vitamin and mineral rich immune boosters. The kombu and wakame are sea vegetables that add minerals the body needs to be healthy and strong. This soup is light, easy to digest, and has a savory, umami flavor. Moreover, it's super easy to make. It doesn't take more than 20 minutes to chop, cook and serve. Ingredients 4 c mushroom broth (or 4 cups water with Kombu soaked in it for 30 min which is my preferred way- discard kombu after soak or cook and eat it) 4 tbsp organic white miso paste \u00bd c chopped greens (I use what I have on hand - spinach, kale, collard, broccoli, or chard are all great options.) \u00bd c sliced Shiitake mushrooms \u00bc c chopped green onion \u00bd c firm organic tofu \u00bd c dried wakame seaweed *Jordan household variations: 1 tsp Garlic Powder or chopped garlic \u00bd tsp Ginger Powder or chopped ginger Dash of cayenne pepper for kick 1 tsp Sesame Oil to drizzle when served Cooked rice noodles or bean thread noodles added at end. This makes it the Jordan's \"Miso Noodle Soup\" Instructions Place broth in a medium saucepan and bring to a low simmer. Add the following to the broth: greens of choice, green onion, shiitake, and tofu and cook for 5 minutes. You can add garlic, ginger or cayenne here if that suits you. Add wakame and stir. Remove from heat. Put miso into a handled strainer, dip the strainer into the hot broth and use spoon to work miso through the strainer to remove clumps. It's important to not boil miso to keep the active and live probiotics intact. Taste and add more miso or Himalayan salt if more saltiness is desired. Drizzle sesame oil if you desire. Add cooked noodles if you desire. Serve immediately. ch ho "}
