The body doesn't make omega-3s, so we must get these essential nutrients through food and/or supplementation. Scientists still don't know the exact mechanism that makes omega-3s and other essential fatty acids improve brain functions. However, omega-3s are concentrated in the brain and essential for overall brain function, especially memory and cognition.

Avoid omega-3 supplements if you are allergic or sensitive to fish or products containing fish. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has deemed omega-3 fatty acids safe up to 3 grams a day. Doses over 3 grams have been known to keep the blood from clotting and to increase bleeding. High doses may also negatively impact immunity and make a patient more susceptible to infections.
