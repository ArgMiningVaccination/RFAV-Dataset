The following article by Kai-ping Wang, MD , specifically delves into the use of screening and symptom instruments. It gives detailed back - ground on specific codes, including when they should be used and the associated reimbursements. It is a helpful overview that serves as a practical breakdown of a nuanced topic. I would love to hear any feedback you have on depression and depres - sion screening, my initiative, or other ideas you think can help move our efforts forward. m Karen Dineen Wagner, MD, PhD President, AACAP Karen Dineen Wagner, MD, PhD continued on page 122CPT Screening Codes Do you use screening or symptom instruments? Chances are good that you're leaving money on the table. The passage of required mental health coverage under the Affordable Care Act led to introducing the brief emo - tional/behavioral assessment (96127) in January 2015. This code reimburses for each standardized screening scored and documented in the patient's medical record. Typically, the service is billed at a patient visit. While 96127 closely par - allels developmental screening (96110), they are completely different services. In 2017, Administration and Interpretation of Health Risk Assessment Instrument (99420) was replaced by Administration of Patient-Focused Health Risk Assessment Instrument (96160) and Administration of Caregiver-Focused Health Risk Assessment Instrument (96161). All four codes\u201496110, 96127, 96160, and 96161\u2014are largely practice expense without any physician work value. This reflects instrument scoring being typically done by administrative staff and does not require a physician or otherwise qualified healthcare profes - sional. Interpretation and diagnosis is separately accounted by another code\u2014 usually an evaluation/management code. The currently published relative value units (RVUs) for the codes being RVUs differ because these codes were reviewed during different years. Using the 2018 Medicare Physician Fee Schedule conversion factor of $35.99, reimbursements would may limit the number of instances reimbursed per patient visit and/or per day, per Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) rules you may bill for each use of each standardized instrument properly interpreted and documented in the medical record. For example, scoring two ADHD assess - ments and a SCARED would allow you to bill 96127 three times in addition to the applicable service code. Now let's get a little more confused. (Skip this paragraph if you're wise!) In the American Medical Association's CPT Manual, 96110 and are sectioned under \"Central System Assessments/Tests (e.g., Neuro- Cognitive, Mental Status, Speech Testing).\" The codes 96160 and 96161 are part of \"Health and Behavior Assessment/Intervention\" which include \". . . psychological, behavioral, emo - tional, cognitive, and social factors important to the prevention, treatment, or management of physical health prob - lems.\" For this second group of codes, the CPT manual makes an odd distinc - tion: \"the focus. . . is not on mental health but on the biopsychosocial factors important to physical health problems and treatments.\" Many potential instru - ments theoretically fit MD COLUMNS122 AACAP NEWSExamples (not comprehensive) 961101961272961603961614 Acute Concussion Evaluation (ACE) x Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ) x Ages and Stages Questionnaire: Social Emotional (ASQ:SE) x Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) x Beck Youth Inventory - Second Edition (BYI-II) x Behavior Assessment Scale for Children - 2nd Ed.

The term was first devel - oped in the fields of geriatric medicine and end-of-life care, before broadening the scope to primary care and, more recently, psychiatry. It is not synonymous with medication cessation; rather, the goal of deprescribing is \"parsimonious use,\" 1 or use that is sparing or restrained. The deprescribing process is the system - atic approach to identifying and discon - tinuing drugs when existing or potential harms outweigh existing or potential benefits. This is accomplished with consideration of an individual's goals, functioning, values, and preferences. 2 Deprescribing is especially relevant in child and adolescent psychiatry. Normal development can lead to changing formulations and the need to reassess treatment plans over time. Biological aspects of disorders may change with neurodevelopment and youths' grow - ing ability to use cognitive resources to manage their symptoms. Environmental factors are particularly dynamic and important to consider given that youth interact daily with multiple social sys - tems including peers, family, and school. Additionally, there is consistent evidence that children and adolescents are par - ticularly sensitive to certain medication side effects. 3 Minimal data are available pertaining to the safety of long-term use of medications in youth. This is particularly concerning for medications such as atypical antipsychotics that are known to be associated with weight gain, development of diabetes, and metabolic syndrome.In psychiatry, there are particular chal - lenges to deprescribing including a lack of diagnostic and therapeutic precision, focus on symptomatic rather than func - tional outcomes, reliance on individuals' subjective experience of symptoms, and discontinuity in treatment relationships and systems of care. 1 This is further com - pounded by the relative lack of clinical evidence for medication discontinuation and limited incentives for pharma - ceutical companies to dedicate funds for research. I was introduced to the concept of deprescribing within my first few months as a child psychiatrist. The first outpa - tient case I was assigned as a CAP fellow was Michael, a lively 10-year-old boy, who was the middle of three children in a nuclear family with two working parents. He had a history of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and oppositional behavior at home and had been previously diagnosed with an unspecified depressive disorder. In the space below, I outline the application of deprescribing to his care and iden - tify important principles I learned for approaching deprescribing in child and adolescent psychiatry. When we started treatment, Michael was prescribed lisdexamfetamine, low-dose risperidone, and fluoxetine. The his - tory provided by the parents was that when Michael was eight years old, he started lisdexamfetamine for his ADHD (after two brief stimulant trials that were not tolerated due to sleep disturbance). Subsequently, he developed affective lability and irritability for which the psy - chiatrist started fluoxetine. This quickly progressed to self-harm behavior (slam - ming his fingers in a drawer) for which he was then prescribed risperidone. This regimen was continued by at least three different child psychiatrists with only minor dose adjustments for almost two years. This was particularly striking as he had not apparently done well with respect to home or school functioning during this time.Though my assigned role was to provide individual therapy, I quickly gathered that this modality alone would have a low yield for addressing the current issues with Michael's functioning. I dis - cussed with his parents doing combined therapy and medication management, and outlined my concerns about the risks of long-term use of an atypical antipsychotic without clear benefit or indication. I used a standardized rating scale which validated the youth had mild-to-moderate depressive symptoms. I maintained on the differential that this was potentially a side effect from his medication, presumably lisdexamfet - amine, which in one placebo-controlled trial in 278 children caused irritability in 10% and affective lability in 3%. Working in collaboration with the family, we began the process of deprescribing. During this time, I met with the family every one-to-two weeks for individual therapy and to provide evaluation of, and support for, medication changes. We transitioned lisdexamfetamine to a combination of long-acting and immedi - ate release methylphenidate, with an improvement in irritability and depres - sive symptoms. This was followed by continued on page 124Deprescribing is especially relevant in child and adolescent psychiatry.

Biological aspects of disorders may change with neurodevelopment and youths' growing ability to use cognitive resources to manage their symptoms.COLUMNS 124 AACAP NEWSa slow taper of risperidone and then fl uoxetine, with no worsening of mood or impulsive behavior. This coincided with the parents participating in a behavior management group, which signifi cantly helped with managing oppositional behavior in the home. Within six months, Michael's mood, irri- tability, and oppositional behavior were stable on a regimen consisting of only methylphenidate. His ADHD symptoms, including inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity, persisted at home and school, though were not worse than while on his previous regimen. We continued titrating methylphenidate and started clonidine ER to address ongoing ADHD symptoms. As Michael started sixth grade about one year into our treatment, his ADHD symptoms were better controlled than ever before, on a regimen of methylphenidate, clonidine, and melatonin. While he was still tak-ing multiple medications, this regimen posed fewer serious potential risks than his previous combination. Additionally, there is evidence for both effi cacy and tolerability for this combination in the management of his primary diagnosis of ADHD. 4 The process of deprescribing includes a review of all medications, identifi cation of medications that could be ceased or reduced, collaborative planning of the deprescribing regimen, and providing guidance and support to the patient and caregivers. 1 This case illustrates several important considerations for deprescrib-ing in child psychiatry: Providing a comprehensive psychiat-ric assessment, especially when care is being transitioned from another provider or if the child is already on psychotropic medication Evaluating effectiveness of medica-tions for the original target symptoms or indication Reviewing the evidence-base, particularly when considering medi-cation combinations, which in many instances have limited empirical support Evaluating potential contribution of adverse medication effects as opposed to a co-morbid disorder, such as mood symptoms in the above case resulting from a medica-tion side effect Using evidence-based psychosocial intervention, for example parent management training for ADHD and oppositional defi ant disorder Child and adolescent psychiatrists make decisions about the use of medications, at times without diagnostic clarity and with insuffi cient information about risks and benefi ts of different treatment options. When providing clinical care, appropriate prescribing should include consideration of deprescribing. The con- cept of deprescribing should be taught formally in psychiatry training programs. Further research is needed to better characterize when and how deprescrib- ing can be most effectively applied. Identifying information regarding this patient has been changed or omitted.

The goal of the survey was to help gain an understanding of the practice patterns and insurance network participation of child and adolescent psychiatrists. The 900 members who responded represent nearly 10% of AACAP's then 9,200 members. The HCAE would like to thank the members who took the time to respond. Member respondents closely represented the demographics of the membership as a whole, lending additional validity to the results. We would like to share the results of the survey with the member - ship of AACAP, as we were able to glean some interesting and useful data from the results. The first question of the survey was meant to follow up on a previous survey effort from the HCAE Committee to assess adoption rates of electronic health records (EHRs) into child and adoles - cent psychiatry practices. As of 2017, 73% of AACAP members are using an EHR in their practice setting. Member respondents reported that nearly all of their EHRs have electronic prescrib - ing capabilities, with 40% of AACAP members reporting that they prescribe electronically for both controlled and non-controlled prescriptions. These are very promising results, as they are in line with the adoption rate among all physi - cians nationwide. 1 Based on the responses, about 64% of child and adolescent psychiatrists partici - pate in at least one insurance network. The two biggest revenue sources are private insurance plans (about 58% of respondents) and Medicaid (about 48% of respondents). However, compared to other physicians, our participation rates are still low overall. In 2013, 85% of physicians accepted private insurance and 69% accepted Medicaid. 2 Overall, finding ways to increase insurance plan participation among members is one of the long-term goals of the HCAE. We feel the key to increasing participation is two-fold: educating AACAP members so they feel more confident negotiating with insurance plans, as well as working more closely with the plans themselves to help them understand the unique challenges of child and adolescent psychiatry prac - tice. The survey results supported taking this approach as well. The most common challenges that AACAP members run into when participating with insurance networks included excessive requirements for prior authorizations, limited reimbursement, and having to spend too much time on insurance-related tasks in general. Jason Chang, MD, Barry Sarvet, MD, and Karen Ferguson These are all real-world, day-to-day hurdles that add to physician strain and burnout and demonstrate the reasons child and adolescent psychiatrists decide to opt-out of participation with insurance networks. When asked to choose up to three complications arising with insurance networks, the major - ity of survey respondents reported that difficulties with prior authorizations, issues related to reimbursement, and other insurance-related burdens are common, everyday issues. Only 6% of respondents responded that they had no complications at all in their interac - tions with insurance plans. Bridging that gap remains a top priority for the HCAE Committee. Our goal is to identify and create resources that will assist AACAP members with these challenges. For members who do not participate with insurance networks, the most common reasons for opting out include limited reimbursement and struggles with claim and Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code submissions. Members are seeking guidance on how to optimize CPT code usage and how to handle excessive requirements from insurance companies. CPT coding is another area that AACAP is involved in, via its Coding and Reimbursement Committee. AACAP has member advi - sors on both the CPT Editorial Board and the RVS Update Committee (RUC), in addition to a dedicated staff member. One of our primary objectives is to pro - vide educational materials to members on AACAP's website, and many coding resources are readily available in the Member Resources section, under CPT and Reimbursement. 3 We also hold sev - eral educational sessions on CPT coding at the Annual Meeting each year. The HCAE Committee appreciated the opportunity to gain insight into the concerns of AACAP members, which will help guide our work. Once again, we would like to thank everyone who completed the survey, and we hope that you find the results interesting and continued on page 132\"The most common challenges that AACAP members run into when participating with insurance networks included excessive requirements for prior authorizations, limited reimbursement, and having to spend too much time on insurance-related tasks in general.\" MAY/JUNE 2018 127COMMITTEES/ASSEMBLY TELEPSYCHIATRY COMMITTEE Lights, Camera, Action: Technical Telepsychiatry Skills This is the second article in our series on how to conduct telepsy-chiatry well. In the fi rst install- ment, we discussed strategies that foster good patient engagement and a strong therapeutic relationship. In this install-ment, we discuss some technical aspects related to staging and lighting that you need to master to do telepsychiatry well. Patient arrangement can make or break a session. Telepsychiatrists commonly struggle with managing young children at the origination (patient) site. Often a young child is being treated for condi-tions that further impair his or her ability to sit still and remain in the frame! Keeping a child with ADHD or autism in the camera frame can be a challenge, but there are simple strategies you can use (keep in mind super glue and velcro are not AACAP-approved options). A good telepsychiatrist asserts control over the session from the very beginning and spends a few moments at the initia- tion of the session directing the family arrangement, the camera, and the light-ing of the origination site. Keep in mind, you probably gave signifi cant consider- ation to how you arranged your regular offi ce to facilitate treatment sessions. You chose the furniture, the furniture arrange-ment, lighting, and decor to create a professional atmosphere conducive to your work. However, in telepsychiatry you have to work with each family to properly set up the room they have chosen to use. In the beginning of the session, help the participants adjust their seating and camera position to ensure everyone feels comfortable and remains visible within the camera frame. Make sure they are close enough to the camera to be seen and heard, but far enough away that they don't move out of the camera frame with occasional move- ment. It feels very intrusive when you prompt them to readjust the camera or reposition themselves during the session. You want to zoom in for a \"headshot\" for a single adolescent or young adult who can stay still. You want to widen the frame if you have two or more people in the session. You may want to zoom all the way out if you have a toddler or autistic youth moving around the exam room or between different parent laps. Forcing the fi dgeting youth to remain on a parent's lap for the whole ses- sion can be diffi cult for the family and becomes a disincentive for continuing with telepsychiatry. When framing a telepsychiatry session, your two competing priorities are to keep everyone in the frame, and to make their image fi ll the frame as much as possible. Larger and closer participant images feel more realistic and intimate, but they can easily drift (or wander) out of the frame. Having participants positioned far away from the camera allows for more mobil- ity, but a solitary subject seems small, distant, and removed from the interac-tion. When the patient is at a medical clinic using more sophisticated tele- medicine equipment that has a pan/tilt remote-controlled camera at the patient site, you have to adjust it at the begin-ning of the session. Ideally, you will follow the one-third rule used by television camera operators when positioning yourself and others in the camera frame. Position yourself and/or adjust the camera so your eyes appear to be about one third down from the top of the screen. This will create the natural framing you see when watching television newscasters. Next you want to create what we call \"relative eye contact.\" You want to arrange the participant's picture on your screen so that it sits close to your David Roth, MD, and Ujjwal Ramtekkar, MD continued on page 128 128 AACAP NEWSCOMMITTEES/ASSEMBLY camera. This ensures that you appear to be looking at the person when you look at their image on your screen. If your camera is even a few inches away from the patient's image, you appear to be looking away from them or distracted when you are speaking at their image on your screen. If you have a traditional system like a Polycom with a monitor and separate camera, place the camera close to the monitor. If you are mounting the camera on the wall, place it below the monitor, close to your eye level. Most people don't give these framing concerns enough consideration\u2014 and it has consequences! We have both repeatedly observed in distance education classes and administrative meetings that many of the participants seem unaware of the camera position. Subsequently, they sit in profi le, at a dis- tance, in the shadows, in front of a bright backlight, or surrounded by distracting and/or moving objects. They may have fully intended to participate in the video- conference, but their lack of eye contact, poor visibility, and the appearance of distance send a clearly different message to the rest of the participants. How you appear on camera communicates a lot of nonverbal information about you, your professionalism, and your intentions to the other participants. Ignore this at your own peril! Similarly, the camera has to remain steady at both sites. Most expensive telemedicine equipment is mounted to a wall or cart, but increasingly people videoconference with a desktop, laptop, or handheld device. Coach your partici- pants to prop their handheld devices up at eye level using something stable such as pillows, books, and picture frames. No one can hold the phone or tablet still for more than a few minutes, especially if two or more people are in the frame. When unstable devices move even a few millimeters, the image you are viewing moves in a distracting and sometimes nauseating way. This distracts the pro-vider and detracts from the experience you can provide your patient.Properly lighting a videoconference room is also very important. It ensures the experience feels authentic to all of the participants. When done well, the room lighting isn't noticed. When done poorly, it creates many distractions that take away from the session. Fortunately, once the room is properly lit, the lights just have to be turned on! The principle goal of good lighting is for everyone to be seen clearly. This means eliminating shadows, glare, overexpo- sure, and abnormal colorations. This is accomplished by thoughtfully controlling the light coming from windows, lamps, overhead lights, and computer screens. Lights, Camera, Action continued from page 127 MAY/JUNE 2018 129COMMITTEES/ASSEMBLY The most common problem is insuf- fi cient lighting. Cameras need more light than the human eye to construct a detailed image. As a general rule, you need at least one more light source than you would use when patients are sitting in the same room. The following sequence of pictures demonstrates how much light it takes to be seen clearly by another participant. The second most common lighting prob- lem is when too much light is originating from behind or beside a participant. This creates shadows, uneven exposure, or backlighting. Control the light from a window with blackout curtains, espe- cially if the light will change during your clinic hours (e.g. sunset). Balance the lighting by positioning an additional light in front of you that points towards you or bounces the additional light off the ceiling in front of you to fi ll in the shad-ows and give your face suffi cient detail. Often standing halogen torchiere lamps work well for this purpose because you can adjust the amount of light and turn them off during face-to-face sessions in your offi ce.A common cause of abnormal coloration is the computer monitor. You can bal-ance the colors being cast on your face by adjusting the colors on your screen. For example, if your EMR software is predominantly blue and white, fi ll the remaining space with a background pic- ture dominated by earth tones. Another common cause of color problems is caused by light bouncing off your walls or bleeding through window treatments. Color choice is more than decorative when decorating a videoconferencing suite. We suggest using light/neutral color for the walls and avoiding white or dark background walls. Glossy paint can create glare, so when possible, use a fl at or matte paint. Paying attention to these technical aspects will enhance the quality and feel of your telepsychiatry sessions. By investing some time and attention on these issues, your telepsychiatry sessions will feel as authentic, comfortable, and engaging as your traditional face-to-face sessions. Sharpening your telepsychiatry skills with practice and attention to these principles helps you feel more confi dent that you are taking full advantage of this exciting new venue for delivering psychi- atric care. m Dr. Roth maintains a private practice in Honolulu, Hawaii, and has been practicing telepsychiatry with patients across the state, California, and Illinois since 2009.

CARICOM people are of diverse ethnic origins (Indigenous Peoples, Africans, Indians, Europeans, Chinese, and Portuguese) and sixty percent of the population is below the age of 30. The leaders of CARICOM became acutely aware of the impact of internet access to development, trade, and prosperity of the region in the early twenty-first century. The internet was seen as a vital tool to evening the odds for small island developing states in the global trade market. Additionally, the benefits of internet access for youth had been examined extensively with studies demonstrating its positive role in academic progress, independence, and computer literacy. The awareness led to the decision to level the playing field through a strategy to bridge the digi - tal divide. 1 The strategy has translated into a rapid increase in access to the internet and digital technologies across the region. The 2015 United Nations International Telecommunications Union (UNITU) data for the region is a testimony to the success of the strat - egy with internet access rates as high as 78% nationally 2 and cellular phone penetrance of 100% in a number of the countries of the Caribbean.Regional Evidence of Increased Connectivity of Youth The commitment to increase internet access also includes strategic incorpo - ration of technology into schools and homes. Concrete evidence of escalating regional rates of youth connectivity is borne out in the Caribbean Broadband and Database ICT datasheet for Jamaica 3 conducted by the University of the West Indies and partners. The UWI survey found that the majority of internet users were between the ages of 15 and 34, with over 36% accessing the internet from their place of education. The major uses of the internet were for sending and receiving emails (76.9%), followed by social media (71.7%). Bullying and Caribbean Children As has occurred throughout the world, misuse of the internet has become a challenge for school systems in the Caribbean. Clinically we have witnessed the adverse mental health impact of flaming, denigration, outing, imperson - ation, and social exclusion in children as young as age nine. In small communities, cyberbullying often sets the stage for physical bullying, and there is a seamless interchange between these modalities of cruelty. For many of the islands, the population is less than 200,000 persons, with land mass less than 300 square miles, and there exists a culture of strong interpersonal connection. It, therefore, becomes impossible for children and adolescents to escape public scrutiny, and at times ridicule, after incidents of cyber-outing. In his study of Latin America and the Caribbean, McClanahan 4 found that girls reported appearance-based bullying while boys reported physical bullying. Bullying was noted to be a risk factor for suicidal ideations in Jamaican youths. 5 The Abdirahman6 review of the Global School-Based Health Report of five Caribbean countries noted that bullied students were much more likely than non-bullied students to report mental health issues and that bullying was related to sadness, anxiety, hopelessness, and suicidal thoughts. UNITI Caribbean Anti-Cyberbullying Policy Template In recognition of the health burden of cyberbullying on the child and adoles - cent population as well as the need for public sensitization and development of prevention protocols, the Rotary Club of Barbados launched an anti-cyberbul - lying campaign in 2016. As part of the process, school guidance counsellors identified lack of school policies as a major barrier to proactively targeting the root causes of cyberbullying and addressing incidents as they arose. Subsequently, the UNITU commissioned the development of an anti-cyberbul - lying policy development guide. We developed this guide with the vision of it becoming individualized to reflect each country's context. As a child and adolescent psychiatrist, it was important that the guide be based on the 'posi - tive school culture' and 'whole school' concepts. The ultimate goals were for students, staff (teaching and nonteach - ing), parents, and the wider school community to understand, embrace, and demonstrate the principles of tolerance and acceptance of differences. These principles would be woven seamlessly MAY/JUNE 2018 131COMMITTEES/ASSEMBLY throughout the curriculum, providing ample opportunity for reinforcement. Additionally, in recognition of the victim to perpetrator pathway in bullying and the fact that students are often simul-taneously victims and perpetrators of cyberbullying, there was a heavy focus on mental health intervention for all students involved. The area of conse-quences for perpetrators was left open for individualization based on the laws and the pre-existing school policies of each country. The policy development process was inclusive of the following steps: the establishment of a policy develop- ment team of key stakeholders from education and related sectors; a review of the education act for the country, paying particular attention to the limits of authority of the school to address behaviors that occur outside the school domain; a review of national legislation pertaining to cybersecurity; a review of published school cyberbullying policies (local, regional, and international) and effective interventions; the utilization of the template provided in the guide or other suitable templates to develop a draft policy document with wide circulation of the draft policy document to key stakeholders for commentary and consensus building.School Anti-Cyberbullying Policy Development in Action Three countries have embarked on the process of developing their school anti-cyberbullying policy, and as the developer of the policy guide, it has been interesting to observe how culture has shaped the varying concerns of key stakeholders. The main areas where these differences have been exemplifi ed are around confi dential reporting within schools and penalties for perpetrators. Confi dential reporting and the need to minimize the number of persons in the reporting chain has been a uniform concern and most likely is a refl ection of the high level of interpersonal connec-tivity of the societies. Recommendations for penalties for perpetrators has ranged from minimal to more severe. In the case where recommended penalties are minimal, deference was given to the increased impulsivity associated with the developing brain of the child and the need to allow the offending student a second chance by providing psycho-therapy and changing schools without a refl ection of the incident on their academic record. Simultaneously, others have been more austere, recommending the applications of penalties commen-surate with the country's laws for the identifi ed cybercrime. mReferences 1.

Systems of Care and Child Psychiatry: A Call for Advocacy Lisa Durette, MD Systems of care (SOC) - the very topic often evokes eye rolls and sarcasm. Home-based, family- focused... where in the core principles of SOC is the child psychiatrist? How is it fathomable that a children's mental health system can exist without a child psychiatrist? Where in our training are we taught how to navigate the murky political waters entangled with commu - nity SOC? Yet the role of the child psy - chiatrist as advocate for our profession and the youth we serve can significantly impact the community's mental health system. Advocacy can take on many forms. Through the course of my own experi - ences, I have become a committee chair and have been able to advocate for the importance of having a child psychiatrist included in all SOC and local children's mental health committees. To be fair, SOC is a community-based model which has the flexibility to address the miss - ing elements of our traditional system: childcare, transportation, wraparound care. SOC's positive attributes come from their family-driven and youth- guided philosophy. It is a strengths-based community model emphasizing interdisciplinary coordination. AACAP provides many SOC resources on their website. Many states have adopted a SOC model within their jurisdiction. A child psychiatrist was not included amongst the SOC committee makeup in any of the states I researched. However, administrators, including those from juvenile justice, school, and state mental health systems, as well as prescribers were. How is it that we have allowed state and federally-funded care systems for the youth we serve to exclude the child psychiatrist? Your local SOC committee is an ideal environment in which to practice advo - cacy. Search your state's children's mental health SOC committee makeup online. You will likely find that information within your state's department of mental health and/or health and human services website. Is there a child psychiatrist included amongst the members? If yes, reach out and understand their role as well as ways in which you can support your commu - nity's work. If no, your next step may be to find the next meeting. In accordance with public meeting laws, meeting agendas are posted in advance of the meetings. Review the agendas - you will likely find items that pertain to your clinical expertise. Finally, GET INVOLVED! You can typically either call in to the meeting or attend in person. Listen during the first few meetings to iden - tify the players, their roles, and the overall tone and direction of the group. Once you identify a place of entry, begin to partici - pate. Your community's SOC is funded by YOU as a taxpayer. You have a place at the table. Offer to educate in a supportive fashion. Share AACAP resources, perhaps starting with the Facts for Families. Over the course of time, you can make a signifi - cant difference for the youth we serve by including yourself within the committees that determine the funding and provision of children's mental health within your community. m Dr. Durette is the founder and program director of the UNLV Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Fellowship in Las Vegas.

Mao, MD Over 25 years ago, my training direc - tor asked me what I wanted to do after graduation. I answered hesitantly, \"I want to have a private practice, and I like teaching medical students and resi - dents, so the perfect job would allow me to do both.\" At the time, it seemed that the only way to have an academic career was to take a full-time academic posi - tion. After graduation, I accepted a job in community psychiatry that allowed me to continue teaching and start build - ing a small private practice with my husband. My original plan was to stay in the community psychiatry academic position until my practice had grown and I could be \"independent.\" However, as my career evolved, I real - ized that I could not leave academic psychiatry. The opportunity to teach and to learn from bright and curious medical students and residents and the intellec - tual stimulation from collaboration with colleagues was too appealing. I feared being isolated in my small outpatient practice. However, I recognized that private practice had many advantages including the freedom to set your own schedule and choose patient population. In contrast to my academic jobs, which focused on special populations in child and adolescent psychiatry, my private practice allowed me to see patients from the ages of three to 80 with a broad range of diagnoses. Time has passed far too quickly and to my surprise 25 years later, I continue to balance my academic career while maintaining a private practice. My proudest accomplishments are seeing the flourishing of my patients despite mental health challenges and the gen - erations of students and residents who I have trained become successful in their careers. Although I wouldn't change my career path, it was not the easiest when jug - gling parenting responsibilities and family obligations. Since I mentor many residents, I have wondered if there was another way that one could have a private practice but still maintain aca - demic affiliation. I have been intrigued and inspired by some of the outstand - ing early career psychiatrists that I have worked with on AACAP's Consumer Issues Committee. Many of them had transitioned from Academic Psychiatry to private practice but were still very actively engaged in academic presenta - tions, publishing papers, and involved in national and international committees. I have asked them to share the factors that have influenced their career choices and provide tips on how to stay academi - cally involved while in private practice. My hope is that their stories will help to inspire those that are graduating and wanting to start private practice or con - sidering leaving academic psychiatry and entering private practice. Neither career path is exclusive of the other for these three dynamic women! Stephanie Hartselle, MD As I put in notice to my academic job, I was warned by my supervisors that \"no one can make it in private practice these days.\" Their words echoed my own concerns that I was stepping into an abyss that occurred in my state for reasons beyond insurance stipulations that man - dated an outpatient provider accepting certain carriers in any setting and my mentors having avoided that outpatient world for many years. Still, I started small and began building a practice that to my surprise, became more than the expected prescribing psychiatry mill and utilized the training I'd obtained in multimodal therapy. Patients were thrilled to see one doctor who could provide insight on how their circumstances, biological genet - ics, coping skills, and psychodynamic interactions might be contributing to what most pained them. I was thrilled to watch my panel of patients improve and actu - ally be able to move on. I held on to my moonlighting jobs at the prison and the veteran's hospital to keep my academic affiliation but learned quickly that becom - ing a volunteer in the academic system at Brown was just one of the ways to continue my passion for teaching those coming up in training. As a member of committees and someone involved with legislation at AACAP, I have been able to work on various projects, make numerous academic connections and maintain affiliations with work I wouldn't have previously considered if I had self-siloed into a small private practice. I spoke with our training director of the Child Psychiatry Residency and ensured that I could continue in a role that met the yearly requirements of teaching that kept my title as Assistant Clinical Professor. Within the Consumer Issues Committee and in working with those in emergency psychiatry, my writing CONSUMER ISSUES COMMITTEE Career Paths in Child and Adolescent Psychiatry: Bridging Private Practice and Academic Psychiatry Alice R. Mao, MD, Stephanie Hartselle, MD, Carlene MacMillan, MD, and Julie Chilton, MD MAY/JUNE 2018 135 FEATURESand contributions continue to steadily add to the volume of work critical to the forward movement of our work as child psychiatrists. As my CV grows and with the mentorship of full professors with whom I've had the privilege of working across the country because of AACAP, I document each contribution in the hope that I will continue to be an academic, straddling both private practice and the educational worlds. It has not been easy as a working mother, a business owner, private practice psychiatrist, and someone com - mitted to keeping her academic title, but it is something that can be accom - plished. Having mentors and guidance in this is critical, and for that, I can thank the community within AACAP and my committee colleagues. If you have the desire to be your own boss, to create your own patient panel, and to give back to the community on a clinical and academic level, private practice and academic affiliation is achievable. Carlene MacMillan, MD In response to the question I get asked frequently, \"What academic institu - tion are you affiliated with?\" I initially would reply sheepishly that I was not affiliated with any. My perspective has shifted as colleagues seemed intrigued by my small rebellion. While it makes a lot of sense that psychiatrists wanting to work in inpatient or emergency settings would need the infrastructure that a large academic institution can provide, it is a misconception that an academic affiliation is necessary to have a signifi - cant academic career. In contrast, I had experienced that the clinical and admin - istrative demands placed on a junior faculty person can detract from pursuing academic passions and so looked for alternatives. After having twins, timing felt right to test the theory that I could be more academic on my own. Rather than return to my academic post, I decided to form a multidisciplinary group private practice near our home with my psy - chiatrist husband, Owen Muir, MD . We actively collaborate with colleagues in the United States and London, including at places such as Menninger, McLean, and Anna Freud National Centre for Children in an effort to expand under - standing and treatment options for young people with personality disorders. We train and supervise other clinicians, teachers, and other professionals on Mentalization-Based Treatment. It sure feels \"academic\" to do so. We now have two deep TMS machines and 12 employees, including a post-doc clinical psychologist. In the summer, we host interns from Amherst College. In addi - tion, I am a proud Consumer Issues Committee member, lecture at several medical schools, present at grand rounds and national conferences and am on the advisory board of a non-profit for borderline personality awareness called Emotions Matter. I also take Tuesday mornings off to take my toddlers to swim class, free from any worries about RVUs, publishing or perishing, or jumping through bureaucratic hoops to get a proj - ect off the ground. I have not ruled out the possibility of re-affiliating someday if the right oppor - tunity presented itself but feel confident it is not the only path to making signifi - cant contributions to our field. Julie Chilton, MD The older I get the more I realize how important it is to be true to yourself. When explaining my decision to turn down a prestigious academic job after fel - lowship, I was told by one of my dearest mentors that he had never chosen a job based on vacation or salary. On paper it sounds superficial for these to be priori - ties for me, but knowing what I need to be happy, and thus a good psychiatrist, made them critical. A certain income allows me to protect my free time and do what I really care about when I'm not at work, rather than doing what might other - wise supplement my income. Vacation gives me balance and sanity, and time to deepen the quality relationships that allow me to keep good boundaries with patients. But it's really all about the autonomy. That's where it's at. You can make the life you want to live. It may sound scary, and as unfortunate as it is for our patients, there's enough of a need for us as child psychiatrists that it's safe for you to follow your dreams. I balance having a small fee for service practice in the mountains of North Carolina with gratis \"academic\" proj - ects I take on in my roles with AACAP, IACAPAP, APA, and the Yale Child Study Center. While my heart belongs to Yale, and I'd do just about anything to please the fellowship training directors that shaped me there, my role as Assistant Clinical Professor gives me a lot of ben - efits (including street cred in Asheville) and the opportunity to teach fellows via satellite and chair their alumni group. What it doesn't do is strap me down in any way. I am free, and I am connected. I'm free to pursue the projects I care about most. Creating resources for teaching child psychiatry in low and middle income countries where there are few to no child psychiatrists, I do this through my role as Associate Editor of a free online textbook ( www.iacapap. org). The bibliotherapy library I curate in my private practice waiting room serves as a great selection pool for the books I choose for review as an Assistant Editor for JAACAP 's Book Forum. And my role giving Grand Rounds and seminars on physician wellness stays informed through my work as a member of the APA Committee on Physician Wellness. Research indicates that giving physi - cians just twenty percent of their time to do what they're most passionate about prevents burnout. While I am a far cry from perfect, reserving Fridays for my academic pursuits keeps me evidence-based on matters most important to me, not my boss. Since leaving the mother - ship in New Haven, I've given talks in Madrid, Bucharest, Calgary, Geneva, Sydney, New York, Atlanta, and DC. Work hard and follow your passion, and it won't matter where you call home or what title follows your name. m Dr. Mao is Professor of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Baylor College of Medicine.

Ellis, DO Oxford University Press 2018Paperback: 240 - $19.95 Caring for Autism: Practical Advice from a Parent and Physician is a thoughtful and useful book for families of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Written by Dr. Ellis, a child and adolescent psychiatrist and father of a child with ASD, the book offers unique and valuable perspectives and insights. The book is organized around 12 rich chapters covering a broad range of topics. It opens with a candid refl ection by Dr. Ellis and his wife on caring for a child with ASD. They share early feelings of fear and helplessness and their journey to hope and resilience. The assessment and diagnosis chapter considers common signs and symptoms of ASD, comorbid diagnoses, and aspects of a typical workup. A concise exploration of potential causes of ASD considers the evidence for various theories on the etiology of the disorder. Broad domains of treatment are explored, including psychopharmacology, complementary and alternative medicine, and behavioral therapies. The evidence and effi cacy of these interventions are again considered and presented in an accessible way. Key information is highlighted with helpful tables, bulleted points, and brief summaries. Dr. Ellis attends to the practical realities of how ASD impacts families, other children, marriages, and fi nances. He offers valuable insights on how to navigate the educational system and the utility of individualized education plans. Long term planning includes legal issues, fi nances, insurance issues, and guardianships. He concludes with a brief refl ection on initial feelings of grief in families experiencing new diagnoses of ASD and discusses modes of building meaning and strength. In Caring for Autism: Practical Advice from a Parent and Physician , Dr. Ellis offers much more than pragmatic advice; he offers hope and inspiration to families of children with ASD. m 2018 ASSEMBLY CATCHER S IN THE RYE AWARDS Recognizing and promoting advocacy for children The Assembly Catchers in the Rye Awards are AACAP's most prestigious awards that recognize an AACAP member, an AACAP component, and a regional organization of the AA CAP Assembly for outstanding advocacy efforts .

MAY/JUNE ANNUAL MEETING OCT 22-27, 2018 SEATTLE, WAWhat to Do and See in Seattle! Space Needle Built for the 1962 World's Fair, the 605-foot-tall Space Needle quickly became an icon of the city that today is recognized far and wide. On the observa - tion level, which you can reach via a 43-second elevator ride, see the doodle-on-a-napkin concept that led to the Space Needle design. Views from the top feature Elliott Bay, the Cascade Mountains, and even Mount Rainier. Seattle Center Monorail Another World's Fair relic, the Seattle Center Monorail links Seattle Center\u2014home of the Space Needle and several other notable attractions\u2014to downtown's Westlake Center along an approximately one-mile route. The designated historic land - mark can reach a top speed of 45 miles per hour and weaves between skyscrapers above the city streets. Museum of Pop Culture (MoPOP) Music, science fiction, and pop culture all come together at the fascinating Museum of Pop Culture . The Frank Gehry-designed building looks like a smashed guitar from above, while inside, its colorful exhibits cover everything from the history of indie video games and horror films to Nirvana, the Seahawks, and more. Chihuly Garden and Glass Museum The Chihuly Garden and Glass Museum is dedicated to the work and career of locally born, world-renowned glassblower Dale Chihuly, who was introduced to the craft while studying at the University of Washington. It is the most comprehensive collection of his art to date, with interior galleries featuring a variety of his work in the medium. The pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance is the glasshouse, with a vibrant 100-foot-long sculpture in hues of red, orange, and yellow suspended from the ceiling. Pike Place Market From the iconic market sign and Rachel the Piggy Bank to the gum wall, the original Starbucks cafe, well over 225 local arti - sans selling their wares, the famous fish-tossing tradition, and music-playing street performers, there are enough sights and sounds at Pike Place Market to pack a day (or more).

Seattle is a major metropolitan area set within one of the most beautiful parts of the country. It has several professional sports teams, excellent performance arts, a culture that supports physical activity, and outstanding restaurants. What really makes Seattle unique is the natural beauty of the region. Without having to drive more than a couple of hours I can see orca whales in the wild, ski, hike up mountains and through old growth forests, and visit two national parks. I have lived in Seattle for five years and continue to be impressed at what it has to offer. Shannon Simmons, MD, MPH\" \" I love living in the Seattle and Pacific Northwest area for too many reasons to list! It is beautiful and diverse. We have everything you could want, whether you prefer mountains or the ocean, suburbs or the city, tech scene or the arts. We are a land of innovation, activism, culture, and did I already mention how amazingly beautiful it is here? We are so excited to welcome our colleagues to the Emerald City and surrounding areas. There is too much to do in this one trip, so we hope to whet your appetite and then welcome you back again and again! Avanti Bergquist, MD\" \"Seattle is a vibrant city bustling with energy from the influx of tech workers and Amazon's new buildings. The restaurant scene has bloomed in recent years, with a seemingly unending variety of options. John E. Dunne, MD\" \" The city of Seattle has a beautiful natural setting, between two mountain ranges, the Olympics to the west and the Cascades, including Mt. Rainier and Mt. Baker, to the east. In addition, we are nestled in between the salt waters of Puget Sound on the west and fresh water Lake Washington on the east. In between is hilly Seattle with lots of opportunities for outdoor or indoor recreation, for example, rock climbing at the REI store near downtown, boating, hiking, cycling, theaters, and fine dining. We have a world class zoo at Woodland Park and lovely Japanese and Chinese gardens, the Washington Park arboretum, and the conservatory at Volunteer Park, also the site of our Asian Art Museum. The main art museum is downtown, a block away from our best venue for all types of music, including the Seattle Symphony Orchestra at Benaroya Hall. In spite of all of our cosmopolitan attributes, we still maintain the feel of a neighborhood community. Julia H.

Westman, MD, MS School shootings are a distinctly an American phenomenon. Unfortunately, the public focus is either on the mental state of shooters or on the availability of guns. In fact, mass shootings by people with serious mental illness represent less than 1% of all yearly gun-related homicides in the United States. 1 The overall contri - bution of people with serious mental illness to violent crimes is only about 3%. When these crimes are examined in detail, an even smaller percentage are found to involve firearms. Criminals and angry teenagers and adults use guns. Still, there is reason to be concerned about the mental health of our young citizens. Most are doing well, but at least one in three are not. At least one in four have experienced neglect and/or abuse at some point in their lives and are pre - disposed to violence later in life. The United States ranks 18th of 21 Western countries in overall child well-being. American children are clearly falling short intellectually. They rank 23rd in science, 17th in reading, and 31st in math achievement out of 32 Organization of Economic Cooperation The Availability of Guns Is the Issue, Not Mentally Ill Shooters and Development countries. These include Shanghai, China (first in all), Finland (first, second, and sixth), South Korea (sixth, second, and fourth), Canada (eighth, sixth, and tenth), Germany (13th, 20th, and 16th) and Poland (19th, 15th, and 25th). The Centers for Disease Control's 2016 Youth Risk Behavior Survey found that nationwide 6% of students missed at least one day of school during the past month because they felt unsafe in school. Overall child deaths in the United States greatly exceed those in comparable nations, largely because of the preva - lence of gun deaths. Of each one million children in the United States, 6,500 die of all causes annually in the United States, compared to 3,600 in Germany and 2,500 in Japan. In Chicago, more than 440 school-aged children were shot in 2012. Sixty died. \"I think people in Chicago have almost got - ten numb to the statistics,\" said Dexter Voisin, a researcher at the University of Chicago. \"For every kid who is mur - dered, about 100 kids witness a murder or are victims of non-fatal injuries, robberies, muggings and gang-related incidents.\" Mental health professionals are all too familiar with the use of guns in sui - cides and homicides but focusing on the mental state of shooters misses the point. Criminals use guns. No one would shoot anyone if handguns and automatic weapons were not readily available. The latter are military weapons that have no place in civilian hands. No mental health interventions will ever prevent the vast majority of shootings in our homes, on our streets, and in our schools. Strict gun control laws will. At the same time, the mental health of our young citizens does cry out for attention. As child and adolescent psychiatrists, we have an obligation to make both of these facts known. m References 1. \"Mass Shootings and Mental Illness.\" Available at: psychiatryonline.org/doi/pdf/10.5555/appi.books.9781615371099 .

Emma Gonzalez, a Senior at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, gave a powerful \"speech\" that included six minutes, 20 seconds of silence which was how long it took for Nikolas Cruz, a former student, to kill 14 current students, three teachers, and wound 17 more with an AR-15 Style Smith and Wesson semi-automatic rifle on Valentine's Day 2018. It was a very dramatic presentation. This powerful nationwide protest is a serious plea for our leaders to listen and take effec - tive, swift action. A lot of energy in this movement is led by the school youth; however, there is a giant elephant in the room. Not once so far have I heard The Elephant in the Room anyone discuss or even mention the root causes of why someone desper - ately angry (NOT necessarily mentally ill) would resort to obtaining a weapon of mass destruction and killing as many humans as possible in the shortest time. In our schools from kindergarten through college, bullying is widespread and significantly ignored. In some ways, bullying has become a weapon that is more pervasive and destructive. Bullied individuals are targeted and ignored by students, parents, and school person - nel. It took five years for Yale child psychiatrist, James Comer, MD , and his team to help two inner city New Haven, Connecticut, public schools to develop programs to effectively eradicate this serious problem of bullying. 1 So powerful was this transformation that when a new student (a bully) transferred into one of these schools, he attempted to resume his bullying and disruptive behavior. He was told by his fellow classmates, \"We do not do that here!\" And that was that . It amply demonstrated what is needed at every educational level: a serious com - prehensive program to nip bullying in the bud immediately. This includes cyber - bullying which in some ways is more pervasive and needs to be addressed by everyone. If this kind of energy was devoted to this problem as is now devoted across America for ending gun violence, I predict that significantly fewer students would resort to gun violence as a remedy to their problems. In my own family, my third grade grandson was bullied by one of his classmates. He promptly told his parents and teacher. They swiftly responded to his complaint and nipped the problem in the bud. My grandson happily learned two things that day: 1) When bullied by anyone, tell an adult immediately and 2) do not give up until somebody listens. The consequences of not telling some - one can be deadly. m References 1. Comer J: School Power: implications of an intervention project, The Free Press, NY, 1995.

As such, we know that children who experience sudden separation from one or both parents, especially under frightening, unpredictable, and chaotic circumstances, are at higher risk for developing illnesses such as anxiety, depression, posttraumatic stress disorders (PTSD), and other trauma-induced reactions. This is especially the case for children who are fl eeing war, violence, and other traumatic situations from their home countries. Parental support is an essential and proven protective factor that substantially reduces risk for adverse health and developmental outcomes for children. Separating these children from their families in times of stress creates unnecessary and high-risk trauma at the very time they need care and support the most. As child and adolescent psychiatrists, we know that pulling families apart can often cause harm. It is our responsibility as physicians to put an end to the idea and practice of separating vulnerable children from their families, including high-risk immigrant children. AACAP strongly opposes any policy or legislation that separates children and families in these stressful situations.

Calling all leaders! \" 2013 AACAP LIFE MEMBERS MENTORSHIP G RANTS FOR MEDICAL STUDENTS, SUPPORTED BY AACAP'S LIFE MEMBERS FUND While the Legislative Conference was the bait to get me involved into more AACAP activities, the Life Members Award, Life Member Programming and Life Members Dinner was the trap which has kept me all this time. Meeting the Life Members and learning about their paths through child psychiatry and illustrious careers, I was inspired and that inspiration continues. It was at a Life Member Program that I learned the history of the Triple Board (combined training in General Pediatrics, Adult Psychiatry, and Child Psychiatry) - something which helped solidify my interest and commitment to becoming a Triple Boarder. \" AACAP's Legislative Conference is where I got my start, learning how AACAP works and how to get more involved in the organization. I also found excellent mentors there and learned many strategies for how to communicate our patients' stories. The conference is an opportunity to think about and advocate for the macro issues which affect children's mental health and child psychiatrists' practice. AACAP and Regional Organizations support medical students, adult psychiatry residents and child psychiatry fellows in attending Legislative Conference. During the two -day event, the Government Relations team and Advocacy Committee teach attendees how to speak to legislative staff and how to advocate most effectively for our patients' mental health. I worked as a US Senate page in high school and got to watch the legislative process unfold. It has been great to come back to Washington, DC and to be able to talk about important issues with many of those legislators with whom I worked as a page. We see so much in the news about the dysfunction in Congress lately; it feels important to put a human touch on issues like CHIP funding, loan repayment programs for child psychiatrists, and support for early childhood programs. It is reassuring that there are also legislative staffers who are really passionate about these issues, too. Legislative Conference is a place where I feel like I get energized - thinking broadly about how to help all children then motivates me to do all I can to help my individual patients.

MAY/JUNE 2018 155FOR YOUR INFORMATION156 AACAP NEWS FOR YOUR INFORMATIONNo. 100; Updated March 2018 Social Media and Teens Social media plays a big role in teen culture today. Surveys show that ninety percent of teens ages 13-17 have used social media. Seventy five percent report having at least one active social media profile, and 51% report visiting a social media site at least daily. Two thirds of teens have their own mobile devices with internet capabilities. On average, teens are online almost nine hours a day, not including time for homework. There are positive aspects of social media, but also potential risks. It is important for parents to help their teens use these sites responsibly. Potential benefits of social media include: Staying connected to friends Meeting new friends with shared interests Finding community and support for specific activities Sharing art work or music Exploring and expressing themselves Potential risks of social media include: Exposure to harmful or inappropriate content (e.g., sex, drugs, violence, etc.) Exposure to dangerous people Cyber bullying, a risk factor for depression and suicide Oversharing personal information Exposure to excessive advertisements Privacy concerns including the collection of data about teen users Identity theft or being hacked Interference with sleep, exercise, homework, or family activities Teenagers need support and education to develop the skills to manage their social media use. There are many ways to help your child learn to use social media sites responsibly. It's important to talk with your child about their social media use and your family rules, including consequences for too much use or inappropriate use and whether you will be monitoring their online activities. Consider the following suggestions depending on your child's age and maturity: Friending or following your child's social media accounts with an agreement about whether you will or won't post or respond to their posts \"No screen\" times such as \"no screens at the dinner table,\" \"no screens in bedrooms\" after a certain time of day, or \"no social media use until homework is done\" Ensuring that privacy settings are turned on to limit access to personal information Instructing teens not to share full names, addresses, telephone numbers, social security numbers, passwords, and bank or credit card numbers having location enabled services turned \"off\" Exploring apps which limit internet access to age appropriate sites.
