[Critics are arguing](http://m.ncregister.com/49668/d#.V1W_1JErLNP) that newer findings have shown pain sensation appears earlier in gestation, yet the 2005 data continue to be cited in the discussion around abortion. What's more, they note, some of the authors failed to mention their ties to the abortion industry. The 2005 paper has been cited 191 times, according to [Thomson Reuters Web of Science](http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/WOS-boilerplate.pdf). We spoke with Howard Bauchner, Editor in Chief at JAMA and The JAMA Network, who told us something similar to what he said last week, when [PETA asked to retract a paper they claim could be harmful to elephants](http://retractionwatch.com/2016/06/02/jama-takes-all-calls-for-retraction-seriously-even-from-peta/): [Continue reading Pro-lifers call for JAMA to retract 2005 paper about fetal pain](https://retractionwatch.com/2016/06/07/pro-lifers-call-for-jama-to-retract-2005-paper-about-fetal-pain/#more-40945) After the reviewer of a rejected paper was publicly outed, the BMJ has taken the unusual step of explaining why it chose not to publish the paper. The paper \u2014 [eventually published in another journal](http://hsr.sagepub.com/content/early/2016/05/05/1355819616649630.abstract) \u2014 raised hackles for suggesting that there is no \"weekend effect,\" or a higher mortality rate in hospitals on Saturday and Sunday. This caught the attention of UK policy makers, who have proposed changing policies to [compensate for any supposed \"weekend effect.\"](http://www.bbc.com/news/health-34775980) Amidst the heated discussion about the research, [one of the reviewers was identified](http://www.pulsetoday.co.uk/hot-topics/seven-day-gp-access/excess-deaths-at-weekends-a-statistical-artefact-finds-major-new-study/20031777.fullarticle), along with suggestions that [he may have been conflicted](https://twitter.com/search?q=meacock%20freemantle%20weekend%20effect&src=typd) because he had published a study showing the opposite finding. Yesterday, the BMJ [posted a blog explaining that it was the editors \u2014 and not one sole reviewer \u2014 who decided to reject the paper](http://blogs.bmj.com/bmj/2016/05/16/the-bmj-research-editors-why-the-bmj-rejected-a-weekend-effect-paper/): [Continue reading In precedent break, BMJ explains why it rejected controversial \"weekend effect\" paper](https://retractionwatch.com/2016/05/17/in-precedent-break-bmj-explains-why-it-rejected-controversial-weekend-effect-paper/#more-40150) After publishing a [paper about neuropathy in diabetic patients](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmcp1503948) last week, The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) immediately corrected it after editors learned of errors and some missing disclosures within the article. The notice explains that the sole author of the paper, \" [Diabetic Sensory and Motor Neuropathy](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmcp1503948),\" reported incorrect doses for several medications, and received royalties for the tool to measure quality of life used in the paper. The author told us all the declarations were \"discussed in detail\" between him and the journal, and both parties agreed to the final decision. Let's take a look at the lengthy correction notice \u2014 what some of our readers might call a \" [mega-correction](http://retractionwatch.com/category/by-reason-for-retraction/mega-corrections/):\" [Continue reading NEJM quickly corrects disclosure statement, errors in diabetes paper](https://retractionwatch.com/2016/04/19/nejm-quickly-corrects-disclosure-statement-errors-in-diabetes-paper/#more-38942) Eleven scientists are [asking a journal to consider retracting](http://ebph.it/article/view/11590/10868) an asbestos paper with industry ties for including \"seriously misleading information,\" \"several wrong statements,\" and thrice citing a journal that doesn't appear to exist. Editors of the journal, Epidemiology Biostatistics and Public Health, however, say they will not retract the article, based on the advice of two external reviewers. An earlier [correction](http://ebph.it/article/view/11450/10606) for the paper, \" [Further Studies of Bolivian Crocidolite - Part IV: Fibre Width, Fibre Drift and their relation to Mesothelioma Induction: Preliminary Findings](http://ebph.it/article/view/11167),\" cited previously undisclosed competing interests for four of the paper's five authors.

The authors, led by Edward Ilgren formerly of Oxford University, claim that \"myriad sources\" of other forms of asbestos\u2014rather than the asbestos produced at the mine, called chrysotile\u2014exist in the region \"to account for the alleged cases.\" However, according to a recently added correction, the citation does not support one of the authors' claims about how other forms of asbestos arrived at the mine area.

This is a case of family values gone awry: The author common to all papers is [Cheng-Wu Chen](http://iaesjournal.com/online/index.php/IJAI/about/editorialTeamBio/1931) at the National Kaohsiung Marine University in Taiwan, the [twin](http://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/at-work/tech-careers/peer-review-ring-takes-down-taiwanese-minister) brother of one Peter Chen, who was a the center of a peer review ring that SAGE [busted in 2014](http://retractionwatch.com/2014/07/08/sage-publications-busts-peer-review-and-citation-ring-60-papers-retracted/) (and holder of the [number #3 spot on our leaderboard](http://retractionwatch.com/the-retraction-watch-leaderboard/)). Cheng-Wu Chen apparently wasn't an innocent bystander in that episode: Of the 60 retracted papers by SAGE, Cheng-Wu Chen was a co-author on 21.

The 2013 paper \u2014 now retracted by the American Journal of Infection Control \u2014 suggested a particular kind of connector between the catheter and the patient could reduce some of the notoriously deadly bloodstream infections associated with the procedure, according to a [press release](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/09/130910093350.htm) that publicized the work. But last year, the journal issued [an expression of concern](http://retractionwatch.com/2015/02/02/unspecified-questions-earn-central-line-study-expression-concern/) for the paper, noting there were questions about the data. The retraction note reveals an investigation at Georgia Regents University \u2014 now known as [Augusta University](http://www.augusta.edu/admissions/) \u2014 started looking into undisclosed conflicts of interest in the paper, and ultimately concluded the science was flawed. Here's the [retraction note](http://www.ajicjournal.org/article/S0196-6553(15)01165-7/pdf), published in the January 1st 2016 issue of the journal, for \" [Comparison of central line-associated bloodstream infection rates when changing to a zero fluid displacement intravenous needleless connector in acute care settings](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23973422)\" [Continue reading Investigation of undisclosed conflicts in catheter paper uncovers flawed data, too](https://retractionwatch.com/2016/01/27/investigation-of-undisclosed-conflicts-in-catheter-paper-uncovers-flawed-data-too/#more-36141) [Following her request last month](http://retractionwatch.com/2015/11/25/prominent-nutrition-researcher-marion-nestle-retracting-recent-article/), a public health journal has retracted a paper co-authored by prominent nutrition researcher [Marion Nestle](http://www.foodpolitics.com/about/), after revelations of multiple factual errors and her co-author's ties to one of the subjects of the article. The [article, an opinion piece](http://dx.doi.org/10.1057/jphp.2015.37), critiqued the supposed relationship between the biggest beverage distributor in Guatemala and the leading Guatemala-based public health organization, to distribute a fortified supplement (Man\u00ec+) for undernourished children. The relationship, the piece argued, raised concerns about the conflicts of interest that can occur when a food company pairs with a public health organization. But soon after publication, Nestle learned that she and her co-author [Joaquin Barnoya](http://publichealthsciences.wustl.edu/en/Faculty/BarnoyaJoaquin) had misrepresented that relationship, and failed to disclose that the public health organization was paying a portion of Barnoya's salary.

The four papers and two letters were published in Circulation, and all bear identical corrections: Piero Anversa, MD, discloses that he is a member of Analogous, LLC.

With the release of the 2013 Frontline documentary \" [League of Denial: The NFL's Concussion Crisis](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/film/league-of-denial/)\" and the publication of [Concussion](http://www.jeannemarielaskas.com/) by journalist Jeanne-Marie Laskas, the evidence is growing that the NFL \u2014 with the help of doctors working as paid consultants or expert witnesses for the NFL or individual teams \u2014 has downplayed the potential of football to cause long-term brain injuries. In a 2008, Lester Mayers of Pace University in Pleasantville, New York, published a review paper in Archives of Neurology (now JAMA Neurology), that summarized evidence from tests such as balance and gait testing, along with MRI and PET imaging studies. Mayers, who is now deceased, concluded in \" [Return-to-Play Criteria After Athletic Concussion: A Need for Revision](http://archneur.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=796113)\" that it takes at least four weeks \u2014 rather than one or two \u2014 for the brain to heal following a concussion: [Continue reading Critics of 2008 concussion study failed "}
