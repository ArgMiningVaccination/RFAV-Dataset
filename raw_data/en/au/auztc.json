It's about prioritising what's important - and that's doing what makes me feel well. Usually I get this urge after an extremely busy few months when some of my good habits have slid and I've been running from the clinic to social event to karate training to professional education seminar to giving a lecture while surviving on food that is far more convenient than it is worth eating. That's when I know, it's time to set things straight. So my detox diet usually runs for about two or three weeks, and since I respond well to structure and routine I spell it out like this: None of these - Dairy - Gluten and refined grains - Animal protein - Processed foods (this includes chocolate) - Added sugar - Alcohol - Coffee and black tea And plenty of these, organic where possible - Fresh vegetables - A small amount of fruit - Beans, peas and lentils - Wholegrains (non-gluten) - Plenty of herbs and spices (eg. ginger, garlic, cumin, cardamom, cinnamon, turmeric, parsley and coriander). - Water - Herbal and green teas I take a few herbs and supplements for: - liver support - good digestive function - healthy gut flora I like to consider this as more about what you can have, and that is spoiling your body with excellent quality food that you deserve (none of that cheap, nasty processed stuff)! For me, this means I can eat as many gluten-free porridges, curries, casseroles, stir frys and soups as I like. Which is great because I love these foods. Now, you don't have to go without gluten grains if you don't have a problem with them, I just feel better when I do avoid them. I'm also already a vegetarian so the meat thing isn't a problem. The part I struggle with most is avoiding sugar. I have a sweet tooth and I love dark chocolate. The rest of the diet makes me stick to a good routine for two weeks and that's long enough for me to remember my good habits and stick to them most of the time after that. I also find that if you fill up your body with good food it is very satisfying and you tend not to want the processed or sweet foods you might otherwise crave. These cravings are usually gone after only a few days. There are a few other tricks I have up my sleeve for people who struggle with sugar cravings. A good detox program should also include some exercise, again use this as a way to set your future exercise routine. Do exercise that you enjoy - if it's outdoors in a green space it's even better! Be kind to yourself during your program and add in a massage or two and some epsom salts baths. Detox diets and Traditional Chinese Medicine Detox diets are not part of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) so this post is a little controversial. TCM supports the body back to a healthy function but does not traditionally use therapeutic methods as a 'clean out', unless of course you are blocked up. Detox diets do form part of naturopathic and ayurvedic thought. My personal idea of a detox is not huge on the cleaning out side of things, but more on re-establishing a healthy diet and lifestyle routine. In TCM terms it's all about supporting the Earth element - the Spleen and Stomach (or digestive system in western terms). It's a plan for a set period of time (2-3 weeks) to get yourself back on track. I also do not subscribe to the raw food clean-out idea. A little is ok, but it depends on your constitution and you'll probably need to see a TCM practitioner to work that out. My detox doesn't usually include any juicing (or at least not copious amounts). When your body is functioning well, it can eliminate easily what it doesn't need. Detox programs aren't for everyone. It depends on your constitution and your signs and symptoms. I design different types of programs for my patients as individuals. Different foods, herbs, supplements and time periods. The goal is to re-establish (or establish in the first place) a healthy diet and lifestyle for a period of time that you can then stick to maybe 80% of the time thereafter.
