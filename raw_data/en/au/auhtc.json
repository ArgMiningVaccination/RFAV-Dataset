Behind the scenes[ ] In [The Force Unleashed II](/wiki/Star_Wars:_The_Force_Unleashed_II), these crystals are used by Marek for the majority of his adventure, and allowed him to regain force energy every time he struck an opponent. Despite Marek appearing with two of these crystals in cutscenes as early as [Dagobah](/wiki/Dagobah/Legends), it is impossible to obtain more than one in-game before reaching the [Salvation](/wiki/Salvation_(flagship))\u2014though, according to the novel, the crystals are only blue on Dagobah during his vision, and he still had red-bladed weapons at the time.
