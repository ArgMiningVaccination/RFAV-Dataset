Within OWS, the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) has partnered with more than 18 biopharmaceutical companies to accelerate development of drug and vaccine candidates for COVID -19 in a collaboration dubbed Accelerating COVID -19 Therapeutic Interventions and Vaccines (ACTIV). So far, the effort has yielded 14 vaccine candidates from more than 100 that are in development. Some of those are in clinical trials now. Those 14 will be further narrowed down to seven candidates, and the most promising of those will get further testing and clinical trials. Operation Warp Speed has also been working with multiple companies to quickly manufacture a vaccine and to develop solutions for distribution of that vaccine once it is ready. This includes tools such as pre -filled syringes, vials and containers. May 21: HHS announced up to $1.2 billion in support for AstraZeneca's candidate vaccine, developed in conjunction with the University of Oxford. The agreement is to make available at least 300 million doses of the vaccine for the United States, with the first doses delivered as early as October 2020 and Phase 3 clinical studies beginning this summer with approximately 30,000 volunteers in the United States.Operation Warp Speed (OWS) Tom Kanyok, BS Pharm, PharmD, RPhThis United Kingdom based national clinical trial aims to identify treatments that may be beneficial for people hospitalised with suspected or confirmed COVID -19 Principle Investigator -Peter Horby, Professor of Emerging Infectious Diseases and Global Health A range of potential treatments have been suggested for COVID -19 but nobody knows if any of them will turn out to be more effective in helping people recover than the usual standard of hospital care which all patients will receive. The RECOVERY Trial is currently testing some of these suggested treatments: Lopinavir -Ritonavir (commonly used to treat HIV) Low-dose Dexamethasone (now only recruiting children) Azithromycin (a commonly used antibiotic) Tocilizumab (an anti -inflammatory treatment given by injection) Convalescent plasma (collected from donors who have recovered from COVID -19 and contains antibodies against the SARS- CoV-2 virus). Data from the trial are regularly reviewed so that any effective treatment can be identified quickly and made available to all patients. Please see our news page for results that RECOVERY has already found. The RECOVERY Trial team will constantly review information on new drugs and include promising ones in the trial. Tom Kanyok, BS Pharm, PharmD, RPh'We have concluded that there is no beneficial effect of hydroxychloroquine in patients hospitalised with COVID- 19. We have therefore decided to stop enrolling participants to the hydroxychloroquine arm of the RECOVERY Trial with immediate effect. We are now releasing the preliminary results as they have important implications for patient care and public health. 'A total of 1542 patients were randomised to hydroxychloroquine and compared with 3132 patients randomised to usual care alone . There was no significant difference in the primary endpoint of 28- day mortality (25.7% hydroxychloroquine vs. 23.5% 1.11 [95% confidence interval 0.98- 1.26]; p=0.10). There was also no evidence of beneficial effects on hospital stay duration or other outcomes. 'These data convincingly rule out any meaningful mortality benefit of hydroxychloroquine in patients hospitalised with COVID -19. Full results will be made available as soon as possible. 16 June 2020 FDA pulls EUA for hydroxychloroquine/chloroquineChloroquine/Hydroxychloroquine Tom Kanyok, BS Pharm, PharmD, RPhDexamethasone In March 2020, the RECOVERY (Randomised Evaluation of COVid- 19 thERapY) trial was established as a randomised clinical trial to test a range of potential treatments for COVID -19, including low -dose dexamethasone (a steroid treatment). Over 11,500 patients have been enrolled from over 175 NHS hospitals in the UK. On 8 June, recruitment to the dexamethasone arm was halted since, in the view of the trial Steering Committee, sufficient patients had been enrolled to establish whether or not the drug had a meaningful benefit. A total of 2104 patients were randomised to receive dexamethasone 6 mg once per day (either by mouth or by intravenous injection) for ten days and were compared with 4321 patients randomised to usual care alone. Among the patients who received usual care alone, 28 -day mortality was highest in those who required ventilation (41%), intermediate in those patients who required oxygen only (25%), and lowest among those who did not require any respiratory intervention (13%). Dexamethasone reduced deaths by one -third in ventilated patients (rate ratio 0.65 [95% confidence interval 0.48 to 0.88]; p=0.0003) and by one fifth in other patients receiving oxygen only (0.80 [0.67 to 0.96]; p=0.0021). There was no benefit among those patients who did not require respiratory support (1.22 [0.86 to 1.75]; p=0.14). Based on these results, 1 death would be prevented by treatment of around 8 ventilated patients or around 25 patients requiring oxygen alone. Tom Kanyok, BS Pharm, PharmD, RPh Convalescent Plasma -Mayo Clinic Early Safety Indicators of COVID -19 Convalescent Plasma in 5,000 Patients J Clin Invest 2020 Jun 11 Michael J Joyner et al. Background: Convalescent plasma is the only antibody based therapy currently available for COVID 19 patients. It has robust historical precedence and sound biological plausibility . Although promising, convalescent plasma has not yet been shown to be safe as a treatment for COVID -19. Methods: Thus, we analyzed key safety metrics after transfusion of ABO compatible human COVID -19 convalescent plasma in 5,000 hospitalized adults with severe or life threatening COVID -19, with 66% in the intensive care unit , as part of the US FDA Expanded Access Program for COVID -19 convalescent plasma. Results: The incidence of all serious adverse events (SAEs) in the first four hours after transfusion was <1%, including mortality rate (0.3%). Of the 36 reported SAEs, there were 25 reported incidences of related SAEs, including mortality (n = 4), transfusion -associated circulatory overload (TACO; n = 7), transfusion- related acute lung injury (TRALI; n = 11), and severe allergic transfusion reactions (n = 3). However, only 2 (of 36) SAEs were judged as definitely related to the convalescent plasma transfusion by the treating physician. The seven- day mortality rate was 14.9%. Conclusion: Given the deadly nature of COVID 19 and the large population of critically -ill patients included in these analyses, the mortality rate does not appear excessive. These early indicators suggest that transfusion of convalescent plasma is safe in hospitalized patients with COVID -19. Tom Kanyok, BS Pharm, PharmD, RPh15 March 2020, the drug was approved in China for SARS -CoV- 2 Zhejiang Hisun Pharmaceutical Toyama Chemical (Fujifilm group) approved in Japan for influenza in 2014 Broad spectrum anti -viral mechanism of its actions is thought to be related to the selective inhibition of viral RNA - dependent RNA polymerase . Has reportedly shown efficacy in treating the disease with minimal side effects in a clinical trial involving 70 patients. The clinical trial is being conducted in Shenzhen, Guangdong province. US Department of Defense developed favipiravir in partnership with MediVector, Inc. as a broad- spectrum antiviral and sponsored it through FDA Phase II and Phase III clinical trials, where it demonstrated safety in humans and efficacy against the influenza virus.

Beigel, M.D. et al., ACTT -1 Study Group Members* Hospitalized Patients with Severe COVID -19: The COVID- 19 Treatment Guidelines Panel (the Panel) recommends the investigational antiviral agent remdesivir for treatment of COVID- 19 in hospitalized patients with SpO294% on ambient air (at sea level) or those who require supplemental oxygen (AI). The Panel recommends remdesivir for treatment of COVID- 19 in patients who are on mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) (BI). Recommendation for Duration of Therapy in Patients with Severe COVID -19 Who Are Not Intubated: The Panel recommends that hospitalized patients with severe COVID- 19 who are not intubated receive 5 days of remdesivir (AI). Recommendation for Duration of Therapy for Mechanically Ventilated Patients, Patients on ECMO, or Patients Who Have Not Shown Adequate Improvement After 5 Days of Therapy: There are insufficient data on the optimal duration of therapy for mechanically ventilated patients, patients on ECMO, or patients who have not shown adequate improvement after 5 days of therapy. In these groups, some experts extend the total remdesivir treatment duration to up to 10 days (CIII) . Recommendation for Patients with Mild or Moderate COVID -19: There are insufficient data for the Panel to recommend for or against remdesivir for the treatment of patients with mild or moderate COVID- 19.Vaccines and SARS- CoV- 2 mRNA vaccine Phase mRNA vaccine Phase 1/2 INO- 4800 Inovio Pharmaceuticals DNA vaccine Phase 1 AZD1222 University AstraZeneca Adenovirus vaccine Phase 2b/3 Ad5-nCoV CanSino Biologics Adenovirus vaccine Phase 2 Unnamed Wuhan Institute of Biological Products Inactivated virus Phase 1/2 and Sinopharm Unnamed Beijing Institute of Biological Products Inactivated virus Phase 1/2 and SinoPharm PiCoVacc Sinovac Inactivated virus, plus adjuvant Phase 1/2 Unnamed Institute of Medical Biology and Inactivated virus Phase 1 Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences NVX -CoV2373 Novavax Protein subunit Phase \u00bd J&J, Merck and Pfizer Pre-clinicalCOVID- 19 vaccine development pipeline gears up AsherMullard The Lancet Volume 395, Issue 10239, 6- 12 June 2020, Pages 1751 -1752 Tom Kanyok, BS Pharm, PharmD, RPhHistory of Vaccines and the Importance of the FDA ProcessCan a vaccine for SARS -Cov-2 be produced and approved in record time? https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/06/09/magazine/covid -vaccine.html In the history of medicine, rarely has a vaccine been developed in less than five years. Among the fastest to be developed was the current mumps vaccine. Currently there are no approved DNA vaccines or RNA vaccines.Vaccine development for a new pathogen traditionally takes many years or even decades.

BACKUP SLIDESPhase 1 A phase of research to describe clinical trials that focus on the safety of a drug. Usually conducted with healthy volunteers, and the goal is to determine the drug's most frequent and serious events and, often, how the drug is broken down and execrated by the body. Phase 2 A phase of research to describe clinical trials that gather preliminary data on whether a drug works in people who have a certain condition/disease (that is, the drug's effectiveness). For example, participants receiving the drug may be compared to similar participants receiving a different treatment, usually an inactive substance (called a placebo) or a different drug. Safety continues to be evaluated, and short term adverse events are studied. Phase 3 A phase of research to describe clinical trials that gather more information about a drug's safety and effectiveness by studying different populations and different dosage and by using the rug in combination with other drugs. These studies typically involve more participants.HOW DO I STAY INFORMED?
