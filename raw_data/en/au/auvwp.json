RENEW leverages SC 's unique national labor atories, user facilities, and other research infrastructures to provide undergraduate and graduate training opportunities for students and academic institutions not currently well represented in the U.S. science and technology (S&T) ecosystem. The hands -on experiences gained through RENEW will open new career avenues for participants, forming a nucleus for a future pool of talented young scientists, engineers, and technicians with the critical skills and expertise needed for the full breadth of SC research activities. Principal Investigators (PIs) , key personnel, and students and postdocs of RENEW 2 awards will be invited to participate in Isotope R&D and Production ( DOE Isotope Program or DOE IP) researcher meetings and/or SC -wide professional development and collaborator events. As a part of the RENEW initiative, DOE IP hereby announces its interest in receiving applications from Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs) seeking to participate in a training, research, and development program related to the mission space of DOE IP. Successful applications will incorporate isotope science and technology relevant coursework for undergraduate and/or graduate students, as well as research and/or isotope production experiences at DOE IP supported isotope production sites to expose students to potential career paths and foster the development and training of the next generation of workforce in isotope related science. Awards are envisioned to be led by an MSI and include a minimum of one DOE IP isotope production si te as a subaward recipient , acting as a resource in training, research, and development efforts. Successful applicants will describe activities including student recruitment, development of collaborative networks in support of trainee experiences, organiza tion of virtual and/or in- person workshops and meetings for trainees and mentors, establishing peer support groups for students, training for mentors, and trainee career advancement assistance. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION Program Objective The mission of the DOE IP is to: Produce and/or distribute radioactive and stable isotopes that are in short supply. Maintain the infrastructure required to produce and supply isotope products and related services. Conduct R&D on new and improved isotope production and processing technologies that can make isotopes available for essential research and applications. Decrease U.S. dependency on foreign supply of critical isotopes. Produced isotopes are obtained by di rect production or recovery from by- products and surplus government -owned materials. The DOE IP also provides specialized services related to the distribution of isotopes. The DOE IP supports production and processing facilities at the Low - Energy Accelerat or Facility (LEAF) at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL), the Brookhaven Linear Isotope Producer (BLIP) facility at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL), the Isotope Production Facility (IPF) at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), the High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR) and stable enrichment capabilities at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), the Advanced Test Reactor (ATR) at Idaho National Laboratory (INL), and processing facilities at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL). In addition, the Progra m coordinates and supports isotope production at a suite of academic accelerator and reactor facilities throughout the Nation, known as the University Isotope Network (UIN), to promote a reliable domestic supply of essential isotopes (University of Washington, University of Missouri, University of Alabama- Birmingham, and University of Wisconsin- Madison). The ability of DOE IP to fulfill this mission relies on the availability of a highly trained, diverse community of investigators, researchers, engineers, technicians, students, and other staff that provides great benefit to the nation by broadly contributi ng to and advancing fields such as 3 medicine, national security, domestic and global industry, and basic scientific research. The nation would benefit from widening the pool of potential talent to develop the next generation of scientists, engineers, and te chnicians involved in isotope production and processing. The SC RENEW effort seeks to support individuals and institutions historically underrepresented in the SC research portfolio. Critical to this initiative are institutional efforts for recruiting dive rse participation and creating and maintaining positive, inclusive, and professional research and learning environments, including but not limiting to providing mentoring and professional development resources to students and early career researchers and f ostering a sense of belonging among all research personnel. Ultimately, the goal of this FOA is to begin to invest in students as early as possible in their scientific training to ensure that the broadest pool of potential isotope scientists is domestically available, thereby helping to maintain the U.S. position at the forefront of the field with a technically sophisticated and innovative program. The SC RENEW effort seeks to support individuals and institutions historically underrepresented in the SC res earch portfolio. Critical to this initiative are institutional efforts for recruiting diverse participation and creating and maintaining positive, inclusive, and professional research and learning environments, including but not limiting to providing mentoring and professional development resources to students and early career researchers and fostering a sense of belonging among all research personnel. Evaluation The SC RENEW initiative builds foundations for research and training at historically underre presented institutions in the SC research portfolio through new partnership models and through supporting research and training applications that include project elements aimed at directly addressing barriers to participation. An integral part of this effort, is the evaluation of successful approaches, including the impact of the RENEW initiative on recruiting and retaining individuals from diverse backgrounds. Evaluation related to the impacts of RENEW on project participants will be conducted through a ce ntralized SC effort, administered by the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE) on behalf of SC. Recipient institutions and their subrecipients at every tier will be requested to provide information to ORISE about the content of training opportunities/curricula provided to students and postdocs supported by this award and the career paths taken by these participants. Information will be requested no more frequently than annually and may be requested for no more than ten years after the end of any award 's period of performance. Recipient institutions and their subrecipients should therefore plan to maintain communication with student and postdoc participants to respond to ORISE requests. DOE IP RENEW Expectations All applications must be subm itted by an MSI on behalf of a team that includes at least one existing DOE IP production site (either UIN members or national laboratory sites). Additional MSIs, other academic institutions, and/or DOE/NNSA National Laboratories may also be added to form larger teams. The US Department of Education list of MSIs in 2021 can be found at: https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ope/idues/2021eligibilitymatrix.xlsx . Any institution that 4 either receives funding through a Department of Education MSI funding program (coded 6 on the matrix) or that is eligible to receive such funding (coded 5 on the matrix) will be considered an MSI for this FOA The DOE IP RENEW initia tive is envisioned to combine coursework available at educationally appropriate levels specifically focusing on aspects of physics, chemistry, and materials science & engineering as well as other relevant Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields that underpin isotope production with research experience to provide an important foundation on which participants can build. Pairing the above with summer opportunities for participants to travel to DOE IP production sites, like the highly specialized facilities and resources at the DOE/NNSA National Laboratories, exposes students to the career opportunities inherent to isotope science. Responsive applications to this FOA should include research components. All research activities should expl ore innovative approaches to isotope production and processing involving, but not limited to any of the following related research competencies: advanced manufacturing, artificial intelligence and machine learning, and robotics. Applications that focus on isotope applications or end usage are nonresponsive to this FOA. The DOE IP expects that an inclusive environment be fostered at all sites where work is funded. Therefore, if an undergraduate or graduate student is unable to conduct off -campus research, alternative plans should be developed to accommodate this and ensure that an equal quality experience is available. Undergraduate Students It is anticipated that undergraduate students would be afforded the opportunity to engage with faculty con ducting research at their home institutions related to innovative and transformative approaches to isotope production and processing as well as participate in a selection of course work at an appropriate level. Material and supply costs related to undergra duate student research would be appropriate costs for the DOE IP RENEW initiative. During the summer months, undergraduate students would have the opportunity (at the expense of the DOE IP RENEW initiative) to travel for two weeks with their peers in the DOE IP RENEW initiative to a selection of DOE IP production sites for an off -campus, workshop- like learning experience. The experience could include lectures, research presentations, and tours designed to expose them to the breadth of work conducted at the sites and build a sense of community. Alternatively, longer periods could be proposed to include the conduct of on- site research at the collaborating facilities. Graduate Students It is likewise anticipated that participating graduate students be afforde d access to isotope science -related coursework and the student, and their advisor develop a plan to collaborate with DOE IP production sites, off -site from their home institution, in their dissertation work. It is imagined that the students (at the expense of the initiative) would spend three or more weeks, for each of two summers, conducting hands -on related work under the guidance of DOE IP production site collaborators. They would also attend/give research presentations and take tours 5 designed to expose them to various aspects of the isotope work conducted at that site. Students should be encouraged to consider visiting more than one site to begin to appreciate the diversity and breadth of science conducted by the DOE IP. Additionally, the summer stipend and associated indirect costs of each graduate student would be paid by the DOE IP RENEW initiative. RENEW Faculty and Mentors: Applications with clear mentoring plans will be favored. Applications should clearly articulate benefits to the participant stu dents, including skills acquired, networking opportunities, and breadth of exposure to isotope processing and production. In order to recognize and formalize the role of those involved in mentoring, the proposed inclusion of partial support for summer salary (typically half a month) for faculty and/or partial salary support for postdocs , technical, academic, and/or scientific staff (typically 30%) will be considered; and if appropriate, should be included in the mentoring plan and named as co- PIs. Guidance on other allowable costs is provided in the section below entitled \" Guidance for Application Budgets and Costs \". For additional information related to application construction and requested documentation, please refer to S ection IV of this FOA. Annual Meetings In addition to encouraging participating students to present their work at professional society conferences and workshops, it is expected that award recipients will work together to arrange an annual workshop where participating students can present their work, network with their peers, and engage with DOE IP staff.

Initial Review Criteria Prior to a comprehensive merit evaluation, DOE will perform an initial review in accordance with 10 CFR 605.10(b) to determine that (1) the applicant is eligible for the award; (2) the information required by the FOA , including LOIs or pre -applications, has been submitted; (3) all mandatory requirements are satisfied; (4) the proposed project is responsive to the objectives of the FOA , and (5) the proposed project is not duplicative of programmatic work. Applications that fail to pass the initial review will not be forwarded for merit review and will be eliminated from further consideration. 2. Merit Review Criteria Applications will be subjected to scientific merit review (peer review) and will be evaluated against the following five criteria which are of equal importance. Scientific and/or Technical Merit of the Project; Appropriateness of the Proposed Method or Approach; Quality and Efficacy of the Promoting Inclusive and Equitable Research (PIER) Plan; Competency of Applicant 's Personnel and Adequacy of Proposed Resources ; and Reasonableness and Appropriateness of the Proposed Budget . Note that external peer reviewers are selected with regard to both their expertise and the absence of conflict -of-interest issues. Both Federal and non- Federal reviewers may be used, and submission of an application constitutes agreement that this is acceptable to the investigator(s) and the submitting institution. The questions below are provided to the merit reviewers to elaborate the criteria established by regulation: S CIENTIFIC AND/OR TECHNICAL MERIT OF THE PROJECT What is the scientific innovation of the proposed research? What is the likelihood of achieving valuable results? How might the results of the proposed work impact the direction, progress, and thinking in relevant scientific fields of research? How does the proposed work compare with other efforts in its field, both in terms of scientific and/or technical merit and originality? Is the Data Management Plan suitable for the proposed research? To what extent does it support the validation of research results? To what extent will research products, including data, be made available and reusable to advance the field of research? Does the Data Management Plan add ress the specific requirements the topic description 28 APPROPRIATENESS OF THE PROPOSED METHOD OR APPROACH How logical and feasible are the research approaches? Does the proposed research employ innovative concepts or methods? Are the conceptual framework, methods, and analyses well justified, adequately developed, and likely to lead to scientifically valid conclusions? Does the applicant recognize significant potential problems and consider alternative strategies? Is the proposed research aligned with the published priorities identified or incorporated by reference in Section I of this FOA? Does the proposed plan to recruit and retain students and early- stage investigators provide sufficient mentorship? Q UALITY AND EFFICACY OF THE PROMOTING INCLUSIVE AND EQUITABLE RESEARCH PLAN Is the proposed Promoting Inclusive and Equitable Research (PIER) Plan suitable for the size and complexity of the proposed project and an integral component of the proposed project? To what extent is the PIER plan likel y to lead to participation of individuals from diverse backgrounds, including individuals historically underrepresented in the research community? What aspects of the PIER plan are likely to contribute to the goal of creating and maintaining an equitable, inclusive, encouraging, and professional training and research environment and supporting a sense of belonging among project personnel? How does the proposed plan include intentional mentorship and are the associated mentoring resources reasonable and appr opriate? To what extent is the PIER plan likely to facilitate the promotion of physical and psychological safety in isolated research environments. C OMPETENCY OF APPLICANT 'S PERSONNEL AND ADEQUACY OF PROPOSED RESOURCES How do the roles and responsibilities of all collaborators on the project, particularly those from MSIs and/or HBCUs reflect a level of meaningful and/or substantive effort, and how is that substantive effort reflected in the proposed budget(s)? What is the past performance and potential of the research team? How well qualified is the research team to carry out the proposed research? Are the research environment and facilities adequate for performing the research? Does the proposed work take advantage of unique facilities and capabilities? Are resources adequate to provide the participants support throughout the period of the RENEW program? REASONABLENESS AND APPROPRIATENESS OF THE PROPOSED BUDGET Are the proposed budget and staffing levels adequate to carry out the proposed research ? Is the budget reasonable and appropriate for the scope? 29 B. REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS 1. Merit Review Applications that pass the initial review will be subjected to a formal merit review and will be evaluated based on the criteria codified at 10 CFR 605.10(d) in accordance with the guidance provided in the \"Office of Science Merit Review System for Financial Assistance,\" which is available at: https://science.osti.gov/grants/policy -and-guidance/merit -review -system/ . 2. Program Policy Factors The Selection Official may consider any of the following program policy factors in making the selection, listed in no order of significance: Availability of funds Relevance of the proposed activity to SC priorities Ensuring an appropriate balance of activities within SC programs Performance under current awards , if applicable Institutional history of training and mentoring early- career researchers Training the next generation of researchers Providing career pathways for the next generation of researchers Participation with multi- institutional teams in acco rdance with program priorities identified and incorporated in Section I of this FOA Increasing participation of institutions historically underrepresented in the SC research portfolio Promoting principal inves tigators with a commitment to improving diversity, equity, and inclusion in the STEM community Teams led by MSIs and/or HBCUs Supporting applications that include strong plans for recruiting diverse project personnel and fostering a sense of belonging and science identity among participants 3. Selection The Selection Official will consider the findings of the merit review and may consider any of the Program Policy Factors described above. 4. Review of Risk Pursuant to 2 CFR 200.206, DOE will conduct a review of any potential risks posed by the applicant. Such review of risk will include: Quality of the application, Reports and findings from audits performed under 2 CFR 200 and/or 2 CFR 910, and Systems maintained under 2 CFR 180 30 DOE may make use of other publicly available information and the history of an applicant 's performance under DOE or other Federal agency awards. Applicants with no prior performance of DOE awards may be asked to provide information about their financial stability and or their ability to comply with the management standards of 2 CFR 200. DOE may incorporate specific award conditions of a programmatic and/or administrative nature if an applicant exhibits one or more high- risk factors under 2 CFR 200.208. Further, DOE may conduct a review, through Government resources, of the applicant and project personnel with a connection to a foreign country. This includes, but is not limited to, (1) performance of work in, (2) travel to, and (3) awardee personnel 's higher education in a foreign Country, as well as (4) partnerships with international collaborators. The result(s) of any pre -award review of risk may supersede the results of merit review under 2 CFR 200.205, preventing DOE from selecting an application for award, reversing a selection for award, or requiring the disengagement of specific personnel. The results of any post -award review of risk may result in requiring the disengagement of specific personnel, the imposition of other requirements, or the termination of an award that \" no longer effectuates the program goals or agency priorities \" under 2 CFR 200.340(a)(2) and 2 CFR 200.206(c). Pursuant to 2 CFR 910.128, the results of any pre -award review of risk are not appealable. Any pre-award decision to not select an application for award, reverse a selection for award, or require the disengagement of spe cific personnel will be made by the Selection Official or SC Program Official. Pursuant to 2 CFR 910.128, the results of any post -award review of risk may be appealable. Any post -award decision to require the disengagement of specific personnel, the imposi tion of other requirements, or the termination of an award will be made by the Contracting Officer. 5. Discussions and Award The Government may enter into discussions with a selected applicant for any reason deemed necessary, including but not limited to the following: (1) the budget is not appropriate or reasonable for the requirement; (2) only a portion of the application is selected for award; (3) the Government needs additional information to determine that the recipient is capable of complying with the requirements in 2 CFR 200 as modified by 2 CFR 910 (DOE Financial Assistance Regulation) ; and/or (4) special terms and conditions are required. Failure to resolve satisfactorily the issues identified by the Government will preclude award to the applicant. C.

REPORTING OF MATTERS RELATED TO RECIPIENT INTEGRITY AND PERFORMANCE (DECEMBER 2015) DOE, prior to making a Federal award with a total amount of Federal share greater than the simplified acquisition threshold, is required to review and consider any information about t he applicant that is in the designated integrity and performance system accessible through SAM (currently FAPIIS) (see 41 USC 2313). 33 The applicant, at its option, may review information in the designated integrity and performance systems accessible throug h SAM and comment on any information about itself that a Federal awarding agency previously entered and is currently in the designated integrity and performance system accessible through SAM. DOE will consider any written comments by the applicant, in addition to the other information in the designated integrity and performance system, in making a judgment about the applicant 's integrity, business ethics, and record of performance under Federal awards when completing the review of risk posed by applicants as described in 2 CFR 200.206 Federal awarding agency review of risk posed by applicants. E. INTERIM CONFLICT OF INTEREST POLICY FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE 1. Policy The DOE interim Conflict of Interest Policy for Financial Assistance (COI Policy) can be found at -policy- requirements policy is applicable to all non- Federal entities applying for, or that receive, DOE funding by means of a financial assistance award (e.g., a grant, cooperative agreement, or technology investment agreement) and, through the implementation of this policy by the entity, to each Investigator who is planning to participate in, or is participating in, the project funded wholly or in part under the DOE financial assistance award. DOE 's interim COI Policy establishes standards that provide a reasona ble expectation that the design, conduct, and reporting of projects funded wholly or in part under DOE financial assistance awards will be free from bias resulting from financial conflicts of interest or organizational conflicts of interest. The applicant is subject to the requirements of the interim COI Policy and within each application for financial assistance, the applicant must certify that it is, or will be by the time of receiving any financial assistance award, compliant with all requirements in the interim COI Policy. The applicant must flow down the requirements of the interim COI Policy to any subrecipient non- Federal entities. 2. SC Implementation SC only requires that unmanaged or unmanageable financial conflicts of interest be included in the financial conflict of interest ( FCOI ) report. 34 Section VII - QUESTIONS/AGENCY CONTACTS A.

HOW -TO GUIDES 1. How to Distinguish Between a New and Renewal Application New Application: An application must be submitted as \" new\" in the following circumstances: When applying for funding to create a new research award that has not previously received DOE funding, including any funding for the current year , When applying for funding to support continued research from the same applicant institution as the current grant but with a significant change in fundamental nature of the research, or When applying for funding to support continued research supported by an existing DOE award but at a new applicant institution. Renewal Application: A renewal application is appropriate when funds are requested for an award that has no changes in the following items: The recipient/applicant institution , The award 's senior leadership, and The fundamental natur e of the award . A change in an award 's PI does not necessarily require submission as a new application: The change in personnel must be considered in light of other changes. Renewal applications compete for funds with all other peer -reviewed applications and must be developed as fully as though the applicant were applying for the first time. Renewal applications must be submitted by the same sponsoring institution as that holding the current award for which renewal funding is requested, and the proposed r esearch topic must be logical scientific extensions of the research that has been performed in the current award. 2. How Federally Affiliated Organizations May Participate and Be Funded V ALUE /FUNDING FOR DOE/NNSA NATIONAL LABORATORIES AND NON-DOE/NNSA FFRDC S For grant awards, the value of, and funding for, a DOE/ NNSA National Laboratory contractor, a non-DOE/NNSA Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) contractor, or another Federal agency 's portion of the work will not be included in the award to the successful applicant. DOE will fund a DOE/NNSA National Laboratory contractor through the DOE field work authorization system or other appropriate process and may fund non- DOE/NNSA FFRDC contra ctors and other Federal agencies through an interagency agreement in accordance with the Economy Act, 31 USC 1535, or other statutory authority. RESPONSIBILITY The successful prime applicant/awardee (lead organization) will be the responsible authority regarding the settlement and satisfaction of all contractual and administrative issues, including but not limited to, disputes and claims arising out of any agreement between the applicant and 36 any team member, and/or subrecipient . If an award is made to a DOE/NNSA National Laboratory, all Disputes and Claims will be resolved in accordance with the terms and conditions of the DOE/NNSA National Laboratory' s management and operating (M&O) contract, as applicable, in consultation between DOE and the prime award ee. If an award is made to another Federal agency or its FFRDC contractor, all Disputes and Claims will be resolved in accordance with the terms and conditions of the interagency agreement in consultation between DOE and the prime awardee. 3. How Federa lly Affiliated Organizations May App ly DOE/NNSA NATIONAL LABORATOR IES DOE/NNSA National Laborator ies, if eligible either as a prime applicant or a proposed team member on another entity' s application, should ensure that their cognizant DOE/NNSA Contracting Officer provides written authorization. This authorization should be submitted with the application as part of the Budget Justification for DOE/NNSA National Laboratory Contractor File. [This is not required for the National Energy Technology L aboratory because it is a Government Owned/Government Operated (GOGO) Laboratory .] Please note that failure to provide this authorization may result in rejection of an application prior to merit review. If a DOE/NNSA National Laboratory Contractor is selec ted for award, or proposed as a team member, the proposed work will be authorized under the DOE field work authorization system or other appropriate process and performed under the laboratory Contractor 's M&O contract, as applicable. The following wording is acceptable for the authorization: \"Authorization is granted for the _____________ Laboratory to participate in the proposed project. The work proposed for the laboratory is consistent with or complementary to the missions of the laboratory and will not adversely impact execution of the DOE/NNSA assigned programs at the laboratory.\" (end of acceptable authorization) If a DOE/NNSA FFRDC is selected for award negotiation, the proposed work will be authorized under the DOE work authorization process a nd performed under the laboratory' s Management and Operating (M&O) contract. N ON-DOE/NNSA FFRDC S Non-DOE/NNSA FFRDCs, if eligible either as a prime applicant or a proposed team member on another entity' s application, should follow the following guideline s: The prime applicant must obtain written authorization for non- DOE/NNSA FFRDC participation. The cognizant Contracting Officer for the Federal agency sponsoring the FFRDC contractor must authorize in writing the participation of the FFRDC contractor on the proposed 37 project and this authorization should be submitted with the application. The written authorization must also contain a determination that the use of a FFRDC contractor is consistent with the contractor 's authority under its award and does not place the FFRDC contractor in direct competition with the private sector, in accordance with FAR Part 17.5. Please note that failure to provide this authorization may result in rejection of an application prior to merit review. The following wording is acceptable for the authorization: \"Authorization is granted for the _____________ Laboratory to participate in the proposed project. The work proposed for the laboratory is consistent with or complementary to the missions of the laboratory and will not adversely impact execution of the (insert agency) assigned programs at the laboratory. This laboratory is authorized to perform the work proposed in the application submitted under DOE Funding Opportunity Announcement <<Include the FOA number on the cover pa ge>> by the following statutory authority (insert statute name, citation, and section) .\" (end of acceptable authorization) O THER FEDERAL AGENCIES Other Federal Agencies , if eligible either as a prime applicant or a proposed team member on another enti ty's application, must include in their budget justifications any specific statutory authorization (other than the Economy Act) that permits their receipt of an interagency agreement or that authorizes the payment of certain costs. 4. How Consortia May be Used I NCORPORATED CONSORTIA Incorporated consortia are eligible to apply for funding as a prime recipient (lead organization) or subrecipient (team member). Each incorporated consortium must have an internal governance structure and a written set of internal rules. Upon request, the consortium must provide a written description of its internal governance structure and its internal rules to the DOE C ontracting O fficer. There is no requirement that subawards be formalized into incorporated consortia. U NINCORPORATED CONSORTIA Unincorporated consortia (team arrangements) must designate one member of the consortium to serve as the prime recipient/consortium repres entative (lead organization). There is no requirement that subawards be formalized into unincorporated consortia . Upon request, unincorporated consortia must provide the DOE C ontracting Officer with a collaboration agreement, commonly referred to as the a rticles of collaboration, which sets out the rights and responsibilities of each consortium member. This agreement binds the individual consortium members together and should discuss, among other things, the consortium 's: 38 Management structure; Method of making payments to consortium members; Means of ensuring and overseeing members ' efforts on the project; Provisions for members ' cost sharing contributions; and Provisions for ownership and rights in intellectual property developed previously or under the agreement. Note that a consortium is applied for in one application and results in one award with subawards to consortia members. Multi- institutional teams may, if permitted under this FOA, submit collaborative applications with each institution submitting its own application with an identical research narrative, resulting in multiple awards to the collaborating institutions. 5.

If individual applica nts (those submitting on their own behalf) are eligible to apply for this funding opportunity, they need only refer to steps 2 and 3 below. Creating a Grants.gov account can be completed online in minutes, but SAM registration may take several weeks. Ther efore, an organization' s registration should be done in sufficient time to ensure it does not impact the entity' s ability to meet required application submission deadlines. Complete organization registration instructions can be found on Grants.gov here: https://www.Grants.gov/web/grants/applicants/organization- registration.html 1) Register with SAM : All organizations applying online through Grants.gov must register with SAM at https://www.sam.gov . Failure to register with SAM will prevent your organization from applying through Grants.gov. SAM registration must be renewed annually. For more detailed instructions for registering wi th SAM, refer to: https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/applicants/organization- registration.html 2) Create a Grants.gov Account : The next step is to register an account with Grants.gov. Follow the on- screen instructions provided on the registration page 3) Add a Profile to a Grants.gov Account : A profile in Grants.gov corresponds to a single applicant organization the user repres ents (i.e., an applicant) or an individual applicant. If you work for or consult with multiple organizations and have a profile for each, you may log in to one Grants.gov account to access all of your grant applications. To add an organizational profile to your Grants.gov account, enter the UEI (Unique Entity Identifier) for the organization in the UEI field. If you are an individual applicant submitting on your own behalf, you do not need a UEI to add the profile . For more detailed instructions about creat ing a profile on Grants.gov, refer to: https://www.Grants.gov/web/grants/applicants/registration/add -profile.html 4) EBiz POC Authorized Profile Roles : After you re gister with Grants.gov and create an Organization Applicant Profile, the organization applicant 's request for Grants.gov roles and access is sent to the Electronic Business Point of Contact (EBiz POC). The EBiz 42 POC will then log in to Grants.gov and author ize the appropriate roles, which may include the Authorized Organization Representative (AOR) role, thereby giving you permission to complete and submit applications on behalf of the organization. You will be able to submit your application online any time after you have been assigned the AOR role. For more detailed instructions about creating a profile on Grants.gov, refer to: https://www.Grants.gov/web/grants/applicants/registration/authorize -roles.html 5) Track Role Status : To track your role request, refer to: https://www.Grants.gov/web/grants/applicants/registration/track -role-status.html b. Electronic Signature : When applications are submitted through Grants.gov, the name of the organization applicant with the AOR role that submitted the application is inserted into the signature line of the application, serving as the electronic signature. The EBiz POC must authorize people who are able to make legally binding commitments on behalf of the organization as a user with the AOR role; this step is often missed, and it is crucial for valid and timely submissions. H OW TO SUBMIT AN APPLICATION TO SC VIA GRANTS .GOV Grants.gov applicants can apply online using Workspace. Workspace is a shared, online environment where members of a grant team may simultaneously access and edit different webforms within an application. For each FOA, you can create individual instances of a workspace. Below is an overview of applying on Grants.gov. For access to complete instructions on how to apply for opportunities, refer to: https://www.Grants.gov/web/grants/applicants/apply -for-grants.html 1) Create a Workspace: Creating a workspace allows you to complete it online and route it through your organization for review before submitting. 2) Complete a Workspace: Add participants to the workspace to work on t he application together, complete all the required forms online or by downloading PDF versions, and check for errors before submission. The Workspace progress bar will display the state of your application process as you apply. As you apply using Workspace , you may click the blue question mark icon near the upper -right corner of each page to access context -sensitive help. a. Adobe Reader: If you decide not to apply by filling out webforms you can download individual PDF forms in Workspace so that they will appear similar to other Standard forms. The individual PDF forms can be downloaded and saved to your local device storage, network drive(s), or external drives, then accessed through Adobe Reader. NOTE: Visit the Adobe Software Compatibility page on Grants.gov to download the appropriate version of the software at: https://www.Grants.gov/web/grants/applicants/adobe -software -compatibility.html 43 b. Mandatory Fields in Forms: In the forms, you will note fields marked with an asterisk and a different background color. These fields are mandatory fields that must be compl eted to successfully submit your application. c. Complete SF -424 Fields First: These forms are designed to fill in common required fields across other forms, such as the applicant name, address, and SAM UEI. Once it is completed, the information will tran sfer to the other forms. 3) Submit a Workspace: An application may be submitted through workspace by clicking the Sign and Submit button on the Manage Workspace page, under the Forms tab. Grants.gov recommends submitting your application package at least 24- 48 hours prior to the close date to provide you with time to correct any potential technical issues that may disrupt the application submission. 4) Track a Workspace: After successfully submitting a workspace package, a Grants.gov Tracking Number (GRANTXXXXXXXX) is automatically assigned to the package. The number will be listed on the Confirmation page that is generated after submission. For additional training resources, including video tutorials, refer to: https://www.Grants.gov/web/grants/applicants/applicant -training.html Applicant Support: Grants.gov provides 1 -800- 518-4726 and email at support@Grants.gov . For questions related to the specific grant opportunity, contact the number listed in the application package of the grant you are applying for. If you are experiencing difficulties with your submission, it is best to call the Grants.gov Support Center and get a ticket number. The Support Center ticket number will assist SC with tracking your issue and understanding background information on the issue. T IMELY RECEIPT REQUIREMENTS AND PROOF OF TIMELY SUBMISSION Proo f of timely submission is automatically recorded by Grants.gov. An electronic date/time stamp is generated within the system when the application is successfully received by Grants.gov. The applicant AOR will receive an acknowledgement of receipt and a tra cking number (GRANTXXXXXXXX) from Grants.gov with the successful transmission of their application. Applicant AORs will also receive the official date/time stamp and Grants.gov Tracking number in an email serving as proof of their timely submission. When SC successfully retrieves the application from Grants.gov, and acknowledges the download of submissions, Grants.gov will provide an electronic acknowledgment of receipt of the application to the email address of the applicant with the AOR role. Again, proof of timely submission shall be the official date and time that Grants.gov receives your application. Applications received by Grants.gov after the established due date for the program will be considered late and may not be considered for funding by SC. 44 Applicants using unreliable internet connections should be aware that the process of completing the Workspace can take some time. Therefore, applicants should allow enough time to prepare and submit the application before the package closing date. Grants.gov will provide either an error or a successfully received submission message in the form of an email sent to the applicant with the AOR role attempting to submit the application. If you do not promptly receive an email from Grants.gov with an agency trac king number, indicating receipt of the application by SC, please contact the Grants.gov Helpdesk -free) or support@Grants.gov immediately. SC will have no records of your attempted submission w ithout the second email from Grants.gov. 8. How to Prepare an Application A PPLICATION PREPARATION You must submit the application through Grants.gov at https://www.Grants.gov/ , using either the online webforms or downloaded forms. (Additional instructions are provided in 7., above .) You are required to use the compatible version of Adobe Reader software to complete a Grants.gov Adobe application package. To ensure you have the Grants.gov compatible version of Adobe Reader, visit the software compatibility page at https://www.Grants.gov/web/grants/applicants/adobe -software -compatibility.html . You must complete the mandatory forms and any applicable optional forms (e.g., Disclosure of Lobbying Activities (SF -LLL)) in accordance with the instructions on the forms and the additional instructions below. Files that are attached to the forms must be PDF files unless othe rwise specified in this FOA. Attached PDF files must be plain files consisting of text, numbers, and images without editable fields, signatures, passwords, redactions, or other advanced features available in some PDF - compatible software. Do not use PDF por tfolios or binders. Please note the following restrictions that apply to the names of all files attached to your application: Please limit file names to 50 or fewer characters Do not attach any documents with the same name. All attachments must have a un ique name. Please use only the following characters when naming your attachments: A -Z, a-z, 0-9, underscore, brackets, ampersand, tilde, exclamation point, comma, semi colon, apostrophe, at sign, num ber sign, dollar sign, percent sign, plus sign, and equal sign. Attachments that do not follow this rule may cause the entire application to be rejected or cause issues during processing. R ENEWAL APPLICATIONS For renewal applications only, the PI is requ ired to submit a Renewal Proposal Products section 45 through the PAMS website at https://pamspublic.science.energy.gov . The PI must enter into PAMS each product created during the course of the previous project period. Types of products include publications, intellectual property, technologies or techniques, and other products such as databases or software. As soon as the renewal application is assigned to a DOE Program Manager, the PI will receive an auto mated email from PAMS (< PAMS.Autoreply@science.doe.gov >) instructing him or her to navigate to the PAMS Task tab to complete and submit the Renewal Proposal Products. The submitted product list will be sent for merit review as part of the application. The application will not be considered complete and cannot be sent for review until the product list has been submitted. R ESUBMISSION OF APPLICATIONS Applications submitted under this FOA may be withdr awn from consideration by using the PAMS website at https://pamspublic.science.energy.gov . Applications may be withdrawn at any time between when the applicant submits the application and when DOE makes the application available to merit reviewers. Such withdrawals take effect immediately and cannot be reversed. Please exercise due caution. After the application is made available to merit reviewers, the applicant may contact the DOE program office identi fied in this FOA to request that it be withdrawn. After an application is withdrawn, it may be resubmitted, if this FOA is still open for the submission of applications. Such resubmissions will only count as one submission if this FOA restricts the number of applications from an applicant. Note that there may be a delay between the application 's submission in Grants.gov and when it is available to be withdrawn in PAMS. SC will usually consider the last submission, according to its Grants.gov timestamp, to be the intended version. Please consult with your program manager to resolve any confusion about which version of an application should be considered. I MPROPER CONTENTS OF APPLICATIONS Applications submitted under this FOA will be stored in controlled- access systems, but they may be made publicly available if an award is made. As such, it is critical that applicants follow these guidelines: Do not include information subject to any legal restriction on its open distribution, whether classifie d, export control, or unclassified controlled nuclear information. Do not include sensitive and protected personally identifiable information, including social security numbers, birthdates, citizenship, marital status, or home addresses. Pay particular attention to the content of biographical sketches and curriculum vitae. Do not include letters of support from Federal officials. Do not include letters of support on Federal letterhead. Letters that are not letters of support (such as letters confirming access to sites, facilities, equipment, or data; or letters from cognizant C ontracting O fficers) may be on Federal letterhead. Clearly mark all proprietary or trade- secret information. C HANGE OF AWARDEE INSTITUTION 46 If an awardee chooses to relinquish an awar d made under this FOA to permit the transfer of the award to a new institution, the new institution must submit an application under the then- available SC \" annual \" or \"open\" FOA. 9. How to Prepare a Biographica l Sketch A bio graphical sketch is to provide information that can be used by reviewers to evaluate the PI 's potential for leadership within the scientific community. Examples of information of interest are invited and/or public lectures, awards received, scientific program committees, conference or workshop organization, professional society activities, special international or industrial partnerships, reviewing or editorship activities, or other scientific leadership experiences. SC requires the use of the format approved by the National Science Foundation (NSF), which may be generated by the Science Experts Network Curriculum Vita e (SciENcv), a cooperative venture maintained at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sciencv/ , and is also available at https://nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/nsfapprovedformats/biosketch.pdf . If an interagency common format for a biographical sketch has been promulgated, that format must be used in an application. The use of a format required by another agency is intended to reduce the administrative burden to researchers by promoting the use of common formats. The biographical information (curriculum vitae) must include the following items within its page limit: Education and Training : Undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral training, provide institution, major/area, degree and year. Research and Professional Experience: Beginning with the current position, list professional/academic positions in chronological order with a brief description. List all current academic, professional or institutional appointments, foreign or domestic, at the applicant institution or elsewhere, whether or not remuneration is received, and, whether full-time, part- time, or voluntary. Publications : Provide a list of up to 10 publications most closely related to the proposed project. For each publication, identify the names of all authors (in the same sequence in which they appear in the publication), the article title, book or journal title, volume number, page numbers, year of publication, and website address if available electronically. Patents, copyrights and software systems developed may be provided in addition to or substituted for publications. An abbreviated style such as the Physical Review Letters (PRL) convention for citations (list only the first author) may be used for publications with more than 10 authors. Synergistic Activities : List no more than five professional and scholarly activities related to the effort proposed. Requested information may be appended to a biographical sketch, whether produced from a fillable PDF or in SciENcv. Do not attach a listing of individuals who should not be used as merit reviewers: This information is no longer collected as part of a bio graphical sketch . 47 SC strongly recommends the use of SciENcv to reduce administrative burden by allowing the use of digital persistent identifiers, including the Open Researcher and C ontributer ID (ORCiD). Biographical sketches must be attached to the Research and Related Senior/Key Person Profile (Expanded) form in an application. Personally Identifiable Information : Do not include sensitive and protected personally identifiable info rmation including social security numbers, birthdates, citizenship, marital status, or home addresses. Do not include information that a merit reviewer should not make use of. 10. How to Prepare a List of Individuals Who Should Not Serve as Reviewers To assist in identifying individuals who should not serve as merit reviews, provide the following information for each and every senior/key person who is planned to be or is identified in Section A of the R&R Budget for the applicant and any proposed subrecipients: Advisees (graduate students or postdocs) of the senior/key person Advisors of the senior/key person while a graduate student or a postdoc Close associates of the senior/key person over the past 48 months Co-authors of the senior/key person over the past 48 months Co-editors of the senior/key person over the past 48 months Co-investigators of the senior/key person over the past 48 months Collaborators of the senior/key person over the past 48 months Do not identify any personnel at the applicant institution or any proposed subrecipient or team institution: Those personnel are prohibited from serving as merit reviewers. Large collaborations of 10 or more researchers do not require that all collaborators be identified: rather, only list the researchers with whom the senior/key person actually collaborated. For all identified individuals, provide the following information: The senior/key person to whom the individual was an advisee, advisor, close associate, co - author, co- editor, co- investigator, or collaborator, identified by first name and last name The individual 's first (given) name The individual 's last (family) name The individual 's Open Researcher and Contributor ID (ORCiD), if known The individual 's institutional affiliation spelling out acronyms (For joint appointments, separate each institution with a slash ( \"/\"). Do not list departmental affiliations.) The reason for listing the individual (advisee, advisor, close associate, co -author, co- editor, co-investigator, collaborator) The year when the individual last was a close associate, co -author, co -editor, co -investigator, or collaborator You may also provide a list of all senior/key personnel who are planned to be or are iden tified in Section A of the R&R Budget for the applicant and any proposed subrecipients. The lists do not need to be sorted in any method. 48 The lists must be submitted in tabular format, preferably as Microsoft Excel (.xls or .xlsx) files. For your convenience, a template is available at https://science.osti.gov/grants/Policy -and- Guidance/Agreement -Forms . The template may also be posted with this FOA in Grants.gov. If using the template: Do not add tabs to the spreadsheet Do not merge the existing tabs Do not remove headers Fill out the requested headers on both tabs with the same information Ensure that given and family names are presented in the correct columns 11. How to Prepare Current and Pending Support WARNING : These instructions have been significantly revised to require disclosure of a variety of potential conflicts of interest or commitment, including participation in foreign government -sponsored talent recruitment programs . Current and Pending support is intended to allow the identification of potential duplication, overcommitment, potential conflicts of interest or commitment, and all other sources of support. The PI and each senior/ke y person at the prime applicant and any proposed subaward must provide a list of all sponsored activities, awards, and appointments, whether paid or unpaid; provided as a gift with terms or conditions or provided as a gift without terms or conditions; full - time, part- time, or voluntary; faculty, visiting, adjunct, or honorary; cash or in- kind; foreign or domestic; governmental or private -sector; directly supporting the individual 's research or indirectly supporting the individual by supporting students, res earch staff, space, equipment, or other research expenses. All foreign government -sponsored talent recruitment programs must be identified in current and pending support. SC requires the use of the format approved by the National Science Foundation (NSF), which may be generated by the Science Experts Network Curriculum Vita e (SciENcv), a cooperative venture maintained at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sciencv/ , and is also available at https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/nsfapprovedformats/cps.pdf . If an interagency common format for current and pending support has been promulgated, that format must be used in a n application. The use of a format required by another agency is intended to reduce the administrative burden to researchers by promoting the use of common formats. For every activity, list the following items: The sponsor of the activity or the source of funding. The award or other identifying number . The title of the award or activity. If the title of the award or activity is not descriptive, add a brief description of the research being performed that would identify any overlaps or synergies with the pr oposed research. The total cost or value of the award or activity, including direct and indirect costs. For pending proposals, provide the total amount of requested funding. The award period (start date - end date). 49 The person- months of effort per year bei ng dedicated to the award or activity. If required to identify overlap, duplication of effort, or synergistic efforts, append a description of the other award or activity to the current and pending support. Requested information may be appended to current and pending support, whether produced from a fillable PDF or in SciENcv. SC strongly recommends the use of SciENcv to reduce administrative burden by allowing the use of digital persistent identifiers, including the Open Researcher and Contributer ID (ORCiD). Current and pending support must be attached to the Research and Related Senior/Key Person Profile (Expanded) form in an application. Details of any obligations, contractual or otherwise, to any progra m, entity, or organization sponsored by a foreign government must be provided on request to either the applicant institution or DOE. 12. How to Prepare a Data Management Plan In general, a DMP should address the following requirements: 1. DMPs should descri be whether and how data generated in the course of the proposed research will be shared and preserved . If the plan is not to share and/or preserve certain data, then the plan must explain the basis of the decision (for example, cost/benefit considerations, other parameters of feasibility, scientific appropriateness, or limitations discussed in #4). At a minimum, DMPs must describe how data sharing and preservation will enable validation of results, or how results could be validated if data are not shared or preserved. 2. DMPs should provide a plan for making all research data displayed in publications resulting from the proposed research open, machine -readable, and digitally accessible to the public at the time of publication. This includes data that are displayed in charts, figures, images, etc. In addition, the underlying digital research data used to generate the displayed data should be made as accessible as possible to the public in accordance with the principles stated in the Office of Science Statement on Digital Data Management ( https://science.osti.gov/funding- opportunities/digital -data- management . This requirement could be met by including the data as supplementary information to the published article, or through other means. The published article should indicate how these data can be accessed. 3. DMPs shoul d consult and reference available information about data management resources to be used in the course of the proposed research. In particular, DMPs that explicitly or implicitly commit data management resources at a facility beyond what is conventionally made available to approved users should be accompanied by written approval from that facility. In determining the resources available for data management at Office of Science User Facilities, researchers should consult the published description of data management resources and practices at that facility and reference it in the DMP. Information about other Office of Science facilities can be found at https://science.osti.gov/user -facilities/ . 4. DMPs must protect confidentiality, personal privacy, Personally Identifiable Information, and U.S. national, homeland, and economic security; recognize proprie tary interests, business confidential information, and intellectual property rights; avoid significant negative impact 50 on innovation, and U.S. competitiveness; and otherwise be consistent with all applicable laws, and regulations. There is no requirement t o share proprietary data. DMPs will be reviewed as part of the overall SC research proposal merit review process. Applicants are encouraged to consult the SC website for further information and suggestions for how to structure a DMP: https://science.osti.gov/funding- opportunities/digital -data- management 13. How to P repare a Research and Related Budget and Justification The following advice will improve the accuracy of your budget request: Funds requested for personnel (senior, key, and other) must be justified as the product of their effort on the project and their institutional base salary. Funds requested for fringe benefits must be calculated as the product of the requested salary and, if pres ent, the negotiated fringe benefit rate contained in an institution 's negotiated indirect cost rate agreement. Funds requested for indirect costs must be calculated using the correct indirect cost base and the negotiated indirect cost rate. You are encoura ged to include the rate agreement used in preparing a budget as a part of the budget justification. Do not prepare a budget justification using the expired DOE form F4260.1. If you are proposing indirect costs and do not already have an Indirect Cost Rate Agreement with your Cognizant Federal Agency or documentation of rates accepted for estimating purposes by DOE or another Federal agency, it is recommended that you begin preparing an Indirect Cost Rate Proposal to be submitted, upon request, to the DOE c ontract specialist/grants management specialist who will evaluate your application if you are selected for award. For your convenience in preparing an Indirect Cost Rate proposal, a link to applicant resources, including indirect rate model templates, has been provided below: https://science.osti.gov/sbir/applicant -resources/grant -application/ . Budget Fields Section A Senior/Key Person For each Senior/Key Person, enter the requested information. List personnel, base salary, the numbe r of months tha t person will be allocated to the project, requested salary, fringe benefits, and the total funds requested for each person. The requested salary must be the product of the base salary and the effort. Include a written narra tive in the budget justif ication tha t justif ies the need f or requested personn el. Within the justification, explain the fringe benefit rate used if it is not the standard faculty rate. Section B Other Per sonnel List personnel, the numb er of months th at person will be allocated to the project, requested salary fringe benefits, and the total funds requested for each person. Include a written narra tive in the budget justi fication tha t fully justifies the need for requested personn el. Within the justification, provide the 51 number of positions being filled in each category of other personnel. Section C Equipment For the purpose of this budget, equipm ent is d esignated as an item of property that has an acquisition c ost of $5,000 or more and an expected service life of more than one year, unless a different threshold is specified in a negotiated Facilities and Administrative Cost Rate . (Note that this d esignation a pplies for propos al bud geting only and di ffers from the DOE d efinition of capit al equipm ent.) List each item of equipm ent separat ely and justi fy each in the budg et justif ication section. Do not aggregate items of equipment.

How to R egister in PAMS After you submit your application through Grants.gov, the application will automatically transfer into the Portfolio Analysis and Management System (PAMS) for processing by the DOE SC. Many functions for grants and cooperative agreements can be done in PAM S, which is available at https://pamspublic.science.energy.gov . You will want to \" register to \" your application: a process of linking yourself to the application after it has been submitted through Gra nts.gov and processed by DOE. You must register in PAMS to submit a pre -application or a LOI . Notifications sent from the PAMS system will come from the PAMS email address <PAMS.Autoreply@science.doe.gov >. Please make sure your email server/software allows delivery of emails from the PAMS email address to yours. Registering to PAMS is a two -step process; once you create an individual account, you must associate yourself with ( \"register to \") your ins titution. Detailed steps are listed below. C REATE PAMS ACCOUNT : To register, click the \" Create New PAMS Account \" link on the website https://pamspublic.science.energy.gov/ . Click the \" No, I have never had an account \" link and then the \" Create Account \" button. You will be prompted to enter your name and email address, create a username and password, and select a security question and a nswer. Once you have done this, click the \"Save and Continue \" button. On the next page, enter the required information (at least one phone number and your mailing address) and any optional information you wish to provide (e.g., FAX number, website, mailstop code, additional email addresses or phone numbers, Division/Department). Click the \" Create Account \" button. Read the user agreement and click the \" Accept \" button to indicate that you understand your responsibilities and agree to comply with the rules of behavior for PAMS. PAMS will take you to the \" Having Trouble Logging In? \" page. (If you have been an SC merit reviewer or if you have previously submitted an application, you may already be linked to an institution in PAMS. If this happens, you will be t aken to the PAMS home page.) R EGISTER TO YOUR INSTITUTION : 54 Click the link labeled \" Option 2: I know my institution and I am here to register to the institution. \" (Note: If you previously created a PAMS account but did not register to an institution at that time, you must click the Institutions tab and click the \" Register to Institution \" link.) PAMS will take you to the \" Register to Institution \" page. Type a word o r phrase from your institution name in the field labeled, \" Institution Name like,\" choose the radio button next to the item that best describes your role in the system, and click the \" Search \" button. A \" like\" search in PAMS returns results that contain the word or phrase you enter; you do not need to enter the exact name of the institution, but you should enter a word or phrase contained within the institution name. (If your institution has a frequently used acronym, such as ANL for Argonne National Laborat ory or UCLA for the Regents of the University of California, Los Angeles, you may find it easiest to search for the acronym under \" Institution Name like. \" Many institutions with acronyms are listed in PAMS with their acronyms in parentheses after their nam es.)

Buy America Requirement for Infra structure Projects Required use of Iron, Steel, Manufacture Products, and Construction Materials Produced in the United States A. DEFINITIONS For purposes of the Buy America Requirement, the following definitions apply: Components are defined as the articles, materials, or supplies incorporated directly into the end manufactured product(s). Construction Materials are an article, material, or supply \u2014other than an item primarily of iron or steel; a manufactured product; cement and c ementitious materials; aggregates such as stone, sand, or gravel; or aggregate binding agents or additives \u2014that is used in an infrastructure project and is or consists primarily of non- ferrous metals, plastic and polymer -based products (including polyvinyl chloride, composite building materials, and polymers used in fiber optic cables), glass (including optic glass), lumber, drywall, coatings (paints and stains), optical fiber, clay brick; composite building materials; or engineered wood products. Domestic Content Procurement Preference Requirement - means a requirement that no amounts made available through a program for federal financial assistance may be obligated for an infrastructure project unless \u2014 (A) all iron and steel used in the project are produce d in the United States; (B) the manufactured products used in the project are produced in the United States; or (C) the construction materials used in the project are produced in the United States. Also referred to as the Buy America Requirement . Infrastr ucture includes, at a minimum, the structures, facilities, and equipment located in the United States, for: roads, highways, and bridges; public transportation; dams, ports, harbors, and other maritime facilities; intercity passenger and freight railroads; freight and intermodal 60 facilities; airports; water systems, including drinking water and wastewater systems; electrical transmission facilities and systems; utilities; broadband infrastructure; and buildings and real property; and generation, transportati on, and distribution of energy\u2014including electric vehicle (EV) charging. The term \" infrastructure \" should be interpreted broadly, and the definition provided above should be considered as illustrative and not exhaustive. Manufactured Products are items used for an infrastructure project made up of components that are not primarily of iron or steel; construction materials; cement and cementitious materials ' aggregates such as stone, sand, or gravel; or aggregate binding agents or additives. Primarily of iron or steel means greater than 50% iron or steel, measured by cost. Project - means the construction, alteration, maintenance, or repair of infrastructure in the United States. Public - The Buy America Requirement does not apply to non- publi c infrastructure. For purposes of this guidance, infrastructure should be considered \"public \" if it is: (1) publicly owned or (2) privately owned but utilized primarily for a public purpose. Infrastructure should be considered to be \" utilized primarily for a public purpose \" if it is privately operated on behalf of the public or is a place of public accommodation. B. BUY AMERICA REQUIREMENT FOR INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS (BUY AMERICA REQUIREMENT ) None of the award funds (includes federal share and Recipient cost share) may be used for a project for infrastructure unless: (1) all iron and steel used in the project is produced in the United States \u2014this means all manufacturing processes, from the initial melting stage through the application of coatings, occurred in the United States; (2) all manufactured products used in the project are produced in the United States \u2014this means the manufactured product was manufactured in the United States; and the cost of the components of the manufactured product t hat are mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States is greater than 55 percent of the total cost of all components of the manufactured product, unless another standard for determining the minimum amount of domestic content of the manufactured product has been established under applicable law or regulation; and (3) all construction materials 5 are manufactured in the United States \u2014this means that all manufacturing processes for the construction material occurred in the United States. The Buy Ameri ca Requirement only apply to articles, materials, and supplies that are consumed in, incorporated into, or affixed to an infrastructure project. As such, it does not apply to tools, 5 Excludes cement and cementitious materials, aggregates such as stone, sand, or gravel, or aggregate binding agents or additives. 61 equipment, and supplies, such as temporary scaffolding, brought to the construction site and removed at or before the completion of the infrastructure project. Nor does the Buy America Requirement apply to equipment and furnishings, such as movable chairs, desks, and portable computer equipment, that are used at or within the fi nished infrastructure project but are not an integral part of the structure or permanently affixed to the infrastructure project. The Buy America Requirement does not statutorily apply to Prime Recipients that are For -Profit Entities. However, the Buy Ame rica Requirement is applicable to a For -Profit Entity if: (1) it is a sub-recipient or sub -awardee under an award that contains the Buy America Requirement term and condition, or (2) it is the Prime Recipient that voluntarily chooses to use domestically sourced iron, steel, manufactured products, and constructions materials by stating so in its proposed application containing an infrastructure project. If the For -Profit Entity specifically states that it will comply with the Buy America Requirements in its application and it is selected for award, its award will contain a Buy America Requirement for Infrastructure Projects term and condition. The Prime Recipient is responsible for flowing the Buy America Requirement down to all sub-awards, all contracts, su bcontracts, and purchase orders for work performed under the proposed infrastructure project, including to For -Profit Entities when the For -Profit Entity is a sub - recipient or sub- awardee. Recipients must certify or provide equivalent documentation for pr oof of compliance that a good faith effort was made to solicit bids for domestic products used in the infrastructure project under this award. Recipients must also maintain certifications or equivalent documentation for proof of compliance that those articles, materials, and supplies that are consumed in, incorporated into, affixed to, or otherwise used in the infrastructure project, not covered by a waiver or exemption, are produced in the United States. The certification or proof of compliance must be pr ovided by the suppliers or manufacturers of the iron, steel, manufactured products and construction materials and flow up from all subawardees, contractors and vendors to the recipient. Recipients must keep these certifications with the award/project files and be able to produce them upon request from DOE, auditors or Office of Inspector General. C. DOE SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS FOR FULL APPLICATION Within the first two pages of the workplan or project description, applicants must provide a short statement on whether the project will involve the construction, alteration, maintenance and/or repair of infrastructure in the United States. The ultimate determination about whether a project includes infrastructure remains with DOE, but the applicant 's statement w ill assist project planning and integration of the Buy America Requirement, which may impact the project 's proposed budget and/or schedule. D. WAIVERS In limited circumstances, DOE may waive the application of the Buy America Requirement in an 62 award where DOE determines that: (1) applying the Buy America requirements would be inconsistent with the public interest (Public Interest); (2) the types of iron, steel, manufactured products, or construction materials are not produced in the United States in sufficient and reasonably available quantities or of a satisfactory quality (Non -Availability); or (3) the inclusion of iron, steel, manufactured products, or construction materials produced in the United States will increase the cost of the overall project by more than 25 percent (Unreasonable Cost). DOE will only process waiver requests after an award has been made and for which the requests have been submi tted in accordance with the term and conditions of the award. Waiver requests must be reviewed by DOE and the Office of Management and Budget 's Made in America Office and are subject to a public comment period of no less than 15 calendar days. DOE or OMB may request additional information for consideration of the wavier. DOE may reject or grant waivers in whole or in part depending on its review, analysis, and/or feedback from OMB or the public. DOEs final determination regarding approval or rejection of t he waiver request may not be appealed by a Recipient. Requests to waive the Buy America Requirement must include the following: Waiver type (Public Interest, Non- Availability, or Unreasonable Cost); Recipient name and Unique Entity Identifier (UEI); Award information (Federal Award Identification Number, Assistance Listing number); A brief description of the project, its location, and the specific infrastructure involved; Total estimated project cost, with estimated federal share and recipient cost share breakdowns; Total estimated infrastructure costs, with estimated federal share and recipient cost share breakdowns; List and description of iron or steel item(s), manufactured goods, and/or construction material(s) the recipient seeks to waive from the Buy America Requirement, including name, cost, quantity(ies), country(ies) of origin, and relevant Product Service Codes (PSC) and North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes for each; A detailed justification as to how the non- domestic item(s) is/are essential the project; A certification that the recipient made a good faith effort to solicit bids for domestic products supported by terms included in requests for proposals, contracts, and non- proprietary communications with potential suppliers; A justification statement\u2014based on one of the applicable justifications outlined above \u2014 as to why the listed items cannot be procured domestically, including the due diligence performed (e.g., market research, industry outreach, cost analysis, cost -benefit analysis) by the recipient to attempt to avoid the need for a waiver. This justification may cite, if applicable, the absence of any Buy America -compliant bids received for domestic products in response to a solicitation; and Anticipated impact to the project if no waiver is issued. 63 The following principles should be incorporated as minimum requirements in waiver request: Time -limited: Consider a waiver constrained principally by a length of time, rather than by the specific project/award to which it applies. Waivers of this type may be appropriate, for example, when an item that is \" non-available\" is widely used in the project. When requesting such a waiver, the recipient should identify a reasonable, definite time frame (e.g., no more than one to two years) designed so that the waiver is reviewed to ensure the condition for the waiver ( \"non-availability \") has not changed ( e.g., domestic supplies have become more available). Targeted: Waiver requests should apply only to the item(s), product(s), or material(s) or category(ies) of item(s), product(s), or material(s) as necessary and justified. Waivers should not be overly broad as this will undermine domestic preference policies. Conditional: The recipient may request a waiver with specific conditions that support the policies of IIJA/BABA and Executive Order 14017. 4. Conference Spending (February 2015) The recipient shall not expend any funds on a conference not directly and programmatically related to the purpose for which the grant or cooperative agreement was awarded that would defray the cost to the United States Government of a conference held by any Executive branch department, agency, board, commission, or office for which the cost to the United States Government would otherwise exceed $20,000, thereby circumventing the required notification by the head of any such Executive Branch department, agency, board, commission, or office to the Inspector General (or senior ethics official for any entity without an Inspector General), of the date, location, and number of employees attending such conference. 5. Commitment of Public Funds (a) A DOE financial assistance award is valid only if it is in writing and is signed, either in writing or electronically, by a DOE Contracting Officer. (b) Recipients are free to accept or reject the award. A request to draw down DOE funds constitutes the Recipient' s acceptance of the terms and conditions of this Award. 6. Corporate Felony Conviction and Federal Tax Liability Representations (March 2014) In submitting an application in response to this FOA the Applicant represents that: It is not a corporation that has been convicted of a felony criminal violation under any Federal law within the preceding 24 months, It is not a corporation that has any unpaid Federal tax liability that has been assessed, for which all judicial and administrative remedies have been exhausted or have lapsed, and that is not being paid in a timely manner pursuant to an agreement with the authority responsible for collecting the tax liability. For purposes of these representations the following definitions apply: 64 A Corporation includes any ent ity that has filed articles of incorporation in any of the 50 states, the District of Columbia, or the various territories of the United States [but not foreign corporations]. It includes both for -profit and non -profit organizations. 7. Environmental, Saf ety and Health (ES&H) Performance of Work at DOE Facilities With respect to the performance of any portion of the work under this award which is performed at a DOE -owned or controlled site, the recipient agrees to comply with all state and Federal ES&H r egulations, and with all other ES&H requirements of the operator of such site. Prior to the performance on any work at a DOE -owned or controlled site, the recipient shall contact the site facility manager for information on DOE and site -specific ES&H req uirements. The recipient shall apply this provision to all subrecipient s at any tier. 8. Federal, State, and Local Requirements With respect to the performance of any portion of the work under this award, the recipient agrees to comply with all applicab le local, state, and Federal ES&H regulations. The recipient shall apply this provision to all sub awardees at any tier. 9. Funding Restrictions Funding for all awards and future budget periods are contingent upon the availability of funds appropriated by Congress for the purpose of this program and the availability of future -year budget authority. Cost Principles : Costs must be allowable, allocable and reasonable in accordance with the applicable Federal cost principles referenced in 2 CFR 200 as modified by 2 CFR 910 (DOE Financial Assistance Regulation). Pre-award Costs : Recipients may charge to an award resulting from this FOA pre -award costs that were incurred within the 90- day calendar period immediately preceding the effective date of the award, if the costs are allowable in accordance with the applicable Federal cost principles referenced in 2 CFR 200 as modified by 2 CFR 910 (DOE Financial Assistance Regulation). Recipients must obtain the prior approval of the DOE C ontracting O fficer for any pre -award costs that are for periods greater than this 90- day calendar period. Pre-award costs are incurred at the applicant 's risk. DOE is under no obligation to reimburse such costs if for any reason the applicant does not receive an award or if the award is made for a lesser amount than the applicant expected. 10. National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) Compliance If question 4.a. on the \" Research and Related Other Project Information \" docu ment indicates \"potential impact on the environment \", or if DOE 's own review indicates it, DOE may ask the 65 applicant to provide additional information on those impacts in order to prepare an environmental critique/synopsis per 10 CFR 1021.216. Note that this pre -award environmental critique/synopsis process would be separate from the preparation of a NEPA document such as an environmental impact statement (EIS) or an environmental assessment (EA). If DOE determines the latter documentation is necessary, this process would need to be completed, funded by and with the participation of the awardee, prior to them taking any action on the proposed project that could have adverse environmental effects or that could limit the choice of reasonable alternatives. Note that in most cases, even when \" Potential Impact to the Environment \" is checked \" Yes,\" preparation of such NEPA documents is rarely necessary, but DOE has the expectation that the Applicant will disclose the potential, which would serve to initiate dialog with DOE if necessary. The inability to satisfy the NEPA requirements after an award would result in cancellation of the award. 11. Nondisclosure and Confidentiality Agreements Representations (June 2015) In submitting an application in response to this FOA the Applicant represents that: (1) It does not and will not require its employees or contractors to sign internal nondisclosure or confidentiality agreements or statements prohibiting or otherwise restricting its employees or contactors from lawfully reporting waste, fraud, or abuse to a designated investigative or law enforcement representative of a Federal department or agency authorized to receive such information. (2) It does not and will not use any Federal funds to implement or enforce any nondisclosure and/or confidentiality policy, form, or agreement it use s unless it contains the following provisions: a. ''These provisions are consistent with and do not supersede, conflict with, or otherwise alter the employee obligations, rights, or liabilities created by existing statute or Executive order relating to (1) classified information, (2) communications to Congress, (3) the reporting to an Inspector General of a violation of any law, rule, or regulation, or mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety, or (4) any other whistleblower protection. The definitions, requirements, obligations, rights, sanctions, and liabilities created by controlling Executive orders and statutory provisions are incorporated into this agreement and are controlling.'' b. The limitation above shall not contravene requirements applicable to Standard Form 312, Form 4414, or any other form issued by a Federal department or agency governing the nondisclosure of classified information. c. Notwithstanding provis ion listed in paragraph (a), a nondisclosure or confidentiality policy form or agreement that is to be executed by a person connected with the conduct of an intelligence or intelligence -related activity, other than an employee or officer of the United States Government, may contain provisions appropriate to the particular activity for which such document is to be used. Such form or agreement shall, at a minimum, require that the person will not disclose any classified information received in the course of such activity unless specifically authorized to do so by the United States Government. Such nondisclosure or confidentiality forms shall also make it clear that they do not bar disclosures to Congress, or to an authorized official of an executive agency or the Department of Justice, that are essential to reporting a substantial violation of law. 66 12. Notice Regarding Eligible/Ineligible Activities Eligible activities under this program include those which describe and promote the understanding of scientific and technical aspects of specific energy technologies, but not those which encourage or support political activities such as the collection and dissemination of information related to potential, planned or pending legislation. 13.

The Unit ed States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission also makes a number of resources available at https://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/publications/index.cfm to ensure that employees may perform their work without hindrance. Graduate students and post -doctoral researchers are understood to have a dual role as both trainees and employees, in accordance with 2 CFR 200.400 (f). 14. Prohibition on Lobbying Activity By accepting funds under this award, you agree that none of the funds obligated on the award shall be expended, directly or indirectly, to influence congressional action on any legislation or appropriation matters pending before Congress, other than to communicate to Members of Congress as describe d in 18 USC 1913. This restriction is in addition to those prescribed elsewhere in statute and regulation. 15. Proprietary Application Information Patentable ideas, trade secrets, proprietary or confidential commercial or financial information, disclosure of which may harm the applicant, should be included in an application only when such information is necessary to convey an understanding of the proposed project. The use and disclosure of such data may be restricted, provided the applicant includes the following legend on the first page of any document included in the application that contains such proprietary information and specifies the pages of the document which are to be restricted: \"The data contained in pages _____ of this document have been submitted in confidence and contain trade secrets or proprietary information, and such data shall be used or disclosed only for evaluation purposes, provided that if this applicant receives an award as a result of or in connection with the submission of this application, DOE shall have the right to use or disclose the data herein to the extent provided in the award.

Rights in Technical Data 68 Normally, the government has unlimited rights in technical data created under a DOE agreement, including the right to distribute to the public . Delivery or third party licensing of proprietary software or data developed solely at private expense ( \"Limited Rights Data \") will not normally be required except as specifically negotiated in a particular agreement to satisfy DOE 's own needs or to insur e the commercialization of technology developed under a DOE agreement. If software is specified for delivery to DOE, or if other special circumstances exist, e.g., DOE specifying \" open -source \" treatment of software, then the DOE Contracting O fficer, afte r negotiation with the recipient, may include in the award special provisions requiring the recipient to obtain written approval of the DOE C ontracting O fficer prior to asserting copyright in the software, modifying the retained Government license, and/or otherwise altering the copyright provisions. 20. Subaward and Executive Reporting Additional administrative requirements necessary for DOE grants and cooperative agreements to comply with the Federal Funding and Transparency Act of 2006 (FFATA) are cont ained in 2 CFR 170. (See: Prime must register with the new FSRS database at https://www.fsrs.gov and report the required data on their first tier subrecipients. Prime awardees must report the executive compensation for their own executives as part of their registration profile in SAM. 21. Title to Subject Inventions Ownership of subject inventions is governed pursuant to the authorities listed below: Nonprofit organizations or small business firms : Under the Bayh- Dole Act (35 U.S.C. \u00a7 200 et seq.), nonprofit organizations or small business firms as defined by 35 U.S.C. 201 may elect to retain title to their subject inventions. All other parties : The federal Non -Nuclear Energy Act of 1974, 42. U.S.C. 5908, provides that the government obtains title to new inventions unless a waiver is granted (see below). Patent Waiver : DOE has issued Class Patent Waiver W(C) 2022 -01 which allows domestic large businesses providing at least 20% cost share to elect to retain title to their subject inventions. Class Patent Waiver W(C) 2022 -01 includes a U.S. Competitiveness provision requiring any products embodying or produced through the use of a subject invention first created or reduced to practice in the performance of work under this FOA to be substantially manufactured in the United States. A domestic large business is any for -profit entity that does not qualify a s a \"small business \" and is incorporated (or otherwise formed) under the laws of a particular state or territory of the United States and is not owned, controlled, or influenced by a foreign government, agency, firm, corporation, or person. Applicants may request a waiver of all or any part of the rights of the United States in inventions conceived or first actually reduced to practice in performance of an agreement as a result of this FOA, in advance of or within 30 days after the effective date of the aw ard. Even if such advance waiver is not requested or the request is denied, the recipient will have a continuing right under the award to request a waiver of the rights of the United States in identified inventions, i.e., individual inventions conceived or first actually reduced to practice in performance of 69 the award. Any patent waiver that may be granted is subject to certain terms and conditions in 10 CFR 784. For more information, see -counsel -technology- transf -1 . Nonprofit organizations and small business firms do not need a pate nt waiver in order to retain title to their subject inventions (see above). Determination of Exceptional Circumstances (DEC) : On June 07, 2021, DOE approved a DETERMINATION OF EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES (DEC) UNDER THE BAYH- DOLE ACT TO FURTHER PROMOTE DOMESTIC MANUFACTURE OF DOE SCIENCE AND ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES. In accordance with this DEC, all awards, including sub- awards, under this FOA shall include the U.S. Competitiveness Provision in accordance with Sectio n 22 of this FOA. A copy of the DEC can be found at https://www.energy.gov/gc/determination- exceptional -circumstances -decs. Pursuant to 37 CFR \u00a7 401.4, any nonprofit organization or small business firm as defined by 35 U.S.C. 201 affected by any DEC has the right to appeal it by providing written notice to DOE within 30 working days from the time it receives a copy of the determination. DOE may issue and publish on the website above further DECs prior to the issuance of awards under this FOA. DOE may require additional submissions or requirements as author ized by any applicable DEC. [IF APPLICABLE] DEC : QUANTUM INFORMATION SCIENCE TECHNOLOGIES DEC: On August 28, 2020, DOE approved a DETERMINATION OF EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER THE BAYH- DOLE ACT FOR QUANTUM INFORMATION SCIENCE TECHNOLOGIES , pursuant to 37 CFR 401.3(a)(2), which applies to agreements issued under this FOA requiring each applicant to agree to a U.S. Competitiveness Provision. DOE has determined that exceptional circumstances exist that warrant the modification of the standard patent rights clause for small businesses and non- profit awardees under the Bayh- Dole Act, 35 U.S.C. 200 et seq., to the extent necessary to ensure that DOE \" obtains sufficient rights in the federally supported inventions to meet the needs of [DOE] \" and \" to promote the commercialization and public availability of inventions made in the United States by United States industry and labor \" and/or further promote other purposes of the Bayh -Dole Act. 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 200. In accordance with this DEC, all awards, including sub- award s, under this FOA shall include the U.S. Competitiveness Provision in accordance with Section VIII of this FOA . A copy of the DEC can be found at https://www.energy.gov/gc/determination- exceptional -circumstances -decs. [IF APPLICABLE] Class Patent Waiver : DOE has issued Class Patent Waiver No. W(C) 2020- 001 of Patent Rights Related to Quantum Information Science and its Technology Appli cations that applies to this FOA for any domestic large business that is a recipient, or subrecipient at any tier to this FOA and is providing at least 20% cost share. Under this Class Patent Waiver, domestic large businesses may elect title to their subje ct inventions similar to the right provided to the domestic small businesses, educational institutions, and nonprofits by law. In order to avail itself of the class patent waiver, a domestic large business must agree that any products embodying or produced through the use of a subject invention first created or reduced to practice under this program will be substantially manufactured in the United States. Entities not eligible under the Class Patent Waiver are still able to petition DOE for rights under an 70 Advanced or Identified Patent Waiver as described above. Nonprofit organizations and small business firms do not need a patent waiver in order to retain title to their subject inventions (see above). 22. U.S. Competitiveness A primary objective of DOE 's multi- billion dollar research, development and demonstration investments is to cultivate new research and development ecosystems, manufacturing capabilities, and supply chains for and by U.S. industry and labor. Therefore, in exchange for receiving t axpayer dollars to support an applicant 's project, the applicant must agree to a U.S. Competitiveness provision requiring to any products embodying any subject invention or produced through the use of any subject invention will be manufactured substantiall y in the United States unless the Recipient can show to the satisfaction of DOE that it is not commercially feasible. Award terms, including the U.S. Competitiveness Provision, are available at https://www.energy.gov/gc/standard- intellectual- property- ip-provisions -financial -assistance - awards . Please note that a subject invention is any invention conceived or first actually reduced in performan ce of work under an award. An invention is any invention or discovery which is or may be patentable. The recipient includes any awardee, recipient, sub- awardee, or sub -recipient. As noted in the U.S. Competitiveness Provision, if an entity cannot meet the requirements of the U.S. Competitiveness Provision, the entity may request a modification or waiver of the U.S. Competitiveness Provision. For example, the entity may propose modifying the language of the U.S. Competitiveness Provision in order to change the scope of the requirements or to provide more specifics on the application of the requirements for a particular technology. As another example, the entity may request that the U.S. Competitiveness Provision be waived in lieu of a net benefits statement or U.S. manufacturing plan. The statement or plan would contain specific and enforceable commitments that would be beneficial to the U.S. economy and competitiveness. Examples of such commitments could include manufacturing specific products in the U.S., m aking a specific investment in a new or existing U.S. manufacturing facility, keeping certain activities based in the U.S. or supporting a certain number of jobs in the U.S. related to the technology. DOE may, in its sole discretion, determine that the proposed modification or waiver promotes commercialization and provides sufficient U.S. economic benefits, and grant the request. If granted, DOE will modify the award terms and conditions for the requesting entity accordingly. More information and guidance on the waiver and modification request process can be found in the DOE Financial Assistance Letter on this topic, available here at information on DOE 's Commitment to Domestic Manufacturing for DOE -funded R&D is available at https://www.energy.gov/gc/us -manufacturing . The U.S. Competitiveness Provision is implemented by DOE pursuant to a Determination of Exceptional Circumstances (DEC) under the Bayh -Dole Act and DOE Patent Waivers. See Section 21 . 71 D.

Acquisition costs for software includes those development costs capitalized in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Ancillary charges, such as taxes, duty, protective in transit insurance, freight, and installation may be included in or excluded from the acquisition cost in accordance with the non-Federal entity 's regular accounting practices. Administrative requirements Administrative requirement s means the general business management practices that are common to the administration of all grants, such as financial accountability, reporting, equipment management, and retention of records. Advance payment Advance payment means a payment that a Federal awarding agency or pass- through entity makes by any appropriate payment mechanism, including a predetermined payment schedule, before the non-Federal entity disburses the funds for program purposes. Allocation Allocation means the process of assigning a cost, or a group of costs, to one or more cost objective(s), in reasonable proportion to the benefit provided or other equitable relationship. The process may entail assigning a cost(s) directly to a final cost objective or through one or more intermediate cost objectives.

Approved budget The approved budget for the Federal award summarizes the financial aspects of the project or program as approved during the Federal award process. It may include either the Federal and non -Federal share or only the Federal share, depending upon Federal awarding agency requir ements. It must be related to performance for program evaluation purposes whenever appropriate. See 2 CFR 200.308(a). Assurance Assurance means a certification by an applicant, normally included with the application or State plan, indicating that the entity is in compliance with, or that it will abide by, a particular requirement if awarded a Federal grant. 72 Authorized organizational representative Authorized organizational representative means the individual, named by the applicant organization, who is authorized to act for the applicant and to assume the obligations imposed by the Federal laws, regulations, requirements, and conditions that apply to grant applications or grant awards. Award Award means the provision of funds by DOE, based on an approved application and budget or progress report, to an organizational entity or an individual to carry out a project or activity. Award documents Award documents means the entirety of the documents describing the legal relationship between DOE and an awardee or recipient. The award documents include an Assistance Agreement and other documents which may be incorporated by reference or as attachments to the Assistance Agreement. The award documents are the official, legally binding document, signed (or the electronic equivalent of signature) by a Contracting Officer that: notifies the recipient of the award of a grant; contains or references all the terms and conditions of the grant and Federal funding limits and obligations; and, provides the documentary basis for recording the obligation of Federal funds in the DOE accounting system. Bayh -Dole Act Bayh -Dole Act means a law which encourages universities and researchers to develop their inventions into marketable products; formal citation is Section 6 of the Patent and Trademark Amendment of 1980, Pub. L 96-517 as amended . Budget Budget means the financial plan for the project or program that the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity approves during the Federal award process or in subsequent amendments to the Federal award.

Contracting Officer prior approval is required for a change in scope to be allowable under an award. Closeout Closeout means the process by which a Federal awarding agency determines that all applicable administrative actions and all required work under an award have been completed by the recipient and the Federal awarding agency. Competitive segment Competitive segment means the initial project period recommended for support or each extension of a project period resulting from a renewal award. 73 Conference (domestic or international) Conference (domestic or international) means a symposium, seminar, workshop, or any other organized and formal meeting, whether conducted face- to-face or via the Internet, where individuals assemble (or meet virtually) to exchange information and views or explore or clarify a defined subject, problem, or area of knowledge, whether or not a published report results from such meeting. Consortium or sub-award agreement Consortium or sub-award agreement means a formalized agreement whereby a research project is carried out by the awardee and one or more other organizations that are separate legal entities. Under the agreement, the awardee must perform a substantive role in the conduct of the planned research and not merely serve as a conduit of funds to another party or parties. These agreements typically involve a specific level of effort from the consortium organization 's PD/PI and a categorical breakdown of costs, such as personnel, supplies, and other allowable expenses, including F&A costs. The relationship between the recipient and the collaborating organizations is considered a sub- award relationship. Consultant Consultant means an individual who provides professional advice or services for a fee, but not as an employee of the engaging party. To prevent apparent or actual conflicts of interest, awardees and consultants must establish written guidelines indicating the conditions of payment of consulting fees. Consultants also include firms that provide professional advice or services. See 2 CFR 200.459. Continuation application/award Continuation application/award means a financial assistance request (in the form of an application or progress report) or resulting award for a subsequent budget period within a previously approved project period for which a recipient does not have to compete with other applicants. Contract Contract means a legal instrument by which a non-Federal entity purchases property or services needed to carry out the project or program under a Federal award. The term as used in this part does not include a legal instrument, even if the non-Federal entity considers it a contract, when the substance of the transaction meets the definition of a Federal award or sub-award (see 2 CFR 200.1 Subaward). Contractor Contractor means an entity that receives a contract as defined in 2 CFR 200.1 Contract. Contract ing (or Grants) Officer Contract ing (or Grants) Officer means a DOE official responsible for the business management aspects of grants and cooperative agreements, including review, negotiation, award, and administration, and for the interpretation of grants administration policies and provisions. COs and GOs are delegated the authority to obligate DOE to the expenditure of funds and permit changes to approved projects on behalf of DOE. Contract ing (or Grants Management) specialist Contract ing (or Grants Management) specialist means a DOE staff member who works with a Contract ing or Grants O fficer and is assigned the day-to-day management of a portfolio of grants and/or cooperative agreements. These activities include, but are not limited to, evaluating grant applications for administrative content and compliance with statutes, regulations, and guidelines; negotiating grants; providing consultation and technical assistance to recipients ; and administering grants after award. Cooperative agreement Cooperative agreement means a type of financial assistance used when there will be substantial Federal scientific or programmatic involvement. Substantial involvement means that, after award, scientific or program staff will assist, guide, coordinate, or participate in project activities. Cost principles Cost principles means the government -wide principles, 2 CFR 200 Subpart E (or, in the case of commercial organizations, the Federal Acquisition Regulation [48 CFR 31], or, in the case of hospitals, see Appendix IX to Part 200\u2014Hospital Cost Principles , Appendix E, \"Principles For Determining 74 Costs Applicable to Research and Development Under Grants and Contracts with Hospitals \"), on allowability and unallowability of costs under federally sponsored agreements. Cost sharing or matching Cost sharing or matching means the portion of project costs not paid by Federal funds (unless otherwise authorized by Federal statute). See also 2 CFR 200.306 Cost sharing or matching. Deadline Deadline means the published date and/or time that a grant application is to be submitted to the funding agency. Debarment and suspension Debarment and suspension means the actions taken by a debarring official in accordance with OMB guidance at 2 CFR 180, \"Non-procurement Debarment and Suspension, \" to exclude a person or organization from participating in grants and other non-procurement awards government -wide. If debarred or suspended, the person or organization may not receive financial assistance (under a grant, cooperat ive agreement, or sub-award, or contract under a grant) for a specified period of time. Debarments and suspensions carried out pursuant to 2 CFR 376 are distinct from post-award suspension action by an awarding agency. See 2 CFR 901 for DOE implementation. Direct costs Direct costs means costs that can be identified specifically with a particular sponsored project, an instructional activity, or any other institutional activity, or that can be directly assigned to such activities relatively easily with a high degree of accuracy. See 2 CFR 200.413. Disallowed costs Disallowed costs means those charges to a Federal award that the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity determines to be unallowable, in accordance with the applicable Federal statutes, regulations, or the terms and conditions of the Federal award. Domestic organization Domestic organization means a public (including a State or other governmental agency) or private non-profit or for-profit organization that is located in the United States or its territories, is subject to U.S. laws, and assumes legal and financial accountability for awarded funds and for the performance of the grant -supported activities. Effort Effort means the amount of time, usually expressed as a percentage of the total, which a faculty member or other employee spends on a sponsored project. No one is allowed to spend more than 100% total commitment on all academic activities, including grant -sponsored research, university -sponsored research, teaching, administration, advising and other contracted duties. Effort is indicated on the budget in units of person -months. Equipment Equipment means tangible personal property (including information technology systems) having a useful life of more than one year and a per-unit acquisition cost which equals or exceeds the lesser of the capitalization level established by the non-Federal entity for financial statement purposes, or $5,000. See also 2 CFR 200. 1 Capital assets, Computing devices, General purpose equipment, Information technology systems, Special purpose equipment, and Supplies. Expanded authorities Expanded authorities means authorization to recipients under certain research grant mechanisms which waives the requirement for prior agency approval for specified actions related to awards. Example: 90-day pre-award spending authority, no cost extensions for up to one additional year, and automatic carryover of unobligated funds from one budget period to the next. The expanded authorities are now contained in the standard terms and conditions for most research grants. Expiration date Expiration date means generally, the date signifying the end of the current project period, after which the recipient is not authorized to obligate grant funds. Facilities and administrative costs Facilities and administrative costs means costs that are incurred by a recipient for common or joint objectives and that, therefore, cannot be identified 75 specifically with a particular project or program. These costs also are known as indirect costs. Federal financial report Federal financial report means submitted on Standard Form (SF) 425, to indicate the status of awarded funds for the period covered. Frequency of reporting is specified in the Reporting Checklist provided as part of the award documents. Financial assistance Financial assistance means transfer by DOE of money or property to an eligible entity to support or stimulate a public purpose authorized by statute. Financial status report Financial status report means see Federal Financial Report. Foreign travel Foreign travel is meant to include travel outside of North America (Canada, Mexico, and the United States ) and U.S. territories and possessions (Guam, American Samoa, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands. A trip is considered foreign travel for all legs of the itinerary if the traveler does not return to his or her post prior to departure for a foreign destination. Costs for foreign travel may be restricted by the language of a Funding Opportunity Announcement. Funding opportunity announcement (FOA) Funding opportunity announcement (FOA) means A publicly available document by which a Federal Agency makes known its intentions to award discretionary grants or cooperative agreements, usually as a result of competition for funds. Funding opportunity announcements may be known as program announcements, requests for applications, notices of funding availability, solicitations, or other names depending on the Agency and type of program. Funding opportunity announcements can be found at www.Grants.gov . An FOA may also be known as a solicitation. Grant agreement Grant agreement means a legal instrument of financial assistance between a Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity and a non-Federal entity that, consistent with 31 USC 6302, 6304: (a) Is used to enter into a relationship the principal purpose of which is to transfer anything of value from the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity to the non-Federal entity to carry out a public purpose authorized by a law of the United States (see 31 USC 6101(3)); and not to acquire property or services for the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity 's direct benefit or use; (b) Is distinguished from a cooperative agreement in that it does not provide for substantial involvement between the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity and the non-Federal entity in carrying out the activity contemplated by the Federal award. (c) Does not include an agreement that provides only: (1) Direct United States Government cash assistance to an individual; (2) A subsidy; (3) A loan; (4) A loan guarantee; or (5) Insurance. Grant -supported project or activity Grant -supported project or activity means those activities specified or described in a grant application or in a subsequent submission that are approved by DOE for funding, regardless of whether Federal funding constitutes all or only a portion of the financial support necessary to carry them out. Grantee Grantee means the organization or individual awarded a grant or cooperative agreement by DOE that is responsible and accountable for the use of the funds provided and for the performance of the grant -supported project or activity. The grantee is the entire legal entity even if a particular component is designated in award documents. The grantee is legally responsible and accountable to DOE for the performance and financial aspects of the grant - supported project or activity. Also known as awardee or recipient. Grants.gov Grants.gov (https:// www. Grants.gov /) has been designated by the Office of 76 Management and Budget as the single access point for all grant programs offered by 26 Federal grant -making agencies. It provides a single interface for agencies to announce their grant opportunities and for all applicants to find and apply for those opportunities. Indirect costs (facilities & administrative) Indirect (F&A) costs means those costs incurred for a common or joint purpose benefitting more than one cost objective, and not readily assignable to the cost objectives specifically benefitted, without effort disproportionate to the results achieved. To facilitate equitable distribution of indirect expenses to the cost objectives served, it may be necessary to establish a number of pools of indirect (F&A) costs. Indirect (F&A) cost pools must be distributed to benefitted cost objectives on bases that will produce an equitable result in consideration of relative benefits derived. Institutional base salary Institutional base salary means the annual compensation paid by an organization for an employee 's appointment, whether that individual 's time is spent on research, teaching, patient care, or other activities. Base salary excludes any income that an individual may be permitted to earn outside of duties for the applicant/awardee organization. Base salary may not be increased as a result of replacing organizational salary funds with grant funds. Matching or cost sharing Matching or cost sharing means the value of third -party in-kind contributions and the portion of the costs of a federally assisted project or program not borne by the Federal government. Matching or cost sharing may be required by statute or program regulation. Costs used to satisfy matching or cost-sharing requirements are subject to the same policies governing allowability as other costs under the approved budget. Merit (or peer) review Merit (or peer) review means the process that involves the consistent application of standards and procedures that produce fair, equitable, and objective examinations of applications based on an evaluation of scientific or technical merit or other relevant aspects of the application. The review is performed by experts (reviewers) in the field of endeavor for which support is requested. Merit review is intended to provide guidance to the DOE individuals responsible for making award decisions. Monitoring Monitoring means a process whereby the programmatic and business management performance aspects of a grant are assessed by reviewing information gathered from various required reports, audits, site visits, and other sources. NEPA NEPA means the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), Public Law 91 - 190, as amended . NEPA requires Federal agencies to assess the environmental effects of proposed major Federal actions prior to making decisions. No-cost extension No-cost extension means an extension of time to a project period and/or budget period to complete the work of the grant under that period, without additional Federal funds or competition. Non-Federal share Non-Federal share means when cost sharing or matching is required as a condition of an award, the portion of allowable project/program costs not borne by the Federal government. Obligations Obligations when used in connection with a non-Federal entity 's utilization of funds under a Federal award, obligations means orders placed for property and services, contracts and sub-awards made, and similar transactions during a given period that require payment by the non-Federal entity during the same or a future period. OMB circulars OMB circulars means government -wide guidance issued to Heads of Federal agencies by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget . Other significant contributors Other significant contributors means individuals who have committed to contribute to the scientific development or execution of the project, but are not committing any specified measurable effort (i.e., person months) to the project. These individuals are typically presented at \"effort of zero person months \" or 77 \"as needed. \" Individuals with measurable effort may not be listed as Other Significant Contributors (OSCs). Consultants should be included if they meet this definition. Program participant Program participants are the recipients of service or training provided at a workshop, conference, seminar, symposium or other short -term instructional or information -sharing activity funded by an external grant or award, or the training beneficiaries of the project or program funded by an external grant or award. A participant is not involved in providing any deliverable to the recipient or a third party or would not be terminated or replaced for failure to perform. Participant support costs Participant support costs means direct costs for items such as stipends or subsistence allowances, travel allowances, and registration fees paid to or on behalf of participants or trainees (but not employees) in connection with conferences, or training projects. Person months Person months is the metric for expressing the effort (amount of time) PD/PI(s), faculty and other senior/key personnel devote to a specific project. The effort is based on the type of appointment of the individual with the organization; e.g., calendar year, academic year, and/or summer term; and the organization 's definition of such. For instance, some institutions define the academic year as a 9-month appointment while others define it as a 10-month appointment. Pre-application or pre- proposal Pre-application or pre-proposal means a brief outline or narrative of proposed work and sometimes budget, for informal review by a sponsor to determine whether an application should be submitted. Three predominant reasons for requiring submission of a preliminary pre-applica tion are: Reduce the applicant 's unnecessary effort in proposal preparation when the chance of success is very small. This is particularly true of exploratory initiatives where the community senses that a major new direction is being identified, or competitions that will result in a small number of actual awards. Increase the overall quality of the submission. Distill the number of applications that will be submitted to the agency and the number of anticipated reviewers needed to review. Pre-award costs Pre-award costs means any cost incurred prior to the beginning date of the project period or the initial budget period of a competitive segment (under a multi- year award), in anticipation of the award and at the applicant 's own risk, for otherwise allowable costs. Prior approval Prior approval means written approval from the designated Contracting Officer . Program Director/ Principal Investigator Program Director/ Principal Investigator means the individual(s) designated by the applicant organization to have the appropriate level of authority and responsibility to direct the project or program to be supported by the award. The applicant organization may designate multiple individuals as program directors/principal investigators (PD/PIs) who share the authority and responsibility for leading and directing the project, intellectually and logistically. When multiple PD/PIs are named, each is responsible and accountable to the applicant organization, or as appropriate, to a collaborating organization for the proper conduct of the project or program including the submission of all required reports. The presence of more than one PD/PI on an application or award diminishes neither the responsibility nor the accountability of any individual PD/PI. Program income Program income means gross income earned by the non-Federal entity that is directly generated by a supported activity or earned as a result of the Federal award during the period of performance except as provided in 2 CFR 200.307 paragraph (f). (See 2 CFR 200.1 Period of performance.) Program income 78 includes but is not limited to income from fees for services performed, the use or rental or real or personal property acquired under Federal awards, the sale of commodities or items fabricated under a Federal award, license fees and royalties on patents and copyrights, and principal and interest on loans made with Federal award funds. Interest earned on advances of Federal funds is not program income. Except as otherwise provided in Federal statutes, regulations, or the terms and conditions of the Federal award, program income does not include rebates, credits, discounts, and interest earned on any of them. See also 2 CFR 200.407 Prior written approval (prior approval). See also 35 USC 200- 212 \"Disposition of Rights in Educational Awards \" for inventions made under Federal awards. Program Manager Program Manager means the DOE official responsible for the programmatic, scientific, and/or technical aspects of a grant. The same role is filled by Program Directors, Program Officers, or Project Directors at other Federal agencies. Progress report Progress report means periodic, frequently annual, report submitted by the awardee and used by DOE to assess progress and to determine whether to provide funding for the budget period subsequent to that covered by the report. Project/performance site Project/ performance site means location(s) of where the work described in the research plan will be conducted. Project period Project period means the total time for which Federal support of a project has been programmatically approved as shown in the award documents; however, it does not constitute a commitment by the Federal government to fund the entire period. The total award period comprises the initial competitive segment, any subsequent competitive segments resulting from a renewal award(s), and extensions. Proposal See application. Re-budgeting Re-budgeting means reallocation of funds available for spending between approved budget categories to allow best use of funds to accomplish the project goals. Recipient Recipient means the organizational entity or individual receiving a grant or cooperative agreement. Renewal application Renewal application means an application requesting additional funding for a period subsequent to that provided by a current award. Renewal applications compete for funds with all other peer reviewed applications and must be developed as fully as though the applicant is applying for the first time. Research Research is defined as a systematic study directed toward fuller scientific knowledge or understanding of the subject studied. See 2 CFR 200.1 Research and Development (R&D). Research misconduct Research misconduct means fabrication, falsification, or plagiarism in proposing, performing, or reviewing research, or in reporting research results, but does not include honest error or differences of opinion.

The term includes such financial assistance when provided by any legal agreement (even if the agreement is called a contract) but does not include any form of assistance which is excluded from the definition of a grant, including the recipient 's procurement of property or services needed to carry out the project or program. The term includes consortium agreements. Subrecipient Subrecipient means a non-Federal entity that receives a subaward from a pass- through entity to carry out part of a Federal program; but does not include an individual that is a beneficiary of such program. A sub-recipient may also be a recipient of other Federal awards directly from a Federal awarding agency. Supplement Supplement means a request for an increase in support during a current budget period for expansion of the project 's scope or to meet increased costs unforeseen at the time of the new or renewal application. A supplement may increase support for future years in addition to the current year. Supplements require applications and are subject to administrative and merit review. Terms and conditions of award Terms and conditions of award means all legal requirements imposed on a grant by DOE, whether based on statute, regulation, policy, or other document referenced in the grant award, or specified by the grant award document itself.
