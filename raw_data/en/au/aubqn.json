Herbal formulas and herbal recommendations are used with the intent of restoring the body's natural energetics. Although many western herbs are widely used and marketed today, their use remains very similar to that of Western Pharmacology , a particular solo herb is used for a specific condition such as Echinacea for the immune system and Saw Palmetto for the prostate. Many of today's modern drugs originated from herbs; in labs the chemically active ingredients are isolated from the plant and reproduced. Frequently these ingredients are synthetically produced. The risk of adverse reaction is increased because of the concentrated, solitary nature of the product. Chinese herbal medicine follows a distinctively different approach. The multiple herbs used in formulas create a complex blend of constituents that work synergistically together to address the body's imbalance. In many patient cases herbal treatments are used in conjunction with Acupuncture to increase the effectiveness of the treatment plan. The blend of herbs used in formulas greatly enhances the therapeutic effect while at the same time reducing the risk of side effects. At Acupuncture Alternatives we use two approaches. Patent formulas are those that are dispensed in pill form and granular or custom formulas are those that are designed to be dissolved in hot water and consumed as teas. We utilize high quality manufacturers utilizing good manufacturing practices such as Evergreen Herbs and Kan Herb Company Chinese herbal formulas are safe and effective; they are backed by thousand of years of use and practical experience as well as extensive modern research.
