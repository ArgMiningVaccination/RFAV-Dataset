Keywords: Testosterone;Hydrocortisone;Sub-opti- malhealthstatus;Biologicalindicator INTRODUCTION Sub-optimal health status (SHS) has become a new challenge to public health in China. An intermediatestate between health and disease, SHS is mainly charac-terized by a general decline in health, non-specificweakness, and decreased energy. 1Manifesting as re- duced strength and a decline in function and adaptabil-ity, this syndrome does not meet any current diagnos-tic criteria for disease. According to the theories of Tra-ditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), the body's Yinand Yang,Qiand blood are in an unbalanced state but no pathological changes have yet developed in patientswith SHS.Previous studies on SHS have mainly focused on thedefinition of this concept, differentiating it from theviewpoint of TCM, associated risk factors, andTCM-type interventions; 2-5there are few studies of its biological indicators.6-9In this study, we investigated bi- ological indicators of SHS extensively with the aim ofidentifying an means of assessing SHS. 647JTCM|www.journaltcm.com October15,2013 |volume33 |Issue5|WangLM etal./ClinicalStudy METHODS Subjects Both the research protocol and written informed con-sent forms were reviewed and approved by the EthicsCommittee of Beijing University of Chinese Medicineprior to initiation of this study. From October 2009 toMay 2010, we conducted a cross-sectional study onsub-optimal health. We distributed a syndromes ques-tionnaire 10to the following six medical/physical Hospital (Beijing,China), Shaanxi Hanzhong People's Hospital (Han-zhong, Shaanxi, China), affiliated hospital of JilinChangchun University of TCM (Changchun, Jilin,China), Jiangsu Zhenjiang People's Hospital (Zhenji-ang, Jiangsu, China), Second People's Hospital ofShenzhen city of Guangdong province (Shenzhen,Guangdong, China), and the Huangshi Aikang Hospi-tal (Huangshi, Hubei, China). From about 10 000 sub-jects who were attending for medical check-ups, wegenerated a random sample of 407 by using theRAND function of Excel. Of this sample, 365 were ingood health and 42 had SHS according to the criteriadescribed below. Dataandcollection We set the following uniform standards for diagnosinga SHS: (a) malaise and poor work performance lastingfor more than three months; and (b) no major identifi-able diseases or mental illnesses. The inclusion criteriawere: (a) age range 18-49 years; (b) syndromes comply-ing with the above two diagnostic criteria; and (c) hav-ing given written informed consent. The exclusion cri-teria were: (a) pregnancy, lactation or planning to bepregnant; (b) metabolic syndrome; (c) incomplete datacollection.We collected 15 mL of fasting venous blood from eachparticipant: 8 mL with heparin The serum and plasma were sep-arated and placed in a refrigerator at 80until mea- surement.Reagents used for blood tests included radio-immunereagents produced by Beijing Kemei Dongya pur-chased from Beijing, fortesting included a Hitachi 7080 automatic biochemis-try analyzer (Tokyo, Japan) and a DFM-96 type ra- dio-immunity counter (Nanjing Medical University,China). and performed statistical analysis with SPSS 13.0 (SPSSChina Software Shanghai Limited Company, Shang-hai, China). We used Student t-test for variables with a normal distribution and a non-parametric test (Wilcox-on test) for variables that were not normally distribut-ed. For all tests, we set the significance level at P<0.05. Data are expressed as means \u00b1 standard deviation ( SD). RESULTS Distributionofsexandhealthstatusinstudy subjectsOf the 407 subjects, 226 were men and 181 women. Of the men, 29 were healthy and 197 had SHS; of thewomen, 13 were healthy and 168 had SHS. Biologicalindicators As shown in Table 1, the mean T and CD3+ differedsignificantly between the two groups ( P<0.01,t-test), the mean T concentration in the healthy group beingfar higher than that in the SHS group and the meanCD3 + concentration in the SHS group being higherthan that in the healthy group.Because the distribution of the T/C ratio was skewed,we performed a non-parametric test, which showed asignificant difference between the two groups(Z=-2.683, P=0.007<0.01), the mean T/C ratio being significantly higher in the healthy group (42 cases,Mean=1.5009, Median=1.5808) than in the SHSgroup (364 cases, Mean=1.0456, Median=0.8109). Biologicalindicatorsinmen As shown in Table 2, mean CD3+ and T concentra- tions differed significantly between healthy men andthose with SHS groups (P<0.05, t-test), the mean T concentration in healthy men being higher than that inmen with SHS and the mean CD3+ concentration be-ing lower in healthy men than in those with SHS.Consistent with the results above, the non-parametrictesting confirmed that the results of CD3+ and T con-centrations differed significantly between healthy menand those with SHS (P<0.05, Table 3). Biologicalindicatorsinwomen As shown in Table 4, the mean CD3+ concentration in healthy women differed significantly from that in thosewith SHS (P<0.05), being lower in the former than inthe latter.As the distribution of both T concentration and T/Cratio were skewed, non-parametric testing was per-formed; this showed no significant differences in thesevariables between the two groups (P>0.05, Table 5). DISCUSSION SHS is caused by physical dysfunction in the nervous,endocrine, and immune systems induced by mental, 648WangLM etal./ClinicalStudy JTCM|www.journaltcm.com October15,2013 |Volume33 |Issue5|physical, and social factors.11We have observed that, in most subjects with SHS, repeated physical discomfort and poor work performance are attributable to over-work. Assessment of biological indicators related to thenervous, endocrine, and immune systems in individu-als with SHS may, to some extent, help to clarify themechanisms underlying this condition.The hormone testosterone promotes protein synthesisand the ability of the immune system to resist infec-tion, strengthens muscle, stimulates red cell productionthrough increasing erythropoietin concentrations, en-hances sexual function. Generally speaking, serum Tconcentrations vary very little when the body is func-tioning well, but decline when it is in bad condition,such as in a state of fatigue. In comparison with the ac-celeration of anabolism induced by T in vivo , C acceler- ates catabolism, and maintains the normal glucose me-tabolism and relative stability of blood glucose concen-trations. However, excessive C can cause negative emo-tions, such as those experienced with increasing psycho-logical stress, and suppress the immune system. There-fore, the level of T and C concentrations are the mostsensitive indicators of SHS status currently avail-able. 12-14In addition, the T/C ratio can help clarify the state of balance between anabolism and catabolism(building up and breaking down). When this ratio ishigh, anabolic processes are dominant, whereas when itis low, catabolism becomes predominant, which meansthat the organism is in an ongoing consumption-domi-nated status and cannot readily recover from fatigue. Inour study, the mean T concentration and T/C ratio inthe healthy group were significantly higher than inthose with SHS, which indicates an imbalance betweenanabolism and catabolism in those with SHS. Thesefindings confirm with previously study by Xu et al. 16 That the body is in a state in which catabolism pre-dominates is reflected by symptoms such as fatigue, dif-ficulty in recovering from fatigue and poor adaptabili- ty. In men, the mean serum T concentration in the SHS group was significantly lower than that in subjects,aP<0.001. Group T (ng/dL) CD3+ (ng/mL)Health October15,2013 |Volume33 |Issue5|healthy group. Among women, the mean serum T did not differ significantly between the two groups becausethe concentration of serum T is higher in men than inwomen.The level of CD3+ and T concentrations differed sig-nificantly between healthy male subjects and thosewith male SHS, whereas mean CD3 + concentrations were significantly higher in those with female SHSgroup than in healthy female subjects. These findingsindicate that the immune system functions abnormallyin both male and female with SHS.In conclusion, changes in biological indicators relatedto the nervous, endocrine, and immune systems in sub-jects with SHS may shed light on the physiological ba-sis for the symptoms described above. The T/C ratiowas significantly decreased in subjects with SHS,which implies that changes in this ratio T/C are associ-ated with SHS. Thus, decreased serum T/C ratiomight be helpful for the objective evaluation of SHS.This study suggests that SHS could be objectively eval-uated by laboratory indicators (decreased serum T/Cratio), clinical symptoms and signs, and using our re-ported SHSQ-50 questionnaire with good reliabilityand validity. 17 Xiaohong Li, Shaoxian Xin Peng, Liqian Zhou, MinghuaBai, and Guangren Peng for their contributions to col-lection of clinical data.
