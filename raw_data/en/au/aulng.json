Introduction Ayurveda, a formof TraditionalIndian Medicine (TIM), lit- lifespan\" [ 1]. Ayu- rveda is a Whole System of Medicine (WMS) [ 2-5]. In its South Asian countries of origin it has been practiced formore than 2000 years in an unbroken tradition and is thus one of the oldest WMS of mankind [ 6]. Ayurveda is fully recognized by the World Health Organization (WHO) as amedical science analogous to Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and has amassed an enormous wealth of empirical healingknowledge.(Proto)scientificconceptshavehadafirm place in mainstream Ayurvedic medicine ever since aroundthebeginningofthecommonerawiththeemergenceofthe\"classic texts\" (e.g., Caraka Samhita [ 7,8]) and are centered around designated disciplines of logic and methodology[9]. In India and some neighboring countries, Ayurvedic medicine is officially and legally recognized as on par withc o n v e n t i o n a lm e d i c i n e .I ti su s e di na na r e aw i t hm o r et h a n1.4 billion people as a broad system of medicine [ 10,11]. The importance of Ayurveda in modern South Asian healthcare setups is reflected by the following figures: in Indiaaloneabove400,000registeredAyurvedicphysicianspracticeAyurveda [ 12] and there are more than 250 universities and colleges where Ayurvedic medicine is systematically taughtas a 4-6-year university degree program [ 13]. In its diagno- stic and therapeutic approaches Ayurveda is steeped in theprinciplesofsalutogenesis[ 14]Primary,secondary,andterti- ary prevention, patient self-empowerment, and self-efficacyplay crucial roles in the holistic and multidimensional Ayu-rvedic approach to healing [ 15]. Ayurveda not only is a WMS but also incorporates eclectic philosophies of life that have helped to shape complex theories about health 2 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine and disease over more than three millennia, including philosophical,epistemological,andspiritualdimensions.Forexample, Ayurveda postulates a paradigmatic harmony ofphysiological, psychological, social, and environmental fac-tors of the human microcosm and the universal macrocosm[16,17]. InadditiontoitskeyroleinAsianhealthcaresystems,it isplayingagrowingroleinComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine(CAM),especiallyinintegrativesettingsinEuropeand North America. For instance, in Germany, Austria,and Switzerland Ayurveda is one of the fastest growingCAMmethods[ 18].Aninternetsearchfor\"Ayurveda\"yields >7 , 4 0 0 , 0 0 0e n t r i e si nG o o g l e[ 19]. In 2011 the establishment of the German Medical Doctors Association of AyurvedicMedicine (D \u00a8AGAM) took place [ 20]. In several training institutions throughout Germany professional developmentand training opportunities certified by various state-levelGerman Medical Doctors' Associations are being offered(e.g.,inBavaria,Berlin,NorthRhine-Westphalia,Schleswig-Holstein, Hessen, Hamburg, and Rhineland-Palatinate). YetthereisnonationalcertificateforAyurveda.ImportantareasofdiscussionsurroundingthecharacterofAyurvedainclude(a)itsunderlyingcoreconceptsfordiagnosisandtherapy,(b)ultimate therapeutic aims, and (c) demarcation from otherSouthAsiantraditionalmedicalsystems(e.g.,Siddha,Unani- Tibb) and modern western medicine and remain largely unanswered [ 17]. Inquiries regarding the importance of reli- gionandspiritualitywithinmedicalcontextshavebeenposedrepeatedly in Indology, Sociology, Anthropology, ReligiousStudies, and Medical Sciences [ 18,21,22]. Whole Medical Systems (WMS) are by definition complete and coherent systemsofmedicaltheoryandpracticethathaveevolvedandcontinue evolving, in different regions, cultures, and timeperiods around the globe. They have evolved relatively inde-pendent of modern western medicine, for example, Tradi-tionalEuropeanMedicine(anthroposophy,homeopathy,andnaturopathy),TraditionalChineseMedicine(TCM),TibetanMedicine,orArabiansystemsofmedicine[ 23-29]. ConcerningAyurveda,twomainopposingpositionscan be observed: [ 16] (a) supporters of \"scientific\" Ayurveda state that it has always been an empirical medical system inwhich religious and spiritual speculations are mere interpo-lations,alien to the system, or(b) supporters of\"traditional\"Ayurveda state that religious and spiritual elements havealways been integral components of Ayurveda as a WMS.Thesepositionsare,however ,notmutuallyexclusive. There is growing acceptance and demand for Ayurveda in western countriesand there are currentlymorethan 2500online publications on Ayurvedic therapies in PubMed [ 30] andgreaterthan52,000referencedAyurvedaresearcharticlesin the Indian digital database DHARA (Digital Helpline forAyurveda Research Articles) [ 31]. It is hypothesized that spiritualitymightbeamainattractorfortheincreasingpop-ularityofAyurveda[ 32];however,thereisstilllittlescientific evidence regarding the influence of religious and spiritual elements on the diffusion and implementation of modernhybridformsofAyurveda[ 33-35]. This is striking because spirituality has already entered discussions in neurobiology [ 36] and most of all qualityof life (QoL) research [ 37], especially in chronic diseases [38-44]. However, cultural and spiritual attractors of non- western CAM have been discussed in recent years [ 45,46] and are beginning to be researched [ 47,48]. The rather late awareness of spiritual aspects in CAM might be due tot h ei m p a c tt h a tt h em e t h o d o l o g yo fE v i d e n c e - b a s e dM e d i - cine (EbM) had on the medical system as such and in particularonresearchinitiativesinCAM.Morerecently,afterCAM research has managed to close some evidence gaps,researchers have become aware of the necessity to conductresearch focused not only on specific evidence but also onunspecific or contextual or patient-centred aspects (relatedtoCAM)[ 49-52].ThisisbynomeansinoppositiontoEbM becauseoneofitsfoundersdefinedEbMastheintegrationof(a) the research evidence with (b) clinical expertise and(c)patientvalues[ 53].However,clinicalresearchhadfocused predominantlyonthetwoformeraspectsuntilrecently. In order to explore the general role of religion and spi- ritualityspecificallywithinthefieldofAyurveda,anewque-stionnaire was developed. While existing questionnaires,for example, the Spiritual Perspective Scale [ 54,55], the S-PRIT [56], the FACIT-Sp [ 57], the Spiritual Scale Aspects of Spirituality [ 59], the SpREUK [ 60], the Health and Religious Congruency Scale [ 61]a n do t h e r s [62-68] would be useful for further analysis, the objective of this pilot survey was to focus on the specificities of thec o m p l e xfi e l do fA y u r v e d ai naw e s t e r ns e t t i n g ,l e a v i n gt h edefinition of spirituality as open as possible. Spirituality andreligion were thereby not used as analytical but as emic(ethno)categories[ 69-71].Thisquestionnairewasdistributed amongpatientsaccessingandtherapistsofferingAyurvedain German-speakingcountries. 1.1.Hypothesis. To shed some light on the influence and mea- ning of religious and spiritual aspects on the diffusion andimplementation of Ayurvedic practices in Europe the follo-winghypotheseswereformulatedtothesurveyapriori. (i)Hypothesis 1. Participants who apply Ayurveda as a therapist or receive Ayurveda as a therapy are reli-giousand/orspiritual.Ayurvedaisperceivedasahea-lthcare approach which incorporates religious andspiritualdemands. (ii)Hypothesis 2. For patients and therapists, principles of Ayurveda and modern science are not in conflict.Concepts of religion, spirituality, and science can beintegrated. (iii)Hypothesis 3. Elements from South Asian cultures, religions, and philosophies are supposed to have aneffectontheresultsofAyurvedictherapies. (iv)Hypothesis 4. Women are moreopen to religiousand spiritual aspects in the case of Ayurvedic therapistsandpatientsthanmen. 2. Methods 2.1.Survey.

To be included participants had to be 18 years of age. Patient participants had to have had 1 experience with Ayurvedic therapies and therapist participants had to havehadatleastonecourseofinstitutionalizedAyurvedictrainingand had to offer Ayurvedic therapies or have a plan to do soatthetimeofinclusion(detailsabouttheindividualtrainingdurationwerenotfurtherassessed). Patientswereexcludediftheysufferedfromalifethreat- ening disease, in order to avoid systematic bias/confoundersduetoa\"lastexitmentality\"whichcaninfluencetheoverall compliance with respect to their choice of therapies and therapists. The survey with anonymized questionnaires, part of a master thesis for the corresponding author, was performedat the Institute for Indology and Tibetology, PhilosophicalFaculty, University of G \u00a8ottingen, Germany. Of note this is not a clinical study, and according to university procedurestherefore no ethical approval was mandatory and informedconsent, anonymized questionnaires, and respect of dataprivacyweresufficient. 2.2. Construction of the Questionnaire. Firstly, a preliminary questionnaire considering content validity, internal consis-tency,criterionvalidity,constructvalidity,andreproducibil-itywasdeveloped[ 72]. The items for the preliminary questionnaire version were derived from three sources: (1) exploratory interviewswith expert representatives, (2) as discussed in the researchliterature, and (3) items inspired by existing questionnairesi nt h efi e l d( e . g . ,\" A s p e c t so fS p i r i t u a l i t y , \"s e ea b o v e ) .Th i spreliminary version of the questionnaire was pretested with10 test persons accustomed to filling out questionnaires, togaininformationonreliabilityandvalidityaspects.Theques-tionnaire was then modified based on the received feedbacka n dr e e x a m i n e d .I tw a st h e nm o d i fi e da n da p p r o v e db yexpert representatives and scholars from various disciplines(Medicine, Indology, Religious Sciences, Informatics, andSociology). This resulted in a final version of the question-n a i r et ob ed i s t r i b u t e dt ot h et a r g e tg r o u pi ni t sfi n a l i z e dversion. Therefore the underlying questionnaire might beregarded as a \"standard\" questionnaire in the sense of Olsen[73]. A validated questionnaire in the traditional sense was not possible, since we could not compare this instrument againstagoldstandard,assuchagoldstandardforAyurveda as a Whole Medical System this context does not yet exist[58]. The final version of the questionnaire included a section for sociodemographic baseline data and 50 questionnaireitems.Themajorityoftheitemsarescoredona5-pointLikertscalerangingfrom\"total\"disagreementto\"total\"agreement(0-4)orona3-pointLikertscale(i.e.,\"yes,\"\"no,\"and\"donot know\").Inordertoobviatetheproblemofacquiescencebias, wedesignedascalewithbalancedkeying(anequalnumberofp o s i t i v ea n dn e g a t i v es t a t e m e n t s ) ,w h i l ep o s s i b l ed i s t o r t i o n s through central tendency and social desirability are more difficulttocontrol. 2.3. Statistics and Validation. All returned questionnaires underwent statistical analysis. For descriptive statistics eachitem was analyzed separately and in some cases item responsesweresummedtocreateascoreforagroupofitems. Thefrequenciesofthevariousvariableswerecalculated.Dif-ferences in frequency distributions were tested with the 2- Test. Principal Component Analyses with Varimax Rotation and Kaiser Normalization were used to represent the mainstructural features of the multivariate data set by a smallernumber of attributes. This is achieved by transforming data from the original coordinate system (i.e., spanned by the original attributes) into a different coordinate system where the variables are linearly independent. The factor loading, astandardized scoring coefficient, was used to determine thecontributionofavariabletoaparticularfactor.Variableswithrotatedabsolutefactorvalues>0.5(or<0.5)foraparticular factorwereconsideredsignificantcontributorsforthatfactor(seeTable 3. The 12 variables are replaced by 4 factors: for example,thevariables\"Ayurveda=Spirituality?,\"\"Ayurveda=Philosophical system?,\" and \"Ayurveda = Way of life?\" have rotated absolute factor values >0.5 for factor 1, which expresses a strong correlation between these variables; allothervariableshavefactorvalues 0.5or0.5withrespect to factor 1; therefore they do not significantly contribute tothis factor). Negative rotated absolute factor values expressinversecorrelations.Weused10ormoretestpersonsperitemin connection with multivariate analyses. Ten test personsper 1 item is a well-known rule of thumb for the number ofinstances(datasets)inconnectionwithknowledgediscoveryprocesses, that is, multivariate analyses. Based on reliabilityanalyses inner consistencies and discriminatory power weretested. A significance level of<0.05 was taken as a basis. Calculationswere performedwith NCSS (version 2007)andSPSS(version19). The validation of questionnaires in general is based on methods of the classical test theory and factor analyses forthedesignofquestionnaireitems.Factoranalysiswasoneofthecentralmethodsfortheevaluationofthisquestionnaire. It serves for the grouping of parameters and for the partial validation of this questionnaire. The a priori allocation ofdifferent subject areas was tested by factor analyses.

Follow-ing the sociodemographic background, the results of thequestionnaire will be summarized in order of the respectivehypotheses.Parts of the results are presented as pooled data from patientsandtherapistswhereverthereisnosignificantdiffe-rencebetweenthetwogroups. 3.1.BaselineData Sociodemographic. Among the participants of the survey a significant difference in sociodemographic data was onlyfound for profession but not for age, gender, education, income,orlocation( Table 1). Other. Four survey participants (all patients) had only 1 experience with Ayurveda at the time of the interview.Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine 5 Table2:CharacterizationofAyurvedabytherapistsandpatients.

Traditional Christian values and beliefs are confirmed (e.g., 77% believe in God), but in addition a majority alsobelieveinnon-Christianconcepts(karma66%,rebirth64%,and transmigration of the soul 58%).

Three\"groupsofbelievers\"canbedelineated:(1)agroup, whose members simultaneously believe in karma, nirvana,a universal soul, transmigration of the soul, and rebirth; (2)a group with a statistical relation between believing in thegod, the devil, and angels; and (3) a group, characterizedby simultaneous beliefs in a metaphysical sense of life andgod(s). The most prominent aspects of traditional Christian spirituality and of South Asian spirituality derived from thisdata are (1) belief in God (Bonferroni adjusted value (adj.

Discussion Themetapostulateofthisworkwasconfirmedthatindividual sociocultural backgrounds, especially religious and spiritualones,ofAyurvedictherapistsandpatientsinfluenceattitudesandexpectationsregardingAyurvedichealthcare.Statisticalrelationshipsbetweenindividualreligiousandspiritualback-groundsandindividualdecisionstoofferoraccessAyurvedicservicesareclearlyshown. Astatisticallysignificantlargerfractionofwomeninboth groups is noticeable. Both therapists and patients also sharean above average education. Results support the thesis thatAyurveda is being used by a predominantly well-educated,urban,andfemaleclientele[ 76-78].Differenceswithrespect to income between groups suggest that hybrid forms ofAyurveda in the West are part of a \"luxury\" medicine;theirusageispredominantlyreservedforpeoplewithhigherincomes(see Table 1)[79]. ThissurveyinvestigatestheperceptionofAyurvedafrom a convenience sample of therapists and patients of predom-inantly western backgrounds. Therefore, it cannot define Ayurvedainanyabsolutetermnordoesitattempttocompare contemporary with \"classic\" Ayurvedic perspectives. Nev-ertheless the results of this survey point to a conceptionof Ayurveda as Whole Medical System, which also impactsthe implementation of Ayurveda, particularly regarding thepatient-doctorrelationship[ 80,81]. Individualformsofspiritualityandreligionseemtoplay a key role in the perception and definition of Ayurvedafor patients and therapists. In our population adherers ofAyurveda have a tendency to have a special affinity forBuddhism, Hinduism, and South Asian culture in general.Christian religions (e.g., Protestant or Catholic churches)seemtoplayalessintegralroleinthepracticeandperceptionofAyurveda,while\"traditional\"religiousbeliefs(e.g.,abelief in god, angels, and the devil) can be grouped together withSouthAsianreligiousbeliefsforamajorityoftherespondents(notably a belief in god, angels, and the devil can alsobe included in several South Asian belief systems as morerecenttextsincludesuchconcepts).Spiritualityandreligious aspects appear to be central in individual conceptions of salutogenesis [ 82,83] and within the Ayurvedic therapeu- tic paradigm [ 84]. Thereby spirituality, not religion, is the preferred self-categorization within the field of Ayurveda.The results pose the question whether individual referencesto traditional Christian values might have become weakerdue to a loss of confidence in established western religiousinstitutions [ 85,86]. These values may thus be substituted or supplemented by the individually composed syncretisticrealitiesofpatientsandtherapistsusingorofferingAyurveda(e.g., combining god, karma, and nirvana), whose religiousandspiritualimpulsescontinuetoguidethem[ 87]. While both therapists and patients are engaged with religiousandspiritualquestionsandareopentotheseissues,therapistsseemtodealevenmorewithreligiousandspiritualmatters than their patients. Beyond pure somatic healthcareservices, adherents of Ayurveda expect the therapist to alsofunction as a spiritual/psychological caregiver. As a resultoftrainingandpatientexpectations,theAyurvedictherapistalso frequently engages in functions (within an Ayurvedictreatment) that are also characterized by religious and spir-itual elements, for example, mantra recitation, performingrituals,meditation,prayers,andsoforth[ 88]. O u rd a t as u p p o r tt h eh y p o t h e s i st h a te l e m e n t sf r o m SouthAsianculture,religion,andphilosophyseemtoplayan importantroleforAyurvedicpatientsandtherapists.Ahighlevel of \"authenticity\" and \"authentic therapy\" is expectedfrom the therapists and therapies. It is notable that not onlytherapists but also patients seem to be quite well versed inSouth Asian culture, religion, and philosophy. This suggestst h a tt h ec h o i c ef o rA y u r v e d am i g h tg oh a n di nh a n dw i t hafundamental affinity to South Asian culture and worldview[89]. For Ayurvedic patients and therapists, spirituality, reli- gion, and principles of modern science are not in conflict.For them, Ayurveda contains aspects of spirituality, religion,a n ds c i e n c ea tt h es a m et i m e .W h i l es p i r i t u a l i t yi ss e e na savery important aspect, which also influences the daily life oftherapists and patients, the medical dimension of Ayurvedais still seen as the most important one and does not excludethe simultaneous use of modern medicine for the majority.ThecompositionofAyurvediccharacteristicsthatisexpectedfrom the majority of those participants could be interpretedas a curiosity for novel things and at the same time asan expression of uncertainty and discontent with prevailingstructures. Frustration with modern medicine is less impor-tant in the decision to use Ayurveda than, for example, theinclusion of the spiritual dimension. An \"enchantment of the world,\" a concept often mentioned in CAM contexts, is supposed to help overcome the separation of matter, mind,andsoul.Nexttoscientificknowledge,spiritualitystandsonequal footing. Religion in a classical sense seems to take abackseatinfavourofspirituality.However,thisistoacertain8 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine degreeatenuouspositionbasedonthefactoranalysesrelated tothesecondhypothesisofthiswork. In our survey Ayurveda is used\u2014as is CAM in general in the western world\u2014by a well-educated, middle class, andfemaledominatedclientele[ 90,91].WomenaccessAyurveda more often than men among the surveyed participants, and w o m e na p p e a rt ob em o r eo p e nt or e l i g i o u sa n ds p i r i t u a l matters [26]. Almost all characteristics related to religiosity and spiritual attitudes are more prominently representedamongwomeninourdataset[ 92]. Ayurveda patients and therapists seem to be more open to CAM, especially nonwestern CAM methods, but thisdoes not exclude the simultaneous use of modern westernmedicine for the majority of respondents. Moreover, Ayu-rveda may be compensating for deficits in the field ofpsychosocial healthcare logistics [ 93,94]. In this concep- tion the Ayurvedic therapist does more than simply treatsomatic disorders. Ayurvedic concepts are based on anthro-pologic/cosmological assumptions which include differentlevels of human existence in both diagnostic and therapeu-tic healing approaches. As a result, therapist-patient rela-tionships focused on the individual's unique experienceand promoting trust and confidential discussion of spiritualmattersinthetherapeuticencounterareaccommodatedandindeedcultivated. Thereareseverallimitationsofthiswork.Thisstudywas informed by a small sample size rather than a large scaleinquiry; thus various nonspecific effects, for example, theinhomogeneoussettings,mayhavecontributedtotheanswerpatterns and thus may have significantly biased the results. Further a statistically significant larger fraction of women in both groups is noticeable (which however also refle-cts the field). Moreover, the partial reporting of the resultsas pooled data from patients and therapists may bias thepicture depending on potentially different attitudes andknowledge about Ayurveda via patients versus therapists.The fact that 15% of patients are also trained as Ayurvedictherapistsisafurtherlimitationandapotentialsourceofbias.Anotherissue may be thatthe potentialsimultaneoususe ofother CAM methods was not assessed by the questionnaire.Another minor limitation is the fact that some of the useditems may have had influencing or directing effects due totheir wording or an intentional open phrasing. It is alsoimportanttokeepinmindwhileinterpretingtheresultsthatthisnotarepresentativepopulationsamplebutasamplethatwaslikelytobepronetoAyurveda,whichofcourseisanotherlimitationofthisstudy. To summarize, key questions regarding the character, essence,complexity,andcontextualizationofAyurvedainitsoriginal and hybrid forms remain largely unanswered. Thefollowing questions yet to be answered seem to be of highexigency. (a) What is Ayurveda in general and can a cleardefinition of it be given independently of western or Indiancontexts?(b)WhatarethereasonsforchoosingAyurvedaout of a range of different methods of CAM and is the choice for Ayurveda specific or random? (c) What exactly does\"spirituality\" mean for therapists and patients in the caseof Ayurveda? Overall, normative questions about whetherAyurveda is a science or religion or spirituality seem to bedeceptive.Itmightalsobehelpfultomoveawayfromasking whether and to what extent Ayurveda acts in this contexta n dt oi n s t e a df o c u sm o r eo nw h ya n dh o wi tf u n c t i o n si nassociationwithscience,religion,andspirituality.Letuskeepinmindthattheseconceptsarenotnaturalentities.Religion,spirituality, and science are modern western concepts and have a strong potential to export normative and ideological items into what are primarily nonwestern contexts [ 17,95- 97]. LookingatAyurvedaasawholemedicalsystemincluding physical, psychological, medical, and spiritual elements, aswell as a philosophy and a way of life, may challenge thedifferentiation,compartmentalization,andrationalizationofmodern societies [ 98-100], while leading to a better under- standingofAyurvedaasanexpressionofandcomplementto\"modernwesternmedicine.\" Given the complexity of the topic and the exploratory nature of the survey, larger surveys with fully validated que-stionnaires, preceding qualitative phases, and refined hypo-theses are warranted to support the results of this first pilotsurvey.
