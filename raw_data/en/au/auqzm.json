Management is ai med at shortening the course of the disease and restoring the comfort of the patient. We performed a meta-analysis to investigate whether treatment with the Pelargonium sidoides extract EPs 7630 reduces the use of antipyretic comedication (i.e., acetami nophen) in children suffering from ATP. Methods Studies were identi ed from clinical trial registries and medical literature. Randomized, placebo-controlled, clinical trials investigating EPs 7630 in children with ATPand reporting the coadministration of paracetamol were eligible. Based on the raw data ofeligible trials, we analyzed cumulative paracetamol use, as well as the ability to attendschool at the end of treatment. Three trials including a total of 345 children aged 6 to10 years and suffering from non- -hemolytic streptococcal ATP were identi ed and eligible. Children were administered EPs 7630 or placebo for 6 days. Results Compared with placebo, EPs 7630 reduce d the cumulative paracetamol dose by an average of 449 mg (95% con dence interval [CI]: of 19.1% (EPs 7630) and 71.5% (placebo) of children were still unable to attend schoolat the end of the treatment (risk ratio \u00bc0.28; 95% CI: 0.16 -0.48; p<0.001). Conclusion Our meta-analysis EPs 7630 reduced the use of antipyretic comedication and accelerated recovery. received March 11, 2020accepted after revision July 8, 2020 published onlineJanuary 14, 2021DOI https://doi.org/ 10.1055/s-0040-1722205.ISSN 1305-7707.\u00a9 2021.

In all other cases, only symptomatic treatment is recommended.6,7 Symptomatic treatment is aimed at relieving the symptom burden caused by ATP and includes analgesia, hydration, andrest. Mainly motivated by improving the child 'so v e r a l lc o m - fort, analgesic drugs, such as paracetamol (acetaminophen), are widely used. 8In addition to analgesia, paracetamol also has an antipyretic effect, although ATP is usually not associated with fever in a range requiring antipyretic treatment. Fever has been shown to inhibit the replication of viruses and to exert a stimulating effect on the patient 's immune system. Conse- quently, antipyresis may even prolong the duration of infec-tious diseases. 8-12Moreover, paracetamol has been linked with a risk of certain rare but potentially harmful side effects and unintentional overdose in children.13-15 Pelargonium sidoides extract EPs 7630 of the product Umckaloabo\u00ae, ISO-Arznei- mittel, Ettlingen, Germany) is a herbal preparation from theroots of P. sidoides and used in adults and in children from the age of 1 year for the treatment of respiratory tract infections in several countries in Europe, Central and South America, Asia,and Australia. EPs 7630 was shown to support the immune response of the organism by a stimulation of the release of tumor necrosis factor- and nitric oxides, the stimulation of interferon- , and an increase in natural killer cell activity. 16-19 In vitro and in vivo EPs 7630 and several of its isolated constituents demonstrated an antiviral activity by interferingwith the replication of several seasonal in fluenza A virus strains, respiratory syncytial virus, human coronavirus, para- influenza virus, and coxsackievirus, 20,21while direct antipy- retic effects have not been reported for EPs 7630. A comprehensive presentation of the pharmacological proper- ties of EPs 7630 has been published elsewhere.22In randomized, placebo-controlled, clinical trials per- formed in children and adults, EPs 7630 was ef cacious in acute respiratory tract infections including ATP.22-30Ar e - view of the safety and tolerability based on more than 8,000 patients exposed to EPs 7630 shows the favorable safetyprole of this herbal preparation. 31 As the avoidance of unwanted and mostly unnecessary antipyresis is an important clinical advantage, particularly inchildren suffering from ATP, EPs 7630 may be an interesting therapeutic option. We report on a meta-analysis performed to investigate whether symptomatic treatment of childrensuffering from ATP with EPs 7630 may reduce the coadmin- istration of paracetamol, an issue which has not been sub- jected to an in-depth analysis so far. Moreover, we alsoassessed whether EPs 7630 administration is associated with faster recovery of the children 's ability to attend school. Materials and Methods We performed a meta-analysis of double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, clinical trials investigating treatment with EPs 7630 in children with ATP. EPs 7630 is an extract from the roots of P. sidoides , drug-extract ratio \u00bc1:8-10, extraction solvent \u00bcethanol 11% (w/w), which is available as a liquid solution with a recommended dose of 3 /C210 drops/d for children aged 1 to 5 years, 3 /C220 drops/d for children aged 6 to 12 years, and 3/C230 drops/d for adults and adolescents over 12 years. Alm-coated tablet formulation for adolescents over 12 years, as well as adults, and a syrup formulation for children aged 1 to 12 years are also available but were not used in any of the identi ed ATP studies. Study selection criteria, as well as the statistical methods, were de ned prospectively. Eligible studies had to investigate the use of EPs 7630 in children with ATP while allowing the concomitant use of paracetamol whose administered amount had to be reported. No other restrictions were applied. Search terms included the combination of \"EPs (ISRCTN; ClinTrials.gov) and literature databases (MEDLINE; EMBASE) and completed in April 2017. Titles, abstracts, and keywords were considered in the search. Outcome measures of interest were the investigational treatment administered, paracetamol consumption, and in- ability to attend school due to ATP. For a basic characterizationof the trial populations, we also extracted patient age and sex. The meta-analysis included all clinical trials meeting the eligibility criteria above without further restrictions. Analy-ses were based on the individual patient data of the eligible trials which were provided by the study sponsor. All analyses were performed based on the ef cacy analysis datasets of the eligible trials. Sample characteristics were analyzed using descriptive statistics. For the cumulative dose of paracetamol, a meta-analysis was performed by com-puting the difference between the mean values of the treat- ment groups and the associated 95% con dence intervals (CIs) in the original scale. Since the eligible trials used identical Journal of Pediatric Infectious Diseases Vol. 16 No. 3/2021 \u00a9 2021. The Author(s).Influence of EPs 7630 on Antipyretic ATP Seifert et al. 123 prescriptions for paracetamol dosing, cumulative paracetamol use could be analyzed on the original scale instead of using astandardized but more abstract effect size measure. Moreover, we determined the percentage of children who were unable to attend school at the end of thescheduled treatment period andperformed a meta-analysis based on risk ratios and their 95% CIs. The I 2statistic and a 2test were used for assessing heterogeneity between trials. Pooled meta-analysis estimateswere obtained by using random effect models in case of I 2>5%, andxed effect models otherwise. For all meta-analyses, Review Manager Version 5.2 software was used.32Treatment differences were considered descriptively signi cant if the 95% CI of the point estimate did not include the value of 0 for differences between means or the value of 1 for risk ratios,corresponding to a descriptive, two-sided p-value of /C200.05. The cumulative paracetamol dose of patients withdrawn from the trial prematurely was calculated for the periodbetween the start of the investigational treatment and the date of withdrawal. The ability to attend school was assessed based on the last valid information. Results The results of our database search are shown in Fig. 1 . Searches in MEDLINE, EMBASE, as well as in the ISRCTN and ClinicalTrials.gov registries, produced a total of 14 records. Oneadditional review was identi ed which mentioned studies with EPs 7630 in ATP even though it did not match our search terms. Four matches were duplicates and therefore excluded.Furthermore, eight records, which had been retrieved because sore throat or tonsillopharyngitis mentioned in the title or in the abstract, were excluded during screening, based on furtherinformation extracted from the data source: one excluded record referred to an ongoing trial and reported no results, three excluded records were publications of clinical trials with EPs 7630 in indications other than ATP (i.e., acute bronchitis, the common cold) and in a different study population(adults), 33-35two were review articles which did not add new studies beyond those which we had already identi- ed,22,29one excluded record referred to a conference paper of a safety review of EPs 7630 and did not report results on paracetamol use,36and one excluded record was a brief report from a press conference.37The remaining three trials met our eligibility criteria also after full-text review and were therefore included into our meta-analysis.38-40 The three trials that met our eligibility criteria were per- formed in Ukraine according to similar protocols and included a total of 173 children treated with EPs 7630 and 172 treated with placebo. All trials included girls and boys aged 6 to10years with ATP signs and symptoms persisting for /C2048 hours. Moreover, eligible children had to have a negative rapid antigen-detection test for -hemolytic streptococci, as well as a total score of /C218p o i n t so na ve-item tonsillopharyngitis symptom scale (TSS; severity assessment of the symptoms dysphagia, sore throat, salivation, redness, and fever on a4-point scale; total score range: 0 -15 points) in trials A and C, or /C216 points on a 7-item TSS (severity assessment of the symptoms dysphagia, sore throat, salivation, redness,coating left, coating right, and fever on a 4-point scale; total score range: 0 -21 points) in trial B. In all three trials, fever was scored as <37.5\u00b0C \u00bc0, The other symptoms were assessed by the following categories: not present \u00bc0, mild \u00bc1, moderate \u00bc2, and severe \u00bc3. Duration of treatment as scheduled was 6 days in all included trials. Other main characteristics of thetrials are shown in Table 1 . In case of fever /C2138.5\u00b0C, the concomitant administration of paracetamol suppositories was allowed on days 0 through 4 after the start of randomized treatment in all three trials, up to a maximum daily dose of 3 /C2500 mg. All administered doses had to be documented. Any other concomitant medication with potential impact on the study outcomes and/or on the course of ATP (e.g., antibiotic treatment) was not allowed. Basic demographic data of the patients is shown in Table 2 . All children except 1 were between 6 and 9 years old and with negligible mean value differences between thetreatment groups. All clinical trials were performed according to an adaptive, group-sequential design. On the level of all individual studiesincluded into the analysis, bias was controlled by requiring the inclusion of consecutive patients who were eligible and for whom informed consent could be obtained, by random-ized treatment assignment, and by blinding of the study drugs (including blinded outcome assessments). We asked the manufacturer for data of all randomized, placebo-con-trolled, clinical trials conducted to investigate the adminis- tration of EPs 7630 to children suffering from ATP. Since our search included both published and unpublished clinicaltrials conducted in the indication and population of interest, a publication bias can be excluded. Moreover, as all clinical trials reported data on our prede ned outcome measures, no Fig. 1 Selection of clinical trials for meta-analysis.

In trials A38and C,40the prede ned primary outcome measure was the change of the TSS total score betweenbaseline and treatment day 4. The children treated with EPs 7630 in trial A showed a decrease in the TSS total score by 7.1/C62.1 points compared with 2.5 /C63.6 points in children treated with placebo (95% CI for mean value difference: 3.3 - 5.7 points favoring EPs 7630). In trial C, the TSS total score (mean /C6standard deviation) decreased by 6.7 /C62.7 and 3.3/C64.2 points for EPs 7630 and placebo, respectively, with a 95% CI for the mean value difference ranging from 2.0 to 5.2 points favoring EPs 7630. The primary outcomemeasure of trial B 39was the percentage of children present- ing with a TSS /C204 points at day 4 of randomized treatment. This criterion was met by 40 (90%) participants in the EPs7630 group and by 38 (44.7%) participants in the placebo group ( p<0.001; Fisher 's exact test). The main meta-analysis results of cumulative paraceta- mol use during participation in the clinical trials are shown in Fig. 2 . Although the mean cumulative dose of paracet- amol ranged between 425 and 1,623 mg for EPs 7630 and between 724 and 2,043 mg for placebo, the treatmenteffects observed in the analyzed trials were homogeneous (I2\u00bc0.0%; p\u00bc0.59). As compared with placebo, cumulative consumption of paracetamol in the EPs 7630 group was reduced by 449 mg (95% CI: 252 -646 mg; p<0.001), with individual study mean values ranging between reductions of 299 and 558 mg corresponding to reductions by 41% of thecumulative amount in the placebo group in trials B and C and by 21% in trial A where the absolute cumulative dose of paracetamol was the highest. Fig. 3 shows that the number of children unable to attend school at treatment end (identi ed as \"events \")w a s signicantly higher for placebo as compared with EPs 7630 for all three studies included into the meta-analysis. In the pooled dataset, the event rates observed were 19.1% (33/173 patients) and 71.5% (123/172 patients) for treatment withEPs 7630 and placebo, respectively, and a meta-analysis risk ratio of 0.28 (95% CI: this meta-analysis moderateto substantial heterogeneity between the results of the trials.41Fig. 3 shows, however, that heterogeneity was attributable to between-trial differ- ences in the magnitude, not by direction of the treatmentTable 1 Main characteristics of eligible trials Trial: Author (year) Duration of treatment (daily dose)Primary efficacy outcome measureNumber of patientsa EPs 7630 Placebo days (3 /C220 drops) TSS (5 items): difference between baseline and day 473 70 B: Timen et al (2015)396 days (day 1 -2: 20 hourly while awake; day 3 -6: 3/C220 drops)Response: TSS (7 items) /C204 at day 38 C: Berezhnoi et al (2016)406 days (3 /C220 drops) TSS (5 items): difference between baseline and day 64 Abbreviation: TSS, tonsillopharyngitis symptom score. aPrimary ef cacy analysis dataset (full-analysis set).

Moreover, signi cant advantages of EPs 7630 over placebo were also observed for each individual clinical trial. Discussion The avoidance of mostly unnecessary antipyresis is an im- portant clinical objective in the treatment of viral acute respiratory infections, particularly in children. The presentmeta-analysis aimed at investigating whether symptomatic treatment with EPs 7630 may reduce coadministration of paracetamol in children with ATP, an issue which has notbeen subject to an in-depth analysis so far. The present meta-analysis included all double-blind, ran- domized, placebo-controlled, clinical trials in which theadministration of EPs 7630 to children suffering from ATP was investigated and which were published by the end of November 2018. ATP is a commonly used term for acutepharyngitis with simultaneously affected tonsils (acute ton- sillitis), 42whereas it should be noted that the current Classi cation of Disease-10th Revision (ICD- 10) acute pharyngitis and acute ton- sillitis as separate diagnostic categories. By presenting a deeper insight into results from clinical trials investigatingtreatment with EPs 7630 in children with ATP, this meta- analysis adds to the evidence from previously published systematic reviews which included studies in several acute respiratory tract infections. 22,28,29,43The present results of pooled data from ATP trials only demonstrate that EPs 7630reduces paracetamol use in children suffering from ATP and additionally show that the use of EPs 7630, in the indication ATP, signi cantly reduces the percentage of children still unable to go to school after a week 's treatment. The results of our meta-analysis are therefore in line with those of a meta- analysis reported earlier, in which data of 523 children fromsix randomized, placebo-controlled trials investigating EPs 7630 in ATP (three trials) or acute bronchitis (three trials) were analyzed with regard to paracetamol use. 43However,as the six trials included in this former meta-analysis used different prescriptions for paracetamol dosing and, there-fore, size effects could not be excluded, the authors had to use a standardized effect size measure for the analysis. In the present investigation, all eligible trials used identical pre-scriptions for paracetamol dosing and, therefore, cumulative paracetamol use could be analyzed in the original scale, which is a more tangible effect size measure. Moreover,the present results refer exclusively to ATP and, in this way, add to medical knowledge in this disease. In all studies included into our meta-analysis, additional intake of paracetamol was allowed in case of fever /C2138.5\u00b0C. Fever is a closely regulated increase in body temperature that has evolved as an adaptive host response to infection. 8,9,12In vitro experiments suggest that fever plays a key role in reducing the virulence and increasing the clearance of micro- organisms, as well as in stimulating the immune response bysupporting the activation and proliferation of lympho- cytes, 9,12by enhancing the phagocytic potential of dendritic cells, and by augmenting interferon- production in response to viral infection.11There is no indication shown in clinical trials that antipyretic treatment may reduce the duration of a febrile disease,10and there is no evidence that children with fever are at an increased risk of adverse outcomes.8 Since EPs 7630 has no known direct antipyretic effect, the fact that the cumulative paracetamol dose was systematically lower in the EPs 7630 group than in the placebo group indicates that children treated with the herbal product wereless febrile, not as a result of the antipyretic treatment but because of a more favorable course of the infection. The results suggest that the clinical picture of the children was improvedby treatment with EPs 7630 in such a way that parents administered their children paracetamol less frequently and that the children were able to return to school earlier. The interpretation is consistent with preclinical data regarding the assumed mechanism of action of EPs 7630; in vitro and in vivo experiments showed that the extract Fig. 2 Cumulative use of paracetamol (mg).

Journal of Pediatric Infectious Diseas es Vol. 16 No. 3/2021 \u00a9 2021. The EPs 7630 in ATP Seifert et al. 126 activates the host immune response through the release of tumor necrosis factor- and nitric oxides, the stimulation of interferon- , and an increase in natural killer cell activi- ty.16-19A therapeutic effect is achieved by preventing viruses released from host cells after one life cycle from entering newhost cells for the next life cycle. 21In addition to its antiviral activity, EPs 7630 also has an antibacterial effect, for exam- ple, by inhibiting the adhesion of GAS to human epithelialcells. 44-46It can therefore be concluded that children bene t- ted from treatment with EPs 7630 toward a more favorable course of the disease because of its pharmacological mode ofaction, such as alleviation of symptoms of cytokine-induced sickness behavior, and antiviral activity as shown in vivo. 21,47 These results clearly demonstrate the bene cial effects of treatment with EPs 7630, especially in children with ATP and the resulting reduction in paracetamol use. This in turn leads to a reduction of the risk of rare but potentially harmful sideeffects and unintentional overdose in children. This interpretation is also in accordance with the observa- tion from the single trials that children exposed to EPs 7630recovered from ATP-associated symptoms more rapidly. A methodological weakness of our study may lie in the comparatively small number of patients available for meta-analysis. It is mentionable, however, that the sample size of each clinical trial had been planned according to statistical considerations and proved to be suf cient for demonstrating the superiority of the herbal extract over placebo for the prede ned primary outcome measure. Especially in a vul- nerable patient population, such as children, it can alsohardly be justi ed from an ethical point of view to include more patients into a placebo-controlled, clinical trial than the minimum number required to provide an acceptablestatistical power for achieving the primary trial endpoint. Conclusion Our results demonstrate that children treated with EPs 7630for non-GAS ATP required less paracetamol comedication and were able to return to school earlier than those exposed to placebo. These results thus support and extend ndings from randomized, placebo-controlled trials which con rm that EPs 7630 reduces the severity and duration of ATP-associated symptoms in a pediatric population. Considering the observedreduction in paracetamol use on one hand and the earlier return to school on the other hand, our results can be inter- preted in a way that, under EPs 7630 treatment, children wereless febrile, not as a result of antipyretic treatment but because of a more favorable course of their infection.
