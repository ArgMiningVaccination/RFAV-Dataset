Our practice serves patients from around the country, primarily focused in La Jolla, San Diego, North County, Orange County, and Los Angeles. Why choose Integrative Medicine? Nutritional, environmental and functional medicine can treat many common problems that traditional medicine doesn't have answers for, as well as treat difficult-to-diagnose issues. [Learn more about conditions we treat >](/conditions-and-diagnosis) [Fatigue & Tiredness](/conditions-diagnosis/fatigue/chronic-fatigue-and-adrenal-fatigue) Identifying the cause of chronic fatigue is often a challenge in medicine. If obvious medical conditions like heart disease, diabetes, autoimmune conditions are ruled out, most physicians assume fatigue is a symptom of depression. But in the majority of medical visits where fatigue is the main complaint, an underlying cause can be identified using the concepts of Integrative Medicine. [Allergies, Toxins & Environmental Medicine](/treatments/allergy-environmental-medicine) Included in the practice of Environmental Medicine are assessment and treatment for allergies to foods, molds, dust, pollen and other airborne materials. It also includes identification of any symptoms caused by exposure to chemicals found in our environment, as well as heavy metals like lead and mercury. A great number of common medical problems ranging from fatigue to autoimmune disease can be successfully assessed and treated using the principles of Environmental Medicine. [Cognitive Issues & Optimal Brain Health](/bredesen-protocol-for-cognitive-impairment) Through Integrative Medicine, we focus on not just treating symptoms, but improving and optimizing function and quality of life. Conditions such as depression and anxiety, ADD, cognitive dysfunction (MCI), dementia including Alzheimer's disease (Bredesen Protocol), as well as generalized feelings of poor health, all can respond very positively to our approach. [Hormonal Imbalances](/bio-identical-hormones) Hormones function as a symphony and control almost all bodily functions. They need to work in harmony to deliver vibrant health and slow the aging process. As we age, many people experience fatigue, weight gain, mood changes and aging skin from lower testosterone, DHEA, estrogen, progesterone, growth hormone or thyroid. As these hormones go lower, cortisol - the main chronic stress hormone - can go higher, contributing to weight gain and increasing the risk for diabetes, heart disease and cancer. [Digestive problems and gut and microbiome health](/blog/2016/4/4/the-microbiome-and-the-leaky-gut-how-to-take-control-of-your-gut-and-your-health) The founder of western medicine, Hippocrates, knew that optimizing gut health is the key to overall well-being. I have certainly seen in my patients that repairing gut problems has enormous benefits. Symptoms from irritable bowel disease, GERD and reflux disorders, intestinal permeability issues (leaky gut) gluten intolerance from grain exposure (wheat, rye, barley) and inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis) are often resolved with an Integrative Medicine approach.
