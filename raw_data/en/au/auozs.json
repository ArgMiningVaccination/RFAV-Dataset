ART allows you to neutralize triggers and rehearse success in the virtual reality of your mind. - PAIN REPROCESSING THERAPY Many forms of chronic pain are not caused by physical or structural problems in the body but by the misfiring of pain circuits in the brain. Pain Reprocessing therapy is a mind-body therapy for disrupting the pain-fear cycle and retraining the brain to feel safe. - ECOTHERAPY/OUTDOOR THERAPY Discover surprising insights and inspired solutions while practicing mindfulness in nature and being grounded in your body.

A whole-health approach to mental health and wellness. I provide integrative therapy for anxiety, trauma, and chronic pain based on mind-body healing techniques and a whole-health approach to wellness. Let's awaken your Inner Hero and mobilize your MindBody & Soul! Cognitive behavior therapy, schema therapy, and mindfulness-based approaches are available to support your cognitive health. We will explore your thoughts, beliefs, and the quality of awareness you bring to situations. You will learn to challenge negative thought patterns, let go of false beliefs and internalized voices, and build healthy attitudes and cognitive flexibility. Accelerated Resolution Therapy and SoulCollage\u00ae are additional tools in your mental health toolbox for supporting cognitive change at the level of images, metaphors, and stories. I also offer Pain Reprocessing Therapy for treating neuroplastic pain by rewiring the neural pathways involved in the pain-fear cycle. Neuroplastic pain is caused by the brain. This is why we target the brain and not the body. Your body and emotions are highly sensitive detectors of wellness and dis-ease. I incorporate somatic mindfulness practices and motivational coaching to support you in creating and sustaining habits that are aligned with your values and conducive to the health of your MindBodySoul. We will explore mindfulness, grounding, Emotional Freedom Technique, and many other \"bottom-up\" approaches for supporting your physical and emotional health, including nature connection and ecotherapy. Accelerated Resolution Therapy also helps process and resolve troubling emotions and sensations stored in the body related to stress and trauma. A soul-centered approach to healing invites you to examine that which sparks joy, meaning, and creative expression. We will dive into topics of passion, play, and purpose. We will pay special attention to your dreams and creative stirrings. We will explore the soul-tending practices of working with breakage and repair and coming to know \"survival as a creative act.\" I invite an array of expressive arts into the therapeutic adventure for getting to know your inner wisdom and authentic inner voice. Discover your unique resilience and resourcefulness via SoulCollage\u00ae, expressive writing, dreamwork, and more. Ready to set up a FREE 30 minute discovery call to see if therapy is right for you? We will talk about your goals, and I can help you decide if I'm the right fit for you. "}
