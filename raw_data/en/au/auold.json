Following the fire that destroyed the first Goetheanum building in Dornach, Switzerland, Steiner had focused his efforts on rebuilding and reorganizing the Anthroposophical Society. But he also continued to travel and speak to the public - in Prague, Vienna and Basel - to explain the purpose of the Goetheanum and to elucidate the broader aims of his spiritual work. These lectures, including a semi-public series in Dornach, are gathered here and published in English for the first time, together with an introduction, notes and index. In describing the development of Anthroposophy, Steiner illumined the philosophies that lie at its roots. He speaks of Madame H. P. Blavatsky, of the anti-Christian forces in the world, and of the 'homeless' souls who seek a spiritual scientific understanding of the world and humanity. The History and Conditions of the Anthroposophical Movement in Relation to the Anthroposophical Society An Encouragement for Self-Examination This course of lectures was given at a pivotal point in the development of the anthroposophic movement. Just months before, an act of arson had caused the destruction of the first Goetheanum, and its darkened ruins appeared to reflect the fragmentations within the Anthroposophical Society. Divisions were appearing amongst members and friends, with individual energies increasingly routed to external initiatives and practical projects. It became apparent that a new impetus was needed.

(From the first 'Leading Thought'.) \"We are firmly in our understanding of things of the spirit only when we do not rest content with abstract spiritual concepts and a capacity to express them theoretically, but instead grow into a sure belief that higher beings are present with us in a community of spirit when we engage in spiritual study. No external measures can bring about anthroposophical community-building. You have to call it forth from the profoundest depths of human consciousness.\" \u2014Rudolf Steiner [THE CHRISTMAS CONFERENCE FOR THE FOUNDATION OF THE GENERAL ANTHROPOSOPHICAL SOCIETY 1923/24](viewbook.php?isbn_in=9780880101936) The complete proceedings of the Founding Meeting as well as Rudolf Steiner's description of the structure and organisation of the new Society.

On this day I will think a lot of all the beautiful things which were, and are contained in our work together, and which now always stand so beautifully before my inner eye when I describe them. Let me assure you that I write this description with love.' - Rudolf Steiner to Marie Steiner, 13 March 1925 From the time of the Foundation Meeting of the Anthroposophical Society (Dornach, Christmas to the New Year, 1923-24) until his death shortly before Easter 1925, Rudolf Steiner wrote a weekly letter addressed to the members of the Anthroposophical Society. The letters were printed in the members' supplement to the Goetheanum Weekly and in its English edition, Anthroposophical Movement.

Known as 'the Representative of Humanity', this sculpture shows a central, free-standing Christ holding a balance between the beings of Lucifer and Ahriman, who represent polar tendencies of expansion and contraction. On New Year's Eve 1922 the Goetheanum was destroyed by fire, but the model - still in a process of creation and therefore housed in an external studio - miraculously escaped the flames. It remains intact to this day in the second Goetheanum, where it can be viewed by the public.
