O. Tuesday, January 25, 7PM - A Zoom Presentation |Motivated by our fall program on Biodynamics and Beyond, the late Dr. David Gershan was working on the development of a talk for our January Branch Meeting. He had already begun developing this as a joint presentation with Harold Hoven.| We are pleased to be able to honor David by hosting Harold, and additionally, Patricia Reber as his medical colleague, in a presentation inspired by David and Harold's initial discussions together, and their impulse to show the connection between biodynamic insight and medical insight. The lowly dandelion is often despised, but it is in fact a very powerful healing plant. Through careful observation we learn to understand why Rudolf Steiner chose this plant to be used as a soil balancing compost preparation and as a remedy for a number of human conditions.

In 1983 he moved to Fair Oaks, CA, where he joined Raphael Association, a therapeutic center, to grow medicinal herbs that were subsequently used to make anthroposophic medicine at Raphael Pharmacy. From that time came a strong bond between the healing arts and Biodynamics. Later, Raphael Garden moved onto the campus of Rudolf Steiner College. There Harald built up an exemplary diversified biodynamic farm, training apprentices and teaching Biodynamics. From the beginning on, he made all biodynamic preparations in conjunction with the Biodynamic Association of Northern California. Now, after the closing of RSC, Harald consults and teaches Biodynamics at home and internationally.
