Get started on the path to health! Founded upon a holistic philosophy, naturopathic medicine combines safe and effective traditional therapies with the most current advances in modern medicine. Naturopathic medicine is appropriate for the management of a broad range of health conditions affecting all people of all ages. The mission of Hillsboro Naturopathic Clinic is to free people from disorders and predispositions to illness by diagnosis and correction of underlying causes of diseases. Homeopathic medicine is a natural pharmaceutical science that uses various plants, minerals or animals in very small dose to stimulate the sick person's natural defenses. The medicines are individually chosen for their ability to cause in overdose the similar symptoms the person is experiencing. \"Homoios\" in Greek means similar and \"pathos\" means disease or suffering. Since one's symptoms are actually efforts of the organism to reestablish homeostasis or balance, it is logical to seek a substance that would, in overdose, cause the similar symptoms the person is experiencing. The medicines, thus, go with , rather than against, the person's natural defenses. In essence, homeopathy is composed of two highly systematic methods: toxicology and case taking. First, homeopaths find out the specific physical, emotional, and mental symptoms that various substances cause in overdose. Homeopathic texts have more detail on toxicology than any other source. Second, the homeopaths interview their patients in great detail to discover the totality of physical, emotional and mental symptoms the person is experiencing. The homeopath seeks to find a substance that would cause the similar symptoms the person has and then gives it in small, specially prepared dose. Homeopaths, like many modern physiologists, recognize that symptoms represent the best efforts of the organism to adapt to and defend against various stresses or infections. Because the body is not always successful in dealing with every stress or infection, it is important to find a substance in nature that has the capacity to mimic the symptoms the person is experiencing in order to aid the body in its efforts to defend and ultimately heal itself. In Botanical Medicine, plant preparations are used as medicine to restore health and maintain health. Herbs are complex in that they contain many different active chemical constituents and work best when used whole in their natural state or extracted state. Herbs are used to regulate the immune system, alleviate disease or symptoms of disease, prevent disease recurrence, and to detoxify the system. Hillsboro Naturopathic Clinic 245 SE 4th Ave. Ste.
