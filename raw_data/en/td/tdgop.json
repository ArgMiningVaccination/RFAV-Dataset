Even though it may look like the person lost a fight to an octopus, the bruises that result from cupping therapy can indicate healing. The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) states that the ancient therapy of cupping was used to treat a variety of ailments, including digestive issues and general pain. There are two types of cupping: wet cupping and dry cupping. Both forms of this alternative therapy involve the creation of a vacuum within the cups either through heat or a suction device. With wet cupping, the practitioner lightly pierces the skin so that blood is drawn into the cup. Dry cupping doesn't draw out any fluids. The suction pulls the skin up into the cups, breaking capillaries or blood vessels under the skin. That is why you see bruise-like circles after a cupping session. The body responds to the treatment as an injury, so it sends increased blood flow to accelerate the healing process. Today, you can receive cupping from a variety of practitioners, including acupuncturists, physical therapists, chiropractors, and massage therapists. And although it is an ancient healing modality, modern medicine continues to search for ways to understand its efficacy as a complementary treatment. Anecdotal reports and limited studies, however, support the following [health benefits of cupping therapy](https://www.dherbs.com/articles/the-adventures-of-v-man-gets-cupping-therapy/).

The results found that those who received cupping therapy experienced significant reductions in pain intensity, compared to the controlled group who did not receive cupping. Another uncontrolled study observed 70 people with chronic tension or migraine headaches. The participants who received cupping therapy experienced a 66% [reduction in headache severity](https://www.dherbs.com/articles/8-natural-remedies-to-get-rid-of-headaches/).

Additionally, another study observed 52 patients with carpal tunnel syndrome and associated shoulder and neck pain. Half the group received wet cupping to the trapezius region and the other group only received heating pad treatment. Researchers noted that the cupping group reported less pain a week after their cupping session. May Help Reduce Arthritis Pain This is based on one primary study that compared the effects of cupping with the over-the-counter pain reliever, acetaminophen, in 20 participants with one [osteoarthritis](https://www.dherbs.com/conditions/osteoarthritis).
