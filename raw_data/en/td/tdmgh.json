For any C overed Items and Services for which Medicare requires a more rigorous network adequacy standard than Medicaid (including time, distance, and/or minimum number of Participating Provider s or facilities), the FIDA Plan must meet the Medicare requirements. To the extent that Medicaid requires a more rigorous network adequacy standard than Medicare (including time, distance, and/or minimum number of Participating Provider s or facilities), the FIDA Plan must meet the Medicaid requirements. Medicare Provider Network standards ac count for the type of Service Area (rural, urban, suburban, etc.), travel time, and minimum number of the type of Provider s, as well as distance in c ertain circumstances. The NYSDOH and CMS may grant exceptions to these general rules to account for patter ns of care for Participants, but will not do so in a manner that will dilute access to care for Participants. Provider Networks will be s ubject to confirmation through Readiness R eviews. 2.7.1.8 The FIDA Plan's Provider Network must meet all of the following requi rements: 79 2.7.1.8.1 In no instance may the FIDA Plan's Provider Network have less than two (2) of any Provider type necessary to provide Covered Items and Services. 2.7.1.8.2 All Participating Provider s' physical sites must be accessible to all Participants as must all Participating Provider s that deliver services in the Participants' locations. 2.7.1.8.2.1 The FIDA Plan must collect completed ADA Accessibility Attestation form s from new Network Provider s that join their networks during the Demonstration. 2.7.1.8.2.2 Effective in Demonstration Ye ar 2, all Participating Provider s must submit to the FIDA Plan and the FIDA Plan must maintain on file a signed ADA Accessibility Attestation F orm indicating that they meet the ADA Accessibility standards. 2.7.1.8.2.3 All Participating Provider s must notify the FIDA P lan within ten (10) Busine ss Days of any change in its ability to meet the ADA Accessibility standards as outlined in the signed ADA Accessibility Attestation Form. 2.7.1.8.3 The FIDA Plan must establish and implement mechanisms to ensure that Participating Provide rs comply with the timely access requirements outlined herein, must monitor Participating Provider s regularly to determine compliance, and must take corrective action if there is a failure to comply. 2.7.1.8.4 The following minimum appointment availability standard s apply to physical health and Behavioral Health Services: 80 2.7.1.8.4.1 For emergency care: immediately upon presentation at a service delivery site. 2.7.1.8.4.2 For urgent care: within twenty -four (24) hours of request. 2.7.1.8.4.3 Non -urgent \"sick\" visit: within forty - eight (48) to seven ty-two (72) hours of request, as clinically indicated. 2.7.1.8.4.4 Routine non -urgent, preventive appointments: within four (4) weeks of request. 2.7.1.8.4.5 Specialist appointments (not urgent): within four (4) weeks of request. 2.7.1.8.4.6 Pursuant to an emergency or hospital discharge, mental health or substance abuse follow -up visits with a Participating Provider (as included in the FIDA Plan's Benefit Package): within five (5) Business Days of request, or sooner if clinically indicated. 2.7.1.8.4.7 Non -urgent mental health or substance abuse vis its with a Participating Provider (as included in the FIDA Plan's Benefit Package): within two (2) weeks of request. 2.7.1.8.4.8 Participating Provider visits to make health, mental health, and substance abuse assessments for the purpose of making recommendations reg arding a Participant 's ability to perform work within ten (10) Business D ays of request. 2.7.1.8.4.9 Mental Health Clinics must provide a clinical assessment within five (5) Business D ays of request for 81 Participants in the following designated groups: 2.7.1.8.4.9.1 Participants in receipt of services from a mobile crisis team not currently receiving treatment; 2.7.1.8.4.9.2 Participants in domestic violence shelter programs not currently receiving treatment; 2.7.1.8.4.9.3 Homeless Participants and those present at homeless shelters who are not currently recei ving treatment; 2.7.1.8.4.9.4 Participants aging out of foster care who are not currently receiving treatment; 2.7.1.8.4.9.5 Participants who have been discharged from an inpatient psychiatric facility within the last sixty ( 60) calendar days who are not currently receiving treatment ; 2.7.1.8.4.9.6 Participants referred by rape crisis centers; and 2.7.1.8.4.9.7 Participants referred by the State court system. 2.7.1.8.5 The following minimum access standards apply to Community -based LTSS services: 2.7.1.8.5.1 For New to Service Participants (meanin g those not already receiving Communi ty-based LTSS), Community -based LTSS service delivery must begin (along with completion of the Comprehensive Assessment) within thirty ( 30) calendar days of Enrollment. 82 2.7.1.8.5.2 For Participants that are not New to Service but transitioning from a n MLTCP, from ano ther plan, or from Medicare and/or Medicaid FFS, FIDA Plans must provide continuity of Community -based LTSS immediately upon Enrollment, as further outlined in the continuity of care and transition policy in Section 2.6.6 and Section 2.5.3, respectively .

Such presentation(s) shall ensure that Eligible Individuals and such Participant s are informed prior to Enrollment of the following: 3.3.2.1.2.1 The rights and responsibilities of participation in the Demonstr ation; 3.3.2.1.2.2 The nature of the FIDA Plan 's care delivery system, including, but not limited to , the Provider Network; and 199 3.3.2.1.2.3 Orientation and other Participant services made available by the FIDA Plan . 3.3.2.1.3 Enroll, disenroll , and process transfer requests of Particip ants in the FIDA Plan , including completion of the NYSDOH 's Enrollment and Disenrollment forms; 3.3.2.1.4 Ensure that Participants are informed at the time of Enrollment or transfer of their right to terminate their Enrollment voluntarily at any time, unless other wise provided by Federal law or waiver; and 3.3.2.1.5 Be knowledgeable about the FIDA Plan 's policies, services, and procedures; and 3.3.2.2 Passive Enrollment will be phased in as described in Section 3.2.4.1.1. 4 Section 4. Payment and Financial Provisions 4.1 General Financi al Provisions 4.1.1 Capitation Payments 4.1.1.1 CMS and the NYSDOH will each contribute to the total Capitation payment. CMS and the NYSDOH will each make monthly payments to the FIDA Plan for their respective portion of the capitated rate, in accordance with the rates of payment and payment provisions set forth in Section 4 and subject to all applicable Federal and State laws, regulations, rules, billing instructions, and bulletins, as amended. The FIDA Plan will receive three (3) monthly payments for each Participant : one amount from CMS reflecting coverage of Medicare Parts A/B services (Medicare Parts A/B Component) , one amount from CMS reflecting coverage Medicare Part D services (Medicare Part D Component) , and a third amount from the NYSDOH reflecting coverage o f Medicaid services (Medicaid Component) . 4.1.1.2 The Medicare Parts A/B Component will be risk adjusted using the Medicare Advantage CMS -HCC model and CMS - HCC ESRD model , except as specified in Section 4.2 .4. The 200 Part D direct subsidy portion of the Medicare Pa rt D Component will be risk adjusted using the Part D RxHCC model . The Medicaid Component will utilize the rate cell methodology described in the annual rate report . 4.1.1.3 CMS and the NYSDOH will provide the FIDA Plan with a rate report , to be signed by all Part ies, on an annual basis for the upcoming calendar year. 4.1.2 Demonstration Year Dates Capitation Rate updates will take place on January 1st of each calendar year, however savings percentages and quality withhold percentages (see Sections 4.2.3.1 and 4. 3.4 will be applied based on Demonstration Years, as follows: Demonstration Year Calendar Dates 1 January 1, 2015 - December 31, 201 5 2 January 1, 201 6 - December 31, 201 6 3 January 1, 201 7 - December 31, 201 7 4.2 Capitated Rate Structure 4.2.1 Underlying Rate Struc ture for the Medicaid Component 4.2.1.1 The NYSDOH shall pay the FIDA Plan a monthly Capitation (the Medicaid Component), a sum equal to the product of the approved Capitation Rate and the number of Participants enrolled as of the first day of that month. 4.2.2 Underly ing Rate Structure for Medicare Component of the Capitation Rate 4.2.2.1 Medicare will pay the FIDA Plan a monthly Capitation amount for the Medicare Parts A/B services (the Medicare A/B Component), risk adjusted using the Medicare Advantage CMS -HCC Model and the CMS -HCC ESRD Model, except as specified in Section 4.2.4 . Medicare will also pay the FIDA Plan a monthly Capitation amount for Medicare Part D services, risk adjusted using the Part D RxHCC Model (the Medicare Part D Component). 4.2.2.2 Medicare A/B Baseline 201 4.2.2.2.1 The Medicare baseline spending for Parts A/B services are a blend of the Medicare Fee For Service (FFS) standardized county rates and the Medicare Advantage projected payment rates for each year, weighted by the proportion of Eligible Individuals projected to otherwise be in each program in the absence of the Demonstration. The FFS county rates will generally reflect amounts published with the April Medicare Advantage Final Rate Announcement. CMS may also further adjust the Medicare FFS standardized county rates as necessary to calculate accurate payment rates for the Demonstration. To the extent that the published FFS county rates do not conform with current law in effect for Medicare during an applicable payment month, and to the extent that such nonconfor mance would have a significant fiscal impact on the Demonstration, CMS will update the baseline (and therefore the corresponding payment rate) to calculate and apply an accurate payment rate for such month. Such update may take place retroactively, as needed. Starting January 2015, in calculating the Medicare Advantage projected payment rates, CMS will include frailty adjustment to the payment rates, to the extent applicable in Medicare Advantage rates outside of the Demonstration. 4.2.2.2.2 Separate baselines will exist for Participants meeting the Medicare ESRD criteria. For Participants with ESRD in the dialysis or transplant status phases, the Medicare Parts A/B baseline will be the ESRD dialysis state rate. For Participant s in the functioning graft status phase , the Medicare Parts A/B baseline will be the Medicare Advantage 3 -star county rate (benchmark) for the applicable county. 4.2.2.2.3 Both baseline spending and payment rates under the Demonstration for Medicare Parts A/B services will be calculated as PMPM standard ized amounts for each county participating in the 202 Demonstration for each year. Participant risk scores will be applied to the standardized payment rates at the time of payment. 4.2.2.2.4 The Medicare A/B Component will be updated annually consistent with annual Fe e-for- Service (FFS) estimates and Medicare Advantage rates released each year with the annual rate announcement. 4.2.2.2.5 If a Participant elects to receive the Medicare hospice benefit, the Participant may remain in the Demonstration Plan, but will obtain the hos pice service through the Medicare FFS benefit and the Demonstration Plan would no longer receive the Medicare Parts A/B Component for that Participant as described in this section. Medicare hospice services and hospice drugs and all other Original Medicare services would be paid for under Medicare FFS. The FIDA Plan and Provider s of hospice services would be required to coordinate these services with the rest of the Participant 's care. The FIDA Plan would continue to receive the Medicare Part D Component fo r all non-hospice covered drugs. Election of hospice services does not change the Medicaid Component. 4.2.2.3 Medicare Part D 4.2.2.3.1 The Medicare Part D Component is comprised of the Part D direct subsidy set at the Part D national average monthly bid amount (NAMBA) for the calendar year, as well as CMS -estimated average monthly prospective payment amount for the low income cost -sharing subsidy and Federal reinsurance amounts; these payments will be reconciled after the end of each payment year in the same manner as for all Part D sponsors. 4.2.2.3.2 The monthly Medicare Part D Component for a Participant can be calculated by multiplying the Part D NAMBA by the RxHCC risk score assigned to the individual, and then adding to this the 203 estimated average monthly prospective payment amount for the low income cost -sharing subsidy and Federal reinsurance amounts. 4.2.3 Aggregate Savings Percentages 4.2.3.1 Aggregate savings percentages will be applied equally, as follows, to the baseline spending amounts for the Medicare Parts A/B Component and Medic aid Component of the capitated rate herein. 4.2.3.1.1 Demonstration Year 1: 1% 4.2.3.1.2 Demonstration Year 2: 1.5% 4.2.3.1.3 Demonstration Year 3: 3% unless changed as a result of the provisions outlined in Section 4.3.3.6 4.2.3.2 Except as otherwise specified, rate updates will take place on January 1st of each calendar year. 4.2.3.3 Aggregate Savings Percentages will not be applied to the Part D component of the rate. CMS will monitor Part D costs closely on an ongoing basis. Any material change in Part D costs relative to the baseline may be f actored into future year Aggregate S avings Percentages. 4.2.4 Risk Adjustment Methodology 4.2.4.1 Medicare Parts A/B: The Medicare Parts A/B Component will be risk adjusted based on the risk profile of each Participant . Except as specified in Section 4.2.4.2, the exist ing Medicare Advantage CMS -HCC and CMS -HCC ESRD risk adjustment methodology will be used for the Demonstration. 4.2.4.2 Coding Intensity Adjustment Factor 4.2.4.2.1 In calendar year 2015 , CMS will calculate and apply a coding intensity adjustment reflective of all Demonstr ation Participant s except as indicated in Section 4.2.4.2. 4. This will apply the prevailing Medicare Advantage coding intensity adjustment proportional to the anticipated proportion of Demonstration Participant s in 2015 with Medic are Advantage experience i n 2014 . Operationally CMS 204 will still apply the full prevailing Medicare Advantage coding intensity adjustment factor to the risk scores but will increase the Medicare A/B Component for non -ESRD Participant s and Participant s with an ESRD status of functioni ng graft, to offset this. 4.2.4.2.2 In calendar year 2016 , CMS will apply the prevailing Medicare Advantage coding intensity adjustment proportional to the anticipated proportion of De monstration Participants in 2016 with prior Medicare Advantage experience and/or Demonstration experience based on the Demonstration's enrollment phase -in as of September 30, 2015 . 4.2.4.2.3 After calendar year 2016 , CMS will apply the prevailing Medicare Advantage coding intensity adjustment to all Demonstration Participants. 4.2.4.2.4 The coding inte nsity adjustment factor will not be applied during the Demonstration to risk scores for Participant s with an ESRD status of dialysis or transplant, consistent with Medicare Advantage policy. 4.2.4.3 Medicare Part D: The Medicare Part D national average bid amount will be risk adjusted in accordance with existing Part D RxHCC methodology. The estimated average monthly prospective payment amount for the low income cost -sharing subsidy and Federal reinsurance amounts will not be risk adjusted. 4.3 Payment Terms 4.3.1 CMS wi ll make monthly, prospective Capitation payments to the FIDA Plan . The Department will make monthly Capitation payments to the FIDA Plan . The Medicare Parts A/B Component will be the product of the Participant 's CMS -HCC risk score multiplied by the releva nt standard county payment rate (or the ESRD dialysis state rate or the Medicare Advantage 3 -star county rate by the HCC ESRD risk score, as applicable). The Medicare Part D Component will be the product of the Participant 's RxHCC risk score multiplied by the Part D NAMBA , with the addition of the 205 estimated average monthly prospective payment amount for the low income cost -sharing subsidy and Federal reinsurance amounts. The Medicaid Component for each rate cell will be the product of the number of Partic ipants in each category multiplied by the payment rate for that rate cell. 4.3.2 Timing of Capitation Payments 4.3.2.1 Enrollments 4.3.2.1.1 CMS and the NYSDOH will make monthly per member per month Capitation payments to the FIDA Plan . The per member per month ( PMPM ) Capitation payment for a particular month will reflect payment for the Participant s with effective Enrollment into the FIDA Plan as of the first day of that month, as described in Section 2.3.1 . 4.3.2.2 Disenrollments 4.3.2.2.1 The final per member per month Capitation payment made b y CMS and the NYSDOH to the FIDA Plan for each Participant will be for the month in which the Disenrollment was submitted, the Participant loses eligibility, or the Participant dies (see Section s 2.3.2 and 3.2. 6). 4.3.2.3 Timing of Medicaid Component of the Rate 4.3.2.3.1 Capitation paid by the NYSDOH for the Medicaid Component is due to the FIDA Plan within the service month. Payments due from NYSDOH , including late charges, will be paid in accordance with the New York State Finance Law when applicable. Collection of under lying amounts owed plus interest shall be the FIDA Plan 's sole remedy against the NYSDOH for late payments by the State. Payment terms contained on the FIDA Plan 's invoices shall have no force and effect. 4.3.3 Modifications to Capitation Rates 206 CMS and the NYSD OH will jointly notify the FIDA Plan in advance and in writing of any proposed changes to the Capitation rates , and the FIDA Plan shall accept such changes as payment in full as described in Section 4. 5. 4.3.3.1 Rates will be updated using a similar process for each calendar year. Subject to Section 4. 3.3.2, changes to the Medicare and Medicaid baselines outside of the annual Medicare Advantage and Part D rate announcement and the annual Medicaid rate update will be made only if and when CMS and the NYSDOH jointl y determine the change is necessary to calculate accurate payment rates for the Demonstration. Such changes may be based on the following factors: shifts in Enrollment assumptions; major changes or discrepancies in Federal law and/or State policy compared to assumptions about Federal law and/or State law or policy used in the development of baseline estimates; and changes in coding intensity. CMS and/or NYSDOH will make changes to baseline estimates within thirty ( 30) days of identification of the need fo r such changes, and changes will be applied, if necessary on a retrospective basis, to effectuate accurate payment rates for each month. 4.3.3.2 For changes solely affecting the Medicare program baseline, CMS will update baselines by amounts identified by the independent Office of the Actuary necessary to best effectuate accurate payment rates for each month. 4.3.3.3 Subject to Section 4. 3.3.2, if other statutory changes enacted after the annual baseline determination and rate development process are jointly determined by CMS and the NYSDOH to have a material change in baseline estimates for any given payment year, baseline estimates and corresponding standardized payment rates shall be updated outside of the annual rate development process. 4.3.3.4 CMS will evaluate Participa nt risk scores in Demonstration Year 1 and Demonstration Year 2 to determine whether coding intensity in either or both years supports the need for adjustments to the baseline in Demonstration Year 3. CMS will give the FIDA Plan the opportunity to review and comment on such adjustment s and will then incorporate such adjustments into the Demonstration Year 3 baseline, as appropriate, on a prospective basis to prevent overpayments due to increased coding intensity. 207 4.3.3.5 Changes to the Aggregate S avings Percentag es will be made if and when CMS and NYSDOH jointly determine that changes in Part D spending have resulted in materially higher or lower savings that need to be recouped through higher or lower savings percentages applied to the Medicare A/B baselines. CMS and NYSDOH will give the FIDA Plan the opportunity to review and comment on any such proposed changes to the Aggregate Savings P ercentages before they are implemented. 4.3.3.6 In the event that a least one -third of FIDA Plans experience losses in Demonstration Year 1 exceeding three (3 %) percent of revenue, based on at least twelve (12) months of data from Demonstration Year 1, the savings percentage for Demonstration Year 3 will be reduced to two and a half (2.5 %) percent. CMS and NYSDOH will make such determi nation at least four months prior to the start of Demonstration Year 3. 4.3.4 Quality Withhold Policy for Medicaid and Medicare A/B Components 4.3.4.1 Under the Demonstration, both CMS and the NYSDOH will withhold a percentage of their respective components of the Capitation Rate, with the exception of the Part D Component amounts . The withheld amounts will be repaid subject to the FIDA Plan 's performance consistent with established quality thresholds. 4.3.4.2 CMS and the NYSDOH will evaluate the FIDA Plan 's performance accor ding to the specified metrics required in order to earn back the quality withhold for a given Demonstration Year . 4.3.4.3 Whether or not the FIDA Plan has met the quality requirements in a given year will be made public. 4.3.4.4 Additional details regarding the quality withholds, including the more detailed specifications, required thresholds and other information regarding the methodology will be made available in future technical guidance. 4.3.4.5 Withhold Measures in Demonstration Year 1 4.3.4.5.1 Figure 4.1 below identifies core withh old measures for Demonstration Year 1.

Wellness monitoring is important to the overall health of Participant s. Wellness monitoring includes disease prevention, the provision of health education and the identification of modifiable health risks. Through increased aware ness and education, Participant s may make healthy lifestyle choices that will decrease the likelihood of unnecessary institutionalization. The frequency of wellness monitoring will be contingent on the Participant 's needs. Home Visits by medical personnel are expected to decrease the likelihood of exacerbation of chronic medical conditions and unnecessary and costly emergency room visits, hospitalizations and nursing facility placement. In addition to assessing the Participant , this service will also include the evaluation of the home environment from a medical perspective, and the Participant 's informal support system's ability to maintain and/or assume the role of caregiver. The Provider 's assessment of the informal support system/ caregivers will focus on the relationship to the Participant in terms of the physical, social and emotional assistance that is currently provided or may be provided in the future. Based on the outcome of this assessment, the Provider of this service can make referrals for or request that the Service Coordinator make referrals for additional assistance as appropriate to maintain the Participant 's ability to remain at home or in the least restrictive setting. Home Visits by Medical Personnel differs from what is offered under t he State Plan because this service is used for wellness monitoring, the 268 assessment of the informal support system and/or caregiver ability to provide assistance to the Participant , and/or the evaluation of the Participant 's home environment from a medical perspective. This preventive activity decreases the likelihood of accidents in the home, lowers the Participant 's and caregiver's stress levels, increases the quality of medical care provided to the Participant and increases the efficiency of medication m anagement, all of which promote the Participant 's ability to remain at home. This service is especially beneficial for those Participant s who have significant difficulty traveling or are unable to travel for needed medical care provided by a physician, ph ysician assistant or nurse practitioner because of one or more of the following: (1) severe pain; (2) severe mobility impairments; (3) terminal illness; (4) a chronic condition that can be exacerbated by travel; (5) medical Provider s at a physician's offic e and/or transportation Provider s refusing to provide services because an individual's disruptive behavior; (6) the home visit is cost - effective or (7) transportation to medical appointments is limited due to geographical or medical considerations. The Me dical Personnel are an integral part of the Participant 's IDT and have the responsibility to inform the IDT and Care Manager of any recommendations for services to meet the Participant 's medical needs and/or other significant findings. The IDT will utiliz e this information in revising the Participant 's PCSP.

ILST must be provided in th e environment and 269 situation which will result in the greatest positive outcome for the Participant . It is expected that this service will be provided in the Participant 's environment; for example, in the Participant 's kitchen as opposed to the Provider 's kitchen. This expectation is based on the difficulty that many Participant s experience with transferring or generalizing knowledge and skills from one situation to another. It is recognized that there is a need for some practice of skills before using th em in the environment. Services may include assessment, training, and supervision of or assistance to, an individual with self-care, medication management, task completion, communication skills, interpersonal skills, socialization, sensory/motor skills, mobility, community transportation skills, reduction/elimination of maladaptive behaviors, problem solving skills, money management, pre - vocational skills and ability to maintain a household. This service may also be used to assist a Participant in return ing to, or expanding the Participant 's involvement in meaningful activities, such as volunteering or paid employment. This use of this service for these purposes must occur only after it is clear that the Participant is not eligible for services provided through the Vocational and Educational Services for Individuals in Disabilities (VESID) or the Commission for the Blind and Visually Handicapped (CBVH); that VESID and CBVH services have been exhausted; or the activity is not covered by VESID or CBVH servi ces.
