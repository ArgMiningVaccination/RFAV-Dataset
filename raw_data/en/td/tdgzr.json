Here are some details to help you learn more. What are the benefits? Getting the vaccine - The vaccine protects you from getting very sick or dying from COVID-19. If you get COVID-19, your symptoms will probably be less severe than if you hadn't gotten the vaccine. - Even though there is a risk of getting and spreading COVID-19 after you're up to date on your vaccines, the vaccine does help protect others around you. This includes people who are more likely to get very sick or die from COVID-19. If you get the virus, you could spread it to friends, family, and other people in your community who are at high risk. This can happen even if you don't have symptoms. So getting the vaccine can help save lives. - When more people get vaccinated, the disease is less likely to spread. Not getting the vaccine - Without the vaccine, you will be less protected from getting very sick or dying from the virus. And you won't be keeping others safe or helping your community. - Without the vaccine, you'll be less protected from other problems caused by getting COVID-19. This includes long-term health problems. It also includes missing work, school, or other events. And it includes the cost of care if you get seriously ill. How safe is it? Getting the vaccine - The vaccine is safe and effective. It's been given to billions of people. Scientists made sure the vaccine was tested for many people of different ages, races, and ethnicities, and for people with different health issues. - You cannot get COVID-19 by getting the vaccine.
