Doc/9) -iv INTRODUCTION The Forty-sixth World Health Assembly (WHA46) was held in Geneva, Switzerland, from 3 to 14 May 1993. During its deliberations, WHA46 considered the work of the Executive Board since the last World Health Assembly, reappointed Dr. Hiroshi Nakajima as the Director-General of WHO, adopted a program budget for the period 1994-1995 and passed a total of 40 resolutions. From the Region of the Americas, Dr. R. Pereira, Minister of Health, Honduras, was elected one of the Vice Presidents of the Assembly; Mr. B. M. Taitt, Minister of Health, Barbados, was elected Chairman of Committee B; and Dr. A. L. Pico, Argentina, was elected as one of the Vice-Chairmen of Committee A. The work of the Assembly is synopsized in the following sections. Only those resolutions and other actions considered to be of particular importance to the Region of the Americas are annotated. They are presented according to subject matter, rather than the sequence in which they were adopted. Some relate directly to agenda items being considered by the Regional Committee for the Americas and are so noted with cross references. All of the resolutions are included in Annex I, in numerical order. II. APPOINTMENT OF THE DIRECTOR-GENERAL During his address to the World Health Assembly, Dr. Hiroshi Nakajima, Director-General of WHO, spoke of a \"new partnership\" between WHO and its Member States, implying a new social covenant for health based on mutual responsibility, respect and sharing. Outlining the content of the Ninth General Program of Work, Dr. Nakajima highlighted four main lines of action for the period 1996-2001: 1) integration of health and human development in public policies, 2) equity of access to and quality of health care, 3) promotion and protection of health and 4) prevention and control of disease. He also spoke about his intention to tighten management and administration and to revitalize WHO's structure to achieve greater efficiency and accountability. In a private session, WHA46 reappointed Dr. Nakajima to a second five-year term as Director-General (Resolutions WHA46.2 and WHA46.3). Prior to the consideration of his appointment in plenary session, Committee B had considered a Special Report of the External Auditor concerning possible financial irregularities during 1992, exhorting the Director-General to secure maximum transparency, accountability and efficiency in the use of WHO's resources, as stated in a resolution subsequently adopted (WHA46.21). In his acceptance speech, Dr. Nakajima stated, \"I hope we can put the events of the past few months behind us and work thoroughly and intensively for our Organization and for the health of the people of the world. I pay tribute to the dedicated staff of this Organization, who, whatever the weakness or strength of their leadership, continue toCD37/27 (Eng.) Page 2 work with great technical ability, dedication and loyalty to WHO. I have stressed that a new partnership for health is essential in the light of massive world change. I pledge that through the process of reform that has started you, the Member States, will find an improved and refreshed Organization, with more intensive cooperation at global level and in your individual countries. To achieve this, I need the help and support of each one of you.\" mII. PROGRAM BUDGET AND OTHER FINANCIAL POLICY MATTERS Consideration of the program content of the Proposed Program Budget for WHO for the Financial Period 1994-1995 occupied most of the time and attention of Committee A during WHA46. This section will focus on the actions taken by the Assembly in regard to the level of the program budget and how it will be financed. 1. Appropriation Resolution for the Financial Period 1994-1995 and the Scale of Assessments (Resolutions WHA46.34 and WHA46. 15. respectively) In its consideration of the proposed program budget for 1994-1995, the Executive Board had asked the Director-General to give further attention to comments its members made regarding potential shifts in budgetary priorities, reductions and economies to help offset and reduce cost increases, and other changes that could lead to a reduction in the proposed program budget. In a separate report to the Assembly, the Director-General proposed a total regular program budget of $830,241,000, a level which would represent a 12.96% increase over the comparable level for the 1992-1993 biennium. At the same time, he suggested ways to make further reductions of $8,140,000, which the Assembly accepted, of which $276,000 related to the Region of the Americas. The appropriation resolution finally adopted by the Assembly as Resolution WHA46.34 sets the effective working budget for 1994-1995 at $822,101,000, reflecting an overall increase of 11.86% over the comparable level for 1992-1993. For the Region of the Americas, this results in a WHO regional program budget of $79,794,000. This level is the same as that included in OD-254, the proposed program budget for the Pan American Health Organization for 1994-1995, to be considered under Agenda Item 5.1. To fund the WHO program budget, $13,129,000 will be drawn from casual income, $3,600,000 from UNDP reimbursement of program support costs and the remaining $805,372,000 from Member State contributions. The latter represents an increase of 14.07% over 1992-1993 levels.CD37/27 (Eng.) Page 3 A new scale of assessments was also adopted (Resolution WHA46.15) to reflect the admission of new Members and Associate Members. The resulting contributions of Members and Associate Members for each year, 1994 and 1995, is given in Annex II, which includes gross assessments less credits from the tax equalization fund and from the financial incentive scheme. 2. Budgetary Reform (Resolution WHA46.35) After consideration of the program budget for 1994-1995 and its related appropriation resolution, the Assembly adopted Resolution WHA46.35 on budgetary reform, requesting the Director-General to introduce a clearer, simpler, more \"user- friendly\" proposed program budget for the financial period 1996-1997. Specifically requested is a budget formulation process which results in a clearer, simpler presentation, determines strategic and financial priorities and establishes realistic and measurable targets for each one, and reallocates human and financial resources to reflect them. Regular evaluation of progress is also requested. Furthermore, measures are requested to achieve a more appropriate ratio of staff and staff related costs to all other program costs. During the discussion of the resolution, the process used for formulating and presenting the program budget of the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) was offered as a possible example to be emulated, as were the relatively low costs for PAHO's program direction and administration. 3. Interim Financial Report of WHO for 1992 (Resolution WHA46.5) Although the Interim Financial Report of WHO for 1992 was accepted by WHA46, it is important to point out some key information about the financial status of WHO contained in it. First, WHO began 1992 with zero funds in the working capital account due to internal borrowing in 1991; furthermore, $54.2 million of other funds available to WHO were secured to cover the 1990-1991 regular budget deficit. As of 31 December 1992, $28.9 million still remained outstanding in regard to prior year deficits, secured partially by the $11 million working capital fund. Thus WHO started 1993 with zero operating funds other than those in its special accounts. Second, the amount of casual income has been dropping steadily from 1989, when the opening balance was $56.1 million, as opposed to $13.2 million at the end of last year, thus decreasing the amount available to fund the program budget for the next biennium. And third, the rate of collection of annual contributions for 1992 fell to 77.6% of assessed levels, compared to 84.4% and 81.9% for 1990 and 1991 respectively.CD37/27 (Eng.) Page 4 The result in the Region of the Americas is that spending authority from WHO against the 1992-1993 program budget was reduced by 10%, or $ 7,149,100. Unless the situation improves, a similar action will likely be taken for the 1994-1995 biennium. 4. Status of Collection of Assessed Contributions and Members in Arrears (Resolutions WHA46.9 and WHA46. 10) These resolutions specifically address the fact that $79,599,485 or 22.4% of 1992 contributions to the effective working budget of WHO were unpaid as of the end of 1992. Resolution WHA46.9 calls the attention of Member States to the fact that contributions are payable in full by the first day of the year to which they relate and reminds Members of the incentive scheme for early payment. Because ,of the amount of their arrearages, the voting rights of Antigua and Barbuda and of the Dominican Republic were automatically suspended during WHA46. Haiti's voting privileges will be suspended at the Forty-seventh World Health Assembly unless sufficient contributions are received before that time. IV. PROGRAM POLICY MATTERS A number of program policy matters were considered during WHA46. Background documents provided a basis and focus for the discussion and the resolutions which resulted. In other instances, resolutions were generated and adopted as part of the discussion of agenda items. The following presentation includes program policy issues pertinent to the Region of the Americas. 1. WHO Response to Global Change (Resolution WHA46.16) Twenty-three delegations sponsored a resolution on the WHO response to global change which was a report of an Executive Board Working Group originally intended for consideration at the Board's meeting to be convened following the Assembly. Nevertheless, because the Director-General had pledged his support to WHA46 in implementing the recommendations of the Report (which contains recommendations concerning WHO's mission and governance; the role and operation of WHO's head- quarters, regional and country offices; budgetary and financial considerations; as well as other matters) the Assembly requested the Executive Board, in an unusual move, to examine and prioritize the recommendations made, to consider their implications for WHO program management and implementation, and to mobilize the resources necessary to ensure implementation of the priorities established. The Director-General is requested to make a progress report to the next World Health Assembly.CD37/27 (Eng.) Page 5 At the meeting of the Executive Board on 18 May 1993, the Working Group report was endorsed, and the Director-General was requested to develop a timetable and workplan for implementation of the recommendations for consideration by the Board's Program Committee at its July 1993 meeting. The regional committees are requested to study the implications of the recommendations and report to the next meeting of the Board in January 1994. Thus, this report has been included for consideration by the Regional Committee for the Americas under Agenda Item 5.13. 2. WHO Global Strategy for Health and Environment (Resolution WHA46.20) Last year, the Forty-fifth World Health Assembly requested the Director-General of WHO to formulate a new global strategy for environmental health based on the findings on the WHO Commission on Health and Environment and on the outcome of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) held in Rio de Janeiro in June 1992, in which \"Agenda 21\" was adopted as a plan to guide national and international activities. At the XXXVI Meeting of PAHO's Directing Council (1992), a report was presented on the results of UNCED and its implications for PAHO, and Resolution XIII was adopted. The components of WHO's global strategy are: 1) an enhanced program for the promotion of environmental health, 2) an expanded program for the promotion of chemical safety, 3) broader collaboration throughout WHO on health and environment and 4) a stronger partnership with other international agencies and NGOs. The resolution (WHA46.20) specifically refers to PAHO's regional plan for investment in the environment and health and calls upon Member States to give high priority to health and the environment in their planning for sustainable development and to collaborate closely with WHO in order to strengthen their own capacities for the attainment of environmentally sound and sustainable development. For his part, the Director-General is requested to support Member States in ensuring that measures for health and environment are fully incorporated in sustainable development plans and activities and to promote WHO's global strategy, including prospective studies on potential environmental hazards to human health. For some years now, PAHO has been orienting its strategy in the same direction as that included in the global strategy, within the context of regional characteristics and available resources. The main thrust of PAHO's program is strengthening national capabilities to evaluate environmental health risks and to manage programs of water supply, basic sanitation and pollution control, as well as chemical safety. The reintroduction of cholera into the Americas Region in 1991 has refocused regional attention on the great deficiencies of basic sanitation that still exist, even thoughCD37/27 (Eng.) Page 6 potable water coverage has reached 79 %, sanitation 66% and refuse collection 70 %. The fact remains that water disinfection programs have been relegated to second priority, only 10% of waste water is treated and only 30% of solid waste is properly disposed. To correct this situation, PAHO has launched the \"Regional Plan for Investment in Health and the Environment\" in an effort to achieve equitable coverage by 2005. (See Agenda Item 5.6.) 3. Study of the United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (Resolution WHA46.37) In a relatively short period of time, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has spread throughout the world. Worldwide, an estimated 14 million people are now infected, including at least 3 to 4 million women. By the year 2000, it is conservatively estimated that at the global level, there will be close to 10 million cases of AIDS in adults, and a total of 30 to 40 million persons infected with HIV, 10 million of whom will be children. The current situation of the pandemic in the Region of the Americas will be considered by the Regional Committee under Agenda Item 5.2. During WHA46, there was an extensive discussion of the pandemic, the efforts of Member States to control its spread and to treat those already infected, as well as the management of the global program to support Member States in implementing the strategy to prevent and control the infection and the disease. Resolution WHA46.37 recognizes that a multisectoral response is required to strengthen preventive efforts and to reduce the increasing social and economic consequences of the pandemic. A wide range of organizations, agencies and groups need to contribute to this response. Therefore, the Assembly requested the Director-General to consider the economic and organizational benefits of a joint and cosponsored United Nations program on HIV and AIDS and to study the feasibility of establishing such a program in close consultation with the Administrator of the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), the Executive Director of the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the Executive Director of the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), the Director- General of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and the President of the World Bank. In conducting the study, particular attention is to be given to the anticipated growth and consequences of the pandemic over the next two decades, the level of resources likely to be available over the next 10 years, practical arrangements for establishing a joint program and the need for global leadership. A report on the outcome of this consultative process is to be presented to the January 1994 meeting of the Executive Board. In the Region of the Americas, UNDP, UNICEF and the World Bank are already collaborating with PAHO and with some countries in Latin America. At the country level, the degree of interest among other UN agencies varies, but sound opportunities forCD37/27 (Eng.) Page 7 joint collaboration with national AIDS programs exist. Furthermore, interagency committees have already been established formally in three Andean countries, and informal interagency collaboration already exists in several other countries in the Region. 4. Tuberculosis Program (Resolution WHA46.36) Despite the existence of highly cost-effective strategies and the availability of tools to control the disease, tuberculosis continues to be an important cause of death. This already serious situation is rapidly worsening in both developing and industrialized countries as a result of the low priority given to control programs, the global economic recession, appalling social conditions in many parts of the world, the spread of HIV infection and increased international migration. The problem is further exacerbated by a lack of political will to promote and support effective control programs. In this light, Resolution WHA46.36 urges Member States to take rapid action to strengthen national tuberculosis programs as part of national health services and as an integral part of primary health care. The main components of control strategies are: 1) detection of smear-positive cases, 2) introduction of standardized short-course chemotherapy, 3) introduction of standardized case registries, 4) thorough evaluation of treatment results by cohort analysis, 5) provision of a regular antituberculosis drug supply and 6) promotion of tuberculosis prevention. The Director-General is requested to reinforce WHO's support for national tuberculosis control programs and to ensure a coordinated effort to fight tuberculosis with other relevant programs within the Organization. In the Region of the Americas, in epidemiological and operational terms, the most severe problem exists in Haiti and the Dominican Republic, the Andean subregion and in Central American countries with the exception of Costa Rica. Severe problems also exist in Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Paraguay and Venezuela. Although the problem is less severe, it is worsening in countries such as the United States of America and in the English-speaking Caribbean, largely in association with the HIV/AIDS pandemic. The Ministers of Health of Central America have already assigned priority to the control of tuberculosis as a public health problem. In all of the countries of Latin America, ministerial level teams have been created to address this problem. Countries such as Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Bolivia and Peru have made substantial recent advances in the organization and implementation of national control programs. It is expected that similar efforts will be initiated in 1993 in El Salvador, 'Ecuador and the Dominican Republic. PAHO has increased its technical cooperation activities in tuberculosis control in recent years, with emphasis given to the Central American and Andean subregions. Direct consultation, training and information dissemination have been particularlyCD37/27 (Eng.) Page 8 emphasized. Significant effort has been devoted to promoting short-course chemotherapy with direct observation during the entire treatment period, not just the first two months of therapy as contained in resolution WHA46.36. By 1995, it is expected that the majority of countries in the Region will achieve 85 % successful completion of short- course therapy in newly diagnosed cases. Accurate laboratory diagnosis of infectious cases is critical to ani effective control program. Unfortunately, 40 to 50 % of the microscopes needed for TB diagnosis in Latin America are damaged. As a result of PAHO's efforts to train technicians, through specially designed four week courses, to repair this equipment, over 200 microscopes in Central America and Peru have been returned to service. It is hoped this capacity can be extended throughout the Region. Finally, technical guidelines for the management of tuberculosis in HIV/AIDS patients are being prepared and will be distributed in the near future. 5. Eradication of Poliomyelitis (Resolution WHA46.33) The current status of the effort within the Region of the Americas to eradicate the transmission of wild poliovirus will be discussed by the Regional Committee under Agenda Item 5.8 concerning the Expanded Program on Immunization. At WHA46, the countries of the Region of the Americas were congratulated on having had no cases of poliomyelitis caused by the transmission of indigenous wild poliovirus since September 1991. While surveillance and vaccination efforts continue in the Americas in the preparation for eventual certification of eradication, the rest of the world is strengthening its efforts to achieve the goal of global eradication by the year 2000. Resolution WHA46.33 urges Member States to reaffirm their commitment to the national eradication of poliomyelitis. Until global eradication is achieved, efforts in the Americas Region to assure vaccination coverage will have to continue lest the disease be reintroduced in future months and years, as was the case recently in Canada among a religious group who migrated from the Netherlands where they had shunned vaccination. 6. Control of Malaria (Resolution WHA46.32) WHA46 considered the report of the Director-General on the Ministerial Conference on Malaria, held in Amsterdam in October 1992. In Resolution WHA46.32, the Assembly endorsed the World Declaration on the Control of Malaria and urged Member States, where malaria remains a problem, to reinforce their efforts for prevention and control in accordance with the principles enunciated in the Declaration. For its part, WHO is to ensure the necessary technicalCD37/27 (Eng.) Page 9 support to Member States for the reorientation of malaria control programs according to the global malaria control strategy and for their implementation in the context of primary health care. Many control programs in the Region of the Americas are based on the old strategy of malaria eradication which attempts interruption of transmission but is inefficient in controlling malaria in an ever changing socio-demographic environment. In addition, simplified vector control measures utilizing insecticides are no longer effective. The new strategy emphasizes the clinical management of malaria as a disease, with the objective of reducing the interval between suspicion and treatment. This major element of the strategy has provided a decisive tool for the integration of the resources of specialized malaria programs into general health services, an approach already emphasized in the Americas. The second element of the strategy, \"to implement selective preventive measures,\" supports PAHO's orientation to this Region's Member States, by recognizing the diversity of transmission patterns which have to be addressed through epidemiological stratifi-cation. In this manner, high, medium and low risk areas in the Region can be defined. Furthermore, the stratification process emphasizes implementation of preventive measures through local health services, where they can be programmed with the local characteristics of transmission in mind. The third element of the strategy, \"to detect early, contain and prevent epidemics,\" reflects the need for health information systems to widen their information services so as to enable monitoring and to incorporate into their analyses socio- demographic and economic variables that allow for the recognition of groups at risk of high levels of transmission. The implementation of the Global Malaria Control Strategy is well underway in the Region of the Americas. Nicaragua, for example, has planned early detection and treatment of malaria cases within the framework of its local health services (SILAIS) with an 11 % reduction of registered cases in one year. Colombia's province of Antioquia has reduced by 82 % the number of hospital deaths from malaria in a period of 5 years during which integration of malaria management was achieved through local health systems. The reappearance of malaria in Sucre State, Venezuela, has been controlled and reduced by 60% in one year as a result of a change from universal house spraying to integrated vector control designed for each focus of transmission. Brazil has now concentrated its malaria control activities on 70 municipalities with high levels of transmission.CD37/27 (Eng.) Page 10 Notwithstanding these efforts, it must be realized that 38.9 % of the population of this Region now live in areas propitious for the transmission of malaria. Although 1,230,671 cases were registered in the Region in 1991, they may represent only a small fraction of what might be at least 2.2 to 5.6 million cases occurring in that year. 7. Dengue Prevention and Control (Resolution WHA46.31) New epidemics of dengue are occurring with increasing frequency in the Americas and Asia, fatality rates are rising and the presence of the dengue mosquito vectors, Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus, is rapidly spreading, causing a serious health hazard. The risk of transmission is being increased by population movements, unplanned rapid urbanization and increased numbers of people with poor water supplies. For these reasons, the Assembly adopted resolution WHA46.31 confirming that dengue prevention and control shoul.d be among the priorities of WHO. Member States are urged to strengthen national and local dengue prevention and control programs, ensuring monitoring and assessment by general health services ,and reinforcing surveillance measures. Cost-effective approaches can be used to reduce significantly dengue vector density and the risk of disease transmission, such as through improved vector monitoring, appropriate vector control and proper waste management. Member States should also expand diagnostic capabilities, increase the number of well trained staff at all institutional levels, improve community health education and encourage health promotion and better hygiene. The resolution also requests the Director-General to establish strategies to contain the spread of dengue, dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome, to draw up plans for emergency health cooperation against dengue outbreaks and to find extrabudgetary resources for support of national and international control efforts. During the 1980s there was a considerable increase in the magnitude of the dengue problem in the Americas, as well as a marked increase in the occurrence of dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS). The most important event in the history of dengue in the Americas was the outbreak of DHF/DSS which affected Cuba in 1981 and in which 344,000 cases were reported of whom 158 died. A second outbreak, occurring in Venezuela in 1989-1990, resulted in 70 deaths. Dengue epidemics are now occurring with greater frequency and affecting larger numbers of people. PAHO is carrying out a variety of technical cooperation activities to address the threat posed by these diseases. Specific control programs have been implemented in the English-speaking Caribbean and Central American subregions. In the latter, Finland is supporting control efforts particularly at the borders between Honduras, El Salvador andCD37/27 (Eng.) Page 11 Guatemala. Community participation has been the basis for control efforts in the English-speaking Caribbean with emphasis on vector control, a program receiving support from the Government of Italy. Recently, PAHO has developed guides for the prevention and control of dengue and DHS/DSS at the community level, based largely on the fact that effective control can be achieved by improving domestic sanitation with minimum resources and efforts. 8. Maternal and Child Health and Family Planning (Resolution WHA46. 18) The Resolution recognizes that despite the progress that has been made, much remains to be done in order to achieve the goals of health, development, and human rights for all members of society. The countries of this Region have committed themselves to these goals through various international forums and instruments (the Strategy for Health for All, the World Summit for Children, the International Conference on Nutrition, and the World Population Plan of Action). This affirmation holds true for our Region, where all the countries have accepted the goals related to maternal and child health, with the exception of the United States of America which has not yet signed the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. Nevertheless, some countries, such as Bolivia, Haiti, and Honduras, and the poorest areas of other countries with relatively poor indicators, are far from attaining the basic targets. The Resolution reiterates the priority that the Organization attaches to the health of women, children, and adolescents and again calls on the Member States to develop plans of action, including monitoring and evaluation, aimed at these groups. It requests the Director-General to ensure that the Organization strengthens its technical support and cooperation for the implementation of these plans of action; to submit to the WHO Executive Board in January 1993 an assessment of progress of maternal and child health/family planning programs in meeting the health and development needs of women, children, and adolescents; and to increase collaboration with other organizations. PAHO is working vigorously, together with an Interagency Coordination Committee, on the design, development, and monitoring/evaluation of national Plans of Action for the attainment of the goals set forth by the World Summit for Children in relation to mortality of mothers, infants, and children under 5 years of age; nutrition of women and children; family planning; diseases preventable by immunization, diarrheal diseases, and respiratory infections; prenatal and perinatal care; monitoring of growth and development; and care for children in especially difficult circumstances.CD37/27 (Eng.) Page 12 In view of the requests made and in order to achieve greater political mobilization in our Region, advantage will be taken of several regional meetings to be held over the next 18 months: the meeting of the Presidents of the Americas in Brazil (1993); the meeting to evaluate progress toward attaining the goals of the World Summit for Children to be held in Colombia (1993); preparatory and international meetings to be held in Cairo in connection with the International Year of the Family (1994); and preparatory meetings for the International Conference on Women to be held in Beijing (1995). A document for the Region will be prepared for use in these meetings and in response to the request of the World Health Assembly, describing regional plans and aspirations to achieve a higher level of health for the mothers and children of the Americas. Furthermore, the Regional Committee will discuss Family Planning, Reproductive Health and Population under Agenda Item 5.10. 9. Collaboration within the United Nations System -International Year of the Family (1994) (Resolution WHA46.27) The Resolution recognizes the importance of the family as the basic social unit; urges Member States to make every effort to achieve the objectives of the International Year of the Family; to determine which families are at risk; and to undertake operational research on the issue, as a crucial means for meeting the health and development needs of families; and requests support from the Organization in order to accomplish these goals. In the Region of Americas, the traditional family unit is undergoing substantial change as a result of the process of modernization and development, as well as the integration of women into the labor force. These changes have manifested themselves in a progressive replacement of extended families by nuclear, single-parent families and an increase in family breakup. Moreover, the loss of family support has not been offset by the establishment of social support networks, including, for example, child care and preschool education. Both the Member States in this Region and PAHO should continue to contribute in the preparatory meetings for the International Year of the Family, one of which will be held in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, from 16 to 19 August 1993. It is also suggested that the countries include in the report to be submitted to the ninety-third meeting of the Executive Board of WHO (pursuant to Resolution WHA46.18) the progress that has been made in this respect, in order to ensure coherence in the implementation of the resolutions on the same population group.CD37/27 (Eng.) Page 13 10. Emergency and Humanitarian Relief Operations (Resolution WHA46.6) Significant strides in disaster preparedness and management have been made throughout Latin America and the Caribbean in recent years. However, the Region's vulnerability to both natural and potential man-made disasters remains. Social and economic factors, urban population growth and settlements in vulnerable areas constitute additional risks. While most countries have now established Preparedness Departments in their Ministries of Health with trained competent staff, many of these departments are still without permanent funding, especially in those countries undergoing the most serious economic problems. Positive strides have been made in intercountry technical cooperation and resource sharing. The initiative to integrate preparedness issues into the curricula of health science faculties and schools of engineering in universities is succeeding, and a series of regional and country training workshops for foreign affairs and diplomatic personnel have led to continued requests for more of this type of training. Too often, natural disasters are ignored in the planning and design of hospitals and related facilities--even in areas where the risks are well known. These facilities must be able to withstand the impact of earthquakes, hurricanes, and other disasters and not themselves pose an added threat to their occupants. Structurally, many hospitals in Latin America are old; some date from Spanish colonial times. Others are contemporary, modem facilities but the lax application of antiseismic building codes may make their ability to withstand earthquakes, both structurally and non-structurally, questionable. The natural hazards that threaten Latin America and the Caribbean, and the special vulnerability of the health sector to disaster situations, justifies specific prevention and mitigation actions. It is these actions which are addressed in Resolution WHA46.6. Member States are urged to strengthen their capabilities for preventing and mitigating disasters and establishing comprehensive national programs to prepare for emergencies, to strengthen the capabilities of their health systems to prepare for emergencies, and to increase the allocation of resources in their health budgets to prepare for and respond to emergencies. The Director-General is requested to support and guide Member States in the strength- ening of capabilities to prepare for emergencies and to provide humanitarian assistance in the health sector. With substantial support from the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) and the United States Agency for International Development (AID), PAHO has provided extensive technical cooperation to the countries of the Region of the Americas in disaster preparedness and is playing a leading role in regional activities related to theCD37/27 (Eng.) Page 14 United Nations' International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction. In the coming years, the regional program will give increasing priority to disaster prevention and mitigation to prevent and reduce the effects of all types of disasters, including technological accidents, especially on hospitals and other physical facilities. Efforts will continue, in conjunction with the recently established UN Department of Humanitarian Affairs, to assist stricken countries to assess health sector needs in the aftermath of disasters and to coordinate and manage international disaster relief and in particular relief supplies through the Netherlands funded SUMA (Supplies Management) project initiated in 1992. 11. International Conference on Nutrition: Follow-up (Resolution WHA46.7) The Assembly considered the actions taken by the delegates to the International Conference on Nutrition, jointly sponsored by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and WHO, which was held in Rome in December 1992. In Resolution WHA46.7, it endorsed the Conference's World Declaration and Plan of Action for Nutrition. Specifically, this resolution urges Member States to strive to eliminate famine and famine related deaths as well as to reduce substantially the prevalence of chronic hunger and undernutrition especially among children, women and old people, to eliminate iodine and vitamin A deficiencies and to reduce the prevalence of iron deficiency anemia by the year 2000. It also urges the development and strengthening of national nutritional goals and their achievement through nine action-oriented strategies elaborated in the Plan. Furthermore, the Assembly requested the Director-General to support Member States in establishing and implementing national plans of action for nutritional improvement that emphasize self-reliance and community-based action. PAHO has already adopted substantial targets in line with the goals and strategies adopted in the Declaration. For example, one target, set to be achieved by the end of 1994, is for 85 % of the children in all of the countries of the Region to have a weight for height that comes within standards indicating normal nutritional status. Another target is to strengthen food and nutrition surveillance systems and to stimulate the use of this information in national policy-making and in the planning and evaluation of national food and nutrition programs so that interventions can be aimed at high-risk groups and the poorest sectors of society. Finally, goals have already been established, and plans of action adopted for the elimination of iodine and vitamin A deficiency in the Region of the Americas.CD37/27 (Eng.) Page 15 V. ADMINISTRATIVE POLICY MATTERS 1. Recruitment of International Staff in WHO (Resolutions WHA46.23 and WHA46.24) Two resolutions concerning the recruitment of international staff in WHO were adopted by WHA46, one dealing with the geographical representation of international staff and the second dealing with the employment and participation of women. To measure the distribution of the staff by geography, WHO has had a monitoring system which is divided into three categories: (a) under-represented countries; (b) adequately represented countries; and (c) over-represented countries. At the ninety-first session of the Executive Board (EB), the Director-General proposed that it would be beneficial to introduce a new, intermediate grouping of countries, those with representation within the range but below the mid-point, in order to achieve a more equitable geographical distributions of the staff of the Secretariat. The proposal was accepted by the EB and adopted by the WHA in Resolution WHA46.23. The change will require that those countries which were classified as (b) be split into two groups, denominated B1 and B2, depending on whether a country is at or below the mid-point of the range, or above it. As a result, the change will provide flexibility in efforts to improve the geographical balance of staff, as the aggregate of selections of candidates from countries in \"A\" and \"B1\" will be counted towards the 40% target set by WHA46. As of March 1993, countries of the Americas in the \"A\" listing are: Dominica, Grenada, Paraguay, Puerto Rico, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, and U.S.A. Those in the \"B1\" listing are: Antigua and Barbuda, Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Saint Vincent, Suriname, and Venezuela. Concerning the employment of women in WHO, the proportion of all professional and higher-graded posts occupied by women stood at 25.1 % in established offices and 24.3% at all locations, against the target of 30% set in 1985. The EB, therefore, decided to maintain the target of 30% but set a time-limit of 30 September 1995 for reaching it. The Director-General must present a report to the EB in January 1996 on the progress made during the period October 1991-September 1995. Resolution WHA46.24 endorsed the views expressed by the EB.CD37/27 (Eng.) Page 16 Insofar as PAHO/AMRO is concerned, the target of 30 % set by WHA has already been attained, organization-wide. At the level of PAHO Headquarters, the proportion of professional posts occupied by women has exceeded the target, i.e., 36% as of May 1993. Future efforts will therefore be focused on improving employment and participation of women at the country level. 2. Meritorious Within-Grade Increases (Resolution WHA46.38) The Executive Board (EB) considered, in January 1993, a report by the Director- General on meritorious within-grade increases, following recommendations on the subject by the International Civil Service Commission (ICSC) and the United Nations General Assembly. At issue was the practice of WHO of granting additional salary steps upon completion of 20, 25, 30 and 35 years of satisfactory service. The EB recommended that, in view of the Organization's commitment to the common system, the WHO's extended scale and the practice of awarding additional salary increments for 20, 25, 30 and 35 years of service be abolished as of 1 March 1993 for all staff recruited on or after that date. The EB considered, however, that the situation of serving staff called for further review and recommended that things be left as they are pending examination by the WHA in May 1993. Resolution WHA46.38 was crafted with the interests of WHO staff in mind, in consultation with the Division of Personnel and with the benefit of advice from representatives of the WHO Staff Association, the Federation of International Civil Servants' Associations (FICSA) and the International Civil Service Commission (ICSC). The Resolution provides for a one-time merit increase in salary for eligible serving WHO staff at either 20, 25, 30 or 35 years of service. There would be no further increases (except for promotion) once that increase has been awarded. The scheme of granting meritorious within-grade increases has been in operation in PAHO as it has been in WHO. Considering the principle enunciated by the Governing Bodies of PAHO that the employment conditions of PASB staff be in conformity with those of WHO staff, the Executive Committee at its June 1993 Meeting, amended the Staff Rules of PASB to reflect the revised arrangements on meritorious within-grade increases which have been approved by WHA46. (See Agenda Item 5.6.) 3. Salaries for Ungraded Posts and the Director-General (Resolution WHA46.25) The Executive Board (EB) in January 1993 approved a revised base/floor salary scale for the professional and higher categories of staff, incorporating an increase of 6.9% through the consolidation of post adjustment classes into net base salary, on the basis of the \"no loss -no gain\" formula.CD37/27 (Eng.) Page 17 As a consequence, the EB recommended to the World Health Assembly (WHA) that adjustments to the remuneration of the Assistant Directors-General, the Regional Directors, the Deputy Director-General, and the Director-General should likewise be made on the basis of the same formula. Resolution WHA46.25 endorsed the recommendations of the EB. It has been the policy of the PAHO Governing Bodies to equate the salary of the Director with that of the Deputy Director-General. The Directing Council will consider this issue under Agenda Item 6.4. VI. MISCELLANEOUS 1. Health Development in a Changing World--A Call for Collective Action (Resolution WHA46. 17) Resolution WHA46.17 expresses deep concern about the deteriorating health and social conditions of the people in some of the least developed countries. It calls on all Member States to continue to elaborate and implement health policies aimed at reducing inequalities in health improving access to health care, and promoting healthy life-styles, better nutrition and a healthy environment. It calls on developed countries to facilitate the transfer of technology and resources to developing countries for health development programs. It also calls upon them to provide WHO with the financial resources to implement programs which support effectively the efforts of developing countries in accelerating the implementation of health for all through primary health care. 2. Health Assistance to Specific Countries (Resolution WHA46.28) This resolution refers to the consequences of the recent disaster caused by the \"Storm of the Century\" in Cuba earlier this year, which severely affected the population, agricultural and industrial activities, and in particular health services. The Assembly requested WHO to extend the necessary assistance to Cuba in order to help overcome its present crisis in the health care sector. It called upon all Member States to contribute toward this objective. 3. Nonproprietary Names for Pharmaceutical Substances (Resolution WHA46. 19) The use of internationally recognized generic names for pharmaceutical substances is fundamental for the exchange of information on drugs. Since 1950, WHO has managed a program for selecting such International Nonproprietary Names (INNs).CD37/27 (Eng.) Page 18 It is important that the WHO-sponsored nomenclature system not suffer from the interference and confusion that is caused when products are placed on the market using brand names that are similar to those selected as INNs. This is becoming increasingly common as drugs that are no longer protected by patents are being marketed by various producers, and each one tries to distinguish its product through a brand name. Governments, with the support of PAHO, are promoting throughout Latin America the production and marketing of generic products as well as the use of generic names in prescribing and dispensing. Generic drug programs are becoming a major strategy to promote competition in the marketplace, increasing the availability of products at reduced prices to the consumer. Thus, it is important to maintain the integrity of the INN system to avoid confusing the physician, the pharmacist and the consumer. Resolution WHA46. 19 addresses the issue by requesting that Member States regulate the use of generic names and that the Director-General discuss, with industry, ways to minimize nomenclature problems. 4. Awards The Jacques Parisot Foundation was established for the purpose of awarding, every two years, a fellowship for research in social medicine or public health. According to the established order for nominating candidates, it was the turn of the Region of the Americas to submit candidates for the Fellowship award, the topic suggested for research being, \"Women, Health and Development.\" The 1993 fellowship was awarded to Dr. Maria Soledad Larrain of Chile. Dr. Larrain's proposed project is \"Intra-family Violence and the Situation of Women in Chile,\" with a special emphasis on the prevalence and characteristics of domestic violence against women. It is an innovative subject of research relevant not only to Chile but to the international community at large. 5. Executive Board Membership The Forty-sixth World Health Assembly elected 10 Member States entitled to designate a person to serve on the WHO Executive Board. From the Region of the Americas, Costa Rica was elected. Concurrently, the term of Dr. James O. Mason, designated by the United States of America, expired. 6. Forty-seventh World Health Assembly The Forty-seventh World Health Assembly will convene in Geneva, Switzerland, on Monday, 2 May 1994, at 12:00 noon. AnnexesCD37/27 (Eng.)
