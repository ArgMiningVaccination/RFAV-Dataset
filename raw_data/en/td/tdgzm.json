Unfortunately, in today's marketplace, there are so called \"skin care products\" that may be harming your skin more than helping. Using non toxic skin care products has several key benefits: Fewer Chemicals When shopping for skincare products, read the labels carefully, and know what those chemical names mean. Non organic products often contain synthetic, man-made chemicals such as sodium laurel, mineral oils, and toxins that could be residues of pesticides. On the label of a non-toxic product, you'll see fewer chemical names. More Natural Ingredients Non-toxic skin care products contain more natural ingredients. When you read the labels on these products, you'll recognize most or all of the items in the formulation, such as fruits, essential oils, vegetables, and flowers. You won't find fillers, silicon, parabens, sulfates, synthetic fragrances, retinol, petroleum distillates, artificial colors, sulfates, silicones, or minerals. Fewer Side Effects Many of the chemicals found in industrial skin care products can produce unwanted side effects. They can cause allergic reactions, with symptoms ranging from a slight rash to red, swollen, or peeling skin. In severe cases, you could experience swelling of the mouth, face, lips, tongue, or throat. With natural ingredients, these reactions are rare. Gentle on the Skin Though the synthetic ingredients in some products can produce immediate results, they can also cause harm over time. Natural and organic ingredients work in harmony with your body, allowing your skin to better balance and mend itself. Natural oils, honey, aloe, and shea butter may take longer to take effect, but they're better at producing smooth soft skin in the long run. Consider the Environment Since organic products use naturally grown ingredients free from pesticides and fertilizers, they don't negatively impact the environment. By using these products, you're supporting the sustainability of the world around you.
