Such type exercise was the need of the hour and essentially required in Ayurveda for the benefit of humanity across the globe. So Prakriti Assessment Questionnaire has been developed through various National Consultative Meets of experts on the basis of classical texts of Ayurveda during the last three years. This Manual contains the details of the methodology for capturing Prakriti of an individual which consists of measurement of measureable items, making observations as per defined SoPs and using questionnaires wherever required. I express my heartfelt indebtness to Prof Ram Babu AIIMS, New Delhi for their untiring efforts and step wise guidance in accomplishing this work. I am highly thankful to Dr.N. Srikanth, DDG, CCRAS and Dr M.M. Padhi, former DDG, CCRAS for giving their expert inputs and support from time to time. I heartily appreciate the efforts made by my team at CCRAS lead by Dr. Bharti consisting of Dr. Sarada Ota, Dr. Renu Singh & Dr. Lalita Sharma who worked day & night under my guidance to shape this document and make this long pending dream a reality. I acknowledge all the Investigators at 10 centres who helped in clinical validation of the questionnaire. I am also grateful to eminent experts from various reputed Institutions who rendered their valuable suggestions during various consultative meets for a fruitful outcome especially Dr. Shashi NIA, Jaipur. Dr T. Saketh Ram needs a high appreciation for his consistent efforts in developing PAS (Prakriti Assessment Software). I also thank the other officers of CCRAS - Dr. Sunita, Dr. Shruti and Dr. V .K. Lavaniya for rendering their valuable inputs from time to time and Dr Rakesh Rana & Dr Richa Singhal for statistical support. I believe this document will be useful for the Academicians, Researchers, Faculty, Clinicians and Scholars of Ayurveda and allied Sciences in understanding the methodology for Prakriti determination and its clinical application. The Council intends to keep this document dynamic; therefore, progressive constructive suggestions are always welcome. (Prof.Vaidya Kartar Singh Dhiman) Director General, CCRASINTRODUCTION Basic and natural frame work of living universe is decided in very primitive stage of fertilization and this psycho-somatic frame work is coined as 'Prakriti, ' a Sanskrit definitive term literally meaning nature/constitution / temperament in medical terms. Prakriti is an important basic concept of Ayurveda which describes constitution of an individual in relation to one' s physical, physiological, psychological and behavioural characters and is an integral constituent of Ayurvedic diagnosis, treatment and disease prognosis. Since last one decade, modern scientists and doctors have generated their belief in P4 i.e. Predictive, Preventive, Personalized and Participatory medicine. In spite of all modern researches, person to person variation in manifestation of disease and response of medicines in different individuals has led the scientists to look forward to understand the individualized approach of Ayurveda in treating the patients. Thus, the concept of Prakriti i.e. 'Individual constitution' has emerged as an interesting area for the researchers. With the emerging epidemic of NCDs (Non-communicable diseases), role of preventive and promotive medicine has gained a prime attention of the medical fraternity across the globe. Both these aspects need an individual participative approach for which the concept of Prakriti has main role to play. For promotion of health and prevention of diseases, lifestyle and diet advocacies vary from person to person according to Prakriti. However, the other influencing factors viz region, profession, age etc. should also be considered. Thus, it is very important to assess the Prakriti of a person carefully before any advice related to health and disease. Otherwise, it may lead a negative impact on the health status of a person. The characteristic features/ predictors mentioned in classical Ayurvedic texts are subjective in nature and the clinicians/Ayurvedic experts apply their own wisdom and experience to capture these predictors. At present, physicians, academic and research organizations researchers are using different questionnaires for assessment of Prakriti which are based on one or other classics. But the available questionnaires lack national consensus and standardization in content, format and methods to capture each predictor for assessment of Prakriti. This leads to variation in determination of Prakriti across time and space. Therefore, need emerged to develop a uniform method for capturing the attributes for Prakriti assessment for wider applicability based on scientific footings. Hence, a Standardized Prakriti Assessment Tool is the need of the hour. Considering the above facts, Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences (CCRAS), being an apex organization under Ministry of A YUSH, Govt. of India, New Delhi has undertaken the initiative to develop the 'Prakriti Assessment Scale' with rationality, reliability, validity & reproducibility. Capturing of each predictor is clinically important to decide the Prakriti. The method of capturing the predictors have been discussed in great detail with learned physicians, researchers and academicians of Ayurveda and various specialties of modern science in light of Classical texts of Ayurveda. After multiple national consultations, the methodology to capture each and every predictor clinically has been decided / developed by adopting necessary sequential steps on scientific lines in consultation with Biostatistician and a Prakriti Assessment Questionnaire/Scale has been prepared. The predictors are broadly grouped into four traits viz. physical, physiological, psychological and behavioural traits, which are further sub-grouped into various domains e.g. built, appearance, skin texture etc. One of the following three methods (as applicable) has been adopted for capturing the Prakriti deciding predictors: (i) The Anthropometric predictors which could be quantified may be measured by appropriate scale. (ii) Some predictors can be easily captured by simple observation like skin colour, hair colour and other physical appearances etc. (iii) Specific questionnaires have been developed to capture various subjective predictors pertaining to Physiological (Sleep, Appetite, Sweating, etc.), Psychological (Indecisiveness, Memory, Friendship, etc.) and Behavioural traits (Brave, Egoist, Forgiving etc.). Likert scale has been used for capturing the answers of most of the questionnaire. Primary feasibility / inter- rater agreement study (double blind) for validation of the Prakriti Assessment Questionnaire/ Scale has been carried out through multi-centric studies. The Questionnaire/ Scale has been assessed on 50 participants by two Investigators separately at 10 participating centers which includes 06 viz. NIA Jaipur; AIIA, New Delhi; CBPACS, New Delhi and IPGT&RA, Jamnagar. The data generated on 500 healthy volunteers at 10 centers has been subjected for Kappa analysis to see inter rater agreement. The questions framed for Prakriti assessment which showed moderate, good or very good agreement (kappa > 0.41) were taken as valid questions and included in the scale. Accordingly, the results were discussed in consultative meet with the investigators and experts. During this meet few non-specific questions were dropped and few others were modified accordingly. The modified Questionnaire/Scale was again subjected to data generation for 10 healthy volunteers at each identified centre (10 in total). Thus the data generated on 100 volunteers in this phase was again analyzed statistically using Kappa and weighted Kappa. The modified questions showed statistically significant Inter rater agreement and thus were accepted in the scale. To make the questionnaire brief & apt, the Prakriti Assessment Questionnaire/ Scale was further subjected to Confirmatory Factor Analysis (a statistical method) using PCA (Principle Component Analysis) to refine it further as a process of Questionnaire development based on inputs of experts. In the final step, in addition to the Predictors selected on the basis PCA, the predictors which were very-very important clinically and which have reliable responses and definite outcomes were retained in the questionnaire. Reliability testing of the Prakriti Assessment Scale has also been carried out on 100 participants each for inter-rater reliability testing and intra-rater reliability testing. Thus the validated Standardised Prakriti Assessment Scale has been developed which can capture the Prakriti of an individual with rationality, reliability, reproducibility and maximum objectivity. This document embodies the Standard Operative Procedures (SoPs) for capturing each and every predictor for assessment of Prakriti. For the easy application of this questionnaire, a web based software \"A YUR Prakriti Web Portal\" has also been designed which is more user friendly. The Standardized Questionnaire/ Scale may be used in future by Researchers, Clinicians and Academicians of Ayurveda. However, all the rights of its application are reserved with Director General, CCRAS, Ministry of A YUSH, Govt. of India. Some of the photographs have been used from various open sources just as an example for academic interest only, for which there is no claim or copyright of CCRAS. Training for assessors is required before putting this Questionnaire/ Scale in use for Prakriti assessment which in due course of time may be provided by CCRAS.INDEX Content Page No Foreword Preface i-ii Introduction iii-v Standard Operative Procedures 1-65 1.

For normal male and female, the waist hip ratio in Males < 0.9 & Females < 0.85 Confounders: Hypothyroidism, Hyperthyroidism, Diabetes Mellitus, Tuberculosis, Long standing infections, Malnutrition and other endocrine disorders. b) Question to exclude these disease conditions: Whether your physical appearance has been same since beginning or for last 10 years. If not, since when physical appearance has been changed? Any history of probable disease / cause that might have changed your appearance.2 Manual of SOPs for Prakriti Assessment Note: Incase if any confounder is present which is affecting the weight, then the present weight may be excluded and the previous weight of the participant (during healthy condition) may be enquired and recorded. CONCLUSION: The participant is found to be- Apachita (Vata=1mark) / Upachita (Kapha=1 mark) / None = 0 mark (To be filled in the Prakriti assessment questionnaire 1.2. HEIGHT a. As per Ayurveda, 84 angulaparva is the standard height of a person measured by his / her own finger. (Charak Samhita,Viman Sthana, Chapter- 8/117) Methodology for measurement of height by Angulapramana: a) Spread palm with fingers touching each other without gap and measure the breadth of four fingers (except thumb) together. Measure the breadth of palm with the help of Vernier Caliper on dorsal surface of the palm. For this place the palm on the table in such a way that the ventral surface touches the table. Measure at proximal inter-phalangeal joint of the index finger at one end and distal inter-phalangeal joint of the little finger at the other end in centimeters. Divide the same by four to get the measure of \"angulapraman\". Multiply the value by 84 which should be the standard height for that subject. Note: Measurement may be taken of Right hand in right handed people& Left hand in left handed people. The Vernier Caliper should just touch the fingers without pressing. For more accuracy digital Vernier Caliper can also be used. (a) 1 (b) Figure 1. showing Angulipramana measurement with the help of Vernier Caliper 1Courtesy: CCRAS, Hqrs. New Delhi.Manual of SOPs for Prakriti Assessment 3 b) Measure the actual height of the subject in centimetre and see whether it is more than or less than the standard height calculated in point 'a' above. c) To assess the results - Range for normal height is 80-88Angula < 80angula - Short height >88Angula - Tall height E.g. suppose breadth of the palm as per the methodology mentioned above of Mr. 'X' is 7.6 cm. Angulapramana = 7.6 \u00f7 4= 1.9 cm. Multiplying this figure (1.9 cm) by 84, the standard height as per Angula pramana =1.9 x 84 = 159.6 cm. 80angula = 1.9 x 80 = 152.0 cm 88angula = 1.9 x 88 = 167.2 cm So if the actual height of Mr. 'X' is less than 152.0 cm Mr. 'X' is short. If the actual height of Mr 'X' is more than 167.2 cm, Mr. 'X' is tall. Note: The standard height will vary from person to person depending upon the breadth of the four metacarpo-phalangeal joint (excluding thumb). CONCLUSION: The participant is found to be - Tall (Vata = 1 mark) / Short (Vata= 1 mark) / Medium = 0 mark (Not to be ticked in the format) (To be filled in the Prakriti assessment questionnaire) 1.3. APPEARANCE a. observed by the assessor on exposed parts as shown in images below. (Confounder - ageing, varicose veins) 2 3 CONCLUSION : Yes (Vata = 1 mark) / None = 0 mark 2 Image courtesy - www.thegreatfitnessexperiment.com 3 Image courtesy - www.vericoseveins.org30 Manual of SOPs for Prakriti Assessment CONCLUSION : If (a), the subject is having fast eating habit (Laghu Ahara / Chapala Ahara), Vata = 1 mark If (c), the subject having slow eating habit (Manda ahara), Kapha above attributes, the assessor must exclude following conditions e.g. Diabetes Mellitus, Diabetes Insipidus, Hot chilli food, Spicy & Salty food, Tobacco, climatic conditions (temperature & moisture) etc. The participants may also be enquired whether he/she is drinking water as per natural urge or as advised for health. Methodology: The subject is to be asked the following questions to assess his / her thirst (Pipasa) (i) When you feel thirsty and water is not instantly available, how you react? (a) Immediately search for water (b) Wait for sometime (ii) How much water / liquids do you take per day approximately? (a) < 1 litre per day (b) 1 - 2 litre per day (c) > 2 litre per day (iii) How frequently you take water/fluids in a day? (a) 4 times - Less frequency (b) 5 - 7 times - Normal frequency (c) > 7 times - High frequency Manual of SOPs for Prakriti Assessment 35 3. PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAITS 3.1. ask the following questions to the subject to assess his / her decision ability - (i) After taking a decision, how often youfeel the need to change your decisions? (a) Often (b) Sometimes (c) Rarely CONCLUSION: If the answer to question (i) is (a), then the subject is havingindecisiveness (Anavasthita atma 4/72) If the participant is able to grasp new information quickly, he/ she may be considered as Shrutagrahi. Else, if his/her grasping is delayed he/she may be considered as Chiragrahi. To assess Shrutagrahi / Chiragrahi any small story may be narrated and story based questions may be asked to the participant. The informative questions should be preferred and analytical questions should be avoided. The participant who answers 60 % or above correctly may be taken as Shrutagrahi. Two examples with possible methodology are given below. However, the prose can be changed as per the region, language and educational status of the participant. Methodology: A small prose as given below may be spoken to the subject (may be recited maximum two times). Thesubject should be advised to listen attentively. The questions below the prose may be asked from the subject to assess his / her comprehensive ability. Note: Any one prose may be recitedManual of SOPs for Prakriti Assessment 49 CONCLUSION: If answer to question (i) is Yes and (ii) is (c) or/and (d), then the subject keep strong enmity (Dridhavairam), Kapha = 1 mark, (Ref:Ashtanga Hridya ShariraSthana 3/99) With the help of conversation made by the investigator with the subject while administering the questionnaire, he / she are to assess whether the subject is Polite / humble in his manners. (i) Do you remain polite even in stressful / unwanted / anxiety conditions? (a) Rarely (b) Sometimes (c) Often (ii) The opinion of a friend / someone accompanying the participant may be taken on his nature as - (a) Rude (b) Soft & Submissive (c) Aggressive CONCLUSION: If answer to question (i) is (c) and / or question (ii) is (b), then the subject is Polite and humble (Vineeta), Kapha = 1 mark, None = 0 mark.Manual of SOPs for Prakriti Assessment 87 90 Manual of SOPs for Prakriti Assessment Annexure - III Members of Working & Consultative groups Technical Advisory Group 1.
