F uture studies will a) evaluate whether sporadic diverticulitis patients have such a defect using immunohistochemical( IHC) staining of harvested tissues, and b) develop a knock -out animal model of compromised lambda beta 4 expression. 2) Genes/variants suggest ed to be possibly involved with the pathogenesis of diverticul ar disease from the 3 studi ed families (see tables below in Section 17 ) will be investigated in a group of 180 sporadic diverticulitis patients (already recruited with specimens available into t he Division of Colorectal Surgery's \"Colorectal Diseases Biobank\"). The 4 top 3 -5 genes identified from the three families studied to date will be sequenced in the 180 sporadic patients to determine whether gene variants found in the family cohorts, may also be found in sporadic disease possibly as spontaneous mutations. 3) Possible collaborations with other groups (e. g., eMerge , Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network, a multi -institutional gene bank containing DNA specimens from thousands of patients with well characterized disease processes ) to achieve sufficient patient samples to perform a genome wide association study for diverticulitis (GWAS ). 13.

DO NOT DELETE THESE INSTRUCTIONS. Diverticulitis is a common inflammatory condition of the colon usually affecting older individuals with about 1 -2% of the American population requiring surgery that can be life - threatening and disabling. However, it is also seen in youthful individuals with affected family members suggesting a genetic basis for the disease. Our hypothesis is that there are host genet ic factors that predispose the individual to the development of diverticulitis, the identification of which can help in disease management and decision making as well as directing future research into the pathophysiology of the ailment. The research aim of this project is to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP's) associated with diverticulitis requiring surgery. We plan to do this by studying a group of individuals very likely to have such genetic SNP's, specifically youthful individuals with sev ere disease(requiring surgery) and their family members some of whom are als o affected with diverticulitis. From our well established, IRB approved biobank, we presently have approximately 20 such individ uals from 4 different families. Our specific aims for this project are: A) To perform total exome sequencing of approximately 22 individuals from 4 family cohorts containing at least one individual below the age of 50 with diverticulitis and at least one other first degree relative with diverticulitis. 7 B) To per form statistical analysis on the genomic data so developed from (A) to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP's) or insertion/deletions that are associated with diverticulitis. Specific Aim A: We completed whole exome sequencing and genetic analy sis looking for SNP's and genes of interest on 3 of the 4 families (190, 231, 24 2) from the original proposal. Family 159 was not investigated because there was no recruited member that did NOT have diverticular disease and thus represented a much less inf ormative study group. We have pursued further recruitment of individuals from this family 159 to make the family more informative from a genetic standpoint, but divorce, death, distance and poor relations between family members have prohibited further recruitment during the period of this grant. However we continue to pursue recruitment, hoping to contact a family member (divorced spouse, living at a distance) that would render this family more informative. This family however may still be utilized in our s ubsequent studies to possibly confirm or refute SNP's/genes found in other investigations. The pr ocess/methodology of whole exom e sequencing of study patient s used the Hi -Seq sequencer present in the Institute of Personalized Medicine. Steps of specimen p reparation and assay included: a) Sample DNA Fragmentation: Genomic DNA was prepared /isolated from whole blood using a QiaSymphony DNA robot and quality/concentration assessed using pico green quantification. Genomic DNA was fragmented using a Covari s E220 f ocused - ultrasonicator. b) Illumina Library Preparation: The Apollo 324 Library Prep System was used to prepare libraries for sequencing. c) Exome Enrichment Cluster Generation: SeqCap EZ Human Exome Library v3.0 enrichment was used. d) Sequencing and Basecalling: S equencing was performe d on an Illumina HiSeq 25 00 machine. Specific Aim B: Raw data generated from HiSeq analysis was analyzed as follows. We first performed quality control on the FASTQ files (raw reads) by using FastQC1 software to make sure the sequen cing data wa s of high qu ality and there wa s no syst ematic bias (such as GC content ). Next we aligned the FASTQ files to human genome (hg19) with BWA .2 The alignment results were then converted to SAM format (Sequence Alignment/Map), which contains many fea tures that are critical for downstream analysis. The SAM file s were then converted to BAM (binary Alignment/Map) format , which is essentially a compressed file and indexed for faster data access. We then used the Picard3 tool to remove the PCR duplicates d ue to amplification biases in PCR. Small Indels at the end of sequence reads are known to lead to false positive SNPs and therefore need to be identified . To solve this problem, we performed local realignment around indels using local realignment tools fro m the Genome Analysis Tool Kit (GATK ).4 The base 8 quality score for sequencing reads c ould contain bias and thus l ead to false positive SNP calls. We recalibrated the base quality score with the following functions (CountCovariates and TableRecalibration ) from GATK. Finally, we made the SNP calling with GATK UnifiedGenotyper program and saved the output in a VCF file . The single nucleotide variants (SNVs) obtained from the above described 'pipeline' consisted of the SNVs that matched the pattern of inherit ance for each family. The data was further truncated by removing all SNVs that were present in the population with a frequency greater than 1/1000 for all families. For families 190 and 231, the remaining SNVs were then condensed down to a list of genes th at the variants were present in. Family 242, due to its multiple diseased and non - diseased members across multiple generations was particularly informative. It was subjected to two methods of analysis. The first was performed using SnpEff, a software whic h categorizes the variants and predicts the effect of those variants on genes (http://snpeff.sourceforge.net/SnpEff.html ). Using this technique, a list of highly damaging variations matching the inheritance pattern of diverticulitis within the family was p roduced (see table below). Following this, a second analysis was performed in a similar fashion for families 190 and 231, yielding the tables displayed below for the three families. Further studies, beyond Specific Aims of Origin al Grant: Using the above approach, LamB4 stood out as a likely candidate gene as the causal variation for the inherited divertic ulitis observed in family 242. In order to verify the validity of the SNV observed in LamB4 in family 242, the exome sequencing results from the Illumina HiSeq were Family 190 Chromosome Location Gene Gene Name Gene Description Possible Relation to Diverticulitis 1 1 12175729 TNFRSF8 Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 8 TNF-receptor Regulates immune response 2 5 112439941 MCC Mutated In Colorectal Cancers Tumor suppressor gene Regulates cell growth 3 6 30993377 PBMUCL1 Mucin 22 Gastric glycoprotein 1 T Lymphocyte Receptor protein Polycystic Kidney disease is a known risk factor for Diiverticulosis /it is 5 11 125659371 PATE3 Prostate And Testis 6 12 10149851 CLEC1B C-Type Lectin Domain 1, Member B Receptor that cytotoxicity and cytokine secretion Regulates immune response 8 18 21511089 LAMA3 Laminin, Alpha 3 Regulates extracellular matrix organization Cytoskeletal rearrangement 9 18 47563299 MYO5B Myosin VB Regulates plasma membrane recycling Cytoskeletal rearrangement 10 21 46314907 ITGB2 Integrin, Beta 2 (Complement Component 3 Receptor 3 And 4 Cell surface integrin protein Cytoskeletal rearrangement Family 231 Chromosome Location Gene Gene Name Gene Description Possible Relation to Diverticulitis 1 1 240370985 FMN2 Formin 2 DCTN4 Dynactin 4 (P62) Cytoskeletal BCLAF1 BCL2 -Associated Transcription Factor 8 144940230 EPPK1 Cytoskeletal matrix protein Cytoskeletal rearrangement 5 TNFRSF10A Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 10a TNF-receptor Regulates immune response 6 10 135440216 FRG2B FSHD Region Gene 2 Family, Member B Transcriptional regulator Associated with muscular dystrophy 7 11 77937657 GAB2 Growth Factor Receptor Bound Protein 2 -Associated Protein 2 Cytokine signal transduction Regulates immune Acid Receptor 3 G-protein coupled receptor Heredity motor neuropathy 10 17 48276811 COL1A1 Collagen, Type I, Alpha 1 Collagen matrix protein Associated with Ehlers -Danlos syndrome Family 242 Chromosome Location Gene Gene Name Gene Description Possible Relation to Diverticulitis 1 5 115394456 ARL14EPL 7 100028159 PPP1R35 Phosphatase 1, Regulatory Subunit 35 Cytoskeletal rearrangement 3 7 107738905 LAMB4 Laminin Beta 4 Regulates extracellular matrix organization Associated myopathies 4 12 54686662 NFE2 Nuclear Factor OXA1L Oxidase (cytochrome C) Assembly 1 -like Regulates expression of complex 1 in mitochondria 6 14 55169050 SAMD4A Sterile Alpha Motif Domain Posttranscriptional regulator 17250157 NT5M adhesiveness lymphocytes response 9 19 55263886 KIR2DL3 Killer Cell Immunoglobulin like Receptor, 2 Domains, Cytoplasmic Tail 3 Transmembrane glycoproteins Regulates immune response 10 9 confirmed via manual inspection using the Borad Institute's Integrated Genome V iewer .5 Following this In silico verification, Sanger sequencing was performed on family 242 to confirm the same SNV in LamB4 (Figures belo w). The results affirmed that the inheritance pattern matched that of an autosomal dominant pedigree, with each affected family member being heterozygous for the variant. We then attempted to identify variations in the tissue ex pression of LamB4 by performing immunohistochemistry (IHC). Unfortunately we had tissue only from the index, affected patient from family 242 and no related unaffected individuals . Thus, tissues evaluated for LamB4 expression were from 7 unrelated control patients, 7 unrelated patients with sporadic diverticulitis (both taken from the Colorectal Biobank) and the one sample from the index affected member of family 242. The control patients showed heavy staining of LamB4 antibody in the epithelial cells of t he colon and regions of the myenteric plexus. The sporadic diverticulitis samples showed similar staining as the controls in the regions of the myenteric plexus. However, the epithelial cells showed decreased staining relative to the controls. The patient from family 242 showed decreased staining in epithelial cells and near absent staining in the myenteric plexus (see figures below) . To verify the staining within the myenteric S100 the m yenteric plexus . Verification of G1303A variation observed in family 242 by Sanger sequencing of affected(left) and unaffected(right) patients Affected Unaffected 10 Collectively, these results suggest that the SNV identified in LamB4 within family 242 as a possible causal variation for the inherited familial diverticulitis . It correlates with altered tiss ue expression, suggesting an anatomic, if not potentially physiologic consequence in the organ affected by the disease process. A potential hypothesis or disease mechanism is suggested, relating to alteration in nervous function and/or motility of the colo n. Since the creation of diverticuli is felt to be due to increased intraluminal pressure (the consequence of motility), this finding is in keeping with our present but very incomplete understanding of the pathophysiology of diverticulitis.

Koltun, MD POSITION TITLE Professor of Surgery eRA COMMONS USER NAME WAKOLTUN EDUCATION/TRAINING (Begin with baccalaureate or other initial professional ed ucation, such as nursing, and include postdoctoral training.) INSTITUTION AND LOCATION DEGREE (if applicable) MM/YY FIELD OF STUDY Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Boston, MA BS 06/77 Biology Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA MD 06/81 Medicine A. Personal Statement I am a colorectal surgeon and my practice is 75% infl ammatory bowel disease patients and to a lesser degree the management of diverticulitis. I operate 3 -7 times per week on patients with inflammatory bowel disease and approximately 2 -3 times per month for diverticulitis. My four partners have a similar case load in aggregate. At our institution, we have an extensive research ente rprise taking advantage of all patients with colorectal disease as subjects of clinical trials but also u tilizing tissues and serum harvested at the time of surgery creating a Biobank that has DNA, serum, and tissue repositories for scientific investigations. This Biobank has been in place since 1998 and now contains approximately 1500 patients with their cor responding samples. The present study utilizes this Biobank to perform fundamental genetic and serum analysis of patients, specifically those suffering from diverticulitis. To date we have recruited approximately 80 patients with diverticulitis, including approximately 25 with youthful or familial diverticulitis. Presently we recruit between 5 and 10 patients per month with diverticulitis. Our laboratory has a full complement of researchers directly employed in the Division of Colon and Rectal Surgery that will support this grant, specifically, a PhD geneticist, Dr. Zhenwu Lin, 2 full -time technicians, and a Biobank data and tissue manager and patient recruiter. In addition, we have an established research relationship with Dr. Arthur Berg who is co -support ed by the Division of Colon and Rectal Surgery and the Dept of Public Health Sciences providing genetic statistical analysis of our work.

Personal Statement My researc h has been focused on understanding the fundamental mechanisms that control gene expression in mammalian cells. As a postdoctoral fellow in Dr. Bing Ren's lab , I developed a computational pipeline to predict cis -regulatory elements such as promoters, enhan cers and insulators based on ChIP -Seq data for a variety of histone modifications and transcription factors (Shen et al. Nature, 2012). In total, I identified nearly 300,000 candidate regulatory elements from 19 mouse tissue/cell types. These elements grea tly improved our understanding of the mouse genome and suggested potential function for 70% of conserved, non -coding sequences. More importantly , I developed an algorithm that was able to link thousands of enhancers to their target genes and revealed that the mammalian genome is organized into domains of coordinately regulated enhancers and promoters. This work provides a great resource for the annotation of functional elements in the mammalian genome and for the study of mechanisms regulating tissue -specif ic gene expression . I am also interested to study the 3D spatial organization of the mammalian genome, which has been shown to be important for gene regulation. I was a key member of the research team at Dr. Bing Ren lab that discovered the mammalian geno mes are organized into megabase -sized chromatin interaction domains and that the domain boundaries are enriched for house -keeping genes and CTCF binding sites (Dixon et al. Nature, 2012). In this project, we performed Hi -C experiments in mouse embryonic st em cells (ES) and brain cortex, as well as in human ES and IMR90 fibroblast cells. We found that t he domains are stable across different cell types and highly conserved across species, indicating that topological domains are an inherent property of mammali an genomes. Currently, I serve as one of the leading analysts of the mouse ENCODE project. In this project, we systematically mapped transcriptional activities, DNase hypersensitivity, transcription factor binding, chromatin modifications, replication dom ains and candidate cis regulatory elements for more than 100 tissue/cell type in the mouse genome, and compared them with those in the human genome. Through my active involvement in this project, I've gained extensive experience in integrative and comparat ive analysis and became an expert in handling a variety of next -gen sequencing data, including ChIP -Seq, RNA -Seq and DNase -Seq. In summary, based on my unique training and experience, I am well positioned to tackle the proposed problems . B. Positions and Honors.
