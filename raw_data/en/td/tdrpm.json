Many faculty members have extensive work experience in industry, to include working on consulting projects that have saved millions of dollars for clients in multiple countries over the years. The experiences and expertise they bring into the classroom will certainly help prepare the next generation workforce for the challenges of BAIS applications in industry. The Muma College of Business has a Center of Analytics and Creativity (https://www.usf.edu/business/centers/analytics -creativity/, Last visited: 12/06/2022). The activity of the Center directly aligns with the course content of the B.S. BAIS program. Last visited: in the current B.S. BAIS major--and will continue in the proposed program--to work on real industry-funded projects. This opportunity provides students the required real -life experience in an academic environment. In addition, the SISM faculty have experience with successfully administering the current B.S. BAIS major, the M.S. Business Analytics and Information Systems program, and the Ph.D. Big Data Analytics program. The analytics focus in the proposed program directly aligns with USF's Muma College of Business' mission \" The Muma College of Business leverages analytics and critical thinking as a means to advance student success, produce scholarship with impact, and generate innovation in partnership with our stakeholders.\" (https://www.usf.edu/business/about/mission.aspx , Last visited: 12/06/2022) The program will teach students how to use analytics in the business.

Need and Demand A. Describe the workforce need for the proposed program. The response should, at a minimum, include the following: current state workforce data as provided by Florida's Department of Economic Opportunity current national workforce data as provided by the U.S. Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics requests for the proposed program from agencies or industries in your service area any specific needs for research and service that the program would fulfill According to the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity 's website, the number of online ads for Florida jobs, as per December 2022, in related areas are listed in the following table . This table demonstrates the shortage of skilled bachelor degree holders in the State in these areas. Top Occupations in Demand for Florida \u2014 Bachelor's Degree Not Seasonally Adjusted Occupation Code Online Ads October 2022 Online Ads October 2021 Software Developers, Applications 15113200 7,285 6,242 Computer 1,277 1,529 Database Administrators 15114100 952 1,043 Software Quality Assurance Engineers and Testers 15119901 938 808 Source: Florida Department of The significant impacts of the BAIS program will be to meet workforce and economic development needs at all levels of employment. The following Lightcast data (also see Appendix I) highlights the number of for job postings over the past 12 months for graduates of program sin CIP Code 52.1301 CIP shows: Academics & Campus Environment Committee Copy - New Business - Action Items 21 Page 11 of 40 Revised 12-8-21 24,656 postings in the Tampa Bay region 89,678 postings in Florida 1,642,204 postings in the nation The Florida Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) to Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) crosswalk provided by the Florida Department of Education (published October 26, 2022) data indicates an increase nationally a nd statewide of employment opportunities in CIP Code 52.1301. The data indicates a 25 percent increase in Florida employment demand from 2021-2023 for Management Analysts, Information System Mangers, Information Research Scientists, and Operations Research Analyst. The same CIP - SOC crosswalk indicates an 18 percent increase nationally over the same period for the same jobs. Data Analytics and Data Science are among the hottest occupations in today's world. Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics ' website (https://www.bls.gov/oes/2020/may/oes_fl.htm#15 -0000, Last visited: 12/06/2022) show employment to be 220,900 within Florida with an average annual salary of $82,810, in job titles such as, Computer Analyst, Database Administrators, Information Security Analysts, Operations Research Analyst, and Data Scientist. According to payscale.com (http://www.payscale.com/research/US/Skill=Big_Data_Analytics/Salary , Last visited: 01/02/2023), annual salaries for Data Analysts are on average $11 9,000. A recent search (November 202 2) in LinkedIn jobs on \"Analytics\" alone yielded 15,000 jobs in the Tampa Bay area, 28,000 jobs in Florida and 102,000 in the USA. Another search using the same term on Indeed.com (url visited November 2022) yielded 4,940 jobs in Florida; a nd 400,000 jobs in the nation. This great shortage of skilled STEM personnel needs to be urgently addressed. It is imperative to train our future workforce in BAIS with a high -quality curriculum, taught by the distinguished SISM faculty. If enough graduates are not trained in the Tampa Bay area and across Florida, companies will work to find ways to fill the shortfall through transient employees and outsourcing. Outsourcing these high -skilled, high-paying jobs overseas is not a sustainable path for Florida's economy. The BAIS program at USF will provide a sustainable solut ion for a brighter future for the state and the nation. The current B.S. BAIS major helps students acquire skills that provide them with knowledge and skills that will enhance their ability to acquire certifications from several premier professional organizations. The same will be true for the proposed new degree. Here a few examples based on BAIS course content: SAS\u00ae Certified Base Programmer CCA Spark and Hadoop Developer Exam Cloudera Certified Administrator for Apache Hadoop (CCAH) DataStax Professional Certification on Apache Cassandra Society for Human Resources Management (SHRM) Certificate Microsoft Technology Associate Certified Professional in Python Programming Amazon Web Services ( AWS) Certified Solutions Architect - Associate AWS Certified Developer - Associate AWS Certified Big Data - Specialty The School of Information Systems and Management's A dvisory Board asked the School to focus on analytics, management science, data management, operations management area for this new degree program. The Advisory Board has representatives from Raymond James, Academics & Campus Environment Committee Copy - New Business - Action Items 22 Page 12 of 40 Revised 12-8-21 Citi Bank, Bank of America, Amgen, K -Force, Verizon, Amazon, Tampa General Hospital and Hillsborough County Public Schools Board, to name a few companies. The School has invested quite heavily in analytics -related research. Faculty members have published in the area of Information Systems and Analytics. The proposed program will help faculty members to focus more in the area and use of student resources to engage in analytics-related research. It will fulfill the local demand of such research and knowledge . B. Provide and describe data that support student demand for the proposed program. Include questions asked, results, and other communications with prospective students. According to internal data, USF's BAIS major (in CIP Code 52.1201) had a Fall 2021 headcount of 298 students. The UF and FIU Fall 2021 headcount in CIP 52.1301, undergraduate degree, was 351 and 362 respectively . (UF and FIU Fall 2021 enrollment undergraduate in CIP Code 52.1301, USF's headcount in Fall 2022 in 52.1201, the current B.S. BAIS major, has increased to 371, as per USF internal data (see table below). USF's B.S. BAIS major (CIP 52.1201) has evolved over time into covering competencies that aligns with the description for CIP 52 .1301 Management Science: \"A general program that focuses on the application of statistical modeling, data warehousing, data mining, programming, forecasting and operations research techniques to the analysis of problems of business organization and perfor mance. Includes instruction in optimization theory and mathematical techniques, data mining, data warehousing, stochastic and dynamic modeling, operations analysis, and the design and testing of prototype systems and evaluation models\" ( https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/cipcode/cipdetail.aspx?y=56&cip=52.130 , Last visited 12/06/2022.Consequenlty, we can conclude that there is growing demand for undergraduate programs i n CIP Code 52.1301 Management Science. USF intends to grow that enrollment gradually over the next five years with the increased focus on the analytics and management science in the program. The demand for an analytics- based program in Business is clear in the market, and USF intends to support this with the proposed B.S. BAIS program. Due to the high enrollment in the current B.S. BAIS in CIP Code 52.1201, a student interest/demand survey was not conducted. C. Complete Appendix A - Table 1 (1-A for undergraduate and 1 -B for graduate) with projected student headcount (HC) and full -time equivalents (FTE). Academics & Campus Environment Committee Copy - New Business - Action Items 23 Page 13 of 40 Revised 12-8-21 Undergraduate FTE must be calculated based on 30 credit hours per year Graduate FTE must be calculated based on 24 credit hours per year In the space below, provide an explanation for the enrollment projections. If students within the institution are expected to change academic programs to enroll in the proposed program, describe the anticipated enrollment shif ts and impact on enrollment in other programs. The current BAIS major (CIP 52.1201) will be terminated , and all students and resources will be moved to the proposed new B.S. BAIS program (CIP 52.1301). CIP 52.1201 will continue to offer the undergraduate m ajor in Information Assurance and Cybersecurity Management, which has a sustained enrollment over the last 5 years of approximately 50 students. The current B.S. BAIS major has annual sustained enrollments of more than 500 students. USF expects the enroll ment to be consistent in the proposed new degree with that of the current major in CIP Code 52.1201. The majority of students in the current B.S. BAIS major are FTICs or Florida College System transfers. Current USF data indicates that on average annually 20 upper-level students transfer from existing USF majors into the B.S. BAIS . Due to the low number of students who transfer into the current B.S. BAIS major, there is marginal impact on other majors at USF. Approximately 60-80 student come from upper-level transfers outside of the Florida College System. D. Describe the anticipated benefit of the proposed program to the university, local community, and the state. Benefits of the program should be described both quantitative ly and qualitatively. As previously mentioned in Section III.A., Data Analytics, Data Science, and Software Development are among the hottest occupations in today's world . A recent search (url visited: November 2022) in LinkedIn jobs on \"Analytics\" alone yielded 15,000 jobs in the Tampa Bay area, 28,000 jobs in Florida and 102,000 in the nation. Another search using the same term on Indeed.com (url visited: November 2022) yielded 4,940 jobs in Florida; and 400,000 jo bs in the USA. This great shortage of skilled STEM personnel needs to be urgently addressed. It is imperative to train our future workforce in BAIS with a high -quality curriculum, taught by the distinguished SISM faculty. If enough graduates are not trained in the Tampa Bay area and across Florida, companies will work to find ways to fill the shortfall through transient employees and outsourcing. Outsourcing these high -skilled, high-paying jobs overseas is not a sustainable path for Florida's economy. The BAIS program at USF will provide a sustainable solution for a brighter future for the state and the nation. The proposed BAIS program will add the following advantage s to Florida. 1. Increase availability of workforce with Management Science (Analytics) skills. This will attract more large data -focused enterprises to setup offices in Florida . 2. Enable local Florida resident s to create enterprises focused toward data analytics , creating more jobs in the region . 3. Help students navigate in todays' data-driven, complex world. 4. Establish Florida as a leading source of data analytics professionals. Academics & Campus Environment Committee Copy - New Business - Action Items 24 Page 14 of 40 Revised 12-8-21 5. Data analytics is the foundation of business and research in today's world. Thus , graduates with the data analytics skill -sets will help USF and the broader community. E. If other public or private institutions in Florida have similar programs that exist at the four- or six-digit CIP Code or in other CIP Codes where 60 percent of the coursework is comparable, identify the institution(s) and geographic location(s). Summarize the outcome(s) of communication with appropriate personnel (e.g., department chairs, p rogram coordinators, deans ) at those institutions regarding the potential impact on their enrollment a nd opportunities for possible collaboration in the areas of instruction and research. Business Analytics and Information Systems (BAIS) is an area of strategic emphasis under STEM. Undergraduate programs in CIP Code 52.1301 are currently offered at the University of Florida (UF) and Florida International University (FIU). USF 's program is consistent with these existing programs , while offering more extensive content in advanced areas of data analytics, complex systems development, and business intelligence. The BAIS program will explore ways to collaborate with the faculties at UF and FIU to increase the synergy and reach of the three programs across the state. USF's Muma College of Business ' Interim Dean, Gert-Jan de Vreede, communicated with chairs of the respective department s that have Information Systems and Analytics faculty members at University of Miami, Florida International University, the University of Florida, and Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University . He communicated USF's intent to offer such a program and sought suggestions/support in this regard. Please see Appendix K for a letter of support from FIU and email correspondence from other Florida institutions. FIU and Embry-Riddle University chairs have extended their explicit support for this program. The Interim Dean reached out to the Chair of the Department of Information Systems and Operations Management at the University of Florida and also to the Chair of the Department of Management Science at the University of Miami because both institutions offer a program in CIP Code 52.1301. F. Describe the process for the recruitment and retention of a diverse student body in the proposed program. If the proposed program substantially duplicates a program at FAMU or FIU, provide a letter of support from the impacted institution(s) addressing how the program will impact the institution's ability to attract students of races different from that which is predominant on the FAMU or FIU campus. The institution's Equal Opportunity Officer shall review this Section of the proposal, sign, and da te the additional signatures page to indicate that all requirements of this section have been completed. USF is committed to attracting and retaining a diverse student body and the steps taken to recruit for all programs will be used for the BAIS program as well. The College and School will implement the following approaches: SISM's personnel organize an annual Big Data Day where high school students interested in computer or related technologies are invited to USF. The students go through hands-on exercises in analytics to facilitate understanding about the field. In 2022, 600 high school students from Hillsborough County attended this program. Faculty members in SISM are involved in multiple federa lly-funded projects in collaboration with Hillsborough County Public Schools to promote analytics -related Academics & Campus Environment Committee Copy - New Business - Action Items 25 Page 15 of 40 Revised 12-8-21 courses in the high school s, which proves helpful when building relationship s with Hillsborough County Public Schools and attracting students to the program. In 2022, the Muma College of Business disbursed $900,000 in scholarships through the generous gift of donors. These scholarships help to retain students and keep them on the path towards graduation. The recently-founded Muma College of Business Bellini Center for Talent Development of Student Success offers a \"Credly\" badge to students to develop skillsets such as communication, resume build ing, and interview preparation . All MCOB undergraduate s tudents participate in the collaborative Citizen Data Science certificate that prepares them to prepare them for the analytics job market. This certificate is offered in association with Tableau, a data visualization tool. The University's Office of Admissions team facilitates recruitment of a diverse population of students using the following approaches , which will be used to recruit students in the proposed B.S. BAIS : Utilizes a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) System to manage prospective student information and to execute a communication plan consisting of mail, email, and phone call campaigns. Admissions has communication in place that is designed to reach and attract a diverse student body. An example includes sharing profiles and testimonials of current students and alumni who are from underrepresented populations. Attends college fairs in the local market , as well as visiting local high schools , to give presentations and provide information about USF across all three campuses and across all academic programs. Meets with prospective students at their high schools f or instant decision days in the fall and offer on-the-spot acceptance to qualified students. Students who do not meet admissions requirements at that time are given guidance on what they may do to strengthen their application. Purchases contact information of high school students who take the ACT and/or SAT to then communicate with them about USF and its academic programs. Admissions is then able to target students by demographics and geographic locations. Hosts open house programs, information sessions, and other events on campus for potential students. Visits local state and community colleges to attend events, set up information tables, and/or to speak to classrooms of students. The current B.S. BAIS major student body at USF is primarily from the greater Tampa Bay region. The proposed new degree program will be offered primarily face -to-face. Thus even though FIU has a similar program , USF's program will not impact FIU's program. Rather it will open up opportunities of an outstanding data analytics program in another large urban area in Florida--the greater Tampa Bay region. Please see Appendix K for a letter of support from FIU and email correspondence from other Florida institutions. Please note that letters of support internal to USF are not included because the program's major curriculum is contained within the School.

For degree programs in medicine, nursing, and/or allied health sciences, please identify the courses that contain the competencies necessary to meet the requirements identified in Section 1004.08, Florida Statutes. For teacher preparation programs, identify the courses that contain the competencies necessary to meet the requirements outlined in Section 1004.04, Florida Statutes. Not applicable to this program because the program is not a medicine, nursing, allied health sciences, or teacher preparation program. G. Describe any potential impact on related academic programs or departments, such as an increased need for general education or common prerequisite courses or increased need for required or elective courses outside of the proposed academic program. If the proposed program is a collaborative effort between multiple academic departments, colleges , or schools within the institution, provide letters of support or MOUs from each department, college, or school in Appendix D . The proposed major does not require additional resources for General Education or other required courses outside of the proposed academic program . All Business majors enroll in specific General Education and Business Foundation courses. The students in the proposed B.S. BAIS program will take the same courses as those in the current major (52.1201), with the exception of the few core courses that are currently required between the two majors in 52.1201 due to the shared core courses. Since the new B.S. BAIS program will replace the existing B .S. BAIS major (52.1201), a shared core set of courses is no longer required. Thus, the 52.1301 curriculum is more focused on analytics, data modeling, and management science concepts. H. Identify any established or planned educational sites where the program will be offered or administered. If the proposed program will only be offere d or administered at a site(s) other than the main campus, provide a rationale. The program will be offered across USF's three campuses: Tampa, Sarasota-Manatee, and St. Petersburg. Academics & Campus Environment Committee Copy - New Business - Action Items 37 Page 27 of 40 Revised 12-8-21 I. Describe the anticipated mode of delivery for the proposed program (e.g., face-to-face, distance learning, hybrid). If the mode(s) of delivery will require specialized services or additional financial support, please describe the projected costs below and discuss how they are reflected in Appendix A - Table 3A or 3B. The proposed program will be offered in a combination of online, hybrid and face -to-face classes. Though the objective is to offer the majority of major classes face-to-face on all campuses, the feasibility of offering such courses on the St. Petersburg and Saraso ta- Manatee campuses depends on enrollment. All major courses have gone through online conversions and quality checks by USF's Innovative Education team. Thus, these courses may be offered in HB and AD modality to give greater flexibility to students. No specialized services or additional funds are needed. J. Provide a narrative addressing the feasibility of delivering the proposed program through collaboration with other institutions, both public and private. Cite any specific queries made of other institutions with respect to shared courses, distance/distrib uted learning technologies, and joint -use facilities for research or internships. The proposed B.S. BAIS program will be offered solely at US F. There is no current plan to deliver the program in collaboration with other institutions. K. Describe any current ly available sites for internship and/or practicum experiences. Describe any plans to seek additional sites in Years 1 through 5. Not applicable to this program because the program does not require internships or practicums. The proposed program does not require an internship for completion. However, the program offers a three-credit hour elective (ISM 4940 Business Analytics and Information Systems Internship) for those students who are participating in a qualified internship and would like to apply elective credit toward the completion of the program. Some of the internship sites available are as follows: Global Electronics Testing Services , Bristol Myers Squibb , ReliaQuest, Ketone Technologies LLC , SiteZeus, Coca-Cola Beverages Florida, LLC, TD Synnex, JP Morgan Chase & Co. , Raymond James, Jabil, Southwest Florida Water Management District , USSOCOM, Citi Group, Hartford Funds. The College has no plans to add additional internship sites over the next five years. Additional internship sites maybe opened as the need arises and companies have availability. V. Program Quality Indicators - Reviews and Accreditation A. List all accreditation agencies and learned societies that would be concerned with the proposed program. If the ins titution intends to seek specialized accreditation for the proposed program, as described in Board of Governors Regulation 3.006 , provide a timeline for s eeking specialized accreditation. If specialized accreditation will not be sought, please provide an explanation. All Muma College of Business undergraduate programs, except for Hospitality Management, are accredited through the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB). Academics & Campus Environment Committee Copy - New Business - Action Items 38 Page 28 of 40 Revised 12-8-21 The B.S. Hospitality Management has specialized accreditation through the Accreditation Commission for Programs in Hospitality Administration (ACPHA) . The current B.S. Business Analytics a nd Information Systems major is accredited by AACSB. The major in CIP Code 52.1201 will be terminated when USF is approved to offer the degree in CIP Code 52.1301, which will also be accredited by AACSB. The current major is accredited through the Univers ity's SACSCOC accreditation , which will be the case for the degree program in 52.1301 . B. Identify all internal or external academic program reviews and/or accreditation visits for any degree programs related to the proposed program at the institution, including but not limited to programs within academic unit(s) associated with the proposed de gree program. List all recommendations emanating from the reviews and summarize the institution's progress in implementing those recommendations. The most recent AACSB program review for the programs in the Muma College of Business was January 28-30, 2018, with included the undergraduate degree program in CIP Code 52.1201. Following are the highlights of the feedback received from that review: 1. Brief description of major changes made since the previous program review: Addition of the Master of Science i n Sport and Entertainment Management (31.0504). Addition of the Doctor of Business Administration (52.0201) . A major revision of the undergraduate learning outcomes occurred since the prior review to better align with the college's new mission and strategi c priorities. This resulted in adjusting prior assessment processes and performance targets appropriately. Curriculum modifications were made to the following master's programs: Business Administration, Accountancy, Business Analytics and Information Syst ems, and Finance to include new and revised courses that better meet the changing business environment . A major push was undertaken to add online courses -resulting in a tremendous increase in online SCH -20 percent in 2015-2016 and 25 percent in 2016-2017. Most of our principles courses are now online as an option, along with the face -to- face sections. Several student success initiatives have been added - an executive internship with the USF Federal Credit Union, degree applicable internship courses in all m ajors, a collaboration with Sandler Systems, Inc to offer a required undergraduate \"soft skills course\" called Business and Workplace Skills and Best Practices. All programs offer a study abroad course at least annually. 2. Summary of current strengths of the program (Note: most are taken from the accreditation report) : The College has completed a robust strategic planning process in consultation with the faculty. The College has succeeded in fostering and institutionalizing a culture of innovation and ben efits from a motivated cadre of faculty and staff who welcome change. The College has formed effective partnerships with software and service providers (e.g., Tableau and Sandler) to enhance the applied/practice -oriented components of the curriculum. Academics & Campus Environment Committee Copy - New Business - Action Items 39 Page 29 of 40 Revised 12-8-21 The annual Assurance of Learning process and the associated \"closing the loop\" have been adopted as part of their (College) identity and serves as a key point of pride. The College has highlighted student success as a key priority. The formation and naming of the Collier Student Success Center is noteworthy and central to meeting the needs of the undergraduate student body. 3. Summary of current weaknesses of the program : The AACSB Business reaccreditation team identified no current weaknesses in the Muma College of Business programs. However, as a College: o We continuously work to improve our AOL (assurance of learning) processes. With diverse faculty and multiple programs, the integration and effective measure of AOL is something we can always strive to improve. o We continually work to ensure qualified faculty are available to teach our courses. Increasingly , we have relied on adjuncts to meet the increased demand we see for courses. 4. Summary of recommendations and/or proposed action plans made as a result of the review The AACSB Business reaccreditation team identified no matters related to the accreditation standards. Consultative report on matters not related to the accreditation decision : o \"As the College raises its sights for hiring research faculty of increas ingly higher quality, there will be pressure to make competitive offers and put together competitive packages incorporating starting salaries, summer support (to support research), and teaching loads.\" o Graduate career support needs to become a priority. (A career coach has been hired.) o Consider more prestigious titles for non -tenure-earning faculty. (This is currently being considered and proposed.) o College should consider instituting five years of support for some doctoral students. (Currently offering fif th year support to star doctoral students, this is limited.) The AACSB review data was utilized to complete the seven -year academic program review report for the 52.1201 undergraduate degree program, which was submitted to the Florida Board of Governors' office on June 5, 2018. C. For all degree programs, discuss how employer -driven or industry-driven competencies were identified and incorporated into the curriculum. Additionally, indicate whether an industry or employer advisory council exists to provide input for curriculum development, student assessment , and academic-force alignment. If an advisory council is not already in place, describe any plans to develop one or other plans to ensure academic - workforce alignment . USF's Muma College of Business and the School of Information Systems and Management both have advisory councils/boards that consist of Tampa Bay area business leaders who provide advisory review of program curriculum, student performance, and industry demand. The links for these advisory councils/boards are as follows: 1. Muma College of Business (https://www.usf.edu/business/about/advisory -councils/, Last visited 11/21/2022); Academics & Campus Environment Committee Copy - New Business - Action Items 40 Page 30 of 40 Revised 12-8-21 2. School of Information Systems and Management (https://www.usf.edu/business/schools/information -systems- management/board.aspx , Last visited 11/21/2022). VI. Faculty Participation A. Use Appendix A - Table 2 to identify existing and anticipated full -time faculty who will participate in the proposed progra m through Year 5, excluding visiting or adjunct faculty. Include the following information for each faculty member or position in Appendix A - Table 2: the faculty code associated with the source of funding for the position faculty member's name highest degree held academic discipline or specialization anticipated participation start date in the proposed program contract status (e.g., tenure, tenure -earning, or multi -year annual [MYA]) contract length in months percent of annual effort that will support t he proposed program (e.g., instruction, advising, supervising) This information should be summarized below in narrative form. Additionally, please provide the curricu lum vitae (CV) for each identified faculty member in Appendix E. The proposal assumes t he initial headcount to be 390 , which translates to 325 FTE. In five years, we estimate the program to grow up to 500 students, with 417 FTE. A detailed analysis reveals, with a class size of 50 and the support of summer classes, these 417 FTE in Year 5 may be served across all three USF campuses --Tampa, St. Petersburg and Sarasota- Manatee--by the eight faculty mentioned in Appendix A Table 2. The teaching load of these faculty members have been determined based on their research productivity and the rank (tenure-track of non-tenure track). Additionally, based on the student enrollment in individual classes, some courses may be offered as AD or HB modalities to provide more access for students. All eight faculty members in the program ha ve terminal degrees (Ph.D./D.B.A.) in Information Systems, Business/Management, and various Engineering fields, such as C omputer Science or related fields and are currently funded through E&G funds . The eight individuals are full- time faculty members both in tenure track and non-tenure track positions. No additional funds will be needed to meet the salaries and cost s of these faculty members. These faculty are currently teaching in the B.S. BAIS major (CIP 52.1201) and will teach in the proposed program (CIP 52.1301) . The faculty members are recruited on a nine-month contract. Many will give at least 50 percent of their effort toward the program in the form of teaching, advising, and research in Year 1, and by Year 5, all eight faculty will give 50 -100 percent of their effort toward the proposed new degree program . The faculty members are very well achieved. All faculty members have met the highest AACSB standard (Scholarly Academic) as per the Muma College of Business policy (https://www.usf.edu/business/documents/about/aacsb -qualified-faculty.pdf, Last visited 12/06/2022) . The detailed credentials of the faculty members may be found in Appendix E. Academics & Campus Environment Committee Copy - New Business - Action Items 41 Page 31 of 40 Revised 12-8-21 B. Provide specific evidence demonstrating that the academic unit(s) associated with the proposed program have been productive in teaching, research, and service. Such evidence may include trends over time for average course load, FTE productivity, student HC in major or service cour ses, degrees granted, external funding attracted, a nd other qualitative indicators of excellence (e.g., thesis, dissertation, or research supervision). The following visualization s are from Academic Analytics , a tool available at USF that allows for benchmarking of like disciplines. The data below were retrieved using like faculty in all AAU schools. USF's SISM's faculty members (as represented by the red dot) are around the median in terms of faculty with an article and total number of articles in the last five years (2017-2022). The following data screenshot is taken from the Academic Analytic s' website (https://www.usf.edu/ods/data -tools/benchmarking_portal.aspx , Last visited 11/21/2022): As per Academic Analytics, some of the journals where faculty members have published are as follows. Academics & Campus Environment Committee Copy - New Business - Action Items 42 Page 32 of 40 Revised 12-8-21 Some of the grant amounts received by SISM's faculty members are as follows - (Source: Academic Analytics ) The following examples demonstrate that SISM faculty members have been productive in teaching, research, and service . Gert-Jan de Vreede and Alan Hevner were named the top Management Information Systems scholars from USF on a list that measures productivity and citations of a professor's work. Prepared by the University of Arizona, the list ranks academics' publishing productivity combined with the frequency their work was cited in other research. The h-index grades how influential a researcher's work is in the scientific community. (https://ailab-ua.github.io/courses/resources/h -index_mis_jan2019.pdf , Last reviewed: 01/04/2023) Alan Hevner is an American Association for the Advancement of Science ( AAAS) Fellow and was named a USF Distinguished University Professor in May 2017 for the impact of his research. Several faculty members have worked with businesses to conduct research that is being used for decision-making in the workplace . A few examples follow : Don Berndt and fellow USF researchers James McCart and Saurav Chakraborty worked with David Boogers of Finametrics.com to implement an agent-based model of the U.S. corporate bond market, with classes of agents that include mutual funds, insurance companie s and hedge funds. An agent -based model simulates the actions and interactions of individual autonomous agents to better understand the emerging system -wide dynamics of such complex systems.

Clinton Daniel received a grant from the Florida Department of Education for $630,000 to overhaul the Digital Information Technology course for secondary students. An example of Teaching and Learning Impact follows: SISM's faculty member Anol Bhattacherjee authored an open-source textbook that is among the top downloaded textbook among all colleges and universities using Digital Commons with 1.25 million downloads as of February 1, 2023. (2012, Social Science Research: Principles, Methods, and Practices, Global Text Project). Following are additional recent examples of specific evidence demonstrating that the academic unit(s) associated with the proposed program have been productive in teaching, research, and service: Matthew Mullarkey awarded a Core Fulbright Scholarship to Study in Ireland (https://www.usf.edu/business/news/articles/190207 -mullarkey-fulbright.aspx, Last visited 12/06/2022). Sunil Mithas awarded Scholar (https://www.usf.edu/business/news/articles/181004 -sunil-mithas-world-class- scholar.aspx, Last visited 12/06/2022). Researchers in the Muma College of Business' School of Information Systems and Management were ranked highly in the nation from 2017 to 2021 for the number of publications in journals, according to a ranking released in 2022 by the University of Texas at Dallas (UTD) (https://www.usf.edu/business/about/points - of-pride.aspx, Last visited 12/06/2022). The UTD 24 ranking counts only publications in the top 24 Business journals. VII. Budget A. Use Appendix A - Table 3A or 3B to provide projected costs and associated funding sources for Year 1 and Year 5 of program operation. In narrative form, describe all projected costs and funding sources for the proposed program(s). Data for Year 1 and Year 5 should reflect snapshots in time rather than cumulative costs. Since this proposal is to create a program that replaces an existing one that has bee n in existence for a number of years, resources are already currently allotted to support the program. Salary and benefits are computed based on participant faculty members and their percentage FTE (Year 1=$1,177,518; Year 5=$1,455,312) as given in Table 3 A. Row 4 \"Salaries and Benefits (A&P and USPS)\" includes the portions of salaries of undergraduate advisors and staff who will support the proposed new B.S. BAIS program (Year 1=$23,289; Academics & Campus Environment Committee Copy - New Business - Action Items 44 Page 34 of 40 Revised 12-8-21 Year 5=$26,783). The staff and advisors' salaries are proportionally allocated based on all graduate, undergraduate and certificate programs in the School. The OPS (Row 5) includes the cost of the six Graduate Assistants and Students Assistants to support the program (Year 1=$110,073; Year 5=$126,584). The Programmatic Expe nses include the cost of additional software necessary to support the program such as Microsoft partnership and Amazon Web Services (AWS) partnership (Year 1=$15,000; Year 5=$17,250). A fifteen percent increase over five years in the cost of all line items in Table 3A is reflected in the table. This is to account for annual salary increases, cost of business increases, etc. The program will be fully supported through E&G funds. Thus, Table 3B has not been completed. B. Use Appendix A - Table 4 to show how existing Education & General (E&G) funds will be reallocated to support the proposed program in Year 1. Describe each funding source identified in Appendix A - Table 4, and provide a justification below for the reallocation of re sources. Describe the impact the reallocation of financial resources will have on existing programs, including any possible financial impact of a shift in faculty effort, reallocation of instructional resources, greater use of adjunct faculty and teaching assistants, and explain what step s will be taken to mitigate such impacts. The current B.S. BAIS major will be terminated. Thus , the E&G budget associated with the current B.S. BAIS major will be transferred to the proposed new B.S. BAIS program. C. If the institution intends to operate the program through continuing education, seek approval for market tuition rate, or establish a differentiated graduate - level tuition, as described in Board of Governors Regulation 8.002 , provide a rationale and a timeline for seeking Board of Governors' approval. Not applicable to this program because the program will not operate t hrough continuing education, seek approval for market tuition rate, or establish a differentiated graduate -level tuition D. Provide the expected resident and non -resident tuition rate for the proposed program for both resident and non -resident students . The tuition rates should be reported on a per credit hour basis, unless the institution has received approval for a different tuition structure. I f the proposed program will operate as a continuing education program per Board of Governors Regulation 8.002 , please describe how the tuition amount was calculated and how it is reflected in Appendix A - Table 3B. For the 2022-2023 academic year, the undergraduate tuition rate is $211.19 per credit hour for Florida residents and $575.01 for non -residents (https://www.usf.edu/business - finance/controller/documents/student -services/one_usf_undergraduate_tuition_rates_2022 - 2023.pdf - URL accessed on 11/20/2022). There is no plan to operate this undergraduate program through continuing education. E. Describe external resources, both financial and in -kind support, that are available to support the proposed program, and explain how this amount is reflected in Appendix A - Table 3A or 3B. Academics & Campus Environment Committee Copy - New Business - Action Items 45 Page 35 of 40 Revised 12-8-21 The current B.S. BAIS major is supported fully with existing E&G funds, and this will be the case for the proposed new degree program. VIII. Non-Faculty Resources A. Describe library resources currently available to implement and/or sustain the proposed program through Year 5 below, including but not limited to the following: the total number of volumes and serials available in the discipline and related disciplines all major journals that are available to the university's students The Library Director must sign the additional signatures page to indicate that they have review Sections VIII.A. and VIII.B.

Discuss any additional library resour ces that are needed to implement and/or sustain the program through Year 5. Describe how those costs are reflected in Appendix A - Table 3A or 3B. Not applicable to this program because no additional library resources are needed to implement or sustai n the proposed program. The proposed new B.S. BAIS program will replace the existing B.S. BAIS major. Additionally, the School offers a M.S. BAIS program. Thus, the Library has all required resources necessary to support the proposed B.S. BAIS program. No additional resources are necessary. C. Describe any specialized equipment and space currently available to implement and/or sustain the proposed program through Year 5. The School of Information Systems and Management has two dedicated computer labs located within the CIS Building on the Tampa campus . These dedicated lab environments are used by BAIS faculty to provide instruction to students on various technical courses across the campuses. No additional space is required. Additional resources are available digitally such as, Florida CyberHub, USF Research Computing and the USF Virtual Lab System s. D. Describe any additional specialized equipment or space that will be needed to implement and/or sustain the proposed program throu gh Year 5. Include any projected Instruction and Research (I&R) costs of additional space in Appendix A - Table 3A or 3B. Costs for new construction should be provided in response to Section X.E. below. Not applicable to this program because no new I &R costs are needed to implement or sustain the program through Year 5 E. If a new capital expenditure for instructional or research space is required, indicate where this item appears on the university's fixed capital outlay priority list. Appendix A - Table 3A or 3B includes only I&R costs. If non -I&R costs, such as indirect costs affecting libraries and student services, are expected to increase as a result of the program, describe and estimate those expenses in narrative form below. It is expected that high enrollment programs, in particular, would necessitate increased costs in non -I&R activities. Not applicable to this program because no new capital expenditures are needed to implement or sustain the program through Year 5. Academics & Campus Environment Committee Copy - New Business - Action Items 48 Page 38 of 40 Revised 12-8-21 F. Describe any additi onal special categories of resources needed to operate the proposed program through Year 5, such as access to proprietary research facilities, specialized services, or extended travel, and explain how those projected costs of special resources are reflecte d in Appendix A - Table 3A or 3B. Not applicable to this program because no additional special categories of resources are needed to implement or sustain the program through Year 5. G. Describe fellowships, scholarships, and graduate assistantships to be allocated to the proposed program through Year 5, and explain how those are reflected in Appendix A - Table 3A or 3B. Not applicable to this program because no fellowships, scholarships and/or graduate assistantships will be allocated to the proposed program through Year 5. The program offers very technical classes , and these classes are supported by graduate assistants (GA). The School employs a total of six GAs to support the courses offered for the current B.S. BAIS major. The proposed new B.S. BAIS (52.1301) classes will require similar support of six GAs in Year 1. A 15 percent increase from Year 1 ($110.073) to Ye ar 5 ($126,584) is expected in GA assistanceships due to increased operating costs.

Date: Sunday, December 4, 2022 at 2:32:29 PM Eastern GJ,This is wonderful news and surely is where the demand is heading. We are seeing similar trends hereincluding strong calls from industry. Whether it's pla=orm use (e.g., R, Python, Azure, AWS, SAS, etc.) or theneed to \"Design for Data\" these are absolutely hot topics. I would enjoy a call with you if you have the Kme because I am curious as to your thoughts on the blend ofconcepts needed for a BS in BA/IS. These types of 'acKon analyKcs' programs can someKmes lean towardsdata science, or decision making/decision support, or informaKon systems, or social/markeKng analyKcs, etc. It's a decent size list of possibiliKes with many dierent angles so I am curious as to how you turned the dialson your program from a posiKoning point of view.
