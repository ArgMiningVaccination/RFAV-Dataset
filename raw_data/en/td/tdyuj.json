Are you interested in sharing with your friends some of the spiritual experiences that have helped transformed your own life, and want to make sure that it can be a deep, genuine, but also enjoyable and all around fun experience? Do you feel that your family, group of friends, co-workers, or co-activists could benefit from some type of healing but would like to keep things low key and accessible to all? Are you looking for ways to more deeply support the people you work / volunteer / mobilize with, but don't feel that they are ready for a training per se? I facilitate on-site group rituals that are highly customized to the needs of each family or group and where the people are at. In 2 to 3 hours, I lead participants through a series of ritualistic experiences that are deeply healing / transformative and can be easily translated in the daily life. It is a very unique experience, that always opens up many doors for those who are part of it. I keep things deep and low key at the same time, and also make sure to explain everything as we go so that everyone can learn from the experience. Fee: Starting at $500 (depending on the numbers of participants, time and content) This was a truly transformative and groundbreaking experience. It literally changed my viewpoint on something essential about myself and my life story. (A participant in a workshop and group ritual - Washington DC, October 2017) I decided to do a group healing session with Beatrice for the people around me that I love and it was the best decision I've ever made. I had no idea how much my friends were going through in their lives just spiritually, mentally, and physically. Beatrice was able to connect and start healing each one of them in an extremely profound way. My friends had never done this before and didn't know what to expect with Shamanic healing but afterwards they all talked about how something had shifted within them for the better. We all can't wait to do it again either one-on-one or in a group. Beatrice is truly a gifted healer with so much love and compassion in her heart. She made us all feel so comfortable and relaxed. I am truly grateful for her! (E.S.Okano, Washington DC) On-Demand Group Training Are you interested in supporting the people you work with, and enhancing both their overall well-being and performance in high stress environments? Are you looking for ways to support yourself and your colleagues and prevent burnout in very effective, research-driven, ways? Are you wondering what can more deeply support your community or organization, beyond bringing mindfulness and yoga in the work environment? Are you looking to equip your leadership with concrete tools to lead from a place of compassion and care, and more resources to transform unhealthy dynamics and ignite creativity? This is for you! In partnership with a unique community of neuroscientists, experts and community leaders, I am offering highly customized training programs that will fit your specific needs and meet you where you are. Topics Here are some of the thematics that our program of trainings can cover: - Better managing stress in the personal and work environment - Creating your own ritualized experiences to transform dynamics inside your group, your team or your organization - Preventing burnout and building mind-body resilience in very effective, research-driven, ways - Tapping into the neural processes of compassion and self-compassion and its deliberate practice for stress relief and better leadership - Boosting creativity and innovation by tapping in deeper selves Methods In different formats (three hours to two full days), our training modules will lead you and your colleagues through highly transformative experiences. We have translated for you the latest research in neuroscience, to help you understand better how the brain functions and how it can be rewired, with the support of spiritual deliberate practices and rituals. This knowledge is articulated through very concrete skills and practices directly applicable to your life, your communities, and your organizations (for-profit and non-profit). Every individual, organization and situation can benefit from these insights and very concrete skills. Each is also different, and so are the challenges that you are facing. This is why we offer highly customized learning experiences and training opportunities to fit the needs of a wide variety of audiences, across multiple sectors and skill levels. But here is a crucial difference in how we do things, which reflects the way I also work one-on-one as a healer and a mentor. Instead of teaching you one way to breathe or practice mindfulness, or meditate: - We help you understand the underlying mechanisms of what is happening by having our best neuroscientists directly providing you with insights of the latest research, so that you know how to change your approach, adapt your programs, etc.; - We inspire you by giving you examples of practices from a wide diversity of cultural and spiritual background so that you can look at your own environment and experience and identify what might work best for you; - We help you create and put in place (as individuals, a group or a team) the rituals and deliberate practices that you will choose, based on your own resources and what you are already doing.

Reclaim your life. \"The intuitive mind is a sacred gift, and the rational mind is a faithful servant. We have created a society that honors the servant and has forgotten the gift.\"- Albert Einstein There are many times throughout our lives when we lose focus, feel stuck, and become stagnant. We may feel unmotivated, uninspired, even lost. Or we might just feel like we are going through the motion, having become the consumers of our lives, when we are not consumed by it. Does any of this feel familiar to you? You are not alone. How do we reclaim our lives? By reclaiming our intuition and finding the flow of our own life, once more. This has always felt to me as a uniquely important way to reclaim our birth right: being fully part of each moment, more in charge of how we interact with everything inside and out. It is what others may refer to listening to one's intuition - a process that goes beyond our own inner voice. It involves not only the body-mind-soul continuum but also everything that is alive around us. Indeed, intuition comes from that constant interaction between our inner and outer world, the same way our genes express themselves in our environment and change overtime accordingly. Here is my take on how this process of fully embracing the complexity and magic of this human experience. Ready? Come with me on this journey to strengthen your intuition, realign with your soul and reclaim your life flow! Access intuition "}
