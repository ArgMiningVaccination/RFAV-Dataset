It is stylish without being pretentious. - Treatments are a fusion of Thalassa, spa, contemporary wellness and anti-ageing solutions, providing you with an all-round well-being experience. - The spa facilities are adult-only ensuring optimal relaxation. - There is a comprehensive Longevity Vitality Activity Plan of group classes - There is a booking service for surrounding golf courses, meaning you don't have to waste time turning up and waiting around. - If you are a fish and seafood lover, the Terrace Grill prepares excellent fresh dishes. - For an added thrill, why not try some of the water sports available, including jet skiing, scuba diving and surfing. - The medicine aspect of the resort is really great for individuals with specific physiological ailments. Lows - The rooms are not super close to the main spa area, therefore if you struggle with mobility this might be an issue (although they do have golf buggies to get you around) - There is only one main restaurant option - The pool can be a bit chilly "}
