Reiki is an energy healing technique where a practitioner locates the energy fields around the body, and then transfers universal energy from their palms to the client. This work can be done both in the virtual realm and in person. Practitioners often uses crystals, sage, palo santo, and other instruments in order to aide the clearing of energy from the body and the space. Cupping has been used for centuries in cultures all around the world. It is a highly effective modality for increasing circulation of nutrient rich, oxygenated blood to internal tissues and correcting the course of internal energy pathways. When applied by an experienced practitioner, this techniques can strongly reduce pain, decrease inflammation, and improve the function of muscles and related tissues. Common complaints that may benefit from these treatments are sciatic, arthritis, athletic injuries, headaches, and digestive discomfort. Gua sha is a traditional Chinese healing practice in which a practitioner uses a smooth-edged tool to stroke the skin. The aim of gua sha is to help relieve joint and muscle pain by removing inflammation, breaking up scar tissue, improve range of motion, and increase circulation. Gua Sha can be included in your acupuncture and cupping appointments. Services Cupping Cupping is a technique that involves placing glass or plastic cups on the body's surface. By creating a vacuum within the cup, the underlying muscle layer is manipulated to improve blood circulation within the tissues. If you or your acupuncturist feel that you would benefit from an extended cupping treatment, this service can be booked as a standalone service. Please note: when booking cupping as a standalone service, the actual cupping portion of your treatment traditionally lasts anywhere between 15-20min. Reiki Reiki is a Japanese spiritual practice that promotes healing of the mind, body and spirit. \"Rei\" means universal, and \"ki\" means life energy; during a Reiki session, a practitioner uses their hands to restore and balance the natural life force energy flow within the body.
