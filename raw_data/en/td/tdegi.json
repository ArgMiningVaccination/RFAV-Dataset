In-depth profiles show you how to unlock the powerful properties of calendula, chamomile, cinnamon, dandelion, echinacea, elder, ginger, holy basil, lavender, nettle, rose, and turmeric through delicious teas and foods, luxurious salves, skin and hair care treatments, complementary yoga poses, and meditations. Discover the natural keys to radiant health and wellness. The Herbal Goddess Guide is a beautiful little reference book in which 12 different herbs are examined for physical, mental and spiritual healing purposes. Amy Jirsa provides recipes, yoga poses, crafts and more to utilize the healing power of the plants in various ways. This book may not be for everyone as it has a very new age feel. Jirsa discusses magical traditions, honoring a plant's spirit and more. However, if you're into tapping your inner goddess, this may be the perfect book for you. If you read it and you enjoy it, you may want to purchase The Herbal Goddess Guide for your personal collection because Jirsa suggests \"getting to know\" each plant for a month and there is a chapter devoted to each. It could take you awhile to thoroughly digest the information in these pages. (And to try everything!) My favorite chapter, probably because it is my favorite herb, is lavender. Did you know it is a member of the mint family? While lavender is known for being relaxing, it can, in some cases, be stimulating, so be sure to check in with your mind, your mood, and your energy level after each recipe.\" pg 131. Some of the yoga poses Jirsa outlines are rather advanced, but she offers modifications for each. If your flexibility isn't up to snuff, no worries. Highly recommended for the open-minded reader and non-traditional healers. The book focuses on just 12 common herbs, which in this case is good. It's light and blonde and feels like a blog-turned-book, but that's all okay. It serves it's purpose of giving some nice simple information (and woo-y feelings. and yoga poses) about herbs and recipes to get you started making herbal potions. Honestly under normal circumstances the likelihood that I'd pick up and buy a book called \"Herbal Goddess\" are pretty slim--the book's title and cover didn't appeal to me (I bristle a bit at the word \"goddess\"--as someone who doesn't have a goddesses at the heart of my culture or spirituality I worry about both appropriation and diluting potentially important parts of someone else's culture)--but I bought and read this book because: 1-I'm interested in botany and plant medicine and 2-I loved taking Amy Jirsa's (the author's) yoga classes when I lived in Maine--she's a generous and energetic teacher whose passion and pragmatism are infectious. That being said, having read Amy's book cover-to-cover I'm thrilled to own it. In her introduction Jirsa writes, \"Herbal medicine, yoga, and natural health are buzzwords we've heard over and over again in recent years. There are many reasons for this, but I think key reason is...that these modalities allow us to take charge of our own mental, physical, and spiritual health.\" She goes onto write about the cultural heritage many of us share in which, just a generation or two ago, our great grandparents would have had a home apothecary and a working knowledge of useful wild and cultivated plants that could grow where we lived. Jirsa writes about twelve of her favorite plants, including scientific names, the parts of the plant that can be used, it's effects on the body and mind, potential interactions the plant might have with other medicine, and recipes for using and infusing the plant in your own home. In a hyper-marketed culture in which so many of us, even those interested in plant remedies, are marketed and sold medicine, I love that Jirsa encourages readers to know their plants and make their own teas, tinctures, salves, and balms. Amy Jirsa brings the same mix of passion and pragmatism to her writing that I love in her so much in her teaching--and reading Jirsa's book made me genuinely excited to make things: like chamomile-infused honey, nettle-tea, turmeric hot chocolate, and rosehip syrup. I left the book invested, excited, and grateful to own such an accessible and encouraging book on herbalism. Herbs, magic, and yoga - this book is everything I want, love, need, and more. Packed with so much valuable information, but presented in a down to earth, loving manner. It's a fantastic resource for people are new to working with herbs, but also for people like me who have their faves already and are always looking for new ways to utilize and explore their uses and benefits. If you're looking for a close up look at a hand full of herbs, I recommend this book. Very informative without feeling overwhelming. I love the spiritual, mental, and yoga connections made throughout this book. This book by Amy Jirsa, Herbal Goddess, provides the reader with recipes, yoga, and other healthy ideas to enrich one's lifestyle. This book is a well-developed guide that offers a beginner's reference to herbs and its benefits. This book was provide by Netgalley for an honest opinion Herbal Goddess: Discover the Amazing Spirit of 12 Healing Herbs with Teas, Potions, Salves, Food, Yoga, and More by Amy Jirsa By E King | Monday, February 9 \"No matter where our ancestors came from, chances are they used plants as medicine.\"-Amy Jirsa, from \"Herbal Goddess\" Herbs nourish us. They heal, soothe, and uplift our spirit. Writer, Yoga instructor, and master herbalist Amy Jirsa is well-versed in the art of plant medicine, and she imparts her knowledge to us in this gorgeous, full-color edition which will be released in April 2015 by Storey Publishing. The book is divided into 12 Herbal chapters. Through Amy's loving guidance, we get to know: Chamomile, Rose, Dandelion, Holy Basil, Nettle, Calendula, Lavender, Turmeric, Echinacea, Elder, Cinnamon, and Ginger. With beautiful photographs which implore us to smell, touch, and taste, she explains how to grow, dry, and prepare each plant. Within each section, she explains the characteristics of each cutting, including recipes for teas, body care, incense, food, and Yoga positions to accompany the flowers and roots. There is an emphasis on the mind, body, spirit, and even history, folk medicine, and magic for the curious. Amy asks us to, \"Think of the close relationships in your life. Think of the time it takes to really get to know someone-how much care and attention that kind of cultivation requires. You don't take that time with everyone you run into, but you know when it's worth it. It's the same thing with herbs. They too will become more familiar with time and attention.\" With this book as your guide, I can't imagine not becoming completely enamored with each and every shoot and bloom that she has chosen. Not only is it lovely, the book is functional as well, with an extensive Appendix of Flower Essences, Herbal Oils, Herbal Salves, Herbal Tinctures, Herbal Vinegars, Resources, Suggested Reading, Glossary and Index.

Product Details Paperback: 256 pages Publisher: Storey Publishing, (April 21 2015) Language: English ISBN-10: 1612124127 ISBN-13: 978-1612124124 Product Dimensions: 16.5 x 2.4 x 21.6 cm The Herbal Goddess Guide: Create Radiant Well-Being Every Day with Herb-Inspired Teas, Potions, Salves, Food, Yoga, and More by Amy Jirsa is a non fiction resource that is currently scheduled for release on April 21 2015. Amy Jirsa offers recipes and ideas for exploring and embracing the distinctive qualities of twelve herbs; chamomile, rose, dandelion, holy basil, nettle, calendula, lavender, turmeric, echinacea, elder, cinnamon, and ginger. Recipes for teas and foods, skin and hair care treatments, complementary yoga poses, meditations, and more are well explained. The Herbal Goddess Guide is a great resource for those that are interested in more knowledge about herbs and how to live an all natural and healthier life. The information on each of the herbs, along with the recipes and yoga poses that follow, are well organized and very detailed. these are wonderful photographs that accompany each page. This book really is about bringing the mind, body, and spirit together via herbs and lifestyle. So, if you do not care for that style of help, then this book is definitely not for you. I am not rigorous about this lifestyle, but still found much of the herbal information and recipes for tea, food, and body care to be valuable. i know i will be blending some of these teas, salves, and creams but am not likely to start the meditation and yoga any time soon. I did not find the advice and information preachy, it was very well stated and straight forward, it is just not my cup of tea. The Herbal Goddess Guide is a wonderful starter book for those looking to use herbs and lead a holistic life. If you are looking for detailed herb information and some fantastic recipes, then this book is still a great resource and it is easy to skim or skip the information that is not as interesting to you. This is a visually gorgeous book & I have a feeling the print version will be lovely (Note - some of the 'stock images used still have water marks on my copy - either the publisher is going to switch those out or they hadn't purchased the images at the time of putting together the net-galley proof.) ( I have a copy provided by Net-Galley in exchange for an honest review.)_ There are only twelve herbs discussed in the book which I actually liked. Other books may be more suited to an 'encyclopedia style' but I think 12 is a decent starting off point for a beginning like me. I've often used herbs in teas but have never really tried them for much else.This book has all sorts of ideas and examples to branch off from. I have mixed feelings about using herbals in place of proper medicine but I do think in some instances they can certainly assist with good health. (For example I've found a nice cup of chamomile tea will often help with headaches and insomnia. Ginger has helped when I've felt queasy as well.) So, while I am hesitant to use them in any sort of medical capacity (other than perhaps for small cuts and the like) I did enjoy the ideas of what they possibly could do for people. There is a suggested reading list at the end for people like me who like to learn more and perhaps read up on various medical studies as well as listings of various stores to purchase herbs and websites to inquire more. One thing I liked is that there are several recipes to try out for each herb, suggestions for teas, instructions on how to make herbal bath salts, foot soaks, cosmetics and even concepts such as 'ginger yoga' which sounds intriguing. All in all a fun read for anyone interested in herbs and their uses! This is my new go-to wellbeing guide! It incorporates most of the tools that I already use in my daily life and the illustrations and information are breathtaking. The author, Amy Jirsa, is a Master Herbalist and in this book she covers the key aspects of the essential herbs: Chamomile, Rose, Dandelion, Holy Basil, Nettles, Calendula, Lavender, Turmeric, Echinacea, Elder Plant, Cinnamon and Ginger. She explains the properties and scientific names of each herb in detail and there are recipes, remedies and therapies in the form of magic, teas, aromatherapy, natural body care products, recipes for divine edibles and drinks (even wine!) and yoga sequences related to each herb. This book is the perfect gift for yourself or someone else. Read more about the author at: www.quietearthyoga.com **I received a free digital copy of this book from NetGalley in return for an honest review.** This book is probably one of the most visually beautiful books on herbs I have ever read. The pictures are so vibrant and full of life. The writing is conversational and so easy to swallow. I love that there were only a limited number of herbs to discussed, making it easier to really focus on a whole body approach, and not become overwhelmed by having 100 plus different options to choose from. The herbs are also readily accessible. Nothing super out there in terms of ease of finding. I loved the ingredients, the yoga, basically everything about this book. Everything you could want to know about herbs. These chapter titles sum it up nicely: Discovering the Sunny Side of Chamomile, Rediscovering the Most Romantic Bloom (rose), Detoxing with Dandelion, Adapting with Holy Basil, Playing Nice with Nettles, Healing with Calendula, Having a Lie-Down with Lavender, Treating It All with Tumeric, Keeping the Doctor Away with Echinacea, The Many Wonders of the Elder Plant, Vertatile and Singular Cinnamon, Jiving It Up with Ginger *I received an ARC in exchange for an honest review. A little too hippie for me (which is saying something). I skipped over the \"magic\" sections and also most of the yoga (I do yoga for exercise, not for spiritual/mental well being). I knew most of the information from previous research and blogs I follow. Speaking of blogs, this read like blog entries strung together to make a book. I copied down a couple recipes to try. The photos were beautiful and this may be a good book for individuals starting out with herbs. I absolutely LOVED this book. With so much information and recipes for a variety of items, this is a MUST for anyone looking to make their own salves, teas, etc and discover the wonderful properties of each herb. ***Many thanks to Storey Publishing and NetGalley for a galley to be used for honest review & bookseller purposes*** This is one of the best books that has ever come into my life. Just by reading it the care and love contained within each word are nearly palpable and make you feel happier. Brilliant for those looking to get into herbal remedies, healing, recipes, and even a touch of magic. This will be my muse moving forward as I delve deeper into herbs. Highly recommend. Even though I am further along in my plant medicine studies than the intended audience for this book, I still enjoyed it. The author is fanciful in the best way, in addition to being incredibly accessible for new herbalists. Reading this book is like sitting down for tea with a friend :) This book is definitely for a beginner, which I am, but I can see how someone who was more experienced in herbs might find it too basic. I really liked how she formatted this book and the beautiful photographs. Beautifully designed book. Interesting, enthusiastic information on 12 of the most commonly used herbs. Recipes, healing uses, flower essence uses, yoga poses and personal care product recipes for each herb. Would be nice if she continued with future volumes on more herbs. "}
