Patient s suspected or confirmed to have drug susceptible TB disease and who are prescribed treatment will have the following medical screening (s): 1. Baseline and monthly clinical monitoring and evaluation for TB medication toxicity : If patient is taking ethambutol , this include s red/green color discrimination using Ishihara plates and visual acuity using Snellen chart. If patient is taking rifabutin , this includes asking about eye pain, overall vision changes, and/or sensitivity to light. If patient is taking high dose isoniazid , this is to include screening for peripheral neuropathy . 2. Clinical evaluation as soon as feasible when signs or symptoms of medication toxicity develop . In this case, hold the medications , contact the licensed healthcare provider, do not resume until re -started by the provider. D. Patient s receiving treatment for TB infection (including patient s on window prophylaxis) will have t he following medical screening (s): 1. Baseline and monthly clinical monitoring and evaluation for TB medic ation toxicity. If patient is taking rifabutin , this includes asking about eye pain, overall vision changes, and/or sensitivity to light. 2. Clinical evaluation as soon as feasible when signs or symptoms of medication toxicity develop. In this case, hold the medications , contact the licensed healthcare provider, do not resume until re -started by the provider. Texas Department of State Health Services Standing Delegation Orders for Tuberculosis Clinical Services Provided by Authorized Licensed Nurses, Fiscal Year 20 24 TB Clinical Services, SDO, FY2 4 Page 21 of 61 ATTACHMENT 3: TB Screening Tests A. The following patient s may undergo TB screening test ing: 1. All patient s undergoing evaluation for , or diagnosed with, TB disease and there is not a documented previous positive tuberculin skin test ( TST), or interferon -gamma release assay ( IGRA) result performed in the United States or documented previous TB disease , unless the criteria in #6 apply. 2. All patient s undergoing evaluation for TB infection and there is not a documented previous positive TST or IGRA result performed in the United States unles s the criteria in #6 apply. Patient s with history of severe reaction to a TST (i.e., blistering) should not have a repeat TST . 3. All contacts who meet criteria for testing, and there is not a documented previous positive TST or IGRA result or documented previous TB disease . If the initial TB screening test is negative, administer a second TB screening test 8 to 10 weeks after the last exposure. See ATTACHMENT 7: Medications for indications for window prophylaxis and recommendations to complete a full course of treatment for TB infection (beyond the window period) even if a TB screening test administered 8 weeks or more after the end of exposure is negative. 4. All patient s who meet criteria for targeted testing , except screening in correctional facilities - monthly screening re ports shall be submitted in accordance with TB and Hansen's Disease Unit. 5. DSHS employees and contractors providing TB services , when TB screening is indicated. 6. Class B immigrants or other immigrants * (including refugees) undergoing immigration screening . Exceptions : Immigr ants who need evaluation for TB, including those who are reported from the Electronic Disease Notification (EDN) system with a classification of A or B , will have the following exceptions to repeat testing : a) Applicants with a documented positive IGRA test, even if performed overseas, do not need to have a repeat IGRA at the health department unless indicated by the licensed healthcare provider . b) For applica nts under age 2 years old who have a TST performed overseas , the TST should not be repeated unless there is no specific documentation of a result (in mm induration) , unless recommended by the licensed healthcare provider . c) For applicants over 2 years old, screen for TB with an IGRA if the last test done overseas was a positive TST only. Consideration of Texas Department of State Health Services Standing Delegation Orders for Tuberculosis Clinical Services Provided by Authorized Licensed Nurses, Fiscal Year 20 24 TB Clinical Services, SDO, FY2 4 Page 22 of 61 diagnosis should be made based on the IGRA result, however the licensed healthcare provider will need to consider items listed in B. 4., below. *Applicants referred from a civil surgeon should not undergo a TB screening test initially at the health department; they should be referred to the health department only after a full evaluation has been done by the civil surgeon (that includes IGRA/TST and CXR). Refer to: https://www.cdc.gov/immigrantrefugeehealth/exams/ti/civil/tuberculosis - tests may include TST OR IGRA : 1. It is important before applying a TB screening test that infor mation is known about the patient 's risk for infection and risk for progression to disease if infected. The single test that is most appropriate for the patient should be chosen and applied. More than one test should not be routinely performed. 2. Routine testing with BOTH a TST and an IGRA is not recommended . If an IGRA is chosen, it should be used in place of , NOT IN ADD ITION TO , a TST. 3. Performing both a TST and an IGRA can be considered in the following situations after consulting with the licensed healthcare provider and receiving a patient -specific order for the additional test : The initial test is negative and the ris k for infection, the risk for progression, and the risk for a poor outcome are increased (e.g., when persons with HIV infection or children aged younger than five years are at increased risk for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) infection), or The initial test is negative and clinical suspicion exists for active tuberculosis disease (such as in persons with symptoms, signs, and/or radiographic evidence suggestive of active tuberculosis disease ) and confirmation of M.tb infection is desired. The initial tes t is positive and additional evidence of infection is required to encourage compliance or to confirm the positive test (e.g., in foreign -born health -care workers who believe their positive TST result is attributable to BCG). A positive IGRA might prompt greater acceptance of treatment for latent TB infection (LTBI) as compared with a positive TST alone. The initial test is positive, and the patient is considered a healthy person who has a low risk for both infection and progression. Children younger than 2 years old: o IGRA may be indicated if the TST result is negative but there is a high clinical suspicion for TB disease and/or the child is at high risk for infection, progression to TB disease, or poor outcomes. Texas Department of State Health Services Standing Delegation Orders for Tuberculosis Clinical Services Provided by Authorized Licensed Nurses, Fiscal Year 20 24 TB Clinical Services, SDO, FY2 4 Page 23 of 61 o IGRA may also be indicated if the TST result is positive and additional evidence is needed to ensure adherence and /or child is healthy and low risk for TB and/or non-tubercular mycobacteria (NTM) is suspected. For more details, refer to the Red Book Online, 2021 - 2024. 4. If both an IGRA and a TST are performed and discordant results are obtained, the licensed healthcare provider will need to make a determination regarding whether or not the patient should be consid ered to have TB infection , based on patient 's risk fa ctors, examination, and epidemiology (such as exposure risk). The TB and Hansen's Disease Unit can assist but cannot make this determination in lieu of the lic ensed healthcare provider. 5. If both an IGRA and a TST are performed because the initial test is negative , a positive result from a second test increases detection sensitivity. If the repeat test is positive and the patient is high risk, any positive test r esult should be considered evidence of TB infection and acted upon accordingly. If the second test is negative and the patient is high risk, it still does not conclusively rule out M.tb infection. M ultiple negative results from any combination of these tests cannot exclude M.tb infection. 6. If both an IGRA and a TST are performed because the initial test is positive, a positive result from the second test increases the likelihood that the test result reflects infection. An alternative is to assume, without additional testing, that the initial result is a false positive or that the risk for disease does not warrant additional evaluation or treatment, regardless of test results. This should only be considered after careful assessment of the patient 's risk, physical exam findings and history of exposure. Steps should be taken to minimize unnecessary and misleading testing of persons at low risk. 7. Repeating an IGRA or performing a TST should be considered when the initial IGRA result is indeterminate, borderline, invalid , or if int erpretation results are in question and a reason for testing persists. If an IGRA is to be repeated, a new blood sample should be used. In such situations, repeat testing with another blood sample usually provides interpretable results. 8. A TST is not reco mmended to be repeated unless the administration or reading of the TST is determined to be unreliable , the tuberculin PPD is determined to be expired, or if performed as 2nd round screening 8 -10 weeks Texas Department of State Health Services Standing Delegation Orders for Tuberculosis Clinical Services Provided by Authorized Licensed Nurses, Fiscal Year 20 24 TB Clinical Services, SDO, FY2 4 Page 24 of 61 after a break in exposure. 9. When screening for TB with a TST or IGRA in persons who have been recently vaccinated, additional factors should be considered. Live virus vaccines may i mpact TST or IGRA results due to temporary immune suppression, potentially causing false -negative reactions. o Live virus vaccines include measles, mumps, rubella, varicella, zoster, yellow fever, intranasal influenza, oral polio and smallpox o The effects of the COVID -19 mRNA vaccine , while not a live -virus vaccine, on TST or IGRA interpretations are unknown. When possible, placing a TST or drawing an IGRA should occur prior to vaccinations. When that is not possible, a TST or IGRA should not be delayed in persons with risk factors for TB . Providers may order a repeat screening test 4 week s after vaccination if the initial test is negative. Contact the licensed healthcare provider before making decisions to delay a TST or IGRA for at -risk persons. Vaccinations should not be delayed to accommodate TB screening procedures, as a repe at screening may be arranged as needed. C. Which TB screening test to choose: 1. Before a TB screening test is performed, the advantages and limitations of TST and IGRA must be evaluated for each patient . Refer to Figure 1 for choosing the appropriate TB test in children. Per the American Academy of Pediatrics Redbook, 2021, 32nd Edition : \"The published experience testing children with IGRAs demonstrates that IGRAs consistently perform well in children 2 years and older, and some data support their use for even younger children.\" IGRAs may be considered in children 1 year old, e specially if BCG vaccinated. Contact the licensed healthcare provider. 2. An IGRA is preferred for testing the follow ing groups or individuals aged two (2) years and older: High-risk individuals who have previously received BCG Congregate settings, for em ployees and residents Persons with diabetes or on dialysis Immunocompromised persons Persons undergoing contact investigation Persons who work with TB patient s Persons anticipated to receive TNF - inhibitors or other biologic response modifiers a. If an IGRA is used, there is no preference for the use of one IGRA over another. Texas Department of State Health Services Standing Delegation Orders for Tuberculosis Clinical Services Provided by Authorized Licensed Nurses, Fiscal Year 20 24 TB Clinical Services, SDO, FY2 4 Page 25 of 61 b. When IGRA testing is performed greater than 3 days after TST, the PPD injection should be expected to boost anamnestic immune responses measured by IGRA originating from M.tb infection (but not from BCG vaccination or in non -sensitized persons). The effect also appears to be more apparent in those individuals who are already IGRA positive. To date, there is no definitive data and some experts suggest waiting 3 months after TST before testing with IGRA, while others feel this is unnecessary. Decisions to delay IGRA testing can o nly be made by the licensed healthcare provider. 3. TST is preferred for testing patient s younger than 2 years old and may be used if the patient is unable to receive an IGRA or refuses phlebotomy . For infants younger than 6 months, a negative TST cannot be confirmed until the infant is 6 months old , or after the break in contact period, whichever is later. If the test is positive, then refer for medical evaluation. If negative, then retest at age 6 months or 8-10 weeks after the break in contact, whichever is later, to confirm a negative test. Any infant who is a contact to infectious tuberculosis should be placed on windo w prophylaxis until the TST can be confirmed. See Attachment 7: Medications . a. Do NOT administer TST if any of the following apply *. Contact the licensed healthcare provider for instructions. Allergy to any component of TUBERSOL or APLISOL or an anaphylactic or other allergic reaction/hypersensitivity to a previous test of tuberculin purified protein derivative ( PPD) Severe reaction to previous TST such as ulceration, necrosis, blistering, bullae, anaphylaxis A documented history of treatment for TB infection or disease Extensive burns is performed, provide instructions to the patient regarding care of the injection site, then read and interpret the TST result within 48 to 72 hours. b. Definition of TST Reaction: Negative reaction : An induration less than the specified criteria based Texas Department of State Health Services Standing Delegation Orders for Tuberculosis Clinical Services Provided by Authorized Licensed Nurses, Fiscal Year 20 24 TB Clinical Services, SDO, FY2 4 Page 26 of 61 on risk factors shows either a lack of tuberculin sensitivity or a low grade sensitivity that most likely is not caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (M.tb). A negative test does not rule out t he presence of TB. Positive Reaction : An induration greater than or equal to the specified criteria based on risk factors indicates infection with M.tb. c. TST Interpretation: 1) An induration of 5 mm or more is considered to be positive for: HIV-infected persons Recent contacts to a known TB case Individuals with fibrotic changes on chest radiograph consistent with old TB Persons with organ transplants and other immunosuppressed persons (such as taking the equivalent of greater than 15 mg/d ay prednisone for longer than 1 month or taking tumor necrosis factor - antagonists) 2) An induration of 10 mm or more is considered to be positive for: Individuals from high -prevalence countries Injection drug users Residents and employees of high -risk congregate settings: correctional facilities, nursing homes and other healthcare or long - term care facilities, residential facilities for AIDS patients, and homeless shelters Mycobacteriology laboratory personnel Person s with high -risk clinical conditions: silicosis, diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, some hematologic disorders (e.g., leukemias and lymphomas), other specific malignancies (e.g., carcinoma of the head or neck and lung), weight loss of > 10% of ideal body weight, gastrectomy, jejunoileal bypass Children younger than 5 years of age. Infants, children, adolescents exposed to adults in high -risk categories 3) An induration of 15 mm or more is considered to be positive for: Individuals with no known risk fa ctors for tuberculosis.

Note: Routine testing of serum uric acid is not recommended. Acute gouty arthritis is a known adverse effect of pyrazinamide (PZA) and is rare except in patients with preexi sting gout, which is generally a contraindication to the use of the drug. Non -gouty polyarthralgia may occur in up to 40% of patients receiving daily doses of PZA and rarely requires dosage adjustment or discontinuation of the drug. Asymptomatic hyperurice mia is an expected effect of the drug and is generally without adverse consequence. See http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5211a1.htm for additional information. If the patient develops signs and symptoms consistent with acute gouty arthritis, hold medication and contact the licensed healthcare provider for instructions. B.

Because PZA is the most comm on culprit , the benefits of including PZA in the initial regimen for elderly patients with modest disease and low risk of drug resistance may be outweighed by the risk of serious adverse events ...Careful clinical monitoring to detect intolerance and adverse reactions is warranted. \" Refer to page 36 for more details : https://www.cdc.gov/tb/publications/guidelines/pdf/clin -infect -dis.-2016-nahid -cid_ciw 376.pdf **EMB: may be stopped if the isolate is susceptible to RIF and INH. Intermittent therapy of thrice -weekly dosing may be considered in individuals with low risk of relapse (i.e., drug -susceptible TB organisms, that at the start of treatment is non -cavitary and/or smear negative, and those who are HIV negative.) Consultation with a DSHS -Recognized TB Medical Consultant is recommended. Daily dosing is the preferred standard of care for all patients. Interventions to support daily dosing, including video DOT (VDOT), should be arranged, when possible, as intermittent dosing is less efficacious and leads to higher rates of relapse.

All first -line TB drugs are found in breast milk at low levels. Patients can safely breastfeed while on any approved regimens for LTBI treatment. While rifampin is the preferred LTBI therapy, rifabutin can also be used safely in pregnancy. Refer to: Testing and Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection in the United States: Clinical Recommendations , for in following: pregnant women, infants rece iving INH and breastfeeding, patient s with diets likely deficient in pyridoxine, patient s with paresthesia, or patient s who have a risk factor for paresthesia (e.g., HIV/AIDS, alcohol use, diabetes). NOTE: due to increased risk of hepatotoxicity during pre gnancy and in the immediate post -partum period (first three months after delivery) , INH monotherapy should be used with caution in pregnancy . RIF, RPT: Both have drug interactions with potentially serious consequences. Of particular concern are reductions , often to ineffective levels, in serum concentrations of common drugs, such as oral contraceptives, methadone, and warfarin. There are important bidirectional interactions between rifamycins and antiretroviral agents. Because information regardi ng rifamycin drug interactions is evolving rapidly, consult a trusted drug information resource to obtain the most up -to-date information. NOTE: Rifabutin (RBT) may be substituted for rifampin if rifampin cannot be used due to certain drug -drug interaction s. **The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends an isoniazid dosage of 10 -15mg/kg for the daily regimen and 20 -30mg/kg for the twice -weekly regimen in children. For more details refer to Guidelines for the Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection: Recommendations from the National Tuberculosis Controllers Association and CDC, 2020 : https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/rr/rr6901a1.htm? s_cid=rr6901a1_w&deliveryName=USCDCNPIN_151 -DM19855 and the American Academy of Pediatrics Red Book, 2021, 32nd Edition.

Indications for window prophylaxis for contacts to someone with confirmed or suspected TB disease : 1. Children younger than 5 years old a. Note: Children <6 months old should continue on window prophylaxis until they undergo a repeat TST at 6 mo nths of age 2. Patient s with HIV infection* 3. Patient s receiving immunosuppressive therapy for organ transplantation* 4. Patient s taking TNF - inhibitors* *Indications for window prophylaxis WITH recommendations to complete a full course of treatment for TB infection (beyond the window period) even if a TB screening test administered 8 weeks after the end of exposure is negative. D. Alternate regimens for the treatment of TB infection (including window prophylaxis) or TB disease: 1. Tables 1 -4 provide TB regimen options and dosages for first -line therapy with rifampin as the selected rifamycin . When rifabutin (an alternate rifamycin) is used in place of rifampin (most commonly for patients who are HIV positive receiving protease inhibitors ), the following applies: a. Rifabutin dosage is 5mg/kg with a maximum dose of 300mg PO daily for both TB infection and TB disease . Rifabutin is only given as daily dosing and is not recommended bi - weekly or thrice weekly. b. Patients weighing less than 30kg should be carefully dosed and monitored on rifabutin, which must be compounded. Seek medical consultation with a DSHS -Recognized TB Medical Consultant if dosing assistance is needed. c. Treatment completion is counted the same as if using rifampin. d. For more informa tion on rifabutin use, dosing, and drug/drug interactions, including rifabutin use for patients with HIV, refer to Official American Thoracic Society/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/Infectious Diseases Society of America Clinical Practice Guidel ines: Treatment -cid_ciw376.pdf . E. Interruptions of Therapy for TB Disease : Treatment interruptions should be carefully monitored by the nurse case manager and reported to the licensed healthcare provider. In general, the longer the interruption and the earlier the interruption occurs, the more serious the impact of the interruption ( ATS/CDC/IDSA, 2016 ). In addition, patients can be at an increased risk of relapse when doses are missed in the continuation phase. DOT doses should be counted daily and monitored weekly, ensuring the patient completes the recommended number o f doses each week. While the number of Texas Department of State Health Services Standing Delegation Orders for Tuberculosis Clinical Services Provided by Authorized Licensed Nurses, Fiscal Year 20 24 TB Clinical Services, SDO, FY2 4 Page 48 of 61 planned doses must be considered, so t oo the duration of therapy must also be considered . For example, the initial phase of treatment cannot stop prior to 8 weeks even if the minimum number of doses is completed befor e that duration. The below information details set timeframes for when intervention s are required during interruptions in therapy . There may be other times when intervention is necessary, e.g., a patient continually misses one or two doses every week. Contact the licensed healthcare provider and re - evaluate compliance measures when applicable . 1. When any interruption of less than 14 cumulative days occurs during the initial phase of treatment for TB disease, the treatment can continue. If total initial phase treatment is not completed in 10 weeks , the treatment needs to be restarted . Contact the licensed healthcare provider for instructions. 2. When an y interruption of 14 or more cumulative days occurs in the initial phase of treatment for TB disease, the treatment regimen will need to be restarted . Contact the licensed healthcare provider for instructions. If treatment is discontinued for drug intolerances, the patient must be on an empiric regimen considered adequate (RIP [ RIF, INH, PZA], RIE [ RIF, INH, EMB], or RPE [ RIF, PZA, EMB]) for doses to count towards completion of therapy. If susceptibilities are known and there is no resistance to INH or RIF, then once the patient is on both INH and RIF, doses can count towards completion of therapy. 3. If a patient misses a cumulative total of 3 months of doses during the continuation phase and less than 80% of planned doses in the continuation phase are completed, the treatment will need to be restarted . Collect 3 sputum specimens for AFB smear and culture , perform a CXR, and contact the licensed healthcare provider for further instructions . 4. If a patient misses a cumulative total of 3 months of doses during the continuation phase and 80% or more of planned doses in the continuation phase are completed, additional treatment may not be necessary. However, patient s who initially had sputum smears positive for AFB should receive additional therapy. Contact the licensed healthcare provider. F. Interruptions of Therapy for TB Infection: When an interruption occurs during treatment for TB infection , a CXR should be Texas Department of State Health Services Standing Delegation Orders for Tuberculosis Clinical Services Provided by Authorized Licensed Nurses, Fiscal Year 20 24 TB Clinical Services, SDO, FY2 4 Page 49 of 61 obtained in accordance with ATTACHMENT 5: Chest X -Ray. If a CXR is indicated, an examination and symptom screen to rule out active TB disease are also required before restarting therapy . If the patient has symptoms consistent with active TB disease, a symptom screen , physical examination, CXR, and collection of 3 sputum specimens (if sputum can be produced) are required . Active TB disease must be excluded before treatment for TB infection is restarted. If the minimum number of doses cannot be completed within the maximum time frame allowed, as described in section G: Completion of Therapy for TB Infection of this attachment, treatment will need to be restarted from the beginning. Contact the licensed healthcare provider for instructions. G. Completion of Therapy for Drug Susceptible TB Disease : Below are the minimum number of doses required, based on regimens listed in Table 1 and the corresponding time frame s for acceptable completion of therapy. The goa l is to complete all doses within 12 months. Six months (26 weeks) is generally the minimum duration of treatment ; nine months (39 weeks) is recommended for patient s with cavitation on initial chest radiograph an d positive cultures at co mpletion of 2 months of therapy (see additional indications in #4, below ), and for those patients intolerant of PZA or with M. bovis disease . These durations accurately indicate the amount of time the drugs are given only if there a re no interruptions in drug administration . NOTE: daily dosing throughout the course of therapy is preferred over intermittent dosing. 1. Initia l phase to total 8 weeks : Initial phase must be documented to be appropriately completed bef ore patient is permitted to count doses for continuation phase. Regimen 1 : 7 days per week for 56 doses administered by DOT in 8 weeks, OR 5 days per week for 40 doses administered by DOT in 8 weeks Regimen 2: 7 days per week for 56 doses administered by DOT in 8 w eeks, OR 5 days per week for 40 doses administered by DOT in 8 weeks Regimen 3 : 3 times weekly for 24 doses administered by DOT in 8 weeks 2. Continuation phase to total 18 or 31 weeks (INH/RIF): Doses for continuation phase should not be counted until initial phase treatment has been documented to be appropriately completed. Regimen 1a : 7 days per week for 126 doses administered by DOT in 18 weeks , OR 5 days per week for 90 doses administered by DOT in 18 week s Regimen 1b : 7 days per week for 217 doses administered by DOT in 31 weeks, OR Texas Department of State Health Services Standing Delegation Orders for Tuberculosis Clinical Services Provided by Authorized Licensed Nurses, Fiscal Year 20 24 TB Clinical Services, SDO, FY2 4 Page 50 of 61 5 days per week for 155 doses administered by DOT in 31 weeks Regimen 2a : 3 times weekly for 54 doses administered by DOT in 18 weeks Regimen 2b : 3 times weekly for 93 doses administered by DOT in 31 weeks Regimen 3a : 3 times weekly for 54 doses administered by DOT in 18 week s Regimen 3b: 3 times weekly for 93 doses administered by DOT in 31 weeks 3. When regimens vary from above (i.e., are extended or change frequently ) doses from each phase should be converted to \"daily dose equivalents .\" Use the minimum numbers for daily dosing of each phase when making a determination of adequate number of doses to complete therapy. Consult the licensed healthcare provider, the local and/or regional TB program manager, or the TB and Hansen's Disease Unit TB Nurse Consultant (s) for assistance , if needed. For example, for 5 days per week dosing, 40 doses should be given for the initiation phase and 90 doses should be given for the continuation phase. o If twice weekly doses were administered , multiply the total number of twice weekly doses by 2.5 ( because 5 days per week \u00f7 2 doses per week = 2.5 ) to convert twice weekly doses to daily dose equivalents . o If 3 times (thrice) weekly doses were administered , multiply total number of thrice weekly doses by 1.67 ( because 5 days per week \u00f7 3 doses per week = 1.67 ) to convert thrice weekly doses to daily dose equivalents . o Add all daily dose equivalents together to calculate the total daily doses given. o Numbers that are not whole numbers should be rounded do wn. 4. Exceptions to the length of therapy described above: In patients with PZA intolerance in the initial phase (min imum of 40 doses given 5 days/week by DOT), or those with M. bovis , then the regimen should be provided for a min imum duration of 9 months . o EMB may be discontinued only when the isolate is known to be susceptible to isoniazid and rifampin. o INH and RIF must be provided for a total minimum duration of treatment of 9 months (39 weeks). NOTE: M. bovis is naturally resistant to PZA and treatment duration must extend to a minimum of 9 months (39 weeks). Patient s with cavitation or extensive pulmonary TB disease on initial CXR and a positive culture at the time of completion of 2 months (8 weeks) of treatment are at substantial ly increased risk of relapse . The continuation phase for these patient s is recommended to be prolonged to 7 months (31 Texas Department of State Health Services Standing Delegation Orders for Tuberculosis Clinical Services Provided by Authorized Licensed Nurses, Fiscal Year 20 24 TB Clinical Services, SDO, FY2 4 Page 51 of 61 weeks), to complete a total treatment period of 9 months (39 weeks). The following extrapulmonary TB sites generally require a longer du ration of treatment : o Bone and joint: 9 months (39 weeks) of treatment recommended o Meningitis: 9 - 12 months (39 - 52 weeks) of treatment recommended o Disseminated/miliary TB: 9 - 12 months (39 - 52 weeks) of treatment recommended o Any site that is slow to respond should be considered for prolongation of treatment Culture -negative pulmonary TB o Defined as symptomatic or radiographic improvement after 2 months of RIPE treatment in a patient for whom a. the clinical suspicion for active TB disease is high, b. AFB cultures were collected and are negative, AND c. an alternative diagno sis/etiology has not been found o For adult patient s, because of a potential for INH -resistance, treatment should be continued with INH, RIF, AND ethambutol for an additional 2 months to complete a total of 4 months (18 weeks) of treatment. o For pediatric patient s with no identifiable source case , treatment should be continued with INH, RIF, AND ethambutol for an additional 4 months (18 weeks) to complete a total of 6 months ( 26 weeks) of treatment. o Ethambutol can be discontinued if the patient with culture -negative pulmonary TB is a contact to a case and the susceptibilities of that case are known and no resistance is detected. Culture -negative extrapulmonary TB : treatment recommendations are determined by the licensed healthcare provider , prefer ably in consultation with a DSHS -recognized TB Medical Consultant . Patient s newly diagnosed with HIV who are not started on anti-retroviral therapy ( ART) during treatment for TB: treatment should consist of at least 8+ months of therapy or longer. If RIF cannot be included in the treatment regimen, a drug -resistant TB regimen must be provided . Medical consultation required. H. Completion of Therapy for TB Infection: 1. Below are the minimum number of doses required, based on regimens listed in Table 4 and the corresponding time frame for acceptable completion of therapy. Texas Department of State Health Services Standing Delegation Orders for Tuberculosis Clinical Services Provided by Authorized Licensed Nurses, Fiscal Year 20 24 TB Clinical Services, SDO, FY2 4 Page 52 of 61 a. INH/RPT ( 3HP) = 12 doses (minimum of 11 doses acceptable) administered in no fewer than 12 weeks (but no more than 16 weeks) Doses must be separ ated by 72 hours to be counted . b. 4 months of rifampin (4R) = 7 days per week for 120 doses taken within 6 months, OR 5 days per week for 90 doses administered by DOT within 6 months c. 3 months of INH and RIF (3HR) = 7 days per week for 90 doses taken within 4 months d. 6 months of daily INH (6H)= 7 days per week for 180 doses taken within 9 months, OR 5 days per week for 129 doses administered by DOT within 9 months e. 6 months of twice -weekly INH (6H)= twice weekly for 52 doses administered by DOT within 9 months f. 9 months of daily INH (9H) = 7 days per week for 270 doses taken within 12 months, or 5 days per week for 195 doses administered by DOT within 12 months g. 9 months of twice -weekly INH ( 9H) = twice weekly for 76 doses administered by DOT within 12 months 2. For persons treated empirically for TB disease with at least isoniazid, rifampin, and pyrazinamide for 2 months (40 doses given by DOT 5x/week or 56 doses given by DOT 7 days/week ), this regimen can be considered effective treatment of TB infection in persons subsequently determined to have infection r ather than TB disease. 3. When changing treatment regimens due to adverse reactions or intolerance, the number of doses needed to complete adequate therapy must be made by the licensed health care provider. a. The decision to restart treatment entirely with a new regimen or counting a percentage of doses taken towards the new regimen should be made on a case-by-case basis. b. Licensed healthcare providers should consider the patient 's risk of progressing to disease, compliance, and comorbidities. Some experts recommend that certain patients complete a full course of the new Texas Department of State Health Services Standing Delegation Orders for Tuberculosis Clinical Services Provided by Authorized Licensed Nurses, Fiscal Year 20 24 TB Clinical Services, SDO, FY2 4 Page 53 of 61 regimen. c. For others, i t may not always be necessary to restart the new regimen completely to achieve completion of therapy. d. Refer to Section 6: Monitoring and Managing Treatment of the LTBI: Testing and Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection in the United States: Clinical Recommendations , for details . http://www.tbcontroller s.org/resources/tb -infection/clinical - recommendations/ Texas Department of State Health Services Standing Delegation Orders for Tuberculosis Clinical Services Provided by Authorized Licensed Nurses, Fiscal Year 20 24 TB Clinical Services, SDO, FY2 4 Page 54 of 61 ATTACHMENT 8: Patient s with Drug Resistant Tuberculosis (DR -TB) This attachment outlines required activities, procedures, and orders to be performed in addition to those outlined in the previous sections of these SDOs. A. Definitions 1. Isoniazid mono -resistant TB - resistance drug. 2. Rifampin mono -resistant TB (RR) - resistance to rifampin, a first line TB drug; this type of DR -TB is treated MDR -TB. 3. Multi-drug resistant drug resistant TB (Pre -XDR TB) - MDR, plus resistance to one of the second line injectable agents (amikacin, capreomycin, or kanamy cin) or drug resistant TB (XDR TB)- MDR, plus resistance to one of the second line injectable agents (amikacin, capreomycin, or kanamycin) and a fluoroquinolone or plus resistance to a fluoroquinolone, and Bedaquiline or Linezolid. B. Level of Experience, Training, Competence, and Education Required 1. Have reviewed, are familiar with, and able to readily access the recommendations within the following document: a. Treatment of Drug -Resistant Tuberculosis -An Official ATS/CDC/ERS/IDSA Clinical Practice Guideline: Executive Summary, September 2019. https://www.cdc.gov/tb/publicatio ns/guidelines/pdf/executive_summary.pdf C. Procedures and Requirements to be Followed by Authorized Licensed Nurses Managing Patient s with DR -TB 1. When resistance is identified by drug susceptibility testing (DST ), rapid testing (i.e. , GeneXpert NAAT) , or rpoB alert, whichever comes first, or if resistance is suspected due to patient risk factors , perform the following : a. Contact the licensed healthcare provider. b. Consider holding the current regimen if not consistent with current test results and the patient is medically stable . c. Initiate a consultation with a DSHS -recognized TB medical consultant within three (3) working days. Do not wait for final cultures to initiate consultation , as the consultant will assist in coordination of further testing, including Molecular Detection of Drug Resistance (MDDR). d. Notify the TB and Hansen's Disease Unit's Nurse Consultant. 2. Respond to treatment and case management activities where indicated, unless otherwise noted by the treating physician or consultant. a. Drug resistance should be considered in any patient with: Known exposure to an individual with drug -resistant TB Residence in a setting with high rates of primary drug -resistant TB, such as a country or area with high rates of drug -resistant TB in newly diagnosed individuals Persistently positive smear or culture results at or after four months of Texas Department of State Health Services Standing Delegation Orders for Tuberculosis Clinical Services Provided by Authorized Licensed Nurses, Fiscal Year 20 24 TB Clinical Services, SDO, FY2 4 Page 55 of 61 treatment Previous TB treatment, particularly if it was not directly observed or was interrupte d for any reason b. Medical screenings: Perform the following screening assessments at the following intervals and document on the TB 702 (or equivalent): 1) Baseline and monthly clinical monitoring of medication toxicity for patient s on second -line medications: If patient is taking aminoglycosides (most commonly amikacin ), this is to include: o audiometry screening. o vestibular screening. If patient is taking cycloserine , this is to include: o A mental health assessment to include depression screening. Also ask if they are experiencing nightmares, hallucinations, aggression or disorientation. If patient is taking clofazimine , this is to include: o A ment al health screening to focus on depression symptoms. If patient is taking linezolid , this is to include: o red/green color discrimination using Ishihara plates . o visual acuity using Snellen chart or equivalent . o peripheral neuropathy screening . If patient is taking high dose isoniazid (adults 15mg/kg) , this is to include: o peripheral screening . If patient is taking bedaquiline (Sirturo) , this is to include: o ECG at baseline, 2 weeks after initiation of treatment, and monthly. It is recommended that the licensed healthcare provider interpret the ECG within 24 hours of the ECG test. Perform ECG at the designated intervals (preferably Monday -Wednesday in case fur ther interventions such as labs or consultations are needed). ECG should be performed at the same time of day each time. ECGs exhibit diurnal variation of up to +/ - 75ms during the course of a day. A patient with elevated QTc intervals should have one repeat ECG done 30 minutes apart to confirm reading. Documentation of any symptoms* of prolonged QT c should be included when performing the ECG and results of both provided to the licensed healthcare provider . Ensure the licensed healthcare provider reviews the symptoms and ECG results within 24 hours of test, unless otherwise specified, and documents response in the medical record. Texas Department of State Health Services Standing Delegation Orders for Tuberculosis Clinical Services Provided by Authorized Licensed Nurses, Fiscal Year 20 24 TB Clinical Services, SDO, FY2 4 Page 56 of 61 o Respond to the following based on the ECG results : If QTc is greater than 450ms (in males) or greater than 470ms (in females) and patient is asymptomatic*: Draw CMP plus magnesium, TSH, CBC Contact the licensed healthcare provider to review ECG results within 24 hours Perform weekly ECGs until normal or until licensed healthcare provider orders otherwis e If QTc is greater than 500ms in male or females, and patient is asymptomatic*: Hold medications Draw CMP plus magnesium, TSH, CBC Contact the licensed healthcare provider to review results within 24 hours Request that the licensed healthcare provider consults cardiology or a DSHS -recognized medical TB consultant Repeat ECG in 24 -48 hours Perform weekly ECGs until normal or the licensed healthcare provider orders otherwise Do not resume regimen until instru cted by the licensed healthcare provider If QTc is greater than 450ms (in males) or greater than 470ms (in females) and patient is symptomatic*: Refer patient to the Emergency Department (ED) - ensure there is a referral form that the patient may present t o the ED already reviewed by the licensed healthcare provider which outlines at minimum: diagnosis, isolation status, current medications, baseline and current ECG results, symptoms, reason for referral to ED and TB physician contact information Do not resume regimen until instructed by the licensed healthcare provider If QTc is greater than 60ms above baseline and patient is asymptomatic*: Draw CMP plus magnesium, TSH, CBC Contact the licensed healthcare provider to review ECG results with in 24 hours for recommendations *Symptoms of prolonged QTc include palpitations, tachycard ia, light syncope, chest pain, loss of consciousness , shortness of breath Considerations for the licensed healthcare provider : Correcting the QT interval from ECG readings: The QTc interval is influenced by the heart rate. At a HR of 60, QT = QTc using any of the formulas (Bazett, Texas Department of State Health Services Standing Delegation Orders for Tuberculosis Clinical Services Provided by Authorized Licensed Nurses, Fiscal Year 20 24 TB Clinical Services, SDO, FY2 4 Page 57 of 61 Fridericia, Framingham or Hodges). As HR increases, the QTc increases. Most ECG machines in the US us e the Bazett formula which at higher HR yields a more prolonged QTc than the Fridericia formula. It is recommended to use the Fridericia formula when calculating corrected QTc intervals as studies examining TB medications and QT prolongation used the Fride ricia formula in their assessments and guidance. Consider online calculators (e.g. , https://www.mdcalc.com/corrected -qt-interval -qtc) or manual calculations. Refer to algorithms for monito ring and managing corrected QT prolongation in patient s with DR -TB here: \"Guide for QTc Monitoring and management Agents\" available at: https://www.challengetb.org/publications/tools/pmdt/Guidance_on_ECG_moni toring_in_NDR_v2.pdf c. Laboratory tests: Patient s prescribed second line medications age 18 or older will have additional labs collected under the following circumstances: 1) At Baseline: CBC and CMP. A pregnancy test for females of childbearing age who are starting clofazimine and/or on an aminoglycoside, commonly amikacin. For patient s on bedaquiline and amikacin , include magnesium, which mu st be ordered in addition to the CMP. For patient s on ethionamide , bedaquiline , and para-amino salicylic acid (PAS) , a TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone) level. 2) Monthly: CBC and CMP. For patient s on bedaquiline , include magnesium. 3) Quarterly and as needed: For patient s on, ethionamide , PAS or bedaquiline , include TSH. 4) As needed and/or per consultation : Therapeutic drug monitoring . d. Radiology : Posterior -anterior (PA) view CXRs should be performed for patient s over age 18; PA and lateral for patient s younger than 18 and patient s with HIV, in the following intervals: 1) Patient s with RR/MDR /Pre-XDR/XDR pulmonary TB: During treatment: o initially o at two months o at six months, t hen, o every six months until completion of therapy or as recommended by DSHS -recognized medical TB consultant Post treatment: Texas Department of State Health Services Standing Delegation Orders for Tuberculosis Clinical Services Provided by Authorized Licensed Nurses, Fiscal Year 20 24 TB Clinical Services, SDO, FY2 4 Page 58 of 61 o Every six months for two years , accompanied with a TB signs and symptoms questionnaire. 2) For patient s who are contacts to MDR/Pre -XDR/XDR TB diagnosed with TB infection, regardless of whether they completed prophylaxis treatment for TB infection, every effort should be made to perform a TB signs and symptoms screening questionnaire and a CXR every six months for two years as this is the highest risk period for developing active disease. If symptoms of TB are present, follow up as indicated (refer to Attachment 5 ). e. Sputum collectio n: For patient s with pulmonary disease, collect sputum in the following intervals after initial samples: 1) Collect at least three consecutive sputum specimens for AFB smear and culture monthly until culture conversion. 2) Continue to collect at least one sputum specimen for AFB smear and culture after culture conversion, at least once a month, until treatment completion. 3) Every effort should be made to collect at least one sputum every six months for two years after completion of therapy. f. Release from airborne isolation*: It is appropriate to be more cautious when releasing these patients from airborne isolation. Contact the licensed healthcare provider for best practice. Release may be made in consultation with a DSHS -recognized medical TB consultant if needed . Considerations to release from isolation include: Release to a low or high -risk (i.e., congregate settings, household with small children, setting with immunocompromised individuals , and work site ) Patient 's response to therapy clinically, radiographically, and bacteriologically (some experts recommend two to three consecutive negative AFB sputum cultures prior to release from isolation.) *Refer to: - content/uploads/2021/12/guidelines_home_hospital_infectious_patients.pdf and https://www.currytbcenter.ucsf.edu/sites/default/files/tb_sg3_chap8_monito ring_and_cm.pdf#infectionctrl g. Completion therapy: 1) Patient s with RR, MDR, Pre -XDR, or XDR TB : Initial and continuation phases are different for patient s with DR - TB. Refer to consult for dose counting and regimen chang es based on response to therapy. Texas Department of State Health Services Standing Delegation Orders for Tuberculosis Clinical Services Provided by Authorized Licensed Nurses, Fiscal Year 20 24 TB Clinical Services, SDO, FY2 4 Page 59 of 61 An end of treatment consult with a DSHS -recognized TB medical expert is required prior to stopping treatment. 2) Patient s with isoniazid mono -resistant TB (high or low level) or INH intolerance : Seek consultation from a DSHS recognized medical TB consultant. o Once fluoroquinolone susceptibilities are known and no further resistance is identified, the addition of a later - generation fluoroquinolone (usually moxifloxacin or levofloxacin ) may be added to the regimen. Texas Department of State Health Services Standing Delegation Orders for Tuberculosis Clinical Services Provided by Authorized Licensed Nurses, Fiscal Year 20 24 TB Clinical Services, SDO, FY2 4 Page 60 of 61 ATTACHMENT 9: DSHS -Recognized TB Medical Consult ant Indications Consultation from a DSHS -Recognized TB Medical Consultant is required or recommended in the situations described below. Exceptions to consultation requirements may be granted if made by the DS HS Regional Medical Director (RMD). In that case, the RMD must either write the medical orders for the patient or include a signed letter in the patient 's medical record that the treatment prescribed meets criteria for adequate therapy.
