Genus of double -stranded RNA virus. Nearly every child in the world has been infected with rotavirus at least once by the age of five. Immunity develops with each infection, so subsequent infections are less severe Adults are rarely affected. 5 species A, B, C, D, and E. Rotavirus A, the most common species causing more than 90% of infections among humans. Global Impact of Rotavirus vaccination: Evidence as of May, 2020 -Rotaviral disease burden -Worldwide vs. India (Pre -vaccine rollout) 2016Diarrhea was fifth major cause ofglobal deaths among <5aged children .Among these, Rotavirus accounted for the highest diarrhoea -induced deaths . Burden (36.3 $)7.6%ofanaverage Indian income . Rotavirus hospitalizations cost about US$73million each year, while outpatient treatments cost about US$ 80million inIndia .Currently & 49% in 2nd year (Bhandari et al. 2014)36% in 1st , 49% in 2nd Year in India (Kulkarni et al. 2017) & 67% in Niger study Monovalent, human, live attenuated vaccine.

Participants was enrolled from urban slums of Kolkata adjacent to NICED and from surveillance area under KEM HRC, Pune, to ensure close observation post -intervention Informed consent of parents were obtained Block randomization in blocks of at least 12 with equal allocation to six armsJustification for recruiting comparator arms Since efficacy trials forRotasiil and Rotavac were carried out insimilar areas, there was a concern that inorder tolimit the number ofarms inthe study, we could compare the immunogenicity from thefour intervention arms with thedata from historical comparator arms . However, weproposed inclusion oftwo comparator arms because : Epidemiologically inexpedient tocompare historical comparators with current intervention arms Two comparators arms recruited and tested atdifferent time points Primary objective ofprevious trials was reduction ofsevere rotavirus gastroenteritis, slightly different from current hypotheses ;immunogenicity studies were onsmaller sub-samples with less power .Choosing those comparators would beinappropriateDetails of study participants at the two sites Site Consented Drop out Randomized Visit 1 Visit 2 Visit 3 Visit 4Early Termination ICMR -NICED 1067 78 989 989 956 936 907 82 KEM 1042 52 990 990 969 958 945 45Total participants completed thestudy :1852 Baseline Characteristics age(SD) -47.28days (3.97) (SD) didnotdiffer and Arm 1 : RotavacArm 2 : Rotasiil - RotasiilArm : - RotavacArm : - RotasiilArm : - RotasiilArm 6 : Rotasiil - Rotavac RotavacSeroconversion Arm 1 : Rotavac - Rotavac - Rotavac Arm 2 : Rotasiil - Rotasiil - Rotasiil Arm 3 : Rotavac - Rotasiil - Rotavac Arm 4 : Rotasiil - Rotavac - Rotasiil Arm 5 : Rotavac - Rotasiil - Rotasiil Arm : Rotasiil - Rotavac - Rotavac Maximum sero -response was observed in Arm 5 (38.2%) followed by Arm 3 (34.3%)Sero -response rate in compared tothebaseline value forsubjectsSero -response in mixed and pure vaccine groups The SRR difference provide supporting evidence ofnon-inferiority since the lower limit of95% Newcombe -Wilson confidence interval forSRR difference although crossed theactual line but didnotcross thenon-inferiority margin -10%.

The study was conducted inanunblinded manner Lastly, itispossible that some naturally occurring rotavirus infections could have influenced immunogenicity results butsince thestudy was randomized, this would have happened across all study groups, including thepure vaccine groups .Inference The present study demonstrates that administering mixed vaccine product combinations of Rotavac and Rotasiil provides anon-inferior sero -response rate ascompared tosingle vaccine product regime . This study have also inferred that amixed vaccine regime issafe and efficient against Rota virus infections among less than five year oldpopulation .
