C ounties sh ould clea rly identify: 1. Critical stakehol der groups including individuals and their families, consum er groups, provi ders of h uman services, and partners from o ther system s; Planning team members include human services providers and stakeholders as well as consumers and advocate family members. In addition, the team includes staff support from each of the departments included in the block grant. Appendix D includes a comprehensive list of the members of the planning team and their affiliations. The leadership team is comprised of key fiscal and human service administration staff and includes: Human Services Administrator, Fiscal Specialist, Human Services Fiscal Director, MH/ID/EI Administrator, Drug & Alcohol Admin istrator, County Grants Director, and the Assistant County Administrator. 2. How these stakeholders were provi ded with an opportunity for partici pation in t he pl anning process, i ncluding information on outreach and en gagemen t; We have a small but active Planning Team that deliberates on the larger Block Grant Plan, monitors implementation, and recommends adjustments throughout the year. In addition to participating in the Human Services Block Grant (HSBG) meetings, program consumers and their families are often asked for their input through surveys, evaluations, and informal feedback; this feedback informs the operation of Block Grant -funded programs. In addition, most of our categorical areas have their own advisory boards which inform the direction of each department and Block Grant -funded programs: o The Franklin/Fulton Drug & Alcohol Drug Advisory Board holds eleven meetings per year, six in Franklin County and five in Fulton County. The voting members of the Advisory Board 1 include the following sector Community. They provide input into the Block Grant Plan, are informed of Block Grant impact and are made aware of any Drug/Alcohol requests for new funding, projects or service enhancements. o The Franklin County Housing Task Force consists of about 25 people who meet bi -monthly on issues around housing and homelessness. Representatives from both County shelters and the HAP program attend regularly, along with Housing Authority staff, staff from the domestic violence shelter, Salvation Army, an FQHC, two Boroughs, and several religious organizations. They also receive updates on Block Grant plans and funding requests. The Task Forc e now combines their meetings with those of the Program Coordinating Committee hosted by the County Housing Authority, a change which has engaged additional community members and offered opportunities for presentations on local housing resources. o The Franklin/ Fulton County Mental Health/ Intellectual Disabilities/ Early Intervention Advisory Board meets bi -monthly, with 13 members, including one Commissioner from Fulton and one from Franklin. The committee requires representation from each county: four members from Fulton County; nine members from Franklin County. At least two representatives appointed to the Board are physicians (preferably, a psychiatrist and a pediatrician). Four participants are consumers or family members, of which half represent Intellectual Disabilities/ Early Intervention. Additional representation comes from the following areas of expertise: psychology, social work, nursing, education, religion, local health and welfare planning organizations, local hospitals, businesses and other interested community groups. The MH/ID/EI Administrator provides HSBG updates as applicable during the Board meetings. They have impact on decisions related to MH/ID/EI funding and decisions, which indirectly can impact the HSBG. o The Children & Youth Advisory Board meets five times each year. Members come from various sectors, including the County Commissioners, law enforcement, academia, school districts, providers, and staff. They receive updates on the Family Group Decision Making program funded by the Block Grant. 3. How the coun ty intend s to use funds to provi de servi ces to its residents in the least restrictive setting appropriate to their n eeds. For those count ies 2 participatin g in the County Hu man Ser vices Block Grant, funding can be shifted between categorical a reas based on the determinati on of loc al need and wi thin the parameters est ablished for the Block Gr ant; Details of the services to be funded are provided under each categorical area. In general, funding allocations have remained similar to last year, as we currently feel that we have achieved a balance that provides for the basic needs in each categorical. 4. Subs tantial progra mmat ic and/or funding chang es bei ng made as a resul t of last y ear's outc omes. County Planning Team members acknowledge that the existing data lacks the breadth and depth to make critical decisions regarding comprehensive human services that are responsive to local needs and the current service delivery environment. T he County Planning Team is working to establish an objective decision- making framework that incorporates needs, outcomes and values when developing future human services plans, starting with a data warehouse that we will develop next year. The processes for establishing both meaningful outcomes (as opposed to outputs) and for prioritizing our needs has taken much time and planning, as outcomes and needs prioritization are intimately related. We have started by determining the current program outputs and outcomes. We will use those outcomes as part of the process to determine our priorities and needs, with the outcomes data collected in the data warehouse serving as a foundation for determining needs. We have not settled on a model to objectively assess needs, but we know that the model must include valid and reliable data, quality community dialogue, and strategic thinking as we plan for the future. With a solid foundation, we can forecast desired future outcomes and goals that will be meaningful to the Block Grant programs and ultimately the community as a whole. The collaborative nature of the Block Grant Plan process remains extremely beneficial to the county, especially the inclusion of consumer and family perspectives. The Planning Team is better able to take a holistic approach because they better unders tand each department's mission and services. The process also yields more empathy among planners. The County Planning Team still wrestles with the weighty question of, \"How can we be expected to pick certain human services over others when there is such great need throughout all of the programs?\" But, with the collaborative nature of Franklin County stakeholders, and the forward movement of integrating objective data into the decision- making process, this task is no longer as daunting as County Planning Team members perceived in the past. 5. Representation from al l count ies if partici pants of a Local Collabor ative Arrangem ent (LCA). Franklin and Fulton Counties are joinders in Drug & Alcohol and MH/ID, and as such have representation on each county's Block Grant committees. Jean Snyder from Fulton County Human Services serves on the Franklin County HSBG Planning Committee. 3 PAR T II: PUBLIC HEARIN G NOTI CE Two ( 2) are requ ired for counties pa rticip ating in the Human Services Block G rant. One (1) public hearing is requ ired for counties not partici pating in the Human Servic es Block G rant. Please provi de the following: 1. Proo f of publication; a. Actual ne wspaper ad b.

(This is required whether or not there is publi c attendance a t the hearing) NOT E: The publi c heari ng no tice f or counties participa ting i n local collabo rative arrangements (LCA) s hould be made known to residen ts of bot h counties. The Board of Commissioners approved the County's Human Services Plan, as illustrated by their signatures found in Appendix A - Assurance of Compliance. Pursuant to the Sunshine Act, 65 Pa.C.S. 701 -716, the County conducted two public hearings to receive input on the Human Services Plan detailed in this document. A draft of the Block Grant Plan was posted on the County's website on May 16, 2016 for public review and comments. Public hearings were held at 3:00 PM on May 26, 2016, as part of the Block Grant Planning Committee, and 9:30 AM on June 2, 2016, as part of the Board of County Commissioners meeting. Appendix B contains the proof of publication and summaries of the public hearings. PAR T III: MINI MUM EXPENDI TURE LEVEL (Applicable only to Block Grant Counties) For FY 2016/ 17, there i s no minimum expendi ture lev el requirement; however , no catego rical area may be completely e liminated. Please s ee the Fiscal Year 20 16/17 County Huma n Services P lan Guidelines Bu lletin for additional inform ation. PAR T IV: HUMA RVICES NARRAT IVE Created thr ough a collaborative process utilizing local needs data and involving a cross- section of community stakeholders, the goal of this plan is to provide a comprehensive continuum of human services for residents in the least restrictive setting appropriate to their needs. Franklin County collaborates as a joinder with Fulton County in four of the seven funds included in the Block Grant. Both counties have longstanding Human Services Administrative models. Both counties are participating in the Block Grant and su bmit separate plans. 4 Franklin County's Human Services Block Grant Planning Committee has established as its mission: To assist in identifying need- based program priorities for promoting the health, well -being, and self -sufficiency for all people in Franklin County by and through maximizing resources. The services described in this plan are an outflow of this mission statement, and are measured against this guiding standard. MENT AL HEA LTH SE RVICES The discussi ons in this secti on should take i nto acco unt sup ports and servi ces fun ded (or to be fun ded) with all available fundi ng sources, including state a llocations, county funds, federal grants, HealthChoices, reinv estment and other programm atic improveme nts that have enhanced the behavior al heal th service sy stem in FY 2 015-2016. The Franklin/ Fulton County Mental Health Program provides services to Franklin/ Fulton County adults with severe and persistent mental illness and children who have a mental health diagnosis or who are at risk of developing a mental illness. Through contracted case management, our agency provides intake, assessment, and coordination of the following services: outpatient psychotherapy, psychiatric and psychological evaluation, medication monitoring, residential programs, vocational and social rehabilitation, short -term inpatient, partial hospitalization and 24- hour emergency services. Due to the budget issues faced this fiscal year, we focused on maintaining and strengthening the current services already offered in our community. The following list describes program achievements and improvements: Crisis Intervention Team (CIT) - This initiative is in its fourth year and continuing to gain momentum. The team is now 59 strong with half of our members representing law enforcement and first responders. The remainder of the team represents crisis, jail officers/staff, probation officers, mental health professionals and advocates. We were fortunate to have hospital staff join our team this year as well. South Central Region CIT continues to follow the fidelity of the Memphis Model of CIT. During the 40 hours of training, we are fortunate to have a certified trainer for the Veterans module. We also offer evidence based training s uch as QPR (Question Persuade Refer) and Pat Madigan's Hearing V oices throughout the week . Outcomes: o To date we have held four (4) CIT trainings and have fifty nine (59) members with half of our team being represent ed by law enforcement and first responders : 5 Court Hospital Law Enforcement First Responders Mental Health Jail Probation Court Hospital 8% Law Enforcement 41% First Responders Mental Health 29% Probation 7% 2% 5% o The pre/post -tests show considerable growth. The training continues to show growth in learning, however, it shows a slight decline from previous classes. It is possible that as we get more seasoned officers in the training , they have more experience and exposure to working with individuals and professionals in the mental health system. It is also possible that they are learning from their peers who are already CIT team member s. 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 class 1 class 2 class 3 class 4 Avg Growth Avg Growth 0 2 4 6 pre post Series1 Mental Health First Aid Franklin/Fulton County is fortunate to have five (5) local trainers. Three (3) of them are Adult Mental Health First Aid instructors and two (2) are both Youth/Adult Mental Health First Aid instructors. o In the past five years we have trained approximately 252 participants in Adult Mental Health First Aid. Participants have come from a variety of professional backgrounds including : social work, homeless shelter staff, nursing home staff, administrative staff, corrections staff, business partners, and many others. 6 o During our May celebration, there is opportunity for community members to participate in Adult Mental Health First Aid as well as Youth Mental Health First Aid. Supportive Employment Continue to work towards increasing our supported employment opportunities for those in the workforce. Outcomes: We tracked the number of employees engaged in Supportive Employment and the percent change compared to last year. FY 15-16 doesn't include individuals who are transitioning into supported employment. Employment Fiscal Year 14-15 *Fiscal year 15-16 % Change 14-15 to 15\u00ad 16 AHEDD 21 18 -14% OSI 21 21 0% Total 42 39 -7% *15-16 data through Apr il Communities That Care Our community was the proud recipient of a grant to implement the evidence based program, Communities T hat Care. We ar e in the implementation phase ; our data committee has just completed their needs assessment survey and the resource committee is preparing to begin a mapping process in May. The student committee began in February. We have been participating in local health and resource fairs in order to gain membership and awareness in this startup phase. Trauma -Informed Criminal Justice Strategic Plan In Spring of 2015, SAMHSA awarded Franklin County one of 10 Training and Technical Assistance grants to assist in creating a Trauma- Informed Criminal Justice Strategic Plan, and training criminal justice professionals on How Being Trauma- Informed Improves Criminal Justice System Responses . The resulting Strategic Plan has 20 Priority Areas and accompanying Action Steps that we have been implementing over the course of the last year, including: staff training and policies, client trauma screening, and EBP implementation. System Service Needs In a review of system service needs, MH/ID/EI recognized that historically, our sy stem has required improvements in data collection related to quality of care. In response, MH/ID/EI partnered with other entities in our community to identify which areas should be analyzed for our system. We created workgroups and assigned them to priorit y 7 areas for system indicators analysis. The following topics arose as needing improvement; we detail what has been done since last year to improve these areas. Readmission rates We continue to have a workgroup comprised of outpatient providers, behavioral health unit, advocates, crisis, case management, HealthChoices, managed care, and the C ounty. The group is focused on identifying any commonalities and discrepancies in our services compared to neighboring communities. The information will be combined with results of a survey from individuals that have experienced multiple admissions with the goal of creating an action plan. Outcomes: We tracked the annual readmission rates and the percent change compared to previous years. Despite an increase in admission rates, readmission rates have continued to decrease since 2012, with a significant decrease from 2014 to 2015. Bed days per admission have also decreased since 2011. We believe that reduced r eadmission is due to assuring that individuals are set up with an outpatient appointment within 7 days after inpatient discharge, thus keeping the individual engaged and maintaining the continuity of care. Hospital data 2011 2012 2013 2014 % Change (13 -14) 2015 % Change (14-15) Admission 279 313 174 161 -7% 225 +40% Unduplicated 160 165 98 89 -9% 131 +47% Readmission 119 148 76 72 identify the streng ths a nd needs spec ific to each of t he following target popul ations se rved by the behavioral health system: Older Adults (ages 60 and above) Strengths: o Franklin County Mental Health has partnered with Link to create Franklin County Older Adult Team. This team includes Crisis Intervention Staff and Area Agency on Aging Staff. The goal is to assist older adults in diverting from a mental health inpatient stay by accessing available services in the community. Referral criteria has been established and implementation roll out is currently in process. o Continue to provide training regarding older adults and mental health to law enforcement and first responders through the CIT program. This includes multiple ways of engagement that includes utilization of several senses. Recognizing the local resources and how to access. 8 Needs: o As the regulations are changing at the state and federal level for the Area Agency on Aging, it will be important for the county to provide multiple education sessions. Adults (ages 18 and above) Strengths o WRAP\u00ae -Franklin/Fulton County has 21 WRAP\u00ae facilitators representing different levels of services. We are fortunate to have three of our facilitators certified to do WRAP\u00ae for Developmental Disabilities. Two of them assisted in writing the workbook and were invited to present our piloted WRAP\u00ae for developmental disabilities program at WRAP\u00ae Around the World Conference in Washington DC. We were able to complete one 8-week WRAP\u00ae group this year with thirteen graduates. This program is one that was not able to be expanded as much as we wanted due to the budget restraint this fiscal year. Our hope is to offer a few groups throughout this new fiscal year. o The Community Support Program continues to host t he Leadership Academy . The program runs one day a w eek for eight weeks . It featur es class sessions on such topics as: networking, meeting coordination, dressing for success, and others. The sessions are conducted by vari ous profession als from our community who volunteer their time . The goal of the academy is preparation of individuals with a mental illness to serve or hold a position on local community advisory board councils and/or boards of directors. To date, 50 have graduated over the past 5 years. Currently, the class will graduate 12 students at the end of May. Needs: o Public transportation continues to be voiced as a need. For the past few years, MH/ID /EI has had a contractual agreement with Franklin County Integrated Transportation to provide funding for transportation to mental health- related appointments for individuals who are not Medicaid eligible. Recently, rabbitt ransit was awarded the contract for our County Shared Ride transportation program. They are assessing community needs to determine any creative transportation plans/programs that may be implemented . Transition- age Youth (ages 18- 26) Strengths: o The focus is on employment opportunities and skills training for transition-age youth. Mental Health partnered with Intellectual Disabilities to host an employment fair in May. The day start ed with an informational presentation for the employers to learn the benefits available for hiring individuals with a disability. This include d a panel presentation with local employers who shared their experiences. School districts brought students 18 years and older to the fair. Local providers such as the psychiatric rehab center, clubhouse, and supported employment also brought 9 individuals. Family was also invited as benefit education was available on site. Needs: o Employment and housing options are needed in our community for transition- age youth. o Independent living skills training is needed for this population. General activities of daily living such as balancing a check book, paying bills, grocery shopping, cooking, and cleaning are some examples. Children (under 18) . Counties are encouraged to also include services like Student Assistance Program (SAP), Respite, and CASSP Coordinator Services and Supports in the discussion. Community events: o Kick-off Your Drug Free Summer will continue this year and has proved successful not only with the amount of participation but in the fact the communities have taken over the program and now we are a partner instead of the organizer. o Healthy Community Partnership hosted a ten week running program, Go Girls Go, fo r element ary girls. Forty -five girls started the program and 38 finished by running a 5k community run for the local Cumberland Valley Breast Cancer Alliance. The program was designed to work on increasing self-esteem and body image. The data is still bein g compil ed; however, unexpected reports from the teachers have been received regarding the positive changes seen in the girls' behavior and socialization within the classroom and school. Family support increase was also reported as an unexpected outcome. P lanning is continuing to determine funds and staffing in order to continue this program. o Summit Health, our community's largest health care provider, sponsors a children's wellness day every spring for all third grade students in Franklin County. It consists of seven stations, all focused on wellness, covering everything from exercise, gun safety, fire safety, tobacco products, kindness, and positive identity. Mental Health/Intellectual Disabilities is the station leader for Positive Identity. We discuss w ith them the importance of good character traits through positive self -esteem and the impact of bullying. We have used the book \"Have You Filled a Bucket Today\" by Carol McCloud as a guide. This year 1,358 third grade students participated. Respite: The demand for overnight respite decreased this fiscal year. The number of children served for FY 14- 15 and 15- 16 is unduplicated. FY 12 -13 FY 13 -14 FY 14 -15 FY 15 -16 Overnight Hourly Overnight Hourly Overnight Hourly Overnight Hourly Children Served 10 5 10 2 10 6 4 0 Hours of Respite 480 39 600 37 624 12 288 0 10 Children and Adolescent Service System Program (CASSP): We tracked the number of families and schools accessing service and supports: Franklin CASSP Calendar year 2012 2013 2014 2015 Meetings Held 155 220 169 231 New Referrals 40 58 22 40 Higher level of care 14 18 18 27 Strengths: o School -based mental health outpatient services are now present in all secondary schools in Franklin County. o Franklin County was fortunate to begin an el ementary Student Assistance Program (SAP) in two of our school districts. The referrals were overwhelming. Elementary SAP has been able to engage family members to participate and have assisted them in accessing services in the community. o Student Assistanc e Program (SAP) is now present in all of the secondary schools in Franklin Count y. Franklin/Fulton combined # students screened % MH % D/A % CO 2015 -2016 (through April) 7% Franklin only # students screened % MH % D/A % CO 15-16 (through April) 289 79% 2% 19% Needs: o Funding to provide SAP within all the elementary schools in both counties. Identify the streng ths and needs spec ific to each o f the following spec ial/underserved popul ations. If the county does not serve a particul ar population, please indicate a nd note any p lans for developing services for that populati on. 11 Individuals transitioning out of state hospitals Streng ths: o Franklin County continues to partner with the state hospital to create a community support plan with input from the individual, their treatment team and family/friends. Prior to discharge, this plan is reviewed again by the same group and follows the person into the community. Needs: o There is a committee currently working to identify needs and make recommendations to decrease the number of hospitalizations. o There appears to be a need for more supported housing to assist in the transitions and also to provide some diversion from needing higher levels of care. Co-occurring Mental Health/Substance Abuse Strengths: o The Implementation committee created a co- occurring credentialing process for providers. It mirror s the OMHSAS bulletin that was created. The managed care organization and the county mental health program recognized the credentialing process and provided an enhanced rate to any provider who successfully passed. This fiscal year we had two dually licensed outpatient providers pass the credentialing. As part of the credentialing , the providers agreed to pilot a data collection survey. There is an increase in identified persons with co- occurring disorders that we are attributing to better diagnostic practices. Please refer to the transformation priorities for further detail. o Training related to co- occurring illness continues to be offered free to our providers. We offer an on -line training series that is available for all Franklin/Fulton County providers. It features training based on the Tip- 42 to include motivational interviewing. o Since our initiative began we have increased the number of persons accessing services in both the mental health and drug & alcohol programs. Individuals with a COD 800 200 400 a COD 12 o Our readmission rates are decreasing for both non- hospital and inpat ient hospital for individuals identified as someone with a co- occurring disorder. 30 Day Readmission Rate 13/14 14/15 15/16 (to date readmission rate rehab COD 0.00% 5.00% 10.00% Needs: o Financial support is needed to afford clinicians the time to prepare for and complete the Certified Co- Occurring Disorders Professional (CCDP) credential. Our d ata shows a decrease in services and it is concluded that clinicians having access to education and training has proven helpful in identifying and making referrals to the most beneficial services. Justice- involved individuals Strengths: o In 2012, key criminal justice stakeholders in Franklin County met to update a sequential intercept mapping model, first created in 2009, to detail the intersection of local human services with the criminal justice system, identifying gaps and developing objectives to address unmet needs. 13 Reentry from a jail environment into the community at large are the fourth and fifth intercepts of this model (Munetz, M. & Griffin, P., 2006). o In the CJAB Strategic Plan for 2016- 2019, Franklin County identified the enhancement and expansion of reentry initiatives to include housing and treatment programs. o In 2015, PCCD awarded Franklin County a grant to engage a consultant who has worked extensively with reentry strategic planning throughout the state. This process served as a bas is for continued development of a reentry coalition, organized around the goal of cross -agency collaboration to provide comprehensive services for reentering citizens and their families, recognizing the difficulties inherent in the process and helping people remove barriers to reentry wherever possible. o The Reentry Strategic Planning Committee first convened on July 30, 2015 and became the Franklin County Reentry Coalition in November 2015. MH/ID staff have been heavily involved in the Coalition and have been able to provide a much- needed perspective on MH and criminality. o Franklin County was one of 50 counties chosen to be part of the Stepping Up Initiative's National Summit in Washington DC in April 2016, an event that brought together jurisdictions of all sizes to learn from each other and from experts in the ongoing push to reduce the number of people with mental illnesses in local jails. The MH/ID Administrator served as the Team Leader for the Franklin County delegation; we anticipate new initiatives around MH and criminal justice- involved individuals will be developed as a result. Needs: o Early identification and assessment of individuals with MH issues who become involved in the criminal justice system. o Increase the CIT team members as a method of better communication between the departments/disciplines within our community. o A program that would be available 24/7 to provide assessments for individuals that do not need to go to jail but need some support or diversion. Veterans: Strengths: o During the week of CIT training , law enforcement is continuing to be educated about experiences of Veterans returning home after combat. o Participating in the 2 nd annual Veterans Conference being held locally to share the services available and access information. o When a person with military experience comes into contact with our local emergency room, crisis intervention, or delegates , it is requested that the 14 Veterans Affair s department is offered as a resource and be contacted immediately to assist in a diversionary plan. Needs: o A method of better engagement is needed. Stigma also seems to play a role in lack of access. Lesbian/Gay/Bisexual/Transgender/Questioning/Intersex (LGBTQI) consumers Strengths: o Through CIT, Law Enforcement is being educated about experiences of persons identifying as transgender ed. Needs: o List of local MH providers trained to understand the needs of LGBTQI consumers Racial/Ethnic/Linguistic minorities Strengths: o The county hosted an outreach day in the local Hispanic Center in o ur community. Staff was on site to link and offer referrals to local services. o MH/ID/EI does have a contractual agreement with an agency which provides translation and interpretation services. o During Children's Wellness Day, the presentation has posters and signs in Spanish to assist in sharing the healthy message to those that are still learning English. Needs: o SAP has identified a need for more services to be available in Spanish. As they complete screening s for students , they are struggling to find ser vices to make referrals due to the language barrier. Services t hat would be helpful are family -based, outpatient services (both MH and D&A), as well as school -based outpatient. Other, if any (please specify) None identified. c) Recovery- Oriented S ystems Trans formation: Based on the str ength s and needs reported abov e, identify the top five p riorities for recover y oriented sy stem transformation efforts the county plans to address in FY 2016- 2017.For each transform ation p riority, provide: A brief narrative descri ption of the priority A timeline to accomp lish the tr ansformation prio rities including approxim ate dates for progress steps and priority compl etion.

Comprehensive, Continuous, Integrated System of Care Model implementation (CCISC) to develop a service system that is co-occurring capable. Description a. Implementation team has developed a credentialing process to recognize local providers that have completed the criteria to be co- occurring capable. Target Progress Steps i. The certification program began the process in May 2015 with the outpatient providers interested in becoming a recognized county certified co- occurring program. We had two providers that the passed the test and are being re- credentialed in May 2016. The proces s will be open to other providers that are interested in becoming certified as co- occurring capable as well. Completion Dates Ongoing Resources Needed A two percent incentive rate has been established with County and HealthChoices funds to encourage participation in the program. HealthCh oices funds have been utilized to assist with in-person training elements of the program and County funds for an online training module. Tracking Mechanism This is monitored through the CCISC action plan and reviewed at implementation team meetings. In addition, this is mo nitored during HealthChoices monthly Quality Improvement/ Utilization Management meetings. CCISC will be updating the action plan this summer to address the needs identified in our local community health needs assessment. The results of the assessment will be completed and available later this summer. Target date is Dec. 2016. ii. Program hosted our second annual Networking Day just for providers. The goal is to foster the relationships between community providers and increase their knowledge of each other's specialties to allow for better referrals. June 16, 2016 b.

The mission of Franklin/Fulton Mental Health/Intellectual Disabilities/ Early Intervention is to partner with the community to develop and assure the availability of quality MH/ID/EI services and supports for individuals and families. Through the use of a person- centered planning approach and the utilization of Prioritization of Urgency of Need for Services (PUNS), the ID program assists individuals in accessing services and supports within their community regardless of the funding stream. The PUNS gathers information from the person- centered planning approach to identify current and anticipated needs. This information allows Franklin/Fulton Mental Health/Intellectual Disabilities/Early Intervention to budget and plan for the continuum of services and to develop programs to meet the needs of the community. Programs support client engagement and provide access to services for employment , training, housing and family support as appropriate. As of April 30, 2016, there were 528 people registered in the Intellectual Disabilities program in Franklin County, of which 38 are participants in the life sharing program. 23 Estimated Individ uals served in FY 15-16 Percent of total Individuals Served Projected Individuals to be served in FY 16 -17 Percent of total Individuals Served Supported Employment 22 4 24 4.5 Pre-Vocational 7 1 5 1 Adult Training Facility 0 0 0 0 Base Funded Supports Coordination 57 11 60 11 Residential (6400)/ unlicensed 1 0.2 0 0 Life Sharing (6500)/unlicensed 0 0 0 0 PDS/AWC 0 0 0 0 PDS/ VF 0 0 0 0 Family Driven Family Support Services 21 4 25 5 Franklin/ Fulton County ID Program has developed a logic model to reflect the outcomes and objectives that are being accomplished in both counties. The desired outcomes and objectives to be measured are the same as the Quality Management Plan developed for ODP. Appendix E has details that outline the desired outcomes, the objectives measured and the trends and baseline data. The narratives include more details of the outcomes.

P lease add sp ecifics regardi ng the Employm ent P ilot if y our County is a partici pant. Employment First is a concept promoting community integrated employment. Franklin/ Fulton ID program is supporting this concept in a variety of ways. The \"Transition to Adult Life Success\" program engages young adults with disabilities in discussions and activities pertaining to areas of self -determination and career exploration. The \"Transition to Adult Life Success\" program activities include presentations on employability, community resources, and post -secondary opportunities. One -to-one services include connecting with employers, job shadowing, community -based work assessments, and work incentive counseling. There are currently 50 students in the TALS program in Franklin County. The TALS program has a goal of placing 12 individuals into a competitive job. As of March 2016, 5 individuals had been placed into a competitive job. Supported Employment Services include direct and indirect services provided in a variety of community employment work sites with co- workers w ho do not have disabilities. Supported Employment Services provide work opportunities and support individuals in competitive jobs of their choice. Supported Employment Services enable individuals to receive paid employment at minimum wage or higher from their employer. Providers of Supported Employment Supports have outcomes of \"placing individuals with intellectual disabilities in a competitive job.\" They were expecting to place 10 individuals in new jobs and as of March 2016, they ha d placed 5 individuals in jobs not including the TALS program. Transitional Work Services support individuals transitioning to integrated, competitive employment through work that occurs at a location other than a facility subject to 55 Pa. Code Chapter 2380 or Chapter 2390 regulations. Transitional work service options include mobile work force, work station in industry, affirmative industry, and enclave. Franklin/ Fulton County currently serves all individuals using Transitional Work Services in the Waiver. There are currently 74 individuals in the Transitional Work Program. All these individuals are waiver funded. The ID department is concentrating on Community Employment which includes supported employment and transitional work for the Quality Management Goal and logic model. The outcome for the Quality Management Plan/ logic model is \" people who choose to work are employed in the community .\" As of April 1, 2016, there were 142 Franklin County residents in community employment. Franklin County's QM/logic model objective is to increase by 5% the number of people who want to work to achieve community employment. FY 14- 15 had baseline data of 56% of people who had an employment goal were working in the community. The percentage of individuals working the community is currently 60% (142/236). 25 The Franklin County ID Program is supporting a new program which is due to begin in June 2016. The Pathways Program is a time- limited program that teaches independent living skills and/or employment skills. The outcome of this program is for individuals to complete this curriculum in a 2 year period and live independently in their own apartment and/or have competitive employment at the end of the 2 years. The Franklin County ID Program also support ed an Employment Fair May 12, 2016. The Fair's morning program was a speaker who informs local businesses of the benefits of hiring individuals with disabilities followed by a panel discussion with businesses who hire individuals with disabilities. The afternoon w as open to the public to apply for jobs at these businesses. Success will be measured by whether businesses hire someone with a disability and if individuals are hired by the businesses. During the summer of 2016, the ID Program will also fund a summer youth work program through Occupational Services, Inc. to provide paid work experience opportunities to 16 students who have learning disabilities or intellectual disabilities. The program will target students in Franklin County school districts who do not have the opportunity for ex tended school year, transition activities or paid work during the summer months. This will be the last year for this program as OVR is operating a Pre\u00ademployment Transition Service (PETS). Franklin County ID Program will encourage students to attend this program as appropriate. The Franklin/ Fulton ID Program also partners with OVR to provide and attend Referral trainings. The Franklin/Fulton ID Program participates in the Transition Council with OVR and the School Districts and providers to promote and support the Employment First Model. Supports Coordinati on: Descri be how the county will ass ist the supports coo rdination organization to engage i ndividuals and fam ilies in a c onversati on to explore natural support available to anyone in the comm unity . Descri be how the county will assist suppor ts coordina tors to effectively pl an for indivi duals on the waiting list. Descri be how the cou nty will assist the sup ports coo rdination org anizations to develop ISPs t hat 26 maximize communi ty integration and Comm unity Integrated Employm ent. Base Funded Supports Coordination includes home and community based case management for individuals in nursing facilities and in community residential settings. These services are only paid for individuals who have had a denial of M edical Assistance Coverage. There are 40 people who have base funded Supports Coordination. There are 9 people who have the OBRA Waiver and have base funded Supports Coordination. There are 5 people who reside in an ICF/ID or State Center and receive base funded Supports Coordination. Currently no one is leaving a State Hospital system from Franklin or Fulton Counties, so transition services are not needed at this time. The program has MA denials for people who are receiving base services over $8000. The I D Program collaborates with the Supports Coordination Organization (SCO) by holding monthly meetings with Supports Coordination Supervisors. During these meetings, individuals who are deemed high profile or have Emergency PUNS are discussed regarding natural supports and what supports are necessary for that person. Any individual can be added to this list. At these meetings, PUNS, ISPs, Physicals, Levels of Care and other items are part of the standing agenda discussed monthly. The SCO is also represented o n the Transitional Council and is encouraged to participate in SELN trainings to promote community integrated employment. Lifesharing Options: Descri be how the county will suppor t the grow th of Lifes haring as an opt ion. What are the barriers to the grow th of Lifesharing in your county? Wh at ha ve you found to be succ essful in ex pandi ng Lifesha ring in desp ite the barriers? H ow can ODP be of assist ance to you in ex pandi ng and growing Lifes haring as an option in y our county? According to 55 Pa. Code Chapter 6500: \"Family Living Homes are somewhat different than other licensed homes as these settings provide for life sharing arrangements. Individuals live in a host life sharing home and are encouraged to become contributing members of the host life sharing unit. The host life sharing arrangement is chosen by the individual, his or her family and team and with the life sharing host and Family Living Provider Agency in accordance with the individual's needs. Licensed Family Living Homes are limited t o homes in which one or two individuals with an intellectual disability who are not family members or relatives of the life sharing host reside.\" Satisfaction surveys have shown that people in life sharing living arrangements are more satisfied with their life. This , along with the QM plan/ Logic Model that people choose where they wish to live , has driven the objective for the 2015- 2017 Life Sharing, \" to increase the number of people in life sharing. \" The Franklin County Intellectual Disabilities Program will support the growth of life sharing in the following ways: 1. The Administrative Entity (AE) and SCO will support people interested in a residential placement to meet with life sharing providers and life sharers who 27 have openings to promote life sharing as the first option for residential placement. 2. Once per year at the annual ISP meeting, the AE will review the ISP of anyone who has a residential placement to assure the SCO has discussed moving to life sharing from other residential placements. If the person would benefit from life sharing or is interested in moving, the AE will follow up as in #1 above. 3. The AE Life Sharing Point Person will discuss with providers at least annually if they know of anyone who may benefit or want to move from a 6400 licensed home to a life sharing home. 4. Franklin County has 38 people living in life sharing homes, representing 35% of the people in residential placement. Life sharing is the first residential option offered to any person who needs a residential placement. This is documented in the Individual Support Plan. Currently, there are 41 people living in life sharing h omes in Franklin County (see chart below for Franklin/ Fulton QM/ logic model information). All 41 people have waiver funding to support the services they need in the life sharing home. The Intellectual Disability Program's Quality Management/ logic model outcome is \" people live where they choose. \" The QM objective is to increase the number of people in life sharing in Franklin/ Fulton Counties by 10% (n=44) by June 30, 2017. Some of the barriers to growth in lifesharing in Franklin/ Fulton County are the lack of families willing to be lifesharers. Another barrier is the complex needs of individuals that may be interested in lifes haring. The final barr ier is that caregivers that are lifesharers are aging. As they age, their own needs increase and they cannot continue to provide the care required. While there are barriers to lifesharing in Franklin/ Fulton Counties, there are also successes. Many of the people in lifesharing have lived in their lifesharing homes for 20+ years. Frank lin/ Fulton has an increase in lifesharing every year. And one provider of lifesharing actively recruits lifesharing families successfully. Finally, Franklin/Fulton has been successful in moving people from CRRs to lifesharing when they age out of the Children's system. Cross Systems Communic ations and Training: Descri be how the cou nty will use funding , whether it is block gran t or base, to increase t he capacity of your communi ty provi ders to more fully suppor t indivi duals with multiple needs. Descri be how the county will suppor t effective communication a nd collabo ration with local school districts in ord er to engage i ndividuals and families at an early ag e. Descri be how the county will communica te and co llabor ate with local ch ildren and youth ag encies, t he Area Agency on Aging and the men tal health system to ensure indivi duals and families are provi ded with the in formati on they need to acc ess n eeded comm unity resou rces as wel l as forma lized services a nd sup ports through OD P. The ID program collaborates with the following agencies to increase the support for individuals with multiple needs. The ID program staff attends Child and Adolescent 28 Service System Program (CASSP) meet ings to discuss the supports needed for individuals to be supported in their community and school. The ID staff also has a working relationship with Home Health Aid Providers to support people in the home and community. Lastly, the Managed Care Organization Specialized Needs Unit is available for people who meet those criteria. The ID program also collaborates with the school districts by offering information sessions to both parents and teachers. The ID staff has attended IEPs when requested to help problem solve and/or to provide intake information. The Administrative Entity (AE) also is a member of the transition council and attends the Transition Fairs at all High Schools county -wide. The ID program partners with Children and Youth through CASSP. There are also individual cases where C & Y and the ID Program are involved where communication between the 2 agencies resulted in the best outcome for the child while protecting the individual's rights. The ID program participates in the Aging/ ID Meeting as well as collaborating with the PASSAR. The ID staff also attends the Building Bridges Conference. The Mental Health and Intellectual Disabilities program have a long history of communication and Collaboration. ID collaborated with the Copeland Cent er for Wellness and Recovery and Mental Health to pilot WRAP\u00ae for People with Developmental Distinctions, which supports people with both a mental illness and Developmental Disability. WRAP\u00ae is a recovery oriented evidence- based model that is accepted internationally. Franklin/ Fulton County and Philadelphia are the pilot areas. The first group was held at OSI in 2013. The County is also on the committee that wrote the WRAP\u00ae for People with Developmental Distinctions curriculum in collaboration with The Copeland Center, OMHSAS, NASDDDS and ODP. This curriculum is the next step for WRAP\u00ae for People with Developmental Distinction to become evidenced- based. The County has supported WRAP\u00ae efforts to explain this new program at conferences and trainings. It was presented at the IM4Q Conference in July 2015 and the WRAP\u00ae Around the World Conference in August 2015. WRAP\u00ae groups were held throughout the year. See Mental Health Section. The ID program also presents the module on Intellectual Disabilities in the Cri sis Intervention Team Curriculum. This curriculum teaches police officers, MH professionals and first responders how to respond to someone with a disability in the course of their professions. The ID program is also a participant in the MH/ID Coordination Meetings with Tuscarora Managed Care Alliance and Perform Care to develop policy and procedures for people who have a dual diagnosis. The Quality Management Plan/ Logic Model also includes an outcome to \" collaborate and implement promising practices to assist people in achieving outcomes .\" The 29 objective for the 2015- 2017 QM Plan/ logic model will be to identify individuals who have a dual diagnosis and/or a Behavior Support Plan, then develop a toolkit for them to assist in recovery and achieve their outcomes. In 2015, the baseline data was gathered and the toolkit started. This next year, the data will be prioritized and the toolkit finalized and distributed for use. Emergency S upports : Descri be how individuals in an emerg ency situation w ill be suppor ted in the communi ty (regardless o f availability of county funding or waiver capac ity). Provi de details on your county' s emerg ency respo nse plan including: Does your county reserve any base or block gr ant fun ds to meet emerg ency nee ds? What is your county's emerg ency plan in the event an individual needs emerg ency services, residential or otherwis e, whether within or outside of norm al worki ng hours? Please submi t the county 24-hour Emerg ency Response Plan as required under the Me ntal Health and Intellectu al Disab ilities Act of 1966. If waiver capacity is unavailable, individuals will be supported out of funds in the Block Grant. Base money will be provided to graduates for day programs and transportation to maintain their residence at home, so their parents can maintain their employment status. The ID Independent Apartment Program has 5 people living in their own apartment s with less than 30 hours of support per week. Base funds are used to subsidize the rent. The Franklin County ID department will increase the availability for combinations of Family Aide, Day Programs, Transportation, Adaptive Equipment, Home modifications and Respite so that individuals can continue to live at home instead of residential programs which are more costly. The AE has a Risk Management Committee that meets quarterly to discuss incident management and any items that may arise to become a future emergency. Franklin County responds to emergencies outside of normal work hours in Procedure Statement ID -2014- 505 Incident Management. In this procedure statement, all Program Specialists are listed as well as the MH/ID/EI Administrator with their cell phone numbers. These contacts can be used after hours for any emergency. All providers have been trained in the policy. The Incid ent Management Program Specialist checks the HCSIS database on a daily basis to assure that all the incidents provide for the health and safety of the individuals served. This includes weekends and holidays. Franklin County 30 reserves base respite funds to authorize respite services as needed in an emergency and works with providers and the Supports Coordination Organization to set up these services , whether during normal business hours or after. These services may become Emergency Lifesharing or Emergency Residential while the person is in respite. This provides for the safety of the person and finds a long term solution. The MH/ID Department's mission -essential functions are those critical processes the department must maintain, during the response and r ecovery phases of an emergency, to continue to serve its constituents. The department's mission- essential functions must be able to be executed within 12 hours of a major emergency and be sustainable for up to 30 days during the recovery phase of the emerg ency. The County 24-hour Emerg ency R esponse Plan, as r equired under the Me ntal Health and Intellectual Disab ilities Act of 1966, will be sent as a separate attachment along with the Block Grant Plan. Administrative Fundi ng: ODP has engag ed the PA Family Network to provi de suppor t and training in the community .

Descri be what Risk M anagement approaches your county will utilize to ensure a high-q uality of life for individuals. Descri be how the County will interact with 31 individ uals, families, provi ders, ad vocates and the comm unity at large in rel ation to risk managem ent activities. H ow can ODP ass ist you? Descri be how you will utilize the county hous ing coordina tor for people wi th an intellectual disability. Descri be how the county will engage pr oviders of service in the devel opment of an Emerg ency P reparedness Plan. Franklin/ Fulton ID program is planning to use the PA Family Network to provide trainings for individuals and families as well as providers and county staff. This training will be scheduled as the Communities of Practice initiative develops. The county will support and help coordinate these training s and support future trainings that they can provide. The county also coordinates Information sessions for families. In the past ODP has provided technical assistance for these trainings; the AE also refers people to Advocacy Agencies and the Disability Rights Network. The ID program uses the vast experience of the HCQU. Monthly trainings by the HCQU are held in Franklin County. They also provide individualized training that is requested by providers and families. The AE attends the Positive Practices Committee Meetings as well as Regional HCQU meetings. The HCQU is represented at our provider meetings and sits on both the Risk Management Committee and the QI Council. As a result of this collaboration, a Medication Error Task Force has been convened in Franklin/Fulton Counties. This is an outcome and objective in both the Logic model and QM Plan. The HCQU pr ovides training to individuals, provider homes, staff or individuals depending on the trends found while analyzing the data. This supports the outcome t o assure the health and safety of individuals receiving services, Franklin/ Fulton Intellectual Disabilities Program will use the objective of reducing the number of medication errors by 10% by June 30, 2017 . The baseline data is 270 medication errors from July 2013- April 2015. As of March 31, 2016, there are 89 medication errors this fiscal year. As wit h the HCQU, a representative for the IM4Q local program sits on the QI Council. As a result of the IM4Q data, the local program realized that people did not know what to do in an Emergency even though they had a backup plan in their ISP. So, the QI Council recommended that a one page \"What to do in an Emergency\" for m be developed. This has turned into a folder with different Emergency Preparedness information in it. This folder is given to individuals when reviewing what to do in an emergency or at ISPs when questions are raised. The QI Council also reviews Employment and Lifesharing IM4Q data to determine satisfaction with services. Both of these Outcomes are included in the QM Plan and Logic Model. The biggest barrier to reviewing IM4Q data is that the reports are not current. As a result, there is a lag in developing QM outcomes and objectives. The ID program supports local providers by encouraging them to develop a relationship with the HCQU for trainings needed for their staff to support individuals 32 with higher levels of need. The HCQU can also do biographical timelines, CDCs, medication/pharmacy reviews and provide training. The AE continues to support providers in developing relationships with the local hospital. As previously mentioned, the MH/ID Co ordination Meetings help to support providers also. The Risk Management Committee holds quarterly meetings to assess incidents to establish a higher quality of life for individuals. The Risk Management Committee realized t hat Individual to Individual (I -2-I) abuse was an issue that needed addressed. The logic model and QM Plan both address the I -2-I abuse issue. The outcome, \"People are abuse free,\" is measured by the objective of reducing the number of I -2-I abuse incidents by 5%. The number of incidents of I-2-I abuse will be measured through quarterly analysis of the HCSIS Incident Data and the target trends to prevent future incidents will be analyzed by the Risk Management Team. For 2014- 2015, ODP redefined I -2-I abuse, to make sure the definition is consistent across the state. As a result, the state expects to see I -2-I abuse reports sharply increase, followed by a plateau which Franklin/Fulton will use as baseline data. The baseline data is 115 incidents of I -2-I abuse per year. As of March 31, 2015, there were 80 incidents of I 2 I abuse. The Risk Management Committee has found several trends over this year and is working to resolve the issues. The ID Program partners with the County Housing Program to provide an Independent Living Apartment Program. The people living in these apartments need less than 30 hours of support a week and the county helps subsidize the rent with base funds. There are currently 5 people in this program. The County engages providers of service by ensuring that all ISPs have emergency plans included. As stated in the IM4Q paragraph, the county has developed Emergency Preparedness Folders for people who request them. This is a new procedure and the number of folders requested will be tracked over this plan year. Participant D irected Services (PDS) : Descri be how your county will promote PDS services. Descri be the ba rriers and challenges to increasing the use of Agenc y with Choice. Descri be th e barriers and challenges to increasing the use of VF/ EA. Descri be how the county will suppor t the provisi on of training to individuals and families. Are there ways that ODP can assis t you in promoting/increasing PDS servi ces? Franklin/ Fulton County has no individuals or families using VF/EA. When the VF/EA is explained to families, they choose Agency with Choice (AWC) instead. Franklin County has 33 families using AWC supports. All of their supports and services are paid with waiver funding. The county coordinates trainings for families through the Arc of Franklin/ Fulton Counties (the AWC provider) and the HCQU. The major challenge for AWC is that families have trouble finding staff especially in the rural areas of the county. This is due to the low wage, lack of transportation and/ or locations far from any services , to name a few. Another challenge is that families have a lack of knowledge of the ID system and the service definitions. And finally, 33 families get frustrated at the amount of documentation required of them. ODP assistance could be used to find creative ways to address these issues and to provider trainings to families. Commun ity for All: ODP has provi ded you with the data regarding the number of individuals receivi ng services in congreg ate settings. Descri be how the county will enable these indivi duals to return to the communit y. Franklin County has 5 individuals in congregate settings. Two of these individuals are in Private ICF/ID. Both of the individuals have medical needs too complex to be supported by current providers in the local community. Two of the people at State Centers could leave and go to a Nursing Home but are happy where they currently reside. The remaining person at a State Center is offered community placement annually and chooses to stay at the State Center. The rest of individuals who could be considered in a congregate setting reside in nursing homes. This is a generic support for them due to their need for a nursing home level of care. HOMEL ESS ASSISTA NCE SERVICES Descri be the co ntinuum of services to individ uals a nd families wi thin the co unty who are homeless or facing eviction. An individual or family is facin g eviction if they have recei ved either written or ver bal notification from the landlo rd that they will lose their housing unless so me type of paym ent is receiv ed. Include achievem ents and improvem ents in servi ces to families e xperiencing or at risk for homel essness, as wel l as unmet nee ds and gaps. Homeless and near homeless assistance is provided through the County's Information and Referral Coordinator, PATH, HUD, ESG and HAP. T here are two main shelters within the County, the Franklin County Shelter and the Waynesboro New Hope Shelter. South Central Community Action Program (SCCAP) runs the Franklin County Shelter for the Homeless and is contracted to administer the County's HAP funds. Franklin County has been approved to administer the 2016- 2017 Emergency Solutions Grant , contracting with Waynesboro New Hope Shelter and SCCAP, which includes short -term rental assistance under the rapid rehousing and homelessness prevention programs, as well as shelter support. Franklin County also provides permanent supportive housing through the Mental Health Program and offers an independent living progra m through the Intellectual Disabilities funding. Franklin County's Housing Task Force is coordinated by the Housing Program Specialists and staff from the Franklin County Housing Authority. Numerous community agencies are represented at the Task Force meetings with the goal of working together to pinpoint community housing needs and develop action plans to address those needs. Members of the Task Force also collaborate to organize homeless outreach events and establish community collaboration for donations to the local homeless shelters. 34 The MH Housing Program Specialists work closely with provider s to ensure that adequate housing assistance and supports are in place for PATH -funded individuals. Case management is included as part of supportive services offered in two supportive housing programs within Franklin County. Twenty individuals are able to participate in the programs consecutively. Franklin County's Housing Program Specialists are able to support these enrolled individuals with case management services and also work collaboratively with the individual's case manager through the agenc y contracted to provide mental health case management services . Discussion among the Block Grant Committee included concerns that the needs of homeless families with children are not being met. Plans were made to coordinate efforts among stakeholders to f ind solutions and funding to address the needs of the 106 children identified by schools as being homeless. In FY 15- 16 the Block Grant Committee approved to shift unspent funds into HAP for the Rental Assistance program in the amount of $30,000 and $43,0 40 for Emergency Shelter Support. Beginning in the new FY 16- 17, the projected number of individuals to be served is lower based upon the original funded amount under the HAP program. For each of the following categories, describe the services provided, how the county evaluates the efficacy of those services, and changes proposed for the current year, or an explanation of why this service is not provided: Bridge Housing Due to the limited funds available, Franklin County has not expanded into bridge housing support. Case Management Shelter Case Management - o Staff at our homeless shelter are provided intensive case management during their stay at the shelter and ongoing, if needed. Case Management assists the individual in setting goals and meeting goals that will lead to stability , including safe affordable housing. This program is evaluated on a number of factors: o Did the client increase their income? o Did the client obtain needed supportive services (mental health, job training, physical health needs, et c.)? o Did the client achieve safe affordable housing? Homeless Prevention Case Management - o Our Homeless Assistance Program Coordinator provides case management for individuals needing rental assistance in order to prevent eviction or in order to move out of homelessness. Case Management assists the individual in setting goals and meeting their 35 goals, in evaluating the cost of housing they can afford, and identifying other resources they might need. This program is evaluated on two primary fac tors: o Was the eviction prevented? o Did the family move out of homelessness? Rental Assistance Rental assistance is provided to families to prevent an eviction or in order to move a family who is currently homeless into safe affordable housing. This p rogram is evaluated on two primary factors: o Was the eviction prevented? o Did the family move out of homelessness? Individuals and families are near homeless if they are facing eviction (having received either written or verbal notification from the landlord that they will lose their housing unless some type of payment is received. Verbal notification must be followed up with written documentation). Individuals served by the HAP program must have been a resident of Franklin County for six (6) months prior to applying for assistance. Priority for Rental Assistance will be given to Franklin County applicants who can demonstrate that they will be able to become self -sufficient within three (3) months with regard to housing. Applicants are required to cooperate with case management services and clients will be required to sign a service plan showing areas of responsibility between the case manager and the client. The amount of Rental Assistance allocated will be determined by the facts of the case. A service plan is created for each household. The plan addresses the conditions precipitating the housing crisis. It also addresses the acquisition of permanent housing, including the schedule for disbursement of rental assistance funds. Franklin County staff completes an annual onsite monitoring visit to evaluate case management and shelter support to ensure that all program requirements are being met. Emergency Shelter - Emergency Shelter is provided to families who are currently homeless. Basic needs (shelter and food) are provided in conjunction with intensive case management and effective referrals. This program is evaluated on a number of factors: Did the client increase their income? Did the client obtain needed supportive services (mental health, job training, physical health needs, etc. )? Did the client achieve safe affordable housing? 36 The Franklin County Shelter for the Homeless is located centrally at 223 South Main Street in Chambersburg, PA. The Shelter provides 10 bedrooms, two of which are family r ooms, with the capacity to house up to 18 individuals at one time. The Franklin County Shelter for the Homeless is the last safety net for the residents who may find themselves without a place to live. One of its major goals is to move homeless residents back into permanent housing and toward self -sufficiency. In order to accomplish this, the Shelter staff provides case management activities, setting goals with the residents to be accomplished during and after their stay, and cooperates with other agencies within the County to direct residents to the available resources that will help them achieve their established goals. Clients are also required to participate in a basic life skills program. In order to become a client at the Franklin County Shelter for the Homeless, an individual/family must be legally homeless. If legally homeless, the pot ential client completes an Application for Assistance and Assessment package, which includes a self-declaration of homelessness. A potential client will only be considered a client once he/she has completed the intake forms. Upon completion of the form, the client/family works with the staff to identify his/her/their particular causes for homelessness. Once the causes have been identified, the client/family, in coordina tion with the staff, develops a plan of action including specific goals to be achieved during their stay at the Shelter. Long term goals that lead to the attainment of stable housing are also set. The caseworker assesses the client's work history, medical history, and educational background. This information becomes a permanent part of the client's file. The staff identifies the client's family needs such as nutritional education, parenting classes, and drug/alcohol treatment services. Using this information, staff, under the supervision from the Program Coordinator, acquires the necessary information or services to address that particular client/family's needs . Homeless Assistance Program funds are needed to support the daily operational costs of the Franklin County Shelter for the Homeless as it tries to adapt to the steady increase in homeless needs and extensive supportive services. The shelter staff is finding that an increasing number of homeless individuals need more than 30 days of emergency shelter due to the lack of employment opportunities. Other Housing Supports Franklin County has not used HAP funding for other housing support services. Independent living and forensic apartments are available through other funding sources. Describe the current status of the county's Homeless Management Information System implementation. Franklin County has actively participated in HMIS. The Emergency Solutions Grant, HUD Permanent Supportive Housing Programs, PATH and one Shelter Plus Care Program through Franklin County are currently entering data into the PA -HMIS. Intake forms are organized to capture the information that needs to be entered into the PA \u00ad 37 HMIS system. The goal is to have individuals entered in to PA -HMIS immediately following enrollment in the housing programs. Multiple staff members are familiar with entering data into the system as well as running reports. CHILDREN a nd YOUT H SE RVICES Briefly desc ribe the successes a nd challenge s of t he county' s child welfare system and how allocated fu nds for child welfare in the Human Services B lock G rant will be utilized in con junction with other available fundi ng (including those from the Ne eds Based Budg et and Spec ial Grants, if app licable) to provi de an arr ay of servi ces to improve the perm anency, safety, and well-being of ch ildren and youth in t he county. The Franklin County Children and Youth Service (FCCYS) is the local public child welfare agency responsible for ensuring that the children of Franklin County are safe and receiving the essentials of life. The agency provides services to any child from birth to 18 years of age who has been abused, neglected, exploited, is incorrigible and/or truant, as well as services to their families. Additionally, youth who were determined to be 'dependent' prior to their eighteenth birthday and request to re- enter care are provided child welfare services. Services are provided to families who request and voluntarily accept services or who have been ordered to participate in services by the Franklin County Cour ts. Services are designed to promote the safety, permanency, and well -being of children and their families. These are specialized services dealing with the problems of children whose families need help in caring for them. Reports involving abused, neglected, exploited or truant/incorrigible children are investigated and in- home services and/or placement services are provided to families who meet Children and Youth legal criteria. Children and Youth can help intervene in family disputes and crises; however, Children and Youth does not have the authority to determine, mediate or change Court -ordered custody or visitation agreements. Government intervention is justified when the family cannot, or will not, provide for the child's safety and/or basic needs. Plac ement of a child by Children and Youth can only occur if ordered by the Juvenile Court. FCCYS provides an array of services (either in- house or through private contracted providers) to accomplish the goals set forth above. Block Gran t funding is limited t o only two of the many programs provided by FCCYS: Family Group Decision -Making and Check & Connect . The Needs -Based Budget supplies funding for most of the other programs in FCCYS. The services provided by FCCYS provide a wide range of options to meet the needs of the families we serve. One of the key challenges facing FCCYS is the increase in referrals and subsequent need for services. Our Intake Department is struggling to keep up with referrals to FCCYS . The critical initial assessment of needs at the intake level put an enormous amount of safety responsibility on the Intake Caseworkers and their supervisors. The timeliness, volume of referrals, and paperwork demands are significant. 38 While the caseload numbers within the Intake Unit are high, we have been able to sustain reasonable caseload numbers for our ongoing caseworkers and have seen improved results in our casework practice. Workers are performing well within recommended Best Practice Standards and continue to implement these recommendations in their daily case management. We have implemented internal checks and balances to assure that every worker is aware of and utilizing these standards. State and Federal mandates are addressed and made a part of casework practice. The agency continues to enhance the quality of casework practice and provide in- house trainings to the caseworkers on how to engage family members as resources for children. FCCYS continually looks at casework practices in an effort to refine and improve our services to children and their families. Our County has a very active Children's Roundtable and our Juvenile Court Judges and County Commissioners are actively involved with child welfare as well as juvenile delinquency matters. Our staff attend relevant trainings and participate in regional meetings (Quality Assurance meetings, regional supervisor meetings, IL meetings, PCYA conferences, etc.) . FCCYS staff are encouraged to \"think outside the box\" and are encouraged to bring new practices/ideas that may improve our work with children & families to the attention of management. Identify a minimum o f three specific service outcomes from the list bel ow that the county expects to achieve as a result of t he child wel fare servi ces funded through the Hum an Services B lock G rant with a primary focus on FY 2 016-17.

If servi ces or activities will decrease, explain why this decision was made and how it will affect child welfare and juvenile justice services in your county. Family Group Decision Making: Family Group Decision Making (FGDM) is a process in which family members, community members and others collaborate with the child welfare agency to create a plan for a child or youth. The family members define who comprises their family group. In FGDM, a trained coordinator, who is independent of the case, brings together the family group and agency personnel to create and carry out a plan to safeguard children and other family members. FGDM processes position the family group to lead decision making, and the statutory authorities agree to support family group plans that adequately address agency concerns. The statutory authorities also organize service providers from governmental and non- governmental agencies to access resources for implementing the plans. The key to successful FGDM practice is engaging the family group \u2014 those people with kinship and other connections to children, youth and their parents. This inc ludes those who may not be currently connected to children and youth \u2014 for example, paternal relatives who are often excluded or marginalized. FGDM affirms the culture of the family group, recognizes a family's spirituality, fully acknowledges the rights and abilities of the family group to make sound decisions for and with its young relatives and actively engages the community as a vital support for families. FGDM has the potential to energize hope, guide change and foster healing. Through FGDM, a broad support network is developed and strengthened, significantly benefiting children and their family groups. Government, local and tribal programs also benefit, learning from and relying on the family group and community as resources that strengthen and support families in ensuring that their children have a clear sense of 41 identity, lasting relationships, healthy supports and limits, and opportunities for learning and contributing. Check & Connect: The Check & Connect Program is an evidence based truancy int ervention/prevention progr am designed to enhance students' engagement at school and with learning. The Model was developed by the University of Minnesota to promote students' engagement with their school, reduce dropout and increase school prevention. The Program consists of the following four components: 1) A Mentor who keeps education salient for students, 2) systematic monitoring, 3) timely and individualized intervention and 4) enhancing home- school communication and home support for learning. The Mentor works with the students and partners with families for a minimum of two years. During this time, the Mentor is regularly checking on the educational progress of the student, intervening in a timely manner to reestablish and maintain the students ' connection to school and learning and enhancing the students' social and academic competencies. Key Features: The Check & Connect model uses a comprehensive approach to promoting students' engagement. Key features of the model are interrelated and include: o Relationship Building \u2014 mutual trust and open communication, nurtured through a long -term commitment focused on students' educational success. o Routine Monitoring of Alterable Indicators \u2014 systemically checking warning signs of withdrawal (attendance, academic performance, behavior) that are readily available to school personnel and that can be altered through intervention. o Individualized and Timely Intervention \u2014 support tailored to individual student needs, based on level of engagement with school, associated influences of home and school, and the leveraging of local resources. o Long -Term Commitment \u2014 committing to students and families for at least two years, including the ability to follow highly mobile youth from school to school and program to program. o Persistence Plus \u2014 a persistent source of academic motivation, a continuity of familiarity with the youth and family, and a consistency in the message that \"education is important for your future\". o Problem -Solving \u2014 designed to promote the acquis ition of skills to resolve conflict constructively and to look for solutions rather than a source of blame. 42 o Affiliation with School and Learning \u2014 facilitating students' access to and active participation in school -related activities and events. Assessment or data used to indicate the need for the program: The Franklin County Children and Youth Service and the Waynesboro Area School District would like to partner to make a significant impact on increasing Waynesboro Area Middle School student attendance for the 2016- 17 school year and beyond. We are asking for funds to extend our Check and Connect Program with PA Counseling Services to 6th grade. The rationale for implementing this program into sixth grade is to reach students prior to the middle school before negative attendance habits become routine. The WASD current sixth grade consists of 331 students, who are enrolled at four elementary schools in the WASD. These four schools are Summitview Elementary, Fairview Elementary, Mowrey Elementary, and Hooverville Elementary. The attendance rate for these 6th grade students for the 2015- 16 school year was 93.93%. In addition, thirty -one students (10% of 6th grade) missed three or more illegal or unlawful days. We believe with the added benefits of the Check and Connect program, we can make a positive impact on our district's attendance for future years and ultimately increase our graduation rate, which will produce contributing citizens to our community.

Were t here instances of under spendi ng or under- utilization of prior years' funds? Yes X No 44 DRUG a nd A LCOHOL SERVICES This section should describe the entire substance abuse service system available to all county residents that is provided through all funding sources, including state allocations, county funds, federal grants, HealthChoices, reinvestment funds, etc. The Franklin/Fulton Drug and Alcohol Program (FFDA) provides funding for all levels of care for substance abuse treatment. These levels include inpatient detoxification, rehabilitation, halfway house, partial hospitalization, intensive outpatient, outpatient, and early intervention out patient services for Franklin and Fulton county residents. FFDA also provides case management services and oversight of medication assisted treatment. This overview should include: 1. Waiting list issues; 2. Barriers to accessing treatment services; 3. Capacity i ssues; 4. County limits on services; 5. Impact of opioid epidemic in the county system 6. Any emerging substance use trends that will impact the ability of the county to provide substance use services. This overview should not include guidelines for the utilization of ACT 152 or BHSI funding streams issued by DHS. The focus should be a comprehensive overview of the services and supports provided by the Single County Authority and challenges in providing services. 1. Waiting list issues Treatment services are provided to any eligible resident despite age, gender, race, and ethnicity. However, we serve individuals by our priority populations. These priority populations are identified in the following order: Pregnant Injection Drug Users, Pregnant Substance Abusers, Injection Drug Users, Overdose Survivors, Veterans and all others. Individuals in need of substance use assessments are to receive an assessment appointment within 7 days of the request. In Franklin/Fulton County, individuals are able to be seen within 7 days of the request; however when detoxification or inpatient treatment is needed, there are multiple variations of wait times across the state due to state- wide treatment capacity issues. 2. Barriers to accessing treatment services: An estimated 2,194 Franklin County residents will receive substance use assessments in FY 2016- 2017. Level of care assessments are completed by contracted outpatient providers or FFDA Case Management staff. An estimated 276 adults/adolescents are projected to be funded for treatmen t services through the drug and alcohol program in Fiscal Year 2016- 2017. Treatment services are inclusive of detoxification, short and long-term inpatient, halfway house, partial hospitalization, intensive outpatient and outpatient services. The primary barrier to accessing treatment services revolves around the need for detoxification and long -term inpatient treatment beds when the placement is needed. Current wait times to secure placement in these two levels of 45 care produces barriers to getting individuals engaged in treatment when it's needed and when they're ready. This occurs state- wide with the inadequate numbers of detox and inpatient beds available. 3. Capacity issues: Franklin County continues to meet the need of completing level of care assessments adequately and timely (within 7 days of the request); however, placement of individuals into specific levels of care remains challenging due to the lack of beds across the Commonwealth. Wait times for non- hospital based detoxification average between 2- 5 days from the placement request. Wait times for non- hospital based long -term inpatient treatment averages three to four weeks minimum. The increased need for long -term treatment, yet the lack of long -term treatment bed expansion, makes it difficult to obtain the clinically appropriate level of care treatment for individuals who need long -term inpatient treatment. This creates a host of problems locally: longer jail days for individuals waiting to go to inpatient treatment (additional per day costs to house offenders); higher risk for individuals in the community waiting to go to treatment; inability to place overdose survivors being discharged from the local emergency rooms; and potentially undertreating individuals in a lower level of care to get them into treatment while they wait for a bed to open. Franklin County needs to implement service delivery for individuals qualifying for the .05 level of care deemed \"early intervention,\" yet current outpatient providers do not provide this level of care due to it not being reimbursable. This level of care typically comes from DUI assessments and adolescent assessments and is a current gap in our community. Outpatient providers will be approached/ contracted to provide this level of care by utilizing the same/ uniform evidence- based curriculum for adolescents and adults in need of the service. 4. County limits on services: Franklin County does not have halfway house options within either county for individuals to access when being discharged from short or long -term inpatient treatment. Franklin/Fulton Drug & Alcohol contracts with multiple providers across the state who offers halfway house level of care; however, none are within either Franklin or Fulton Counties. Franklin County does not have a provider for long -term inpatient treatment with either county. Franklin County is experiencing a greater need for long \u00ad term treatment beds , yet has to wait three to four weeks for bed placement availability. 5. Impact of opioid epidemic in the county system : Franklin County is experiencing a high rate of opioid related overdoses, overdose fatalities, crimes related to opioid dependence and DUIs. This has significantly impacted the Franklin County court system, Adult Probation, local emergency rooms, employers, families , and of course, the Single County Authority. Franklin County is also preparing for the implementation of the prescription monitoring program in August of 2016 and anticipated increase in heroin- related events. This has prompted Franklin County to develop and implement an Overdose Prevention Task Force; put in place additional resources and processes for the court system and jail; and equip the comm unity with naloxone training, medication and educating clinicians on proper 46 prescribing practices. 6. Any emerging substance use trends that will impact the ability of the county to provide substance use services: The implementation of the Commonwealth's Prescription Monitoring Program will commence in August 2016. The implementation of this program may create higher demand for treatment services within Franklin/Fulton County. With the reduction of access to prescription opioids, it's anticipated for counties to see a rise in heroin use, heroin related overdoses and heroin related overdose fatalities. With the current treatment capacity issues across the Commonwealth, it's anticipated that detox and inpatient beds will quickly fill up and remain consistently utilized. Target Populations Provide an overview of the specific services provided and any service gaps/unmet needs for the following populations: Older Adults (ages 60 and above) If indicated, older adults are eligible for all levels of care for substance use treatment. These levels include detoxification, short and long term rehabilitation, halfway house, partial hospitalization, intensive outpatient, outpatient, and early intervention outpatient services for Franklin and Fulton county residents. FFDA also provides case management services and oversight of medication assisted treatment. Older adults covered by Medicare qualify for county funding due to the lack of Medicare providers within a 50 mile radius of Franklin and Fulton Counties. Adults (ages 18 and above) If indicated, adults ages 18 to 55 are eligible for all levels of care for substance use treatment. These levels include detoxification, short and long terms rehabilitation, halfway house, partial hospitalization, intensive outpatient, outpatient, and early intervention outpatient services for Franklin and Fulton county residents. FFDA also provides cas e management services and oversight of medication assisted treatment. It is anticipated that many of our priority populations, including Pregnant Injection Dr ug Users, Pregnant Substance Users, Overdose Survivors and Veterans will fall into this age demographic. Transition Age Youth (ages 18 to 26) If indicated, transition- age youth are eligible for all levels of care for substance use treatment. These levels include detoxification, short and long term rehabilitation, halfway house, partial hospitalizati on, intensive outpatient, outpatient, and early intervention outpatient services for Franklin and Fulton county residents. FFDA also provides case management services and oversight of medication assisted treatment. It is anticipated that some of our priority populations, including Pr egnant Injection Drug Users, Pregnant Substance U sers and Overdose Survivors will fall into this age demographic. Adolescents (under 18) 47 If indicated, adolescents are eligible for all levels of care for substance use treatmen t. These levels include detoxification, short and long term rehabilitation, halfway house, partial hospitalization, intensive outpatient, outpatient, and early intervention outpatient services for Franklin and Fulton county residents. FFDA also provides case management services and oversight of medication assisted treatment. Additionally, FFDA also contracts with providers of prevention and intervention programs focusing on the adolescent population. Individuals with Co- Occurring Psychiatric and Substance Use Disorders In conjunction with Franklin/Fulton Mental Health and Tuscarora Managed Care Alliance, the Franklin/Fulton Drug and Alcohol Program has implemented a co- occurring initiative in both counties. This initiative uses the Comprehensive Continuous Integrated Systems of Care Model. All local providers participate in this initiative for co- occurring competency. There are facilities that offer specialized treatment programming for individuals with co- occurring conditions for providers outside of the two counties. To evaluate the Comprehensive Continuous Integrated Systems of Care Model (CCISC), we track the number of in- county facilities that offer specialized treatment programming for individuals with co- occurring conditions. Criminal Justice -Involv ed Individuals If indicated, criminal justice -involved individuals are eligible for all levels of care for substance use treatment. These levels include detoxification, short and long term rehabilitation, halfway house, partial hospitalization, intensive outpatient, outpatient, and early intervention outpatient services for Franklin and Fulton county residents. FFDA also provides case management services and oversight of medication assisted treatment. All contracted treatment providers have specialized programming for this population. In addition, Franklin County is involved in the Restrictive Intermediate Punishment Program that coordinates treatment needs for this population. Franklin/Fulton Drug & Alcohol, in partnership with Tuscarora Managed Care Alliance (TMCA) and PerformCare (BHMCO), participates in the Department of Drug & Alcohol Programs (DDAP) Jail Project. This specific initiative is designed to assist incarcerated individuals needing Inpatient substance use treatment to obtain medical assistance when eligible, and for the medical assistance to be activated within one week of discharge from the jail/admission to the treatment facility. If medical assistance is denied, county funding is utilized to pay for the treatment services needed. This partnership will continue into FY16/17. Franklin County has submitted the FY16/17 application to PCCD to implement the Residential Substance Abuse Treatment grant to individuals at the Franklin County Jail. This program requires participation in utilizing Vivitrol as medicated assisted treatment to run parallel to providing substance use treatment prior to release. 48 Franklin County will also be moving forward with planning and technical assistance to begin an Adult Drug Court in FY16/17. Franklin/Fulton Dr ug & Alcohol will assist with planning and development in coordination with the Courts. Veterans If indicated, veterans are eligible for all levels of care for substance use treatment. Thes e levels include detoxification, short and long term rehabilitati on, halfway house, partial hospitalization, intensive outpatient, outpatient, and early intervention outpatient services for Franklin and Fulton county residents. FFDA also provides case management services and oversight of medication assisted treatment. The County provides drug and alcohol treatment funding to a small number of veterans due to the majority of this population having insurance to cover their costs. Women with Children If indicated, women with children in need of substance use services are eligible for all levels of care for treatment. These levels include detoxification, short and long term rehabilitation, halfway house, partial hospitalization, intensive outpatient, outpatient, and early intervention outpatient services for Franklin and Fulton county residents. FFDA also provides case management services and oversight of medication assisted treatment. The county contracts with multiple providers with women with children specific services. There will be a targeted focus placed on mothers of chemically dependent newborns entering the NICU due to their chemical dependency at birth. Services will focus on treatment as well as in- home support for non- treatment, ancillary services. Recovery -Oriented Services Franklin/Fulton Drug & Alcohol partnered with Tuscarora Managed Care Alliance to allocate reinvestment funds to support Recovery Housing and Recovery Support Specialists in both counties, starting in FY15/16 and continuing through FY16/17. Development, planning and implementation of both plans will result in county residents being able to access services to help sustain long -term recovery in their local environment. Recovery Support Specialists will be housed in local outpatient provider settings and will assist individuals from short or long -term rehabilitation to transition to a lower level of care (halfway, partial hospitalization, intensive outpatient and traditional outpatient services). These positions will also assist individuals to engage in recovery supports and long -term recovery. Recovery Housing will assist individuals to engage in housing services during their recovery. Currently neither Franklin nor Fulton Counties have available recovery housing services. If there is additional Block Grant carry over from the 15- 16 fiscal year, it will be allocated to recovery support services. 49 HUMA N SE RVICES AND SUPPO RTS/ HUM AN SERVICES DEVEL OPMEN T FUND For each of these cat egories (Adult Services, Agi ng Services, Children and Youth Servi ces, Gene ric Servi ces and Spec ialized Services) , please use the be low format to desc ribe how the county intends to utilize HSDF fu nds: The progr am name.

This year, it will be on October 11 & 12, 2016. It is held at the Rhodes Grove Conference Center. We anticipate approximately 175 - 200 professionals to attend each day. It is free to those who are a part of the human services community. Funding is used to cover the expenses associated with the facility's fees and trainers . Our Training Day format will have 6 differ ent sessions/ presentation s happening at one time and they are between 1 \u00bc or 1 \u00bd hours in length. A total of 18 sessions along with a keynote occurs over the course of one day. Individuals are given the opportunity to register for the specific classes that they feel will benefit the most from. From this, we can expect approximately 20- 40 participants for each session, unless there is a request for a limit due to the nature of the presentation. These sessions will cover areas of topics that relate to Veterans/Military, the Aging Community, Mental Health, Early Intervention, Intellectual Disabilities, Services to Children, as well as ways to take care of ourselves as the professional. The participants who attend are from a wide array of human services agencies and programs and range from case managers, to support staff, to directors and administrators. Our goal is to provide them with quality professional training that will enhance their skills and increase their professional development. It provides an avenue for those who work in the human services profession to also be more aware of current trends in our profession. From the information they receive, agencies and staff can use the new tools as a way to take their existing and new programs and strengthen the delivery of the service. The coordinator also organizes the Introduction to Human Services training that is available two times a year to new employees within the County government as well as agencies within the community. 51 Appendix A 201 7 E Franklin County Pa assures that services will be and delivered in accordance with the Human Pl'an sutJmltted herewllh, The County assures, in witli Act that the County Human Services Plan submitted herewith has been based upon lhe County officials' determinalion of formulated aft,er an opportunity for public comment In the County.

Franklin County Older Adults Partnership between Aging and Mental Health Continue to do WRAP (Wellness Recovery Action Plan) The Community Support Program continues to host the Leadership Academy. Had 12 graduates from the Academy Every secondary school has school based mental health outpatient and Student Assistant Program (SAP). Seeing a need for bilingual professionals . Homeless Assistance Program: For the Homeless Assistance Program, we get about $100,000 a year for everything. Children and Youth Services Started with two programs and will be eliminating one and looking at another possibility. The one being eliminated was the Family Based Strength Workers. The new one they are looking at is with HCP (Healthy Communities Partnership). Doug is unsure of the e xact costs. If two conferences are needed, there may not be funding left over. For FY 15/16 there was funding for a new program, Check and Connect, and it is being provided to Waynesboro School District. It is a truancy program and C&Y is looking at putt ing the same program into the Chambersburg School District. Drug & Alcohol application changes Barriers for Franklin and Fulton County treatment services. Access to certain levels of care and the time frames to get into those levels of care are a barrier. Two primary levels of care are detox and long term inpatient Franklin County assessments are indicating an increased need for long -term inpatient treatment. Strategies to address the opioid epidemic are new for FY16 -17. Early Intervention Level of Care DDAP added this level of care (0.5) this fiscal year, but it does not have a parallel DSM -V diagnosis for treatment. Proposal to select an evidence -based program to implement for this level of care at each of the Outpatient Treatment provider sites. Funding Proposal o Continue funding the entire Continuum of Care for substance use (Prevention, Intervention, Treatment and Recovery) o Too Good for Drugs 54 o Teen Intervene o Girls Circle o Interrupted o Operation Save a Life trainings Prescription Medication Campaign o The name of the project is BeRXsmart o The initial phase is about proper medication management and proper medication disposal. o As we go into Phase II we will look at the results of this campaign in order to develop the messaging of Phase II. Treatment fundin g will include detox, inpatient, and Vivitrol injections. Recovery funding will be allocated to a recovery vendor (The RASE Project). The HSDF basically funds two things. Training Days and \"211\". No questions were asked. IV. State Budget/Program Updates - Rick et.al The latest rumors about the State Budget are that they are going to pass the budget on time. Mostly because this is election year and they will be running for office soon. The down side of this is that there will not be an increase for the Bloc k Grant. V. Fiscal Update - Stacy R. (Handout) The most up to date numbers were active through March. With the projections, Stacy expressed they are estimating around $82,000 to carry over into FY 16/17. Only state funds are eligible for carryover. Eligible to retain up to 3% of state funding, annually. The cap is $167,000. The county contributes 2.72% on all state funded expenditures. Rick is asking the Committee's approval, for at least $80,000 or more contingent on the total amount of carryover, for the Data Warehouse, out of the carryover. Approval of the Data Warehouse money: o Sheldon motioned to approve o Kim seconded the motion o All approved Rick thanked everybody for the e- mail votes on 15 -16 budget changes. The money is for a generator for the SCR (Specialized Community Residents) through Keystone Human Services. VI. Public Comments Anne Larew asked if the Committee is \"term limited\" on the Block Grant Committee. Rick expressed that he can expand and contract the committee as long as he asks the Commissioners for permission. Anne expressed, as an option, to invite people they know to come and sit through a Block Grant meeting to see if this is something they may be interested in. o Kim suggested a student o Rick suggested someone that has knowledge of the drug and alcohol system from a consumer end. o Manny suggested someone from Head Start. 55 VI. Next Block Grant Committee Meeting October 25, 2016, 3:00 pm - 5:00 pm Human Services Building 425 Franklin Farm Lane Chambersburg, PA 17202 56 THURSDAY, JUNE 2, 2016 The Franklin County Commissioners met Thursday, June 2, 2016, with the following members present: David S. Keller, Robert L. Thomas and Robert G. Ziobrowski. Chairman Keller presided and after calling the meeting to order, a Moment of Silence, and the Pledge of Allegiance, proceeded with the business of the day. Chairman Keller asked for approval of the agenda with the addition of one board action which is a Memorandum of Understanding with York County to detain female inmates at a cost of $67 per day. On a motion by Robert L. Thomas, seconded by Robert G. Ziobrowski; unanimously approved to adopt the amended agenda. There was no public comment. On a motion by Robert L. Thomas, seconded by Robert G. Ziobrowski; unanimously approved all bills presented and ordered paid. On a motion by Robert L. Thomas, seconded by Robert G. Ziobrowski; unanimously approved the minutes of the May 24, 2016 and May 26, 2016 meetings. Warden Bill Bechtold was present to explain the agreement with York County to house Franklin County female inmates. The Warden explained that our population continues to increase at the jail, in particular with the female population which has exploded, and the jail is over capacity to house the female inmates. York County is one of the few jails who are still accepting female inmates. They were the only ones with beds available and it will cost us $67.00 per day. He said they would be moving fifteen female inmates to York County as soon as possible. Commissioner Thomas said the numbers have increased across the nation in the female population and the number one reason is opiate drugs. He said we have to change the program but he's not sure what to do. He said it was reported during Prison Board the increase in the population and it relates to drugs and it's a scourge on our society. But if we let them out prematurely they overdose which was the case with an individual last week. Chairman Keller said it is puzzling as to why more women are having issues with opiates but we have been doing a lot to try to address the issues. He said within the last several weeks we have established a Recovery Support Specialist in the Drug & Alcohol Office to help people become more successful with various stages of treatment. We also applied for a grant to provide Medication Assisted Treatment and recovery while people with drug and alcohol issues are in jail. There is an Overdose Task Force that is now in place and we established a position last week for a mobile Case Manager position in Drug & Alcohol so that assessments can be done as timely as possible to help folks with opiate addictions and determine treatment that is needed. Chairman Keller felt it was important to mention a few things the County is doing. Commissioner Thomas said one challenge we have not solved yet is the shortage of available beds for detox and in-patient treatment. Commissioner Ziobrowski asked the Warden a few questions about the percentages of increases and pointed out that we still have far more male than female inmates at the Jail. Richard Wynn, Human Services Administrator, said there is a lot going on and everyone is doing everything to try stop the recent tsunami of opiate abuse. The Board reviewed Aging Office matters. On a motion by Robert L. Thomas, seconded by Robert G. Ziobrowski; unanimously approved the contract listing for all contracts and addendums for Fiscal Year 2015-16 for the Area Agency on Aging Department.

This also records a corresponding increase in the county share amount; a 10% match is required on all services. The Board reviewed Human Services Administration matters. On a motion by Robert L. Thomas, seconded by Robert G. Ziobrowski; unanimously approved the contract listing for all contracts and addendums for Fiscal Year 2015-16 for the Human Services Administration Department.

Richard Wynn, Human Services Administrator, and Shalom Black, Grants Manager, and a few members from the committee conducted a public hearing last week on the Human Services Block Grant for 2016/2017. Mr. Wynn thanked the work that staff and the committee has done in pulling this together. He said the State did not get the state guidelines to them till a few weeks ago. He said this is the fifth year of the Block Grant and we have never been given an increase. Mr. Wynn provided a summary of the re-investment funds which total $416, 718. He said this is the first year that we can move 100% of money from one area to another in the fund types. Ms. Black explained the planning process and that they held the first public hearing on May 26, 2016 where there were no comments but the committee did make changes due to concerns that the needs of homeless families with children are not being met. She reported that Chambersburg School District identified 106 children that are homeless. A second draft based on public and committee feedback will be sent to the Board for signatures and submitted to the State no later than July 81h. Mr. Wynn mentioned the highlights of reprogrammed MH/ID funding which include: Mental Health First Aid Training; Crisis Intervention Teams; Trauma-informed Care plan in Criminal Justice System; lowered MH re-admission rates; formed Franklin County Older Adult/MH team; Wellness Recovery Action Plan; Transition to Adult Life Success; Community Employment in ID; Increased# of life-sharing homes; and expanded Independent Living program apartments. Mr. Wynn said that more detail is on the County's website and if there are any additional changes, they will be put that on the website as well. Chairman Keller thanked the work of the committee and staff involved. He invited anyone in the audience for public comment and none was received. Mr. Wynn said that the only people that can vote are consumers or providers on the committee. He said these are people who are invested in the system. He said that the County needs a data warehouse to give some good statistics for future decision making. Chairman Keller asked Mr. Wynn to provide more detail on a data warehouse. Mr. Wynn said that our programs send a lot of information to the State and we can't get a report from them, and we have nothing that cross references the information. The first phase is to have planning information since we have a ton of information already. Right now if he wants information, staff has to go through all information by hand. Chairman Keller said the computer systems that we are required to use don't lend themselves for us to generate reports to aid decision making at the local level. He said the goal is to have an integrated information system to pull data from systems we are mandated to use by the state to avoid duplicate data entry and to create reports based on that data that led to better accountability and better outcomes and which lead to the overall improvement to the human services system. Mr. Wynn explained that we would need people responsible for keeping the system going and troubleshooting it. The hope is to partner with Managed Care to do this and implement it. Chairman Keller said that he has a lot of confidence in the committee and the work they are doing, and he supports the recommendations presented today. He added that It's great we can reinvest the dollars. Commissioner Thomas said we can thank Governor Corbett for creating the Human Services Block Grant but it hasn't been expanded and there are a lot of other counties who would like to do this but can't. Continued on page 4 The meeting was adjourned at 10:31 a.m. with a motion by Robert L. Thomas; seconded by Robert G. Ziobrowski.
