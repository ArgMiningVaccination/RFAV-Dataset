METHODOLOGY: Data came from the Vaccine Safety Datalink, which gathers information from eight health systems in the United States. Analyzed data from 135,005 doses given to children age 4 and younger who received the Pfizer-BioNTech [mRNA vaccine](https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/2500132-overview), and 112,006 doses given to children aged 5 and younger who received the [Moderna version](https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/2500139-overview#:~:text=Children%20and%20Adolescents,vaccines%20in%20the%20United%20States.). Assessed for 23 safety outcomes, including [myocarditis](https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/156330-overview), [pericarditis](https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/156951-overview), and seizures. TAKEAWAY: None of the adverse outcomes, including myocarditis or pericarditis, was detected among the children in the 21 days following receipt of either vaccine. One case of [hemorrhagic stroke](https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1916662-overview)and one case of [pulmonary embolism](https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/300901-overview)occurred after vaccination but these were linked to preexisting congenital abnormalities. IN PRACTICE: \"These results can provide reassurance to clinicians, parents, and policymakers alike.\" STUDY DETAILS: The study was led by Kristin Goddard, MPH, a researcher at the Kaiser Permanente Vaccine Study Center in Oakland, California, and was funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. LIMITATIONS: The researchers reported low statistical power for early analysis, especially for rare outcomes. In addition, fewer than 25% of children in the database had received a vaccine at the time of analysis. DISCLOSURES: Donahue reports receiving funding from Janssen Vaccines and Prevention for a study unrelated to COVID-19 vaccines. Klein reports receiving grants from Pfizer in 2019 for clinical trials for coronavirus vaccines, and from Merck, GSK, and Sanofi Pasteur for unrelated research.
