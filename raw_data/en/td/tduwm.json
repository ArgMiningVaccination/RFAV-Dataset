A total of 444,471 female residents who voluntarily - [Effects of combining immune checkpoint inhibitors and anti-angiogenic agents on bone metastasis in non-small cell lung cancer patients](/paperRedirect/1686523082875621376) [Hum. Vaccines Immunother.](/paper/journal/3631)(IF Pub Date : 2023-08-01 Xiaohong Maolin Zhou, Liqiang Wang, Fei Wang, Haiyi Deng, Yiling Yang, Ni Sun, Ru Li, Ying Chen, Xinqing Lin, Ming Liu, Chengzhi Zhou ABSTRACT This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of combining immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and anti-angiogenic agents in treating lung cancer patients with bone metastases (BMs), as it is unclear whether this combination is effective for this condition. Non-small cell lung cancer patients with BMs receiving ICIs were divided into experimental and control groups based on anti-angiogenic treatment - [Sociodemographic and psychosocial factors associated with vaccine hesitancy - results from a longitudinal study in Singapore](/paperRedirect/1683878056491204608) [Hum. Vaccines Immunother.](/paper/journal/3631)(IF Ni, Siow Ann Chong ABSTRACT Singapore has one of the highest COVID-19 vaccination rates, however identifying vaccine-hesitant sub-groups and their concerns is vital given the need for future boosters in vulnerable populations. Furthermore, vaccine hesitancy remains a concern in the event of an emergence of a newer strain that necessitates the rolling out of a new vaccination programme. The aims of this study were to - [HV&I Reviewer Highlight](/paperRedirect/1684973224403263488) [Hum.

Vaccines Immunother.](/paper/journal/3631)(IF 4.8) Pub Date : 2023-07-24 Jingxuan Zhang, Jia Li, Lin Lin ABSTRACT Immunoprofiling has become a crucial tool for understanding the complex interactions between the immune system and diseases or interventions, such as therapies and vaccinations. Immune response biomarkers are critical for understanding those relationships and potentially developing personalized intervention strategies. Single-cell data have emerged as a promising source for identifying immune - [High hepatitis B vaccination coverage among a cohort of predominantly men who have sex with men in Germany](/paperRedirect/1684357942662119424) [Hum. Vaccines Immunother.](/paper/journal/3631)(IF 4.8) Pub Date : 2023-07-25 Allahna L. Esber, Hendrik Streeck, Klaus Jansen, Julie Dorsey-Spitz, Merlin L. Robb, Trevor A. Crowell, for the BRAHMS Study Team ABSTRACT Incidence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection has declined dramatically since the introduction of the HBV vaccine, but gaps remain in coverage. We characterized factors associated with vaccination among individuals with sexual risk of HBV infection. The BRAHMS observational cohort enrolled men and transgender women, without HIV, aged 18-55 years, with behavioral vulnerability to sexually - [\"In general people aren't excited about the vaccine...\": Frontline perspectives on COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy across Syria](/paperRedirect/1683878060345769984) [Hum. Vaccines Immunother.](/paper/journal/3631)(IF Yazan Douedari, Natasha Howard ABSTRACT COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy is a new phenomenon in Syria, about which relatively little is known. We aimed to explore this, drawing from 37 semi-structured interviews with frontline health-workers and service-users across Syria's major military areas-of-control. We found COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy was common and increasing among service-users and less common, but still present, among health-workers - [Homologous or heterologous immunization regimens against inactivated COVID-19 vaccine: Viroj Wiwanitkit Published in Human Vaccines & Immunotherapeutics (Vol. 19, No. 2, 2023) - [Polio vaccination activities in conflict-affected areas](/paperRedirect/1683878058416390144) [Hum.

Within the context of immunization service delivery, conflict-affected geographies are often dogged by recurrent disease outbreaks due to the inability to administer life-saving vaccines to children residing in these areas. Essential immunization coverage is often poor in conflict-affected geographies, and within - [Comment on bibliometric and visual analysis of vaccination hesitancy research](/paperRedirect/1683878057598500864) [Hum.
