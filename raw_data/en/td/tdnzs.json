Autopsy data of recent sudden deaths in young individuals indicated at least one cardiac abnormality. C AD is the most prevalent attributable cause to it , in which dyslipidaemias is a major risk factor, often underdiagnosed. This clearly demands incorporation of predictors of CAD risk such as Atherogenic Index of Plasma, in routine OP level to screen patients with lifestyle disorders susceptible for CVD at the earliest. METHODOLOGY: Study aimed to determine change in AIP values in subjects having borderline high lipid values. In an open label single arm pre and post clinical study design, 30 patients having borderline high lipid values according to NCEP ATP III guidelines, with proper exclusion and with informed consent were recruited. Medicines administered were Gandharvahasthadi Ka haya (herbal decocti on containing Ricinus communis etc) and Astachurna (herbal powder containing 8 ingredients) for 5 days followed by Vidangatanduladi Churna (herbal powder containing Embelia ribes etc) for 30 days. Assessment was done one 0th day and 36th day. After completion of treatment, results were statistically analyzed . AYURVEDA PROTOCOL FOR LOWERING ATHEROGENIC INDEX OF PLASMA - A CLINICAL TRIAL ISSN 2063 -5346 Section A ), 3929-3941 RESULT: Combination of polyherbal formulations used in the study is potent in reducing AIP values. There was a reduction in mean values of AIP from 0.1291(BT) to 0.0463(AT) with an improvement percentage of 64.05 . DISCUSSION: AIP is ratio of molar concentrations of TGL to HDL -C, where each concentration is expressed in mmol/L . Strong correlation of AIP with lipoprotein particle size explains its high predict ion. Dyslipidemias in Ayurveda can be understood as an error in Ahara -parinama (digestion, absorption, assimilation of food) . Jatharagni -mandya digestion strength) leads to improper Sara -Kitta Vibhajana (by-products of digestion) leading to accumulation of Malarupi -kapha (improper by-product) in body which is perceived as excess circulating lipids. When this malarupi -kapha localizes in rasavaha srothas (channel for nutrition) or raktavaha srotas (channels supporting circulation of blood) already having khavaigunya (weak or defective) , can result in cardiovascular pathologies . Arresting the progress of this vitiated Kapha Dosa (body humor which controls body fluids and maintains the structural cohesion of the organism ) from stages of Sancaya (stage of accumulation) , Prakopa (stage of aggravation) or Prasara (stage of liquefaction and spreading of doshas) to a fully manifested disease is the main aim of treatment. Samprapti -Vighatana (intervening pathology) in this condition is achieved by correction of deranged Agni (digestive fire) by -Chik itsa(treatment corresponding with the help of Vidangatanthuladi -Churna. CONCLUSION: As a marker of lipoprotein particle size, it adds predictive value beyond that of the individual lipids, helps to screen and have an early warning of cardiovascular diseases and prevent it . Keywords : Dyslipidemias , Ayurveda, Cardiovascular disease, risk factor, youth INTRODUCTION Cardiovascular disease - a global health concern is the cause of one -third of death worldwide . In the past decade, the mortality rate of youngsters of the age group 18 to 35 years has increased drasticall y. Autopsy data of recent sudden deaths in young individuals indicated at least one cardiac abnormality . And the basic need to deal this problem is the primary prevention of risk factors like dyslipidaemias , obesity, hypertension etc. Atherogenic index of plasma is an important marker to predict the risk of atherosclerosis and coronary artery diseases and is better than individual lipid concentrations1. It reflects the true relat ion AYURVEDA PROTOCOL FOR LOWERING ATHEROGENIC INDEX OF PLASMA - A CLINICAL TRIAL ISSN 2063 -5346 Section A -Research ), 3929-3941 between atherogenic and protective lipoprotein and is calculated according to the formula log 10[TG/HDL -C] wh ich is more closely related to cardiovascular risk than individual lipoprotein cholesterol fractions or other atherogenic indices3. However, utilizing AIP to determine subclinical coronary arte ry disease (CAD) beyond traditional risk factors are limited in clinical practice2. AIP values under 0.11 is associated with lower risk of CAD, the values between 0.11 to 0.21 with intermediate risk and values above 0.21 is associated with increased risks3. Based on the pathophysiology of the condition, an Ayurveda protocol was selected which included polyherbal formulation namely, Gandharvahasthadi during subsequent phase.

Bull. 2023,12(5 ), 3929-3941 EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN In the single group pre and post clinical study design, 30 patients having borderline high lipid values according to NCEP ATP III guidelines8, excluding the patients undergoing treatment for high level lipid profile, pregnant, lactating, with uncontrolled diabetes, known case of coronary artery diseases, cerebrovascular accidents, any type of malignancy, renal and hepatic disorders, hypothyroid ism and patients on prolonged medication with corticosteroids or antidepressants and with informed consent were recruited. Assessment was done on 0th day of study. Initially pachana -dipana (digestive and carminative function) was done with Astachurna for 5 days. 48ml (1pala) of Gandharvahasthadi Kahaya was given two times daily before food for 5 days with a pinch of rocksalt9 and jaggery10. 6 g rams of Astachurna was given twice daily with first bolus of food wi th ghee. After 5 days and assessing nirama lakshanas (symptoms pertaining to digested and metabolized components in the body) , 6 gms of Vidangatanduladi Churna was given from 6th to 35th day twice daily after food with honey. Assessment was done with 9 -12 hours of fasting lipid profile [NCEP ATP 111 guidelines] on 0th day and 36th day. RESULTS After completion of treatment, the results were statistically analyzed using paired t test and final conclusions were drawn. There was a reduction in mean values of AIP from 0.1291(B efore Treatment ) to 0.0463(A fter Treatment ) with an improvement percentage of 64.05.

The disease is usually detected in routine blood investigations or during the management of other illness12. Dyslipidemias can be taken as a stage of Agni derangement and if not taken into cons ideration, on a long run led to many major disorders like hridroga (diseases of heart), medoroga (diseases of adipose tissues), prameha (diabetes) etc. 0 0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08 0.1 0.12 0.14 Mean BT Mean AT AIP AYURVEDA PROTOCOL FOR LOWERING ATHEROGENIC INDEX OF PLASMA - A CLINICAL TRIAL ISSN 2063 -5346 Section A -Research paper 3935 2023,12(5 ), 3929-3941 The food once ingested is acted upon by Agni13 to produce sara bhaga or ahara rasa (nutritious part) kitta bhaga or mala (waste products) in dhatu parinama (formation of tissues). The sara portion of ahara rasa is converted into poshaka rasa or asthayi rasa (transforming component of digestion) by the influence of jataragni14 (digest ive fire). Rasa dhatwagni15 (enzymes building nutrients and essence) acts on poshaka rasa forming poshya or sthayi (transforming component of circulation). Upadhatu (metabolic by -product s) are formed here as by - products16. Kapha is formed during first avasthapaka (transient stage of digestion) and as mala (waste product) of rasa (essence) as part of rasa dhatu parinama17 (transformation to essence and nutrients). If there is a mandyam of jataragni (low digestive fire), then there will be improper sara-kitta vibhajana (by-products of digestion) which leads to the formation of malarupi kapha. If this circulating malarupi kapha gets sthanasamsraya (localization as part of pathogenesis) in rasavaha srotas (channel for nutrition) with pre -existing khavaigunya (defective or weak channels), it will cause conditions like hrudroga . Considering samprapti (pathogenesis), this metabolic error can be perceived to a state prior to sthanasamsraya whic h can be sanchaya (stage of accumulation) or prakopa (stage of aggravation) or prasara (stage of liquefaction and spreading of vitiated body humors)18. and Vihara (activities) etc lead to the kapha vrudhi (profuse increase in the body humor which controls body fluids and maintains the structural cohesion of the organism ) in amasaya (site where undigested food is present at the time of digestion). This excess kapha derange the quality of pachaka pitta (component of pachakagni (digestive fire) which has tyakta dravatwa swabhava (devoid of liquid portion), d ue to the prabhava (extraordinary function) of excess kapha (attribute) loses its prakruta avastha (normal constituency) and become vaikruta (abnormal) which also causes dimunition of agni (digestive fire). Thus, agni vasiahamya (decrease in digestive cap acity) leads to ama20(undigested or partly digested intermediate product). Continuous nidana sevana (aetiological factors) and production of ama gradually lead to improper dhatu parinama (transformation) . Dhatwagni mandya (defective tissue building excessive malarupi kapha. The prasara of malarupi kapha can be interpreted as the initial stage of dyslipidemia.

Bull. 2023,12(5 ), 3929-3941 is diagnosed in this stage for susceptibility of CAD, then a preventive me asure could be adopted before leading to sthanasamsraya in hrudaya if khavaigunya is present. When this condition continues for a long time, it can lead to srotorodham (obstruction to channels) causing diseases like stroke, angina etc. The main objectives of management in this condition are correction of Agni and doshapratyanika chikitsa (treatment aiming respective body humors). Samprati vighatana (intervening pathology) was carried out by Amahara na (treating indigested and improperly formed products in digestion) by Pacana - D\u00edpana as the first line of management. Gandharvahastdi Ka ya and Astacr a were given for Pcana - D\u00edpana6. Gandharvahastdi Ka ya is matters) and vata kapha samana22. Thus, Agnimandya is corrected and proper Sara Kitta Vibhajana is facilitated which prevents the formation of Malarupi Kapha in the body. After cor rection of deranged Agni by Pcana - Dpana , the second objective of management is the allievation of Kapha Do a by Doapratyanka Chikitsa . It is attained by the administration of Viagatahuldi Cr a having Pcana, Dpana, Lekhana (pharmacological effect leading to drying and removal of adhered morbid matters) , Chedana (pharmacological effect leading to morbid matters) and Kapha hara Karma23(treatment modalities aiming pacification of bodily humor kapha). Major ingredients are Tikta, Ka u and Kaya Rasas, Laghu, Rk a (dry) , Tk a, U ha (hot) and Sara (mobile)Gu as, U ha Vrya and Kau and Chedana. Sukha Virecana (mild purgative) property of the drug eliminated the accumulated Mals (waste products) from the Koh (digestive tract) smoothly. Thus, it improves the quality of Pcakapitta (digestive component of bodily h umor pitta) by acting at Pitta Sthna (abode of bodily humor pitta). Emoidin an active compound can act on mysenteric plexus causing irritation and promotes motility of in enterohepatic circulation of bile acids making it unavailable for intestinal AYURVEDA PROTOCOL FOR LOWERING ATHEROGENIC INDEX OF PLASMA - A CLINICAL TRIAL ISSN 2063 -5346 Section A -Research paper 3937 Eur. 2023,12(5 ), 3929-3941 absorption and increases its excretion. It helps to excrete large amount of bile which indirectly helps in cholesterol25. Kaya Rasa taste) and Pcana - Dpana Karma acts as Kledopao aa due to its Pachana -Dipana, anulomana and (pacification of bodily humors li ke kapha and pitta) property corrects the metabolic error due to impaired agni and eliminates kapha and pitta after proper paka of malas26 (proper formation of waste products). Hartaki increases gastric emptying rate which reduces the absorption of dietary cholesterol27. Chebulinic acid in Hartaki interacts with microbes in gut and converts them to anti -oxidant Urolithin. Thus, it prevents oxidative damage and further complications of Dyslipidemia28. Preventing the formation of endogenous cholesterol by inhibiting pathways of its metabolism and increasing excretion of cholesterol from the body are the two main mechanisms involved in correction of lipid parameters. The only excretory ro ute of cholesterol from the body is through Bile. Bile acid sequestrants serve as ion exchange resins that binds to negatively charged ions in small intestine. The formation of this insoluble complex prevents the reabsorption of bile acids and thus leads t o their excretion. This increase in bile acid excretion increases the demand for more bile production. Liver cells increase the number of LDL receptors to meet this demand. So, the end result is decrease in amount of circulating LDL29. By unknown mechanism , this increases the HDL level as well. In Vidangatanduladi churna , Trivrit with its increased gastric emptying activity and promoting intestinal motility would have prevented reabsorption of cholesterol from intestine and at the same time laxative propert y of both Trivt and Triphala (combination of haritaki, vibhitaki, amalaka) subsequently normalised lipid levels by hindering its absorption and increasing excretion30,31. 10. Conclusion Lipid metabolic disorders impose a serious threat to the society if uncontrolled. From the study, the combination of polyherbal formulations used is potent in reducing AIP values, thus enabling an early diagnosis and preventive aspect of the lipid metabol ic disorders could be made possible. Changes in the lipid parameters may be due to multiple mechanisms on different lipid metabolism pathways initiated by different Phyto -constituents in the formulation. The diagnosis and prevention of these lipid disorder s at the earliest can arrest the progression of this disease AYURVEDA PROTOCOL FOR LOWERING ATHEROGENIC INDEX OF PLASMA - A CLINICAL TRIAL ISSN 2063 -5346 Section A -Research paper 3938 Eur. Chem. Bull. 2023,12(5 ), 3929-3941 entity and prevent further complications like atherosclerosis. The present study showed that the combined effect of Pachana - Dipana with Vidangatanduladi churna was beneficial in Uha and u significant Kaphahara action which is an ideal choice in prevention and management of Dyslipidemias. Further, predictors like atherogenic index of plasma can be made use of in the OP practice also. Hence, disease is best forecasted in young population whose mortality rate is high because of th e underdiagnosed risk factors.
