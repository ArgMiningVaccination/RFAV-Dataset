Each chakra holds a unique energetic frequency and relates to specific functions. Crown Chakra True spiritual enlightenment comes with a lot of practice and intention, but we can seek small moments of bliss by working on unlocking the Crown Chakra. Symptoms of a blocked Crown Chakra can include feelings of disconnection and lack of purpose, experiencing mental fog, greed and materialism, and can physically manifest in chronic fatigue, migraines, sensitivity to light and sound, and other neurological problems. The seventh chakra is connected to the colors purple and white. Using your Chakra 7 Oil Blend, diffuse or inhale the scent from the bottle and visualize a bright purple/white light radiating out from the top of your head. Silence is good for balancing the crown chakra, though listening to the universal sound of \"Om\" can be helpful. Spending time in the sunlight is also good for the Crown Chakra. "}
