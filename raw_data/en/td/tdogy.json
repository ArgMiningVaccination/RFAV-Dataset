The DNA (threedoses of either 1mg or 4.5mg) and rFPV (a single boost of either 5 \u00d710 7or 2\u00d7108plaque forming units) vaccines were administered intramuscularly without adjuvants. Broadly reactive HIV-specic T cell immunity was stimulated by all doses of the vaccines administered,without signicant differences between the high and low doses studied. The vaccines induced both CD4 and CD8 T cell responses to Gag,Pol,EnvandTat/Revproteins,withCD4TcellresponsesbeinggreaterinmagnitudethanCD8Tcellresponses.Thevaccine-inducedTcellresponses had signicant cross-recognition of heterologous HIV-1 proteins from non-AE subtypes. In conclusion, these subtype AEHIV-1 DNA and rFPV vaccines were safe, induced broad T-cell immunity in macaques, and are suitable for progression into clinical trials.\u00a9 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

HIV-specic T cell responses facilitate partialcontrol of HIV-1 infection since these responses correlatewiththecontrolofacuteHIV-1viremia [1]anddepletionof CD8 T cells results in rises virus to the work.cell responses in macaques also correlates with protective immunity in most studies [3]. Although the generation of broadlyreactiveneutralizingantibodiesbyvaccinationwouldbe ideal, they have not been reliably induced by any viableHIV vaccine to date. Many HIV vaccine strategies designed to induce T cell immunity either encode a limited number of the nine HIV-1 genes (often just Env and/or Gag) and/or encode multipleindividualCD8Tcellepitopes [4-6].Boththeseapproaches mayrestrictthebreadthofTcellresponsesgeneratedinout-bred populations with diverse MHC genes. It is now clearthat the smaller regulatory genes are important targets for Tcell immunity [7,8]. Further, since T cell immune responses 0264-410X/$ - see front matter \u00a9 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Matching the HIV-1 subtype of the vaccine antigens with common circulating strains within communi-ties most at risk may be helpful both for inducing the mostrelevant immunity and facilitating the political commitmentto conduct clinical trials of such vaccines in less developedcountries. Consecutive heterologous immunisation involving prim- ing by DNA vaccination and boosting with recombinantpoxvirusvectorssuchasfowlpoxvirus(rFPV)encodingcom-monHIVantigensisausefulstrategytoinduceTcellimmu-nity[4,18-21] .Wehavepreviouslyreportedtheutilityofsub- typeBvaccinesexpressinganarrowsetofsharedHIV-1anti-gens(GagandPol)inmacaquesandtheseBsubtypevaccineshave entered a proof-of-principle clinical trial in Australia[22]. Although doses of 1mg of DNA and 5 \u00d710 7plaque- forming units of rFPV have been immunogenic in our pre-vious macaque studies [22], other studies of DNA/poxvirus combinations suggest higher doses may be more immuno-genic in human trials [21]. This study evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of low and high doses of HIV-1 sub-type AE DNA and rFPV vaccines in macaques. The T cellimmunity induced was analysed for breadth, phenotype andcross-subtype recognition. 2. Methods 2.1. Vaccines The subtype AE HIV-1 DNA and rFPV vaccines were based on the design of similar subtype B vaccines describedelsewhere [22,23](Purcelletal.,manuscriptinpreparation).

Results 3.1.

The juvenile macaques remained healthy follow- ing the vaccinations and gained weight normally ( Fig. 1A). Noinjectionsitereactionswereobserved,evenatthehigherdoses of the vaccines.

Interestingly, responses to Pol peaked later thanGagandEnv,beinggreatestatweek16( Fig.2A,diamonds). Pol-specic responses at week 16 were detected in all 12macaques and were of similar magnitude to peak Env andGag responses (mean 275 \u00b1146 spots/10 6PBMC). This broad recognition of HIV-1 subtype AE antigens is also reflected in an elevated response to whole inactivatedHIVvirions(mean313 \u00b1197spots/10 6PBMC)eventhough but all were 70 spots/106PBMC. There was signicant cross-subtype recognition of both Gag and Env peptide pools from HIV-1 subtypes heterolo-gous to ( Fig. 2B).

There were nosignicant differences between animals administered highor low doses of pHIS-HIV-AE or rFPV-HIV-AE vaccines(data not shown). By western blot, all 12 animals developedantibody responses to Gag antigens, in particular p24, butthere was no recognition of the B subtype this assay(Fig. 4B).4. Discussion AE boost regimens in-tended for clinical evaluation in South-east Asia. The vac-cinations were well tolerated and broad HIV-specic T cellresponses were induced at all doses tested. The DNA andrFPV vaccines both encoded subtype AE Gag, Pol (minusintegrase), Env (with a deletion in the middle third), Tat andRev within single constructs. Strong T cell immunity wasdemonstratedbyIFN /H9253ELISpottoEnv,GagandPolantigens inalmostallanimalsstudied,andadditionalresponsestothesmallerTatandRevantigensalsodetectedinthemajorityofimmunisedanimals.Byintracellularcytokinestaining,mostanimalshadbothCD4andCD8Tcellsrespondingtothevar-iousHIV-1proteins,withtheCD4Tcellresponsespredomi-nating.TheverybroadarrayofHIV-1proteinsrecognisedbybothCD4andCD8Tcellsinducedbythesevaccinescould,if replicated in human trials, both facilitate control of HIV-1replication and limit opportunities for viral escape from Tcell recognition. Thelackofasignicantenhancementinimmunogenicity with the higher doses suggests, in this macaque model, thatwearereachingadose-responseplateauforthiscombinationvaccine approach. There was a trend towards reduced T cellresponsesinthegroupreceivingthelowerdosesofrFPV,par-ticularly for the ELISpot and CD4+ T cell responses. OtherDNA/poxvirusprime/booststudieshavesuggestedthathighvaccine doses may be required to consistently induce highlevels of T cell immunity in human studies [21]. This study provides supporting safety data demonstrating it is reason-able to cautiously proceed with high dose vaccine studies inhumans. ThedelayedpeakTcellresponsetoPolantigensdetected byELISpot,occurring2-3weeksafterthepeakresponsestoEnvandGagresponseswasintriguing.ThePolenzymesareexpressed at much lower levels than the structural Gag andEnvantigensinthevaccines,beinggeneratedfromthenativeviral Gag/Pol frameshift events. This raises the possibilitythat,whenmultipleantigensareexpressedatvaryinglevels,thetemporalinductionofTcellimmunityinprimatesmaybedependent on antigen levels expressed. There was a gradualfalltomemorylevelsofTcellimmunityby10weeksafterthelast vaccination. Although it is generally assumed that peaklevels of viral immunity predict levels of memory T cellsin mice[30], there are suggestions that this may not always be true in macaques [31,32], and further evaluation of the functional efcacy of memory T cell responses to HIV-1 isclearly warranted. Regulatory HIV-1 proteins are key targets of the cellular immune response, frequently recognised early during infec-tion[7,8,33]. Signicant levels of Tat- and munity were detected by ICS following immunisation withthesesubtypeAEDNAandrFPVvaccines.ThelowerlevelsofTcellimmunitytoTatandRevproteins,incomparisontoGag/Pol/Env proteins may be due either to the small natureR. De Rose et al. / Vaccine 23 (2005) 1949-1956 1955 of these proteins, which may lack multiple T cell epitopes inthisgroupofanimals,orthelowerlevelsofexpressionofthese small regulatory genes from the vaccines. It was inter-estingthatTcellrecognitionofTat/Revwasmorefrequentlydetected by ICS than by ELISpot. Note, however, that theTat/RevpeptidepoolswerecombinedtogetherintheICSas-say whereas the pools were tested separately in the ELISpotassay and this may have increased the sensitivity of the de-tectionofresponsestothesesmallantigensintheICSassay. Most(10of12)animalsdevelopedapositiveantibodyre- sponse by a standard commercial EIA after all vaccinations.Western blot utilizing B subtype HIV-1 antigens demon-stratedthisresponsewasprimarilyrecognisingGagantigens(being also detected in the two animals negative by EIA). Itis likely, however, that the reliable detection of Env-specicantibodies will require subtype AE-specic protein reagents(currentlybeinggenerated),sinceEnvismuchmorevariablethan Gag across different TheTcellrecognitionofnon-subtypeAEantigensfollow- with previous observations utilising Bsubtype vaccines [34,35]. Multiple subtypes frequently co- circulate in many regions of the world and at least partialrecognitionofheterologousstrainsshouldassistthedevelop-ment of protective immunity. Interestingly, T cell responsestoconsensusHIV-1subtypeAGagpeptidesheterologoustothe vaccine were essentially equivalent to peptides derivedfromconsensussubtypeBandCantigens(butlowerthantheresponse to the homologous vaccine antigens). The signi-cantlossofTcellresponsesbetweenstrainswithinasubtype,but lack of signicant further loss of responses across othersubtypes suggests that subtype differences may play a rela-tivelylessimportantroleinabrogationofTcellrecognition.
