As a result of the NIGMS support and major investments from UMMC and our partnering institutions, we have developed the first ever multidisciplinary and institutional program in Mississippi that combines efforts of basic, clinical and population scientists and the community. While much has been accomplished in the first CTR funding cycle, Mississippi continues to be ranked as one of the unhealthiest states in the nation, and there is much work left to be accomplished. We are extremely pleased to announce that we recently received our Notice of Award from NIGMS for another 5 years of MCCTR funding. The overarching goals of the MCCTR during the next five-year funding cycle are: (1) to enhance infrastructure and people resources required to address clinical and translational research needs in Mississippi; (2) to increase focus on implementation science and clinical and behavioral interventions to address the disparities associated with major diseases that impact Mississippians; and (3) to foster and coordinate collaboration re clinical and translational search within IDeA-CTR/CTSA networks and with partner institutions. The second funding cycle will also focus on expansion, enhancement and even greater added value to clinical and translational research in our state emphasizing growth in rural and health disparities and telemedicine research.3SEPTEMBER 2021 VOL. 1, ISSUE 4 MCCTR Receives NIH Grant for Programs, Partnerships & Training, cont. 4Our Professional Development and Pilot Project Cores will continue to provide a number of important training and grant programs for early stage investigators and our BERD Core will be a central resource for expertise in clinical research design, epidemiology, and biostatistics for all investigators across the UMMC campus. The Research Services Core will also train and assist investigators in research development and implementation, including regulatory management, responsible conduct of research, effective recruitment and retention, and research compliance. Finally, the MCCTR Community Engagement and Outreach Core will build on its past successes by increasing its presence within the State of Mississippi through additional partners and the number of geographic regions in which it works, establishing and administering a MCCTR Practice-Based Research Network and improving the quality and quantity of community-engaged research initiatives, both within Mississippi and throughout the nation. \"I am very excited about the effort to create in-house training programs within the MCCTR,\" said Dr. Richard Summers, Assoc. Vice Chancellor for Research at UMMC. \"We hope that these programs also serve to recruit and retain young, promising researchers at the institution.\" During the first phase of its funding, the MCCTR developed research support partnerships at the University of Mississippi Medical Center, Tougaloo College, and the University of Southern Mississippi. In the second phase, Mississippi State University and the University of Mississippi will join the consortium to broaden connections between early scientific researchers within the state. Dr. Richard SummersSEPTEMBER 2021 VOL. 1, ISSUE 4 MCCTR Receives NIH Grant for Programs, Partnerships & Training, cont. 5Dr. David Buys, who has assisted in facilitating the partnership between MCCTR and MSU, is looking forward to future collaborations between the two institutions. \"Mississippi State University is proud to partner with research-intensive universities in Mississippi to enhance the wellbeing of our state through the MCCTR,\" said Dr. Buys. \"We are particularly excited about the pilot grants, mentor development, and community engagement training opportunities for our world-class faculty and the windows that will be opened to access our unique expertise for faculty outside of MSU.\"Dr. David Buys Dr. Leigh Ann Ross, Director of the CCTS at the University of Mississippi, also acknowledges the unique, mutually-beneficial relationship that occurs when researchers meet and develop new plans to tackle the state's health issues. \"The University of Mississippi Center for Clinical and Translational Science (CCTS) is excited to partner with the MCCTR to facilitate collaborations between our colleagues at UMMC and researchers on the University of Mississippi campus,\" said Ross. \"We hope to connect Oxford-based faculty with UMMC colleagues to implement projects that will move basic science discoveries into clinical trials.\"Dr. Leigh Ann Ross \"At MSU, we have experts in several fields that are intertwined with healthcare and public health,\" MSU Vice President for Research and Economic Development Julie Jordan said. \"By partnering with MCCTR, our faculty members will have more opportunities to pursue research directly related to health while also expanding their network of researchers in the state. The research infrastructure being developed through this work will benefit faculty at MSU and every other institution involved.\"SEPTEMBER 2021 VOL. 1, ISSUE 4 6MCCTR Receives NIH Grant for Programs, Partnerships & Training, cont. We hope that our expanded state and national collaborations, our growing number of clinical and translational investigators, improved connections with rural communities via our Telehealth Center, MS Extension Service, and MS State Department of Health will allow us to be a transformative force to improve MS health outcomes during Phase II. To achieve this critical goal the MCCTR will expand, enhance and add greater value to our clinical and translational research in our state via innovative approaches that will emphasize growth in rural and health disparities, telemedicine and implementation research.

He also serves as the Medical Center's clinical response leader for the current COVID-19 pandemic. The MCCTR appreciates Dr. Jones' contributions to the MCCTR during Phase 1 and to his continued support of the MCCTR. 7SEPTEMBER 2021 VOL. 1, ISSUE 4 Mississippi INBRE and MCCTR Co-Sponsor Inaugural Mississippi Health Disparities Conference For the first time in the state of Mississippi, a conference has been created to address the unique challenges faced by those who suffer from chronic diseases and to bring together local researchers who are passionate about improving public health. Co-sponsored by National Institute of General Medical Sciences-funded Mississippi IDeA Network of Biomedical Research Excellence (INBRE) and the Mississippi Center for Clinical and Translational Dr. Mohamed Elasri Research (MCCTR), the inaugural Mississippi Health Disparities Conference was held on August 4, 2021, at the Mississippi Coast Convention Center in Biloxi. With the goal of increasing understanding and awareness that chronic diseases affecting Mississippians are preventable and reversible and championing the successes of healthy lifestyle modification, the conference offered workshops, research poster presentations, and evidence-based educational sessions to attendees. The idea of the conference quickly became a reality for its organizer, Dr. Mohamed Elasri, the Program Director of Mississippi INBRE. Dr. Elasri mapped the conference's schedule, secured accomplished keynote speakers and saw his project to fruition within a four month period. \"No one had done this before,\" said Dr. Elasri. \"An annual conference entirely dedicated to Mississippi health for Mississippi researchers did not exist.\" 8SEPTEMBER 2021 VOL. 1, ISSUE 4 Mississippi Health Disparities Conference, cont. With the rise in COVID-19 infections this fall, a conference to address the long-term impact of the virus on chronic disease was more necessary than ever.Coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes, and obesity increase an individual's risk of contracting a severe COVID-19 infection, and in turn, COVID-19 can accelerate the effects and morbidity of those diseases. Dr. Caroline Compretta \"Certain populations in Mississippi suffer disproportionately with chronic diseases than others. Adding COVID-19 to the everyday lives of those people often makes the effects of those diseases worse,\" said Dr. Elasri. \"In both the immediate future and in years to come, we will need to collect data and research on how COVID-19 has impacted the lifespan, overall health and the longevity of those who suffer from chronic disease.\" To build upon their mission for a healthier populace, the conference partnered with the Open Arms Healthcare Center to offer free COVID-19 vaccinations, with complimentary gift cards available to those who enrolled to receive the shot. Free health screenings were also offered to the public, giving patients the ability to know their blood pressure, glucose and cholesterol levels, as well as their HIV/STD status. \"Over 355 vaccinations were given during the conference,\" said Dr. Elasri. \"Initially we only had access to 200 vaccines, as we didn't want to prepare any that would go to waste.\" 9SEPTEMBER 2021 VOL. 1, ISSUE 4 Mississippi Health Disparities Conference, cont. \"When it became clear that the public demand for vaccines was going to exceed our supply, Dr. Thomas Dobbs stepped in and saved the day. He made some calls to local hospitals and clinics and was able to come up with the extra doses needed for the day.\" Dr. Thomas Dobbs, the State Health Officer at the Mississippi Department of Health, was one of three keynote speakers whose experience with combating widespread illness lent irreplaceable insight to conference attendees. Dr. Penny Ralston, Director of the Center on Better Health and Life for Underserved Populations at Florida State University, gave the opening remarks and spoke on the importance of building public support for communal health. Dr. Victor Sutton, Director of the Office of Preventative Health and Health Equity at the Mississippi State Department of Health, also spoke on the social determinants of health within communities and advocated for a hands-on, localized approach to benefiting the health of others. The conference offered abundant opportunities for networking and connecting with researchers, health professionals, community leaders and government officials, all focused on practical measures to combat preventable chronic diseases. Among addressing holistic and multi-level approaches to diabetes, obesity and cardiometabolic diseases, speakers and workshops also promoted the use of technology to address health concerns in rural areas as well as future solutions and innovations for health disparities in the state. Though the conference's road from creation to execution was relatively short, over 250 registrants attended the one-day conference, exceeding Dr. Elasri's expectations. 10SEPTEMBER 2021 VOL. 1, ISSUE 4 Mississippi Health Disparities Conference, cont. After a year and a half of virtual meetings, healthcare professionals were eager to meet in person, and by ensuring that conference attendees wore masks and were vaccinated, all could enjoy an opportunity to network and socialize safely. \"One of the best aspects of the conference was seeing the CEAL members for the first time in-person,\" said Dr. Caroline Compretta, who assisted with the MCCTR's involvement in co-sponsoring the conference. \"We were able to get away from the Zoom cameras!\" \"I think people really enjoyed the opportunity to have a small vacation for a day and travel to the Gulf Coast to meet with colleagues,\" said Dr. Elasri. In the future, the conference will most likely call Biloxi its permanent home as it is a convenient gathering place for not only Mississippi residents but for neighboring researchers as well. As for the future development for the conference, both Dr. Elasri and Dr. Compretta have ideas for improvement. \"I would like to see addiction addressed as one of the chronic health concerns impacting Mississippians,\" said Dr. Elasri. \"As we had little time to gather experts before the conference, we were unable to cover addiction as a topic. I'd like to see a panel on addiction and its effects become a staple of the conference.\" \"I think it would be great to have mentoring workshops for young investigators,\" said Dr. Compretta. \"The opportunity to connect with senior investigators involved with health disparity issues would be a great addition.\" 11SEPTEMBER 2021 VOL. 1, ISSUE 4 Mississippi Health Disparities Conference, cont. Dr. Compretta also noted that panels including representatives from the MCCTR and conference's community-based partners, or panels on community engagement led by community members and experts, would greatly enrich the effort to directly connect with those suffering from chronic diseases. Plans for the conference's 2022 meeting are currently underway.

After receiving notice of funding in May 2021, Dr. Compretta is looking forward to expanding the work that she and others have completed under the first phase of her grant, Mississippi CEAL: Addressing Equity in Vaccine Access and Distribution. Dr. Caroline Compretta The Community Engagement Alliance (CEAL) Against COVID-19 Disparities is an NIH-funded initiative that seeks to combat misinformation by conducting community-engaged research and outreach focused on COVID-19 awareness and education. It also aims to include diverse racial and ethnic populations in COVID-19 clinical trials, reflecting the groups disproportionately affected by the virus. Mississippi is one of eleven states participating in the CEAL initiative, and the MS CEAL team includes researchers from UMMC, the MS Department of Health, Tougaloo College and the University of Southern Mississippi. Dr. Compretta, along with Dr. Michael Hall, MCCTR Director of Clinical and Population Studies, and Dr. Victor Sutton of the MS Department of Health, leads the Mississippi CEAL Team towards its goal of addressing COVID-19 vaccine access and distribution. The MCCTR Administrative Core also played a central role in obtaining the NIH CEAL grant. The Mississippi CEAL team has proposed to supplement the work it is now doing with a more vigorous \"boots-on-the-ground\" approach to address vaccination inequities and to reach Mississippians where they live with culturally-sensitive educational materials about the vaccine, 13SEPTEMBER 2021 VOL. 1, ISSUE 4 MCCTR CEO Core Leader Receives NIH Grant, cont. information about vaccination opportunities and bringing the vaccine itself to those areas. \"The greatest challenge currently is continued vaccine hesitancy and refusal,\" says Compretta. \"While we anticipated such hesitancy from the beginning, we have been surprised by its entrenchment in some communities.\" \"We've found that more and more people want to have personal conversations about the vaccine.\"Under the second phase of the grant, the MS CEAL Team will be expanded to include vaccination sites at HBCUs, canvassing teams through the Mississippi State University Extension Service with 4H and Junior Master Wellness volunteers, vaccination teams at select Federally Qualified Health Centers, and the UNACARE vaccination mobile unit run by faculty members from UMMC's School of Nursing, who will provide vaccinations to hard-to-reach areas in Mississippi. As of July 27, 2021, only 38.6% of Mississippi's population had received one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, while only 34.2% had been fully vaccinated. While vaccination rates are predictably higher in more populated areas of the state, rural counties lag behind. Compretta has discovered, however, that face-to-face conversations have begun to impact unvaccinated Mississippians' opinions on getting the shot. \"We've found that more and more people want to have personal conversations about the vaccine to ask questions and voice their 14concerns,\" says Compretta. \"That has made our Communications Leaders, Young Ambassadors and Community Health Advocates such an important strategy in the fight against COVID-19.\" \"They are the grassroots leaders who are having those one-on-one conversations in their communities and helping individuals become vaccine-confident.\" And success, according to Compretta, isn't necessarily defined as a number, but as forward momentum towards the overall health of Mississippi communities. \"For our mobile vaccination units, some of their milestones may include numbers of vaccines administered,\" says Compretta. \"But our other projects with Communications Leaders and Young Ambassadors measure success by the increase in grassroots leaders who are trained and engaged in the project.\" For more information on Mississippi CEAL, visit our website here.
