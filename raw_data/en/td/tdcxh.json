Wild animals and hybrids (Any offspring of wild animals crossbred to domestic animals)Domestic animals (Dogs Do not submit for testingGuidelines: Animal submission for rabies testing 1If a bat was in the room with a sleeping person or an unattended young child or pet, unrecognized direct contact may be suspe cted. 2 If animal was healthy at the time of bite/exposure , it is very unlikely to be rabid. Neurologic illness greatly increases the likelihood of rabies. 3 If animal has ever received at least 2 rabies vaccines, it is very unlikely to be rabid. 4Small rodents (e.g. squirrels, chipmunks, mice, hamsters, rats) are not considered a risk for rabies transmission and general lywill not be tested. Tennessee Department of Health: 615 -741-7247Was a person or domestic animal exposed? (Either a bite or contact with saliva or nervous tissue [ brain or spinal cord])If a bat, was there known or suspected direct contact to a person or domestic animal?1 Type of animal to be testedDomestic Wild Wild animal other than bat or carnivore Risk of rabies very low. Consult public health regarding need for testing.4Bat or Carnivore (e.g. bobcat, coyote, fox, raccoon , skunk) Submit for testingDomestic animal other than dog, cat, or ferret (e.g. livestock) Health status2 Apparently healthy Neurologic illness Non-neurologic illness If neurologic illness present, submit for testingDog, Cat, Ferret Did animal remain healthy for at least 10 days from the time of the bite? If yes, do not submit for testing. 10 days observation of healthy animals is preferred over euthanasia and testing Vaccination status3 Unknown Currently vaccinated Overdue Never vaccinatedHealth status2 Apparently healthy Neurologic illness Non-neurologic illness If neurologic illness present, submit for testing. If no neurologic illness but unvaccinated or vaccination history unknown, consult public health regarding need for testing. Appendix I : Tennessee Department of Health Rabies Control ManualConclusions Rabies is rare but fatal, there is time to assess Rabies in Tennessee from skunks and spillover from skunks, raccoon rabies is a risk Animal submissions do not reflect epidemiology of rabies in Tennessee, testing is a valuable resource Partnership and communication among stakeholders is keyhttps://tn.gov/assets/entities/health/attachments/RabiesManual2016.pdfQuestions?Raccoon Rabies in TennesseeWhy problematic? Raccoons thrive in suburban settings Aggressive and swift Increase in dog and cat (2X) rabies Increase in other rabid species Increase in human exposures Need for PEP risk assessment Increased animal control calls & anxietyTennessee response Education Reduce risk Protect pets through vaccination Control translocation Increase surveillance USDA-Wildlife Services Help prevent spread Oral rabies vaccination (ORV) campaignIncubation period (not infectious) Infectious periodExposure: Rabies virus enters body from a bite or fresh saliva contact with an open wound or mucous membraneOnset of profound, rapidly progressive illness; death occurs within daysVirus travels via peripheral nerves toward the central nervous system (average 3 weeks to 3 months)Virus enters brain, begins replicatingVirus spreads to salivary glands, may be excreted in saliva (begins <10 days before clinical signs appear)How long should an animal be confined and observed? *Applies ONLY to dogs, cats, and ferrets.
