IP19-1901 COVID -19 Supplement funding should be the primary source of funding for vaccination activities.

The COVID supplement 3 budget that you submit must allocate the entire amount of funding that you have received, but that funding need not take you through 6/30/2024 if you will be able to liquidate those funds earlier. We want to strongly encourage you to use the funding as quickly as you can in order to accelerate your vaccination activities. Budget formulation and the timeframe of forecasted expenditures should be based on the immediate needs of your organization although the funding is available through 6/30/2024. You are encouraged to forecast your budget as accurately as you can into the future while at the same time making every effort to accelerate your vaccination activities. There are many ways you may plan to allocate funding through 6/30/2024, as long as funding use is aligned with the goals and purpose of the supplemental funding. Examples of budget categories which might need long-term allocation of funds through 6/30/2024 include (but are not limited to) personnel and contracts.
