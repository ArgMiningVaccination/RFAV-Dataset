What is your relationship with aromatology and aromatherapy? Is it an esoteric, complementary, holistic therapy? Does it have a scientific basis?\" According to the author, Adriana Nunes Wolffenb\u00fcttel, \"the main objective of this book is to provide this clarification, disseminating technical and scientific knowledge, which is still limited to academic circles, while also addressing holism, helping professionals - aromatherapists, biologists, pharmacists , physiotherapists, doctors, massage therapists, nutritionists, psychologists, chemists, therapists - and patients\". After the first and second editions were released and sold out, we launched this revised and expanded third edition, with the addition of a chapter where the research of the author's doctoral thesis enters. This book makes it possible for professionals or, simply, users of essential oils to acquire technical knowledge and start using, in their everyday and everyday verbalization, terms such as: chemotype, chromatogram, major actives, steam extraction, hydrosol, family and botanical species. Information, such as that contained in this book, is extremely important to strengthen this area, which, although it already has a lot to offer, is in constant growth, with much still to be discovered. People fall in love with this area when they know more about the subject, not just about its theory, but when they prove the benefits of essential oils in practice, experiencing them in different ways. This more scientific form is one of them. This book will help the reader so that he can, from this publication, \"walk alone\" in the use of essential oils and aromatology. Good scents..\" SUMMARY 1.

She became Master in Engineering in the Area of Materials Science, in 1992, from the same university. He specialized in Toxicology, acting in toxicological chemical analysis between 1989 and 2012. He specialized for the second time in essential oils at the Pontifical Catholic University of the State of Rio Grande do Sul (PUCRS), in 2007, and completed a Doctorate in Pharmaceutical Sciences (UFRGS), in 2014, having defended his thesis on the anxiolytic action of essential oils. Then, in his postdoctoral research, in 2019, he researched the therapeutics of essential oils in the immune and psychoneuroemotional systems with human volunteers. He continues his academic research in the therapeutic area with essential oils in the postdoc in partnership with the Complutense University of Madrid. His Lattes curriculum can be accessed at <http://lattes.cnpq.br/2096477860249268> He gives courses and lectures in the area of essential oil chemistry at universities and vocational education institutions. It develops formulations, exclusively flavored with essential oils, for therapeutic cosmetics and environmental and business perfumery.
