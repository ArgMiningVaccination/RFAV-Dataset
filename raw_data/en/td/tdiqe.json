When I look at your blood under a microscope, how many white blood cells you have, I can see if you are fighting a virus, bacteria or parasites and if you have nutritional deficiencies or inflammation. I can also see if you have weakened adrenals, parasites, candida or leaky gut. I can then set you up on a personalised diet and supplement plan so you can become the healthy resilient person you need to be at this time! - 70 % of your immune system relies on a healthy gut - Copper fights pathogens - virus, bacteria and parasites and most people are deficient! - Viruses and other pathogens feed on Iron ( if its in the wrong place) - Parasites, candida & leaky gut weaken the immune system - Stress causes 90 % of illness - Only 10 % of disease is caused by your genes/ hereditary, 90 % is epigenetic ! (Diet, lifestyle and environmental factors) These are my best suggestions for immune boosting, remembering that 70-80% of immune health relies on a healthy gut/ digestive in prebiotics/ probiotics - Wholefood vitamin C - (not ascorbic acid or other synthetic C's), Whole food vitamin C like Eden Valley Wild C powder is high in copper which is antipathogenic - Cod liver oil - high in vitamin A and D, important for immune health - Astragalus & medicinal mushrooms such as reishi, Shiitake and codonopsis - Echinacea, andrographis, olive leaf all fight viruses and boost the immune system - Zinc and Selenium In regards to Selenium, Dr. Damien Downing says: \"Swine flu, bird flu and SARS (another coronavirus) all developed in selenium-deficient areas of China; Ebola and HIV in Selenium-deficient areas of Sub-Saharan Africa. This is because the same oxidative stress that causes us inflammation forces viruses to mutate rapidly in order to survive. 'When Selenium deficient virus-infected hosts were supplemented with dietary Selenium, viral mutation rates diminished and immunocompetence improved.'\" [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21318622](https://vesnahrsto.acemlnb.com/lt.php?s=6237fd5a4df29aaddedb74745313d1e3&i=1052A1191A58A6951) - Eat a healthy, whole food diet your immune system relies on this - Reduce stress! 90 % of illness is caused by stress.
