In a straight talk, he shares with TOI his views on ayurveda treatment for Covid-19 and why associations of modern medicines are vehemently opposing it. Q. If [allopathic doctors](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/allopathic-doctors) are asking for research and data, what's wrong with it? A. Nothing wrong with asking for research, but following the data blindly is a major problem. This problem comes from their education model. Modern doctors have been taught to use the data and research but hardly taught to conduct research and generate data. People have faith in these doctors who follow someone else's data blindly. Many times, they follow data influenced by pharma companies. They lack open-mindedness which is a must for any researcher. Good things should come from all directions, at least when the disease is completely unknown. Q. There is strong opposition to ayurvedic medicines like Coronil from modern doctors. A. They can't believe that other schools of medicine can find a remedy. I can confirm that all protocols were followed like any allopathic medicine trial while conducting the Coronil trials. The makers should have published the data scientifically. Unfortunately, they came into the public domain, thus giving an opportunity to create a mess. But that doesn't mean that medicine is useless or trials were fake. Q. Were the trials of Ayush 64 conducted in the same manner? A. In the case of Ayush 64, we conducted research in a big hospital of modern medicine and followed all protocols. Data on aswagandha and giloy was also presented. The data is positive but modern medicine doctors are not ready to accept. Q. Your opinion about government support to ayurveda doctors? A. There is support and we have a separate ministry too. Telangana has allowed ayurvedic vaidyas to treat Covid and post-Covid patients. It is proving beneficial to all. A big research on 1.5 crore citizens and their experience with ayurveda is underway and we will soon come up with big data. Q. Your suggestion to common patients? A. Don't be blind followers. The medicine that was a lifesaver till yesterday and you were dying to get it from the medical store, goes out of protocol the very next day. As Covid-19 is a new disease and no pathy has medicine on it, all are at the same level. An integrated approach should be promoted. All must come together to end this pandemic. "}
