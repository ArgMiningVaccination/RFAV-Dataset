We combine scientifically proven strategies with a compassionate and supportive approach to deliver high-quality care. Our program uses a variety of evidence-based tools to help achieve these goals including one-on-one counseling, group visits to promote a healthful lifestyle, and meal replacements. Medication management, including the prescription of anti-obesity or other medications, may be a part of the treatment plan. We also work with patients before and after bariatric procedures, including surgery. Patients have the opportunity to work with a team of specialty physicians and other staff. After the initial in-person visit, our physicians follow up regularly via video visits to make care more convenient for patients. Follow up visits may also take place in clinic.

For new patients, you will typically be scheduled for an in-person visit. To help prevent the spread of COVID-19, our doctors and care teams are taking extra precautions to make your visit as safe as possible through screening procedures, the use of masks and protective equipment, cleaning and social distancing. We encourage most existing patients to have video appointments (telemedicine) with their provider. We have found that a blend of video and in-person follow up appointments works best for patients. To help your provider deliver the best care during your telemedicine visit, we ask that you complete two tasks the day of your appointment: 1) weigh yourself, and 2) check your blood pressure (if possible).
