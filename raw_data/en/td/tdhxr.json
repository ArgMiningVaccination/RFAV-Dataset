Thanks go also to the members of the Expert Panel for their thoughtful inputs and sage advice along the way, and to the many individuals a nd organizations wh o participated in virtual interviews. We also extend appreciation to the organizations and individuals too numerous to mention here, for special briefings prepared for the MNP Team. Lastly, we extend a heartfelt thank you to the resident s and family members who so openly shared their stories in the hope that their input would lead to improvements in facility -based continuing care in Alberta. Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care ii Classification: Public Executive Summa ry Alberta 's continuing care system provides Albertans with the health, personal care, and accommodation services they need to support their independence and quality of life. Any Albertan can receive continuing care services, no matter their age, diagnosis, or the length of time they need support. Eligibility is based entirely on a pr ofessional assessment of a person 's unmet need for continuing care services and supports. Continuing care services may be provided in different settings including individuals ' homes, community -based service locations, such as adult day programs, supportive living facilities and facility - based continuing care (FBCC) which include designated supportive living (DSL) and long -term care (LTC) . Long -term care is provided for people with complex medical needs who are unable to remain safely at home or in a support ive living setting , and residents receive accommodation, meals and 24 - hour on -site professional nursing and personal care. Designated supportive living provides the highest level of care out of all supportive living settings needs across a range of care an d services including DSL4D, DSL4 and DSL3, and includes access to 24 -hour personal and professional nursing care. A person 's physical surroundings play an important role in creating a sense of meaning and organization in their lives and is closely tied to a sense of who they are. A person 's \"home \" is the place where they feel in control and properly oriented in space and time1. Accordingly, it is important for one to feel at \"home \" wherever they may live, including in FBCC. The Facility -Based Continuing Car e Review (\"the Review \") was commissioned by Alberta Health to identify systemic changes required to improve the lives of continuing care residents and their families , the satisfaction and quality of work environment for staff and operators , and also what changes can be made to modernize the overall FBCC service delivery model . Information and data informing the analyses and ultimately the development of the report was collected from four distinct sources, including stakeholder engagement, expert panel ad vice, literature/jurisdictional review, and analysis of FBCC information/data. MNP received survey feedback from over 7,000 Albertans and completed over 90 interviews/groups interviews with key informants. The review highlights several strengths in FBCC t hat can be built upon to improve the delivery of services including: A highly skilled and dedicated workforce that has strong and trusted relationships with residents and their family members Residents and family members who feel they are treated with dig nity and respect at FBCC sites Well e stablished and valid clinical assessment tools Robust financial management tools and performance monitoring systems McAndrew, F.

Psychology Today. https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/out -the-ooze/201508/home -is-where -the-heart -is-where -is-home Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care iii Classification: Public A solid baseline of operating standards A centralized health authority to administer FBCC services, and A diversity of ownership types which uniquely contribut e to the diversity, efficiency, and effectiveness of the Alberta continuing care system Further, there was significant evidence that Alber ta Health, Alberta Health Services (AHS), and FBCC operators worked collaboratively to respond to the COVID -19 pandemic, and made many adjustments over the last 12 months based on lessons learned to improve the response to the pandemic that can be carried forward for future pandemic planning. The review also found that there were several challenges and issues existing in FBCC prior to the COVID -19 pandemic, that were amplified by the pandemic itself. These issues identified many opportunities for improveme nt including: An increased focus on quality of life and person -centered care for all FBCC residents Improving the provision of culturally appropriate services and inclusion at FBCC sites Improving the quality of care provided to those living with dementia Increasing client choices for care and the use of self -directed care models Improving the coordination of FBCC services with other health and social services , making continuing care services easier to navigate Increasing the direct hours of care for nurse s, health care aides (HCAs), and therapy staff (e.g. occupational therapy, physical therapy, recreational therapy, etc.) Improving mental health and wellness supports for staff Increasing the level of full -time employment opportunities for some positions Enhancing working conditions for staff (e.g. wages, benefits, workplace supports, training opportunities, empowerment) Improv ing coordination for monitoring and inspections, changing the focus of audits from tasks/processes to outcomes Optimizing the use of technology in FBCC Applying l earning from the COVID -19 pandemic experience to prevent the future spread of infectious diseases Replacing aged facilities that no longer meet current design standards Eliminating shared rooms and funding the development of new types of spaces (e.g. smaller congregate settings, campuses of care, etc.) Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care iv Classification: Public Recommendations and Policy Directions The improvement opportunities identified informed the development of 42 recommendations that were grouped into 11 policy directions. Demand for Continuing Care Services and Recommended Shift in Distribution of Services The Review project s that the demand for continuing care services will grow by 62 per cent by the year 2030. To meet this growing demand, while ensuring suitability and affordability of the system, a significant shift is required such that a greater portion of continuing care services are delivered in the home/community through long -term home c are (LTHC) services rather than through FBCC. This shift is also consistent with recommended improvements related to quality of life, client choices and the ability to live at home/community longer and increasing the use of self -directed care. Accordingly , it is recommended that Alberta consider shifting its current distribution of continuing care services from 61 per cent LTHC and 39 per cent FBCC , to a ratio of 70 per cent LTHC and 30 per cent FBCC services. Current State 61 per cent LTHC 39 per cent FBCCRecommended Shift 70 per cent LTHC 30 per cent FBCC Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care v Classification: Public The projected economic impact of shifting to a ratio of 70 per cent LTHC and 30 per cent FBCC by the year 2030 is: A reduction in annual operating costs of $452 million Cumulative capital cost savings of $1.7 billion The annual operating cost reduction of $452 million is slightly lower than the a dded costs of $498 million that result from increasing direct hours of care to an average of 4.5 hours per resident day for LTC, 4.0 hours per resident day for DSL4D, and 3.5 hours per resident. To keep the momentum established by the FBCC Review, the nex t important activity will be to develop action plans for implementing each of the 42 recommendations outlined in the report. Action planning will include the development of implementation working groups, including members from across stakeholder groups who informed the Review recommendations.

Any Albertan can receive continuing care services, no matter their age, diagnosis, or the length of time they need support. Eligibility is based entirely on a pro fessional assessment of a person 's unmet need for continuing care services and supports. Continuing care services include assistance with dressing, eating and bathing, meal preparation, respite, wound care, medication administration, and various other heal th care and support services. These services and supports may be provided in different settings including individuals ' homes, community - based service locations, such as adult day programs, supportive living facilities and facility -based continuing care (FBCC) which include designated supportive living (DSL) and long -term care (LTC) . Long -term care is provided for people with complex medical needs who are unable to remain safely at home or in a supportive living setting. In LTC, residents receive accommodation, meals and 24 -hour on - site professional nursing and personal care. Designated supportive living is unique to Alberta. It provides the highest level of care out of all supportive living settings and includes access to 24 -hour personal and professional nursing care. Alberta Health Services (AHS) assesses individuals for their health and personal care needs and coordinates access to the designated spaces according to those needs across a range of care and services including DSL4D, DSL4 and DSL3. Residents of DSL receive 24 -hour on -site, scheduled and unscheduled, personal care and support services from health care aides and/or licensed practical nurses. A person 's physical surroundings play an important role in creating a se nse of meaning and organization in their lives and is closely tied to a sense of who they are. A person 's \"home \" is the place where they feel in control and properly oriented in space and time1. Accordingly, it is important for one to feel at \"home \" wherev er they may live, including in FBCC. The Facility -Based Continuing Care Review (\"the Review \") was commissioned by Alberta Health to identify systemic changes required to improve the lives of continuing care residents and their families , the satisfaction and quality of work environment for staff and operators , and also what changes can be made to modernize the overall FBCC service delivery model . This Review aimed to assess the existing FBCC model in Alberta and provide recommendations for improv ing residents ' quality of life and care, while enhanc ing transparency, accountability, and efficiency2 within the system. Further, considerations were made regarding how best to prevent and manage episodes of transmittable illnesses that affect residents such as influenzas, the annual flu season , Norwalk virus, and pandemics. Though DSL and LTC facilities were the focus of th e Review , recommendations were made within the context of the overall continuing care system including hospitals and home care , as well as other concurrent and related initiatives that were taking place Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 2 Classification: Public during the Review (i.e., the development of a new continuing care legislative framework , home care redesign, and COVID -19 learnings ). The focus of the Review was to develop recommendations for improvement to address long -lasting systemic issues that existed prior to the COVID -19 pandemic, which were subsequently magnified by the pandemic. However, the Review captured feedback from Albert ans regarding their experiences with FBCC during the pandemic as well. The objectives and scope of the Review included: Evaluating existing FBCC model against leading or best practices Assessing and articulating opportunities for improvement regarding: o Quality of life for residents o Quality of care provided o Staffing mix and models o Workforce conditions o Cost effectiveness of FBCC service delivery and outcomes o Enhanced accountability o Enhanced resident, family, and public communication Producing identifia ble and implementable recommendations and associated actions to improve FBCC Informing new continuing care legislation 1.2 Background and Context for Review A major challenge for FBCC services in Alberta moving forward will be to both absorb ever -increasing demands for continuing care services and adjust to changing expectations. Accordingly, Alberta will need to consider adjusting the types and mixture of con tinuing care services provided in the future to meet these challenges. Alberta 's senior population is aging. In 2019, 13 per cent of the population was over 65 years of age. This proportion is expected to increase to 20 per cent by 2046, when one in five Albertans will be aged 65 and older. Persons over 80 years of age are expected to experience the highest growth with an expected increase of around 225 per cent 3,4. This age group will be the highest user of health services, placing a major demand on acut e care and continuing care services. The emerging population of seniors has characteristics different from those of the current generation and includes the baby boomers. On average, future seniors are expected to be more educated, have higher incomes, desi re increased choice and independence, and want to be active and engaged in the community. They are also characterized by more cultural diversity and a better knowledge of technology. They desire to \"age in place \" and stay in the community to receive care. They expect a higher quality of services, and their care needs will tend to be more complex when moved to FBCC (e.g. dementia care, palliative care). With different lifestyles, service preferences, and demand for choices, they will significantly impact the types of continuing care services provided in the coming decade 5,6,7,8 . Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 3 Classification: Public Approach and Methodology Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 4 Classification: Public 2 Approach and Methodology Information and data informing the analyses and ultimately the development of the report was collected through four unique sources , including stakeholder engagement, expert panel advice, literature /jurisdictional review, and analysis of FBCC information/data. Further details regarding each method ar e provided in the sections that follow. Figure 1: Data/Information Sources Informing the FBCC Review 2.1 Stakeholder Engagement Figure 2 provides a summary of the stakeholder engagement activities completed to inform the Review . A total of 7,098 survey responses were completed through nine online surveys which were active from January 4 to February 1, 2021. A total 94 virtual interviews/group interviews were completed with representatives from different stakeholder groups from October 26, 202 0 to February 12, 2021.

MNP facilitated a total of eight sessions with the Expert Panel . The Panel provided advice and improvement suggestions for many of the areas review ed, as well as f eedback and comments on the stakeholder engagement strategy , preliminary recommendations, and the draft report . The Panel was chaired by the MLA of Calgary -Fish Creek, Richard Gotfried, with the membership consisting of 15 experts from a variety of areas, including academics, clinicians, administrators, facilities operators, a FBCC resident and resident family members , and one Indigenous representative. 2.3 Literature Review of National and International Leading Practices Relevant national, international and Alberta literature, reports and articles were reviewed to help inform improvement recommendations . Particular attention was paid to leading -edge practices in many countries such as the United States of America , United Kingdom , Australia, Denmark, Netherlan ds, Germany, and Japan , as well as other provinces from across Canada . Overall, MNP reviewed over 150 documents /articles/reports , many of which are cited in Appendix 4. 2.4 Data Analyses MNP analyzed data sets provided by Alberta Health , AHS and Alberta Seniors and Housing. Key data sets analyzed included: Financial Information Reporting Management System (FIRMS) data Alberta Continuing Care Information System (ACCIS ) data o Admissions o Discharges o Case Mix Index (CMI) and Resource Utilization Group (RUG) -III data o Outcome data sets including: Depression rating scale (DRS) data Changes in health, end -stage disease, and signs and symptom data (CHESS) Pain scale data (PAIN) Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 6 Classification: Public Activities of daily living (ADL) data sets Index of social behaviour data ( RISE) Cognitive Performance Scale (CPS) data Pressure Ulcer Risk Scale (PURS) data Aggressive Behaviour Scale (ABS) data o Quality indicators AHS data sets including: o CMI and RUG-III data o Outcome data sets including: DRS data CHESS data PAIN data ADL data sets RISE data CPS data PURS data ABS data o FBCC l ength of stay data o Hospital admission rate data (in patient and emergency department) for FBCC residents o Health system planning scenario data and reports Custom scenarios for continuing care service levels in the year 2030 Alberta Seniors and Housing - supplementary accommodation benefit data 2.5 Dynamic Financial Model Development MNP developed an integrated dynamic financial model in Microsoft Excel that allowed a multitude of variables to be modified in real time to support decision making for recommendation development. The integrated dynamic financial model quantified the relative financial impacts of implementing changes identified by the FBCC Review which included but was not limited to: Distribution of C are Across Environments - Level of service delivery and associated operating costs for LTC, DSL and home care for the status quo, low, medium, and high change scenarios, including a comparison of the projected total costs for each scenario o MNP examined lon g-term home care (LTHC) costs from the perspective of caring for higher acuity clients in the community Increasing Direct Hours of Care - Increasing direct hours of care and the impacts this will have on facility operating costs. Scenarios examined include d: o Impacts of changing the proportions of Registered Nurse (RN), Licensed Practical Nurse (LPN) and Health Care Aide (HCA) staffing levels in the staffing mix o Impacts of adding professional therapy services into the staffing mix for direct hours of care Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 7 Classification: Public Capital Spending Requirements - Impacts related to capital spending requirements associated with different care scenarios including: o Adding new beds to meet expected capacity increases for FBCC under each change scenario (status quo through high change) o Replacing/refurbishing existing aged infrastructure (30 years or older), including shared accommodations Implementing a Self -Directed Care System - Impacts related to incorporating a self -directed care system were determined. To do so, assumptions were made related to: o Proportion of residents receiving care under the self-directed care model, including by stream o The costs per day under the self-directed care model (including by stream) o The costs of administering the self-directed care model 2.6 Report Limitations MNP has relied upon the completeness, accuracy, and fair presentation of all information and data obtained through the various stakeholder consultations completed, along with documents and data sets that were made available by March 31, 202 1. The accuracy and reliability of the findings and opinions expressed in this report are conditional upon the quality of this same information. Additionally, the findings and expressed opinions constitute judgments as of the date of the report and are subjec t to change without notice. MNP is under no obligation to advise of any such change brought to its attention which would alter those findings or opinions. Further, the Review findings were limited by the following factors: Limitations in Interviewing FBCC Residents and Caregivers/Families - Due to the stress created by the COVID -19 pandemic, Alberta Health and MNP made a conscious decision to not actively pursue interviews with FBCC residents and caregivers/families. Instead, residents and caregivers were given the option to contact MNP directly for an interview based on communication through the FBCC operators. This resulted in a total of 17 virtual interviews, a significant reduction to the original stakeholder engagement pla n. o To mitigate this limitation, MNP developed separate online surveys for residents and caregivers and re ceived a total of 4,000 completed responses. The survey s provided respondents with the opportunity to provide quantitative feedback and qualitative feedback through comment boxes. Limitations in Interviewing FBCC Staff - Due to the stress created by the COVID -19 pandemic, Alberta Health and MNP made a conscious decision to not conduct any interviews with FBCC staff. o To mitigate this limitation, MNP de veloped four (4) separate online surveys for different groups of staff including HCAs, nurses, professional therapy , and all other staff , and received a total 1,234 completed responses. The survey s provided respondents with the opportunity to provide quantitative feedback and qualitative feedback through comment boxes . Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 8 Classification: Public Review Findings Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 9 Classification: Public 3 Review Findings The findings and recommendations (Section 4) for the FBCC review have been organized by 11 policy direction themes ( Figure 3). Figure 3: Report Policy Direction Themes The findings for Policy Direction themes 1 and 2 have been presented together, and the findings related to federal funding and standards have been presented independently of any policy direction. MNP has organized the findings for each theme into four sub -sections including: Current context (including strengths and areas of opportunity) What we heard from the stakeholder engagement Leading practices/other jurisdictional research Policy directions and recommendations (except for federal funding and standard s) 3.1 Quality of Life and Quality of Care The findings for quality of life and quality of care have been presented together because quality of care was considered a significant contributor to quality of life. 3.1.1 Current Context Alberta Health currently funds FBCC services under two streams of services: LTC and DSL. Alberta is the only province in Canada that formally funds a DSL stream. Both are delivered through a traditional residential care model . Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 10 Classification: Public Many new models of care have been introduc ed in Alberta such as : The Assisted Living Model in Wedman House The Life Lease Model in Laurier House, CapitalCare McConnell Place (Dementia Homes), and Shepherd 's Care Kensington Village The Butterfly Household Model of Care (as designed by Dr. David Sheard, UK Dementia Matters) in various locations9 These models value the quality of life of residents and person -centred care ; and have special facility designs. Person -centred care is a philosophy that recognizes that individuals have unique values, personal history, and personality and that each person has an equal right to dignity, respect, and to participate fully in their environment10. 3.1.1.1 Strengths Health Quality Council of Alberta (HQCA) survey data has found that FBCC residents and family members ove rall are satisfied with the services provided at FBCC sites as evidenced by : 93 per cent of LTC family members , 90 per cent of DSL residents, and 94 per cent of DSL families having a willingness to recommend their facilities to others. Many FBCC sites , on their own initiative, have advocated for person -centred care and participated in training programs such as the Eden philosophy training, and the \"7 Key elements of person -centred care for people with dementia in long -term care homes \" by the Alzheimer Society of Canada. In 2018, Alberta Health held discussions with operators and relevant associations ' representatives in its Minister 's Annual Continuing Care Forum regarding the future vision for continuing care. As a result of these consultations, four f eatures were identified as the future continuing care vision and outcomes: 1. Person -Centred Care 2. Quality and Safety 3. Access 4. Sustainability 3.1.1.2 Areas of Opportunity Modify Acts and Standards to Focus More on Quality of Life The focus of the Continuing Care Hea lth Services Standards , the Nursing Homes Act, and other related legislation is to support the delivery of quality health care to Albertans. There is an opportunity to modify existing legislation to be more focused on resident quality of life moving forwar d. Recognize Importance of Primary Caregivers With an intimate understanding of FBCC residents, primary caregivers can play many roles in the care and supports of residents. Examples include: Companionship and emotional support for residents Assisting in the provision of care activities such as eating, assistance in toileting, mobility (if residents prefer) Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 11 Classification: Public Providing input into the development of care pla n It is estimated that primary caregivers provide between 30 to 40 per cent of the care provided in FBCC11. As the focus for FBCC shifts more towards person -centered care, with more options and choices of how and where residents receive services, primary caregivers will have greater responsibilities. It is important to recognize the role that primary care givers play in FBCC, and to provide them with the necessary supports to reduce caregiver burnout. 3.1.2 What We Heard 3.1.2.1 Expert Panel The Expert Panel members reported that the quality of life for residents could be improved through: Having more resident centred models of care o Support ing residents to age in place - care should come to the resident instead of the resident moving Improving food and meal quality Improving the physical environment for FBCC residents - having spaces that are conducive to walking and mo ving and no shared rooms Improving social interaction for clients o Improving the ability to interact with family members, friends , and caregivers Enhancing family involvement in care Improving meaning for FBCC residents o Creating opportunities for m eaningfu l contribution to the community (e.g. helping set the table, growing vegetables, etc.) o Increas ing opportunities for volunteerism by residents o Increas ing diversity of cultural choices Staffing models o Decreasing the number of different staff that care for residents o Increas ing the number of front -line staff available to provide care 3.1.2.2 Surveys and Interviews/Focus Groups Quality of Life Overall, respondents to the resident, family/caregiver, FBCC staff, and FBCC administrator surveys rated the overall quality of life for FBCC residents at 5.9 to 7.4 out of 10 ( Figure 4). This was about 2.3 - 3.8 points higher than the ratings provided by respondents to the public and external stakeholder surveys. Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 12 Classification: Public Figure 4: Perceived Overall Quality of Life Ratings by Survey Respondents2 Survey respondents further rated the quality of life for multiple attributes on a scale of 0 (area for improvement) to 10 (strength) . A summary of these ratings by stakeholder group is provided in Figure 5. The attributes with the highest ratings by residents and families/caregivers incl uded security and safety, relationships with staff, resident autonomy, and resident dignity. The attributes with the lowest ratings included quality of meals, access to internet/technology, recreational activities, and physical facilities.

Rosalie Kane12. Dimensions scoring well included comfort (except for pain management), security, relationships, functional competence, privacy, dignity, autonomy, and spiritual wellbeing. Dimensions with lower scores and opportunities for improvement incl uded pain management, meaningful activities, and enjoyment (related to food and meals). When asked about opportunities to improve FBCC resident quality of life, the following themes were identified from the surveys and interviews: Shift the culture for FBCC care from a clinical task -orientated medical model toward a holistic, relational, person -centered model of care which considers one 's social, emotional, and behavioral sides Provide supports that allow Albertans to age in place a s long as possible, and delay admission into FBCC if it is safe to do so o Includ e home care more deliberately in the continuing care model and provid e the right level of care in the individual 's home before moving to FBCC Increase recreation opportunities f or FBCC residents Increase the quality and variety of food provided Improve the design of facilities to provide more space for activities , dementia -friendly features , and eliminate shared rooms Increase opportunities for visitations and social interaction s for FBCC residents to reduce social isolation Improve access to technology and internet Improve cultural sensitivity to ensure that FBCC programs and services are provided in a culturally safe environment Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 14 Classification: Public Quality of Care Overall, respondents to the resi dent, family/caregiver, FBCC staff, and FBCC administrator surveys rated the overall quality of care provided to FBCC residents at 6.4 to 7. 6 out of 10 ( Figure 6). This was about 2.6 - 3.8 points higher than the ratings provided by respondents to the public and external stakeholder surveys. Figure 6: Perceived Quality of Care Ratings by Survey Respondents Survey respondents further rated the quality of different FBCC supports on a scale of 0 (area for improvement) to 10 (strength). A summary of the scores provided by survey respondents is provided in Figure 7. The supports receiving the lowest ratings by residents and families/caregivers included mental wellness supports, recreational activities, physical therapy, occupational therapy , and spiritual care. The supports wit h the highest ratings included access to physician/Nurse Practitioner (NP) services, clinical pharmacy , and personal care services.

The movement was led by consumer advocacy groups. The culture - change movement is focused on achieving the following features : Resident direction Homelike atmosphere Close relationships Staff e mpowerment Collaborative decision -making (staff, residents, and families/caregivers) Quality -improvement processes This movement culminated in the Nursing Home Reform Act in the USA, incorporated into the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1987. T he Act required that each nursing home resident \"be provided with services sufficient to attain and maintain his or her highest practicable physical, mental and psychosocial well -being. \"13 The law made nursing homes the only sector of the entire health care industry to have an explicit statutory requirement for providing what is now called \"person -centered care\". Many demonstration projects were implemented in the world as part of this culture change, including the Eden Alternative and what are known as Green Houses. The Eden Alternative 14 believes that care is not to be provided unilaterally , but rather a collaborative partnership , whereby a ll caregivers and care receivers are \"care partners \". It uses environmental and social enrichment to overcome boredom, helplessness, and loneliness among residents. The Green House Projects use small group home settings , where residents are cared for by a consistent group of direct care staff with much expanded work responsibilities, such as organizing and conducting recreational activities , light housekeeping and meal preparation, in addition to personal care. Evaluation studies have found that residents ' quality of life in Green Houses surpassed that of residents of larger traditional LTC homes owned by the same operator. In addition, Green House staff were more satisfied, and turnover rates had dropped in the evaluation period.13,15. For persons with dementia, the Butterfly Household Model of Care developed by Dr. David She ard (Dementia Care Mat ters) in the UK ha s been proven to have positive impacts on improving the quality of care for people experiencing different stages of dementia including: Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 17 Classification: Public Increased well -being Decreased falls Improved safeguarding alerts Improved weight gain Another key benefit of the model includ ed reduced staff turnover, sickness, and absenteeism. The Butterfly Model of Care rests on the belief that feelings matter most for people experiencing dementia, that emotional intelligence is the core competency, and that \"people living with a dementia can thrive well in a nurturing environment where those living and working together know how to be person centred together \"16. Currently, Alberta has many demonstration projects using th e Butterfly Household Model of Care, including homes from Lifestyle Optio ns, Choices in Community Living , the Journey Club and Intercare . A fundamental culture shift will be needed to change from the current practice of FBCC to one focused on achieving quality of life for all FBCC residents . Facilities must shift from a task -oriented, scheduled model of care to a relational, person -centred model of care. Internationally, many research studies identified the following steps as essential to achieving success17,18,19: A. Emphasiz e the leadership role of political, administrative , and medical professionals in fostering culture change . The vision for change must be endorsed as the values and principles of the organization, and the declaration for change must come from the highest leadership level such as the CEO of the organization . All levels of management, including the medical and clinical leaders of the facility organizations, must champion the change . Staff and front -line staff must be trained on the benefits and approach for the change. Many front -line staff in FBCC sites are in fact already committed to delivering services to achieve an optimum quality of life for their residents. These staff could be \"change agents \" and leaders in their organizations to champion the change. B. Redesign ing the structure, process , and outcome s of the organization is needed to achieve culture change . Dr. A. Donabedian (2005)20,21, creator of the model for evaluating the quality of medical care, indicated that \"structure, process , and outcome \" are the foundations for achieving quality medical care. Exam ples of ways of changing current practice include : Structure: o Facility designs should be reviewed to ensure that they achieve resident quality of life o Staff are trained to implement a person -centred care approach to care o Staff are encouraged to increase social interaction and enhance relationships with residents o Recreational p rogra ms are enhanced to add features that will improve resident quality of life: e.g. inclusions of music, pets, and gardening as recreational activities Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 18 Classification: Public o Facility schedules should be reviewed to see how they can be made more flexible to accommodate resident choices o Food and meals should be reviewed to enable wider selections and cater to resident cultural diversity Process: o Legislation and standards should focus more on improving resident Quality of Life o Demonstration projects and evaluation should be introduced to assess the outcomes of specific care practices designed to enhance quality of life o FBCC sites that implement practices to improve quality of life should be pro filed in presentation sessions, with quality of life awards be ing given to top performing FBCC sites annually to recognize their contributions Outcome: o Outcome indicators measuring quality of life should be developed o Facilities should report on the quality of life outcome measures C. Redesign the w orkforce . In traditional FBCC sites , the management model is top -down. There is a \"chain of command \" in which all care staff must follow. Cultural change promotes a redesign of the workforce where the goal is to \"flatten\" the hierarchy. This levelling can be done by creating self-managed work teams (e.g. a group of HCAs responsible for providing care to a specific group of FBCC residents). Team members are encouraged to plan for the care of residents around their total needs, respecting their choice, and foregoing some of the regular schedules if necessary. For example, if a resident wants to \"sleep in \" in the morning, that would be respected, and they can make their breakfast later in a nook designed for flexible sna cking. Research studies have shown that self -managed work teams are associated with higher job satisfaction, improved self -esteem for workers, increased efficiency, and reduce d staff turnover22. D. Restructuring the physical design of facilities23, 24, 25. Physical design is extremely important in influencing the ability of a facility to achieve quality of life for residents. Research has shown that FBCC residents prefer privacy in a home -like environment. Residents living with d ementia become more responsi ve when they live in environmental designs that remind them of their past life. Privacy and dignity are important features of person -centred care. Thus, where possible, semi -private and four -bed rooms should be eliminated. Private one -person rooms for al l residents (except for couples ' rooms) are the preferred accommodation to achieve privacy for residents. In addition, smaller dining spaces , recreational spaces for social events, and availability of green spaces contribute to foster ing a home -like enviro nment and improv ing resident q uality of life . Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 19 Classification: Public Supports for Primary Caregivers Currently, it is estimated that there are more than eight million primary caregivers in Canada - more than one in four adults. If all the care provided by these caregivers is replaced by paid staff, it would cost $66 billion per year26. Many studies have documented various negative impacts on caregivers. In a 2012 Labour Force study, 2.4 million employed Canadians reported that they had arrived at work late, left early, or taken time off during the day to care for their ill family or friend. On average, caregivers were absent for eight to nine days, accounting for 9.7 million days of absenteeism in Canada per year in 201427. Fifteen per cent of employed caregivers stated that they cut back their work hours because of caregiving responsibilities, often changing from full to part -time employmen t. Ten per cent of employed caregivers reported that they had retired early, quit , or been fired from a job because of caregiving during the previous 12 months . Caregiving responsibilities affect caregivers ' physical and mental well -being, as in disturbed sleeping patterns, reduced social activities, disrupted holiday plans, and engendering psychological dysfunctions such as depression, gu ilt, worry/anxiety, loneliness, and emotional distress . It was documented that many caregivers are burnt out . They require support from the government and social agencies to continue with their role. Studies indicate that it is not sustainable for the health system to rely on family caregivers to supplement the care provided by formal caregivers unless services and programs are developed to support family caregivers28. 3.1.4 Policy Direction and Recommendations Based on the findings articulated above related to resident quality of life and quality of care , nine recommendations were developed under two policy directions. Policy Direction 1: Establish Quality of Life as the number one priority goal for Alberta 's contin uing care system. Recommendation 1 : Declare that \"Quality of Life is the number one priority for the continuing care system \" and establish a Quality of Life Task Force to plan for and implement steps to achieve this. Recommendation 2 : Develop new Quality of Life Standards to be included in FBCC standards. Recommendation 3 : Develop quality of life outcome measures for FBCC and mandate the public reporting of these measures . Recommendation 4 : Support couples3/loved ones to remain livin g together , if they choose, in continuing care facilities. 3 Couples defined as married, common -law, etc . Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 20 Classification: Public Recommendation 5 : Include primary caregiver(s) of FBCC residents as essential members of the Care Team and provide supports to reduce burnout. Recommendation 6 : Improve the overall quality of meal s (e.g. nutrition, menu selection, taste, presentation, and dining experience) at FBCC facilities. Recommendation 7 : Refocus capital grant programs to prioritize a greater variety of client centred models of care (such as smaller homes/households and campuses of care). Policy Direction 2: Enhance overall Quality of Care with emphasis on residents living with dementia. Recommendation 8: Enhance the overall quality of care provided to FBCC residents by strengthening the relevant standards and updating/r edesigning continuing care information systems and care indicators. Promote research, education, and evaluation activities on quality of care. Recommendation 9: Improve the quality of life for FBCC residents living with dementia, including quality of care, and the physical, mental, and emotional health of these residents. Further details regarding these recommendations can be found in Sections 4.2.1 and 4.2.2 below. 3.2 Cultural Sensitivity and Inclusion 3.2.1 Current Context Across Canada, including Alberta, FBCC sites are currently challenged to recognize and support the cultures of their residents at a time when their health and mental capacity are declining. Based on interviews with DSL residents, HQCA found that most posi tive experiences in FBCC were created when residents felt their personal interests, lifestyles, and expectations were preserved . The residents also reported that maintaining, as much as possible, an individual 's sense of identity is crucial to a more positive experience when transitioning to FBCC. 3.2.2 What We Heard Expert Panel Expert Panel members reported a need to provide cultural diversity at FBCC sites including: Meals Recreational activities Delivery language Facility design Indigenous Perspecti ves Quality of Life Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 21 Classification: Public The following comments and feedback were provided by First Nations and M\u00e9tis participants to improve the quality of care and quality of life for Indigenous residents: Improve access to FBCC spaces closer to home for First Nations , M\u00e9tis , and Inuit people o Increase development of facilities in First Nation communities and M\u00e9tis Settlements to the degree possible Improve cultural sensitivity and acknowledgement of the importance of the land and the community with which Indigenous peoples ha ve strong kinship ties o Reduce language barriers to the degree possible o Improve access to traditional foods for Indigenous residents o Ensure that staff working with Indigenous residents are trained in cultural sensitivit y, traditional practices, and have a good understanding of trauma informed care o Provide appropriate physical spaces that allow for connection with the land and traditional ceremonies o Provide access to culturally appropriate First Nations, M\u00e9tis, and Inuit programs and recreational activities Improve home care support in First Nation communities and M\u00e9tis Settlements, to allow Elders to age in their communities as long as possible o Funding for home and community care services on -reserve is very limited Reduce wait times and improve admission p rocess for Indigenous residents Resident Choice The following comments and feedback were provided by First Nations and M\u00e9tis participants to improve choices for Indigenous people: Empower residents to make their own decisions and offering them the ability to choose when it comes to: o Food o Recreation and activities o Room layout (e.g. ability to customize a room with pieces of furniture from home) o Care planning, including involving a resident 's family member in the process Have client liaisons who can ensure th at Elders are heard and properly informed to ensure their choices are taken into consideration Service Integration The following comments and feedback were provided by First Nations and M\u00e9tis participants to improve service integration for Indigenous residents: Build mutual trust with Indigenous leadership and communities o Alberta Health , AHS , and Indigenous Services Canada (ISC) need to build relationships with each other and Indigenous leadership to work better together Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 22 Classification: Public o Alberta Health , AHS and ISC need to trust that Indigenous leaders and communities can build and administer programs o Help Ind igenous communities build the capacity to administer their own programming with out stepping in and imposing a non

community to provide services Improve communication and information sharing between the community from which an elder/resident comes from and FBCC o Have a more centralized model that shows people how to acce ss services close to home o Offer onsite wrap -around services for community members Navigation The following comments and feedback were provided by First Nations and M\u00e9tis participants to improve navigation for Indigenous stakeholders: Create on e point of contact for individuals seeking assistance with care navigation o Utilize navigators or liaisons to help Elders navigate the system Ensure information is translated into different languages o Communication should be visual o Communication should be in their own language o Simplify terminology Increase awareness on how to navigate the system Strengthen connections with the community physicians and NPs to continuing care facilities Funding The following comments and feedback were provided by First Nations and M\u00e9tis participants to improve funding for Indigenous stakeholders: There is a need for better partnerships by the provincial and federal governments related to capital and operational funding for Elder 's lodges and FBCC facilities, including better coordination by all parties o There needs to be better continuity and consistency with the funding process for Indigenous communities o There needs to be stable, consistent, and adequate funding for Indigenous run facilities Currently , funding is grant based and there is no specific stream of funding available Facilities need to apply for funding every year which limits their capacity to plan for the future Inconsistent funding is perceived to lead to more turnover in staff Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 23 Classification: Public o There needs to be flexibility in how funding is used Other than a few capital grants, most grants do not allow funds to be used for renovations More flexibility for program -based funding Funding for Indigenous facility planning needs to consider contingencies, feasi bility studies, and cultural nuances (e.g. translators) Indigenous communities need access to more (Indigenous based) facilities equipped with culturally relevant services 3.2.3 Leading Practices/Other Jurisdictional Research The National Institute on Aging (NIA) recently reported a growing need for inclusive care and support that acknowledges and affirms the immense diversity that exists among LTC residents across Canada including race, culture, gender, and sexual orientation29. It was noted that quality of life for all residents could be improved by making relevant changes in LTC facilities that ensures programs, policies, and practices contribute to inclusive, welcoming, and affirming environments for all members of the diverse populations who live, work, and visit in LTC homes. A needs assessment performed s pecific to Indigenous culture for Ontario 's LTC homes in 2017 -2018 found that Indigenous people have unique cultural requirements that must be supported by all health care str eams includ ing LTC30. Levels of acuity for residents and demand for LTC is increasing across -the- board and under these stressors, continuing care homes are challenged to pay appropriate attention to, recognize, and support the culture of their residents. Th rough the work of three groups (Centres for Learning, Research, and Innovation in LTC [CLRIs]), it was identified that support for Indigenous culture in LTC was a key area in which innovation and capacity -building is needed. This group (in collaboration with Indigenous organizations and sector Associations) identified the following types of support opportunities to address these identified challenges: Cultural safety training for all staff whereby Indigenous organizations are the primary content creators fo r training materials Ways to connect to community care providers to ease the transition from community services to those provided within LTC Tips and ideas for helping residents stay in touch with their families and community more generally Information ab out ways for homes to work with Indigenous community organizations, Friendship Centres, Healing Lodges etc. to connect residents to their services; traditional medicines; navigating jurisdictional issues and different payment sources; cultural values, traditions and beliefs in a general way; and ways other organizations support smudging, fires and tobacco burning Promotion of culture specific information about dementia care, palliative care , and end -of-life practices Recipes for traditional foods, and menu ideas for incorporating them along with ideas for sourcing traditional foods Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 24 Classification: Public Tips for engaging and working with interpreters The creation and sharing of printable cards with pictures and words in the language of the resident for activities of daily livin g and other important words Tips for training and engaging Indigenous care staff, supervisors, board of directors ' members and volunteers, including visiting Elders In 2018, t he Standing Committee on Indigenous and Northern Affairs (the Committee) held eight public hearings and heard 48 witnesses, including representatives of the federal government, First Nation communities and organizations, tribal councils, service providers, health authorities and independent experts. The purpose of the study was to c onsider the main barriers that seniors and those with chronic illness face in obtaining continuing care on reserve (including care provided in LTC facilities on - or off - reserve). The study also addressed palliative care and the need for programs and practi ces adapted to First Nations ' cultures and values31. Over the course of its study, the House of Commons Standing Committee on Indigenous and Northern Affairs learned that the barriers associated with continuing care services on-reserve are partly due to the complexity of overlapping responsibilities and current policies between levels of government. Currently, the responsibility to provide health care on -reserve is unclear . The provision of those services is currently shared among the federal and provincial governments, First Nations organizations and communities, and third -party services providers resulting in a complicated and ambiguous framework. Because both levels of government have not fully assumed accountability, First Nation communities have trouble obtaining the support they need to offer health care services on - and off -reserve. Current resources for home and community care cannot meet the growing demand for these services on-reserve; there are very few LTC facilities on or near reserves; and the s ervices provided in off -reserve LTC facilities are often very far from First Nation communities or do not provide the required level of culturally appropriate care. Recommendations related to this study are listed below. 1. That Indigenous Services Canada (ISC) provide increased funding to the First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care Program (FNIHCC) to include palliative care as a service eligible for funding under the program 2. That ISC evaluate the current needs regarding in -home respite care under the FNIHCC Program and report publicly on it; and that ISC review the funding allocated for the FNIHCC Program to ensure that in -home respite care on -reserve is accessible and adequate 3. That ISC: Establish a funding formula that provides stable, predictab le, and long -term funding to projects to build or maintain LTC facilities on -reserve , and that the new formula considers factors such as First Nation population growth, inflation , and the remoteness of communities Facilitate and support partnership initia tives to build LTC facilities Work with First Nations and the provinces and territories, in accordance with the priorities that First Nations set for LTC services on-reserve, to develop and implement Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 25 Classification: Public pilot projects in various regions of Canada to build and maintain LTC facilities on - reserve 4. That ISC work with First Nations and the provinces and territories to take immediate measures to encourage the implementation of culturally appropriate programming and service delivery including traditional foods in LTC facilities and as part of home care and community care on - reserve 5. That ISC work with First Nations and provincial and territorial partners to develop and implement a mandatory training program for Indigenous and non -Indigenous health professionals providing continuing care on -reserve about the values, culture , and history of Indigenous peoples 6. That, in implementing Call to Action 22 of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada, ISC work with First Nations, provinces an d territories and health authorities to recognize, fund and provide access to First Nation traditional healing practices in the delivery of continuing care 7. That ISC, in partnership with First Nations and other relevant federal departments, improve access t o post -secondary health education and occupational training for First Nations learners to provide more opportunities for First Nations people to deliver health care on -reserv e 8. That ISC co-ordinate with First Nations and the provinces and territories to cl arify their respective roles and responsibilities for continuing care on -reserve 9. That the Minister of ISC facilitate tripartite meetings between the federal government, provinces and territories and First Nations representatives to address the jurisdictio nal challenges that exist regarding the delivery of home and community care, palliative care , and LTC services on - reserve 10. Based on the principles of OCAP\u00ae (ownership, control, access and possession) of the First Nations Information and Governance Centre, that ISC work with First Nations and provinces and territories to develop and implement an integrated data collection protocol specific to the health and well -being of First Nations; and that this data be used to inform the provision of evidence -based heal th services on -reserve 3.2.4 Policy Direction and Recommendations Based on the findings articulated above , two recommendations were developed. Policy Direction 3: Improve the provision of culturally appropriate continuing care services. Recommendation 10: Strengthen relationships and the level of collaboration with Indigenous leadership/organizations to provide more culturally appropriate continuing care services , closer to home and integrated with other community services, for Indigenous stakeholders. Reco mmendation 11: Improve cultural sensitivity, and diversity and inclusion at FBCC sites. Further details regarding these two recommendations can be found in Section 4.2.3 below. Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 26 Classification: Public 3.3 System Integration and Navigation 3.3.1 Current Context System Integration System integration refers to how services in different sectors of the health and social system are coordinated, to prevent operat ing in silos (i.e., having limited inter -communication or interface in terms of process/procedures, etc.). Strong system integration is important to ensure that there is continuity of care between service providers and to make transitions from one sector of h ealth services to another seamless from the perspective of the \"user\". Because continuing care operates as one component of the health and social system, it is important that continuing care services are coordinated with other parts of the health and socia l system, particularly with primary health care, mental health care, acute care hospitals, and emergency departments of hospitals. Integration of continuing care services in Alberta began with the implementation of the Single Point of Entry System in 1990 where assessment and case management for continuing care services were coordinated through home care assessors and case managers. Th is model provided referral, assessment, service placements , and coordination for individuals seeking continuing care. At tha t time, LTC and home care were the only two major streams of continuing care. In 2000, t he Single Point of Entry System was expanded to a Co -ordinated Access System for continuing care, where by the entry system was broadened from LTC facilities and home c are to include referral s to a variety of community services and DSL sites. Subsequently , various attempts were made to improve case management services in continuing care. Training for case managers was enhanced by the hiring of McMaster University to prov ide case management train ing to enhance this function throughout the province. With the continual evolution of health and social services in the last 20 years and ever -changing demographics/needs of continuing care clients, the integration of systems providing care and support for this population needs to be re -envisioned beyond a Single -Point Entry and Coordinated Access System. Transitions between FBCC and Hospitals A key area of integration needed, from the perspective of FBCC residents and caregive rs/families, are transitions between FBCC sites and acute care. Based on data provided by AHS, the rate of inpatient visits per 1,000 residents increased for LTC facilities in the South, Central and North zones between 2015/16 to 2019/20, and decreased for Calgary and Edmonton zones . Overall, the rates for LTC ranged from 0.71 to 1.06 inpatient visits per 1,000 resident days over the five -year period. For DSL, the rate of inpatient visits per 1,000 resident days decreased in each AHS zone between 2015/16 to 2019/20. The rate of inpatient visits for DSL ranged from 1.18 to 1.89 inpatient visits per 1,000 resident days, which is higher than the rate observed for LTC facilities in Alberta . Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 27 Classification: Public The rate of emergency department (ED) visits per 1,000 resident days for LTC increased in South zone, remained stable in Edmonton, Calgary and Central zones, and fluctuated up and down in the North zone between 2015/16 to 2019/20; and ranged from 1.73 to 3.13 ED visits per resident day. The rate of ED visits for DSL decreas ed in all zones except for Edmonton zone (which was flat) between 2015/16 to 2019/20 and ranged from 2.49 to 6.52 ED visits per 1,000 resident days . Navigation The continuing care system in Alberta is seen as confusing with different categories of services, facilities, and eligibility criteria. Users of FBCC services have expressed concerns about the difficulty of accessing these services. One issue is a lack of awareness the AHS Continuing Care Facility directory that was recently developed to help Albertans navigate the continuing care system. Also, there is currently no publicly available information on whether a FBCC site has violated any provincial health standards. The navigation function in continuing care in Alberta sits with the case management and case coordination function of the Home Care/Community Care Case Managers. These case managers are responsible for assessing the continuing care needs of individuals and referring them to a range of continuing/community care ser vices . Once a resident is moved into LTC, the case management function is provided by the site itself. The most common responsibilities of navigators are to provide care facilitation and coordination, assist with appointment scheduling and other logistic al support, assist with health literacy, provide patient education and psychosocial support, and connect patients and families with resources and services. Alberta has specialized navigators as part of cancer programs. Health Link and 211 are other exampl es of health system navigation in Alberta. 3.3.1.1 Strengths System Integration and Navigation The Single Entry and Coordinated Access System provided a good foundation for continuing care system integration in Alberta, as case managers are well accepted as coordi nators of community care services within the health system. At present, AHS divides the province into five zones and uses case managers to assess the needs of Albertans requiring publicly funded home care and community care services. Case managers will al so refer clients to other community services, as necessary. As such, these case managers assist continuing care clients in accessing a wide array of community care supports and services available in Alberta. The AHS Continuing Care Facility directory , Health Link and 211 are tools and services that can assist with improving the communication of and navigation of FBCC services in the future. 3.3.1.2 Areas of Opportunity System Integration The need to integrate health and social services The health and social services system s have been changing in the last decade. Evaluation studies have demonstrated the importance of integrating health, social services, and community services to assist Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 28 Classification: Public older adults and people with disabilities to \"age in the right place \" 32,33,34. Coordinated networks of health and social services should be put in place to enable the effective access to services as needed in an efficient manner. The use, or misuse, of hospital EDs is an example of the need for a closely integrated health and soc ial services system. It has been reported that patients who present to the hospital ED often disclose social problems35 (e.g., lack of housing, financial insecurity, family violence, and transportation issues) which acute care facilities alone cannot addres s. In these kinds of circumstances, a close -knit network of all human services is required to resolve these issues including the underlying problems. Primary health care is now regarded as the first point of contact for health services. There is a recognit ion that primary health care must be integrated and coordinated with continuing care and community services to be effective. Some Primary Health Care Networks (PCNs) in Alberta have developed multi -disciplinary teams, including physicians, to address the h ealth needs of the patients. There is a need to establish collaborative alliances amongst health and social agencies as well as age - and dementia -friendly neighbourhoods to assist individuals to remain in their community to receive services. CORE Alberta 36 (Healthy Aging Collaborative Online Resources and Education), funded by Alberta Seniors and Housing, is a good first step towards developing such integrated community networks of services with the assistance of technology. Additional funding to strength en community networks and capacity to enable more seniors to age in the community is a good investment for an aging society. Future planning for FBCC needs to be placed within the context of an integrated health system with coordinated health and social se rvices serving as supports for all individuals. Home -care case management and transformed community care services For individuals requiring publicly funded home and community care services, home care case management remains the appropriate program to provi de assessment and referrals to these services. Case managers in the AHS home care program are knowledgeable, trained service coordinators who are skilled in assessing clients and assisting them to receive a variety of home and community care services. During the past decade, many efforts have been made in Alberta to strengthen and improve the home care program such as the province -wide Destin ation Home Program and the self -directed invoicing home care program in the Edmonton Zone. Moving forward, Alber ta should consider the innovations already underway in home care and the potential role home and community care services could serve as alternatives to FBCC . FBCC case management In FBCC, case management for residents in LTC facilities is the responsibili ty of LTC operators, whereas case management of DSL residents is the responsibilit y of AHS. This difference in case management was identified by operators and staff as a major issue in service delivery. One of the problems with the current approach for DSL is that while AHS case managers are responsible for assessing DSL residents and preparing their care plans, they are only present during regular office hours on weekdays, and their approval is required for off -hour health and emergency services. This anom aly has led to delays in the Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 29 Classification: Public provision of emergency services. In addition, the assessments and care plans are prepared by AHS case managers without the involvement of DSL care staff, who sometimes do not have access to the plans developed by AHS case manag ers. Navigation To address current issues relating to navigation and information, Alberta Health should consider devising an information and communication plan to improve the navigation of continuing care service options in Alberta. The plan could include paper and digitalized information on the details of options of care under the FBCC system. The plan could provide a user -friendly description of services. The plan could be linked to facility -specific information sources that outlin e programs and services provided by each FBCC facility. The information package should also indicate whether the facilities have violated provincial regulations and health standards. The plan could provide the opportunity for the user to access navigators in person via actual or virtual means to discuss options for care and options to age in place in the community if necessary. A pilot project to explore ways of developing a strengthened navigation system for continuing care with navigators could also be c onsidered. The navigation system should include linkages to all health system services including primary care, mental health care, hospitals, social services, and community resources. 3.3.2 What We Heard 3.3.2.1 Expert Panels System integration The Expert Panel members reported that integration of FBCC with other health and social services could be improved through: Reducing the number of transitions through different levels of FBCC Simplifying the overall continuing care system in Alberta, as the current system is complicated with too many different levels of care Allow ing individuals to remain in one facility o Bring care to the client, rather than moving the client to the care Providing more information and education to service providers and users about FBCC b ecause there is confusion about how the current system works Improving access to health clinics, transportation programs and outreach services for seniors and people with disabilities with a prevention focus to support aging in place in the community o This could potentially b e achieved with a \"Community Hub \" model that includes: Physicians Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 30 Classification: Public Public health nurses/district nurses Outreach and day programs Transportation programs Collaborative care teams managing hubs to better integrate home care and FBCC servi ces Having accurate assessment s to ensure individuals receive appropriate services Navigation Expert Panel members reported the following challenges with navigating FBCC services , and opportunities for improvement: The current continuing care system is difficult to navigate and there is a need to develop \"journey maps \" for different types of clients who may go through the system to help potential future clients navigate what their journey could look like through continuing care Providing good public educ ation about FBCC because people do not understand how the system currently works Having a FBCC liaison or navigator and some sort of FAQ sheet or infographic to help people navigate the system especially as they are oftentimes trying to do so while in \"crisis\" Having primary care providers more involved in providing information to individuals looking for continuing care services Reducing the number of levels of care (LTC, DSL 3, DSL4 etc.) would help simplify the system 3.3.2.2 Surveys and Interviews/Focus Groups System Integration Overall, the majority of respondents to the FBCC administrator and FBCC staff surveys perceived the level of coordination between FBCC and home care, other levels of FBCC, hospital services, primary care services, occupational and physi cal therapy, and private health providers to be very well or somewhat coordinated. The level of coordination for mental wellness services and other community health services was perceived to be lower. In addition, approximately 40 per cent of respondents t o the FBCC administrator and FBCC staff surveys perceived the level of coordination with private health services to be low or not coordinated at all. Many respondents to the resident and family/caregiver surveys perceived access to hospital services, primary care, occupational and physical therapy to be easy or somewhat easy. Many respondents to each survey answered \"I Don 't Know/Not Applicable \" regarding the level of access to mental wellness and other community services, with 15 -20 per cent of respondent s indicating that each service is not easy to access. When asked about opportunities to improve the integration of FBCC with other health/social services, the following themes were identified from the surveys and interviews: Improve communication between all service providers Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 31 Classification: Public o Establishing a standardized system like Connect Care for sharing information and medical records across the system would help improve communication Increase the frequency of physician visits for FBCC residents o Incorporating the use of Nurse Practitioners would also improve the level of care provided to FBCC residents Increase the provision of continuing care to seniors and people with disabilities in the community if it is safe to do so, and enhance services to support the ability to receive care in the community if possible o Improve the coordination of Primary Care Networks with all continuing care services o Improve the coordination between continuing care and community/social support services (i.e. transportation services, assistance with errands, recreational services etc.) o Create campuses of care that offer multiple types of living environments and care options Increase access to on -site and mobile services for FBCC residents o Improve access and coordination with mental wellness and d ental services Improve case management to be more seamless for continuing care clients/residents through different levels of care Reduce the complexity of the current continuing care system by eliminating the titles attached to the different levels of care (i.e. LTC, DSL4D, DSL4, DSL3) Case Management Approximately 50 per cent of respondents to the external organization survey and 35 per cent of respondents to the FBCC administrator survey somewhat or completely disagreed that the current approach to ca se management was effective ( Figure 9). Less than half of the respondents to each survey completely or somewhat agreed that the approach was effective. Figure 9: Perceived Effectiveness of Case per cent RespondentsCase Management Approach for Continuing Care is Effective External Organizations FBCC Admin Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 32 Classification: Public When asked about opportunities to improve case management for FBCC services, the following themes were identified from the surveys and interviews: Most stakeholders responding to this question perceived a need to increase the number of case manag ers o Some operators would like increased staffing and funding support for case management from AHS Improve the integration of the case management function across continuing care, as AHS currently manages case management for DSL and home care, and the oper ators manage case management for LTC o Respondents were split on who should be responsible for case management Some operators, AHS and external organization respondents felt that AHS should be responsible for case management Some operators felt that the ope rators should be responsible for case management in FBCC facilities Some operators felt that the case management approach should remain as is Some would like an improved partnership between AHS and operators to manage case management o Standardize the tools , processes, and technology used for case management Navigation Many respondents (71.5 per cent ) perceived that it is currently difficult to access FBCC services. Many respondents also perceived that these challenges were due to long -wait times (85.3 per cent), limited availability of care options in one 's home community (78.0 per cent ), high cost of services (68.5 per cent), unnecessary system complexity (53.4 per cent ), and not sure where to get information from (45.6 per cent ). Respondents to the res ident, family/caregiver, FBCC administrator, and FBCC staff surveys rated a resident 's ability to access continuing care services and supports at 6.0 to 6.8 out of 10, while respondents from external organization s rated this ability at 4.0 out of 10 (Figure 10). Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 33 Classification: Public Figure 10: Perceived Ability of Residents to Access Continuing Care Services and Supports The biggest challenges identified by FBCC administrator, FBCC staff and external organization respondents included: Not being sure where to get information from (49.4 per cent to 71.7 per cent of respondents) Unnecessary system complexity (35.6 per cent to 62.8 per cent of respondents) Limited availability of options in one 's home community (58.7 per cent to 78.8 per cent ) Long wait times (35.8 per cent to 62.8 per cent ) The types of information that would be of most help to assisting residents and fami ly members make decisions when first accessing FBCC included: A listing and description of the services available in facility -based continuing care Compliance information for facility accommodation and care standards Information regarding ratings of facil ities from residents and family The fees paid by residents for services A description of which services are regulated/audited to ensure quality Information regarding specific facilities including age, layout , and room types A description of private pay ver sus publicly funded services The process for accessing different types of services Other supports that would be helpful to better navigate the system included: Funding a navigator position to help client/residents and caregivers navigate the continuing care system A listing of facility programming and services A central location for accessing all information (rather than different websites and service providers) o Create one webpage for easy comparison across sites and levels of care 4.06.66.76.06.16.06.06.8 0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 7.0 8.0 9.0 10.0External OrganizationsFBCC Staff All OtherFBCC Staff - HCAFBCC Staff - Prof TherapyFBCC Staff - NursesFBCC Staff - AdministratorsFamilies/CaregiversResidents Average Rating (0 -10)Stakeholder GroupAccess to Continuing Care Services and Supports Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 34 Classification: Public Having primary care providers and/or clinical pharmacists provide more information to patients regarding continuing care options Providing information in clear simple language Providing a mix of online and print information 3.3.3 Leading Practices/Other Jurisdictional Research Increasing Access to Home Care Services The Canadian Home Care Association 's (CHCA) vision of health care is an integrated system that provides accessible, responsive services that enable people to stay safely in their homes with dignity, independence , and quality of life37. Within this integrated system, home and community -based care provide health promotion and teaching, curative intervention, end -of-life care, rehabilitation, support and maintenance, social adaptat ion and integration, and support for the family caregiver An integrated health system provides seamless patient - and family -centred care and supports for older adults living with frailty, individuals with complex, chronic disabling conditions, and individu als who require palliative care. Integrated home and community -based care enables the following: o Clients access the care and support services they need, when , they need them and where they choose to have them provided o Client and health care team members wo rk together, communicate , and share health information o Caregivers are recognized as partners in care, are involved in care provision when they choose and know where and how to access resources and support o Individuals ' health care wishes are shared, underst ood, respected, and acted upon Effective integrated home and community care models require: o Changing health system planning and funding from an episodic and acute care focus to long-term community -based care o Identification of vulnerable populations that wi ll benefit from integrated care o Patient and family engagement in the co -creation of integrated models and shared decision making about care planning and delivery o Alignment of financial incentives to support collaboration and ensure resources (financial and human) are available in the home and community o Multidisciplinary teams of health care providers (e.g., generalists and specialists, regulated and unregulated) o Care pathways and clinical guidelines that promote best practice and facilitate clinical decisio n making among providers o Engaged leadership that understands resource needs and the ongoing process of integrated care Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 35 Classification: Public o A collaborative culture that emphasizes and rewards teamwork and measures coordinated patient -centred care o Shared performance accountabil ity of providers and patients supported by data collection, analysis, and reporting o User-friendly information technology that supports information sharing between health care providers, patients and their caregivers, and system planners Many jurisdictions have created very innovative programs to reduce early admission to LTC by providing outreach home care and community services. For example, New York State since 1988 ha s implemented a \"Nursing Home Without Walls Program \"38 offering alternative high -level ho me and community care services to individuals assessed as requiring LTC. This program had the flexibility to provide an array of services to maintain an individual at home although they were assessed as eligible for LTC. In New Brunswick in 2019, four LTC facilities participated in the $1.5 million \"Nursing Home Without Walls Program \" 39, with the goal to help seniors in rural communities stay in their own homes without going to LTC sites to seek services. \"Seniors Navigators \" were hired by the project to v isit homes of seniors who require assistance, with staff and equipment provided by the LTC sites . Seamless Transitions: Hospital to Home is a Mississauga Halton LHIN -funded, partnership initiative with Trillium Health Partners (THP) to improve patient and carer experiences through the development of a consistent, integrated, person -centered approach for hospital to home transitions40. The enhanced coordination and communication between providers and patients in this new approach enabled patients to remain at home and out of hospital, helping to improve patient experience, hospital flow/capacity and relationships between hospital and community providers. Using insights from patients, families, staff, THP staff, physicians, community providers and a leading practice review, a dedicated team of interdisciplinary professionals from both organizations developed a new approach to hospital transitions. It was tested for nine months in the THP -Credit Valley Hospital (CVH) Medicine program, following patients from admission through to discharge and recovery at home. Findings from the test phase indicate a significant reduction (52 per cent ) in readmission rates for patients discharged using the Seamless Transitions approach, compared to all other patients in the THP -CVH Medicine program, saving 0.9 bed days for every patient. Patient experience improved measurably as well, with many patients commenting they felt better prepared to leave hospital. Key components of Seamless Transitions approach include: Integrate d, mobile care team Transition planning starting on admission (patients streamed into pathways based on post - hospital care coordination needs) Enhanced care coordination (Transition Coordinator role) - one person as key contact between patient and care tea m who oversees transition plan Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 36 Classification: Public Individualized, comprehensive, written transition plan (My Story and My Care Guide for patients; Plan of Care for providers) Daily discharge rounds Post-discharge phone calls and/or visits Timely, accurate information flow fr om community providers, amongst hospital teams, and back to community providers Self-management and digital entry to the continuing care system With advancing technology, a common trend in the health care sector is that consumers would prefer to manage the ir own care by utilizing relevant computerized tools. An example of this trend is the United Kingdom National Health Services ' Long -Term Plan41 which calls for \"digital entry \" to health services, with substantial investments in integrated primary and commun ity health services. Within this system, health service clients can access their own health records and specific information related to their health and treatment needs and are then able to arrange for required services online. The Plan also addresses prev ention programs, such as smoking cessation , obesity reduction, and prevention of alcohol -related hospital admissions. Navigation In other jurisdictions, h ealth navigation systems have been developed to address fragmentation in the health and social system42. The focus is on navigation at points of transition, as clients move from one provider to another 43. Many navigation programs44, 45 have been created to assist patients with complex needs such as oncology patients, disability groups, persons with mental he alth problems and addictions, and ethno -cultural groups. In a 2019 study by Laura Funk, it is argued that navigation problems are rooted in the structures and operations of existing care systems, as well as the downloading of administrative and coordinati on tasks to individual patients and their families. In Funk 's view, navigation work must be transformed from a private struggle into a public responsibility. This paper proposes three policy directions to alleviate the problems families face in navigating care access: 1. Providing better information about available services 2. Creating more formal navigation supports 3. Improving service integration Ensuring easier access to services can increase the well -being of seniors, people living with disabilities, and care givers. Furthermore, advocating for governments to bear some of the costs of barriers to access by instituting formal navigator programs may generate broader benefits. It might lead to greater recognition among decision -makers of the obstacles associated w ith accessing care for seniors and people living with disabilities and provide the impetus to better integrate services. Although the goal should be to improve the system so that navigators are no longer needed, in the short run this may be unrealistic giv en the complexity of needs for seniors and people living with disabilities across social and health domains46. Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 37 Classification: Public 3.3.4 Policy Direction and Recommendations Based on the findings articulated above related to system integration and navigation, four recommendations were developed. Policy Direction 4: Improve coordination in the continuing care system, making it easier to navigate for the client and better integrated with other health, community, and social services. Recommendation 12: Make easily understandable information about continuing care services available to all Albertans to assist with navigation. Recommendation 1 3: Pilot the use of a continuing care navigator function to improve the coordination of services between continuing care, primary care, acute c are, mental health care and community/social service providers. Recommendation 1 4: Pilot the use of some FBCC sites to function as the \"resource hub \" in communities where this approach would better meet community needs . Recommendation 1 5: Improve case mana gement in continuing care including consideration of responsibilities and functions, with a particular focus on DSL facilities. Additional details regarding these recommendations can be found in Section 4.2.4 below. 3.4 Staffing Mix and Models 3.4.1 Current Context Funded Staffing Hours - LTC Since 2014, the average level of funded worked and paid hours provided to LTC operators through the Patient -Care Based Funding (PCBF) system has remained at 3.37 worked hours per resident day (those hours actually worked by an employee while delivering FBCC services) and 4.08 paid h ours per resident day (includes worked hours plus benefit hours that are paid but not worked ) for nu rsing , personal care and therapy services based on an average Case Mix Index (CMI) of 100 ( Figure 11). Figure 11: Average Level of Funded and Wo rked and Paid Hours for LTC Staffing Type Worked Hours Paid Hours per cent Worked Hours RN 0.52 0.64 15.3 per cent LPN 0.37 0.45 11.0 per cent HCA 2.13 2.58 63.4 per cent Professional Therapies 0.19 0.23 5.6 per cent Non-Professional Therapies 0.16 0.19 4.7 per cent Total 3.37 4.08 100 per cent Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 38 Classification: Public Based on data provided by AHS, the level of funded worked hours in LTC varied by ownership type in 2018/19, with AHS and Covenant Care4 being funded for a higher level of RN hours than all other operator types, and a lower level of LPN, HCA, professional therapy and non -professional therapy hours (Figure 12). Overall, AHS sites provided a higher level of actual hours than funded hours for all staffing types (except for RN hours). In addition, all sites provided a lower level of RN hours than funded for, and a higher level of LPN hours and HCA hours (exc ept Covenant Care) than funded for. The level of actual professional therapy hours was also lower for most operator types except for AHS and Covenant Care. PCBF provides some flexibility for skill mix substitutions such that a minimum of 75 per cent of RN, LPN, HCA, Professional Therapist and Non -Professional Therapist funded worked hours must be provided by LTC operators. Figure 12: Level of Funded Versus Actual Provided Hours in LTC by Operator Type for 2018/19 Funded Staffin g Hours - DSL In 2019/20, the average level of funded worked and paid hours provided to DSL was 2.66 worked hours and 3.12 paid h ours per resident day for nursing , personal care and therapy services ( Figure 13).

This is consistent with a study by Hoben , et al which also show ed that the average length of stay in LTC facilities has decreased from 1.8 years in 2008 to 1.3 years in 2015 in Calgary and from 1.9 years to 1. 1 years in Edmont on48. The shortened average length of stay suggests that residents are being admitted with higher acuity. Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 41 Classification: Public Figure 17: Average Length of Stay of Alberta LTC Residents 3.4.1.1 Areas of Opportunity A shortage of FBCC staff was reported by many s urvey respondents (see Section 3.4.2.2 below) as an issue in FBCC. The HQCA LTC Family Experience Survey of 2017 also reported that family members ' top recommendatio n for improvement was to ensure enough staff were available to meet residents ' care needs and the staff job responsibilities. Only 18 per cent of families said there were always enough nurses and HCAs49. Inadequate direct care hours are a major concern in LTC as many research studies have confirmed that there is a direct relationship between adequacy staffing levels and quality of care in LTC homes50,51,52,53,54. The resident conditions most affected by staffing levels were found to be functional ability, pressure ulcers, and weight loss. Alberta Health has recently explored options for increas ing direct hour s of care for LTC and DSL. As part of the review, MNP w orked collaboratively with A lberta Health to examine options for increasing the average direct hours of care for nursing, personal care, and therapy hours . MNP suggest s increasing direct hours of care as follows in FBCC: Increasing the average direct worke d hours of care for LTC from 3.4 hours to 4.5 hours Increasing the average direct worked hours of care for DSL4D from 3.0 hours to 4.0 hours Increasing the average direct worked hours of care for DSL4 from 2.7 hours to 3.5 hours Staffing Model There is an opportunity to provide greater flexibility within the staffing model for FBCC such that operators should be able to substitute professional care hours between nurses and professional therapies to meet the changing needs of FBCC residents. There is also an opportunity to change staffing levels with the development of new models of care such as the use of smaller home -like settings. In these houses, leading -edge projects had developed very different staffing patterns than those of traditional LTC faciliti es. For example, one project used a consistent group of direct care staff with much expanded work responsibilities, such as suitable daily 1.80 1.85 1.90 1.95 2.00 2.05 2.10 -YearsAlberta LTC Average Length of Stay (Years) Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 42 Classification: Public activities, light housekeeping, and meal preparation, in addition to personal care. Teamwork and the absence of hiera rchy were the features of the staffing model55,56. The principle of adjusting staffing patterns to match clients ' needs should also be used in the future to assist individuals to \"age in the right place \". Currently, DSL sites are staffed with a lower level o f worked hours and professional nursing coverage than LTC sites. In the future, as DSL residents have higher acuity levels of care, it may be more cost-effective to increase the staffing levels of a particular DSL unit than moving these residents to LTC. T his arrangement will enable DSL residents to \"age in the right place \". 3.4.2 What We Heard 3.4.2.1 Expert Panels The Expert Panel members reported that FBCC staffing could be improved through: Improving training offered to staff to meet the growing demands associated with increasing resident acuity Increasing the flexibility of the staff model to have an appropriate staffing mix that meets the differing needs of FBCC residents Having RNs focus more on leadership and less on assessments, although assessments are very important for ensuring proper quality of care Having HCAs be more involved in decision -making and formally included on the care team as a whole Implementing outcome -based staffing models (i.e. ensuring the best client outcomes) rather than task -based models Improving the balance of the flexibility needs of operators with income stability for staff Maintain ing a mix of full-time and part-time positions based on staffing desires o Look at c ohorting facilities or job -sharing options to support part-time positions as desired 3.4.2.2 Surveys and Interviews/Focus Groups Survey and interview respondents were asked to describe the strengths and challenges of the current staffing model. The following strengths were identified: Great teamwork and communication Staff ar e dedicated and qualified Great relationships between residents and staff Survey and interview respondents reported the following challenges with the FBCC staffing model: A lack of available staff to meet workload demands and increasing resident complexit y Over reliance on part -time hours A lack of training provided to staff Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 43 Classification: Public A lack of flexibility in the staffing model to meet the different needs of FBCC residents Not involving HCAs in the care planning for residents, or including them as part of the care team Not enough primary care involvement (physicians and NPs) in FBCC Respondents to the FBCC administrator, FBCC staff , and external organization surveys were asked to rate six different proposed changes to the staffing model for FBCC. The three options with the highest ratings included increasing direct hours of care to residents, putting in place minimum staffing ratios, and adding more flexibility to adjust staffing models based on resident need ( Figure 18).

The study revealed that among LTC residents: nurse staffing levels below 4.1 hours per resident day (below 1.3 hours per resident day for licensed nurses and below 2.8 hours per resident day for nurse aides and assistants) could have adverse consequences. Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 44 Classification: Public The study used a simulation model to determine the number of direct -care staff members necessary to provide five important \"care processes\" to residents including facilitating independence in dressing and grooming, assisting with feeding, facilitating exercise, and providing incontinence care or toileting assistance with repositioning. In 2000, 91 per cent of U.S. LTC facilities had nurse staffing levels below minimum thresholds based on the level of resident need for direct -care nursin g. British Columbia Studies In 2017, the BC Ministry of Health conducted a Residential Care Staffing Review58 which included a literature review and jurisdictional research of the Alberta and Ontario staffing systems. Although the literature was inconclusive about the effectiveness of defined minimum staffin g standards, the Ministry believe d that achieving a minimum 3.36 hours per resident day average is required for safe, quality care in most facilities. In BC, subsidized residential care facilities receive funding from health authorities to provide residen tial care. The Ministry of Health has set a guideline that residents should receive 3.36 hours of direct care daily [comprised of 3.0 worked hours of nursing care (includes care aides) and 0.36 worked hours of allied health services ]59. Direct care hours ma y be delivered by nursing staff, care aides, or allied health care workers, such as physical, occupational, or recreational therapists, speech language pathologists, social workers or dietitians. Overall , 85 per cent of facilities are below the provincial guideline of 3.36 direct care hours per resident, per day. This was an improvement over the previous year, when the Office of the Seniors Advocate found that 91 per cent were not meeting the provincial standard (Figure 19). Figure 19: Direct Care Hour Distribution in BC Facilities Ontario Study The Ontario Association of Non -Profit Homes and Services for Seniors (OANHSS) is the provincial association representing not -for-profit providers of LTC services and housing for seniors. Members include not -for-profit LTC homes (municipal, charitable, and non -profit nursing homes) seniors ' housing, supportive housi ng, and community service agencies. In 2014 , this entity submitted recommendations based on input from the non -profit LTC sector 's perspective on how the system could be improved through public investments and policy changes and enhancements. Specifically, one recommendation regarding s taffing levels and service quality concluded t hat the Ministry of Health and Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 45 Classification: Public Long -Term Care set and fund over the next three fiscal years a system target of 4.0 paid hours of direct care per resident day for LTC. Additional i nformation on leading practices in other jurisdictions regarding staffing and workforce can be found in Section 3.5.3. 3.4.4 Policy Direction and Recommendations Based on t he findings articulated above related to staffing mix and models, four recommendations were developed. Policy Direction 5: Increase staffing hours and consistency of staffing to improve quality of care. Recommendation 1 6: Increase direct care hours (includes nursing, personal care and therapeutic) at FBCC sites to an average of 4.5 worked hours per resident day for LTC and up to an average of 4.0 worked hours per resident day for DSL within a four -year period. Recommendation 1 7: Increase the level o f professional care hours (nursing and therapeutic) for FBCC residents. Recommendation 1 8: Increase the level of mental health professional supports for FBCC residents. Recommendation 1 9: Support FBCC operators to implement consistent staffing assignments . Additional detail regarding these recommendations can be found in Section 4.2.5 below. 3.5 Workforce 3.5.1 Current Context Meeting the needs of the workforce for FBCC is a major consideration moving forward. This issue was amplified by the COVID -19 pandemic. The root causes of workforce concerns and challenges need to be identified and addressed to improve satisfaction , morale , and wellbeing (see opportunities for improvement below). The current FBCC workforce include s HCAs, nursing staff, professi onal therapy staff, non -professional therapy staff, administration/management, food services staff, clerical support staff, education staff, housekeeping staff, laundry/linen staff, and maintenance and operation staff . Key features of the nursing and HCA workforce providing direct care includes but is not limited to: HCAs make up the majority of the FBCC workforce . As of September 2020, there were approximately 16,861 HCAs working in FBCC in Alberta. The current funded level of full -time equivalent (FTE) p ositions for HCAs is 11,610 (average complement is 0.69 FTE), and approximately 60 per cent of HCAs currently work part -time or in casual positions. o The single -site staffing order revealed that many HCAs had been working in multiple positions at more than one site. In 2019, there were 2 ,285 registered nurses working in FBCC. o 46 per cent of the total RN workforce worked full time. o There was a 2.8 per cent growth in the RN workforce between 2015 and 2019. Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 46 Classification: Public In 2019, there were 3,808 licensed practical nurses working in FBCC. o 38 per cent of the total LPN workforce worked full time. o There was a 24 per cent growth in LPN workforce between 2015 and 2019. Based on the Single -staffing Database, o 45 per cent of staff work part -time, 33 per cent full-time, and 22 per cent casual/other. 3.5.1.1 Strengths Continual efforts are being made by the Alberta Government to improve the training and competencies of HCAs. To ensure there is consistent training of HCAs, the Government of Alberta Health Care Aide Provincial Curriculum was d eveloped and first used in 2005 and then updated in 2010 and 2013. In 2018, Alberta Health approved a new HCA competency profile. In 2019, Alberta Health introduced a new Provincial Health Care Aide Curriculum, along with a provincial final exam. Post -secondary institutions applied to use this curriculum and underwent a comprehensive review. All HCA programs are required to use this curriculum. The Continuing Care Health Services Standards60, issued in March 2007, requires that HCAs providing publicly funded continuing care services have demonstrated the competencies required to provide safe, quality care as set out in the Provincial Curriculum for HCAs. With Bill -46 (the Health Statutes Ame ndment Act)61, proposed in November 2020, HCAs have been placed under the College of Licensed Practical Nurses of Alberta for regulatory purposes. With this legislation, HCAs will soon become a regulated profession in Alberta. It is expected that the combi nation of these latest regulatory efforts will continue to improve the training and competencies of HCAs to provide appropriate services to continuing care clients. The proposed regulation of the HCA profession will provide oversight supervision and increa se the standard of care. 3.5.1.2 Areas of Opportunity Rising resident acuity and the gap between t raining /educational experience and the work environment Health care aides provide about 70 per cent of personal care at FBCC facilities in Alberta. Quality of care can only be achieved if staff are trained to deliver the appropriate care. The provision of quality care requires certified training with a uniform core curriculum, standardized staff competencies, and effective supervision of care practices. The character istics of LTC residents have changed substantially in the last twenty years. The once relatively mobile population has changed to one with high health care needs. It is estimated that 70 to 90 per cent of the current LTC population is living with dementia. The length of stay for LTC residents is also decreasing, suggesting higher acuity levels. FBCC staff will require proper training to provide proper care to higher acuity residents. Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 47 Classification: Public Demanding work and employment conditions for staff Increasing workload issues for nursing and personal care staff is another area of concern for FBCC, as the acuity of residents continues to increase. This demand has intensified the stressful working conditions in FBCC. FBCC sites incur some of the highest work -related injury rates in Alberta and Canada. Personal care includes physically lifting and moving residents which often results in staff injuries due to either accidents or improper application of techniques. In addition, residents living with dementia can pose challengi ng behaviours for staff to address. In some of the worst instances, staff may even experience violence and abuse from residents. Many HCAs working in Alberta are immigrants and predominantly women, with language barriers and coming from low -income families . These conditions can lead to many obstacles in articulating their concerns on workplace issues and having the ir problems addressed. Another issue with FBCC workplaces is a shortage of full -time employment with related benefits such as sick time, vacatio n, and other fringe and pension benefits. Part -time employment is created by the need to have enough staff at peak activity periods in FBCC (e.g. mealtime). Some employers prefer to provide part-time employment as it lowers the facilities ' operating costs by reducing fringe and pension benefits. Many employees in FBCC require full -time employment to support the financial needs of their families. Thus, it is not unusual for them to work at two or three facilities concurrently. Some employees prefer part -time employment due to improved flexibility and the need for child -care, and other family commitments. COVID -19 demonstrated the adverse impact that part -time employment had in FBCC. From the organizational health perspective, an excess use of part -time perso nnel in a facility creates instability in the organization. From the person -centred care perspective, part -time employment of nursing and personal care staff makes it impossible to provide consistency of care providers which is requested often by residents . Prior to COVID -19, many HCAs, LPNs, and RNs worked part -time or casual hours. The high percentage of part -time employment in FBCC should be reduced to improve continuity of care for FBCC residents. Public Health Order 10 -2020 came into effect in 2020 and will remain in effect throughout the course of the COVID -19 pandemic. This Order mandates that staff work at only one FBCC site, with some exemptions granted for special occasions. At present, more than 95 per cent of the workforce has been allocated to s ingle sites. Labour Supply and staff shortages Alberta is expected to experience a drastic increase of persons over 75 years in the population from 2020 to 2030. In response, there is an urgent need to project the types and quantities of labour force required to address the needs of the aging population and to develop a provincial human resources strategy to meet these needs. Ways of attracting and retaining workers such as HCAs, LPNs, RNs, and professional therapy staff in FBCC will be an important elemen t of this strategy. An increase in home care staff to address the expansion of home and community services also needs to be evaluated. Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 48 Classification: Public Insufficient funding for staff wages and hours of care The funded wage rate for different FBCC positions is based on t he average wage rates of all FBCC sites in Alberta. However, each operator negotiates its own wage rates with the corresponding unions. Some facilities indicate that the funded wage rates provided by AHS are below the actual wage rates they pay their staff . Culture of FBCC The existing culture of FBCC is one in which staff become overly focused on regulated tasks and schedules, sometimes at the expense of positive resident outcomes. HCAs, who very often know the residents best, are not always involved in the care planning of residents. HCA positions are perceived as low-valued jobs , and few see any opportunity for advancement. To better meet the needs of FBCC residents and build a high -performing workforce, the culture of FBCC needs to change. A continuous quality improvement approach that places residents at the centre of care should be adopted. Staff should be encouraged to participate in in -service education courses and continuous improvement activities. A \"learning culture \" should be cultivated, and opp ortunities for \"career laddering \" should be provided to all front -line staff to provide opportunities for advancement. 3.5.2 What We Heard 3.5.2.1 Expert Panels The Expert Panel members reported that FBCC workplaces could be improved through: Reducing staff burnout, as care staff and managers experience high levels of burnout which can reduce quality of care and ability to retain experienced staff Building strong culture, as happy staff lead to happy residents and families which creates a culture of supporting staff Developing a formal H uman Resources plan for FBCC keeping in mind what is needed for the future, competencies of staff and how to evaluate the effectiveness of the plan Reduc ing the administrative burden on front line staff so they have more time to spend w ith residents Improving the use of IT or management of health data to free up staff time for resident care Having a collective team focus, as the entire care team from cleaning staff to care staff should be looked at as a collective group and each member o f the team should be working towards the same goal 3.5.2.2 Surveys and Interviews/Focus Groups Respondents to the FBCC administrator and staff surveys rated the level of staff morale at FBCC sites from 5.0 to 6.3 out of 10 ( Figure 20). FBCC staff survey respondents rated their level of satisfaction from 5.8 to 7.0 out of 10 ( Figure 21). Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 49 Classification: Public Figure 20: Perceived Level of Staff Morale at FBCC Sites Figure 21: Perceived Level of Staff Satisfaction Respondents to the FBCC administrator, FBCC staff and external organizations surveys were asked to rate six different proposed workplace improvements for FBCC.

Two prominent studies in this area are: the Ontario Long -Term Care Staffing Study, July 2020, by the Long -Term Care Staffing Study Advisory Group, Ontario Ministry of Long -Term Care; and Restoring Trust, COVID -19 and Th e Future of Long -Term Care June 2020, by the Royal Society of Canada62,63. There was consensus on major issues facing the LTC workforce including: Rising resident acuity Gap between training/educational experience and the work environment Challenging working /employment conditions for staff Labour supply and staff shortage Insufficient funding for staff wages and hours of care Workplace culture. Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 51 Classification: Public Labor Supply and Staff Shortages Following Ontario Premier Doug Ford 's pledge that the Ontario government was \"totally committed \" to the provision of four (4.0) hours of care per resident per day in LTC homes, the government announced that it would invest up to $1.9 billion annually by 2024-25 to create more than 27,000 new positions for personal support workers (PSWs , which are the equivalent to HCAs in Alberta ), RNs, and LPNs in LTC within a four -year period64. The study also found that r esidents would benefit from more involvement by allied health and other professionals such as occupational therapists, physiotherapists, social workers, and recreation therapists . In Ontario, the 2020 LTC staffing study provided several recommendations. Specific recommendations included: 1. The number o f staff working in LTC needs to increase and more funding will be required to achieve that goal Minimum daily average of four hours of direct care per resident Guidelines for improving staffing ratios and skill mix for PSWs, nursing staff, and allied heal th professionals, with variance to address specific circumstances 2. The culture of LTC needs to change - at both the system and individual home level Regulatory modernization A quality improvement approach to sector oversight Renewed performance measu rements A strong coherent philosophy of care Recognition of the critical role of PSWs Respectful team environment 3. Workload and working conditions must get better, to retain staff and improve the conditions for care Compensation Full-time and part -time employment Protection from physical, mental, and emotional risk Charting and documentation Medication management 4. Excellence in LTC requires effective leadership and access to specialized expertise Clarifying the role and accountability of the Me dical Director Expanding the use of Nurse Practitioners Ensuring access to strong Infection Prevention and Control (IPAC) expertise Accessing specialists 5. Attract and prepare the right people for employment in LTC, and provide opportunities for learning and growth Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 52 Classification: Public Attracting people with the right personal attributes through: o Improved public perception o Stronger relationships with secondary schools o Enhanced supports for new graduates o Expanding the labour pool Aligning the number of graduates with needs across the health care sector Addressing educational requirements for the LTC sector by: o Increasing onsite experiences for students o Promoting preceptorships Supporting staff to stay current, gain new skills a nd develop specialized expertise, including: o Continuing education o Micro -credentialing and job laddering Workforce Culture There is a growing body of evidence demonstrating that staff empowerment and collaborative decision -making has a significant effect on the overall quality of resident care such as those practices outlined in the Feasible and Sustainable Culture Change Initiative (FASCCI) Model65. Highlights of this model include: Creating an environment within which care staff experience being on a team that is positive, supportive, and inclusive is foundational to increasing their engagement in any practice change initiative aimed at improving resident care Research shows that there is a significant positive relationship between team inclusion and staff empowerment in LTC facilities Leadership training included in the FASCCI model assists supervisors to create such an environment Care-workers in the LTC sector frequently experience low job -satisfaction combined with high levels of burnout and high turnov er, all of which has negative implications for the quality of resident care A cohesive work climate that provides more autonomy and clarity has been found to lead to a higher level of job satisfaction in the LTC sector Further, e xisting research demonstrat es that interventions aimed at increasing the provision of person - centred care most often fail if they do not address contextual and system issues66. Therefore, a multilevel systems approach is required. The following organizational factors have the greates t influence on improving person -centred care in practice : Leaders and managers who embrace a leadership style of 'supporting and valuing staff ' combined with 'responsive to staff needs ' and offering 'solution -focused approaches ' to care decisions Empowered workforce practices that enable and encourage collaborative decision -making and increase staff 's autonomy and self -determination Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 53 Classification: Public The development of effective, supportive, and trusting teams The FASCCI model incorporates the above factors and supports the successful implementation of person -centred care principles into everyday care practices in LTC homes. 3.5.4 Policy Direction and Recommendations Based on the findings articulated above related to workplace, three recommendations were developed. Policy Direction 6 : Develop a Workplace Improvement Action Plan to enhance working conditions for staff working in both FBCC and home care. Recommendation 20: Develop a provincial Human Resource Strategy fo r continuing care (taking into consideration FBCC, home care, etc.). Recommendation 21: Establish a full -time employment benchmark for nursing, therapeutic and health care aide staff for FBCC and include the benchmark as one of the quality indicators for monitoring FBCC . Recommendation 22: Form a Workforce Improvement Task Force to assess ways of improving workforce design, workforce culture and working conditions for staff working in FBCC. Additional detail regarding these recommendations can be found in Section 4.2.6. 3.6 Client / Resident Choice 3.6.1 Current Context Health Charter The values and philosophy of the Alberta health system were outlined by the 2014 Alberta Health Act . In tandem, a Health Charter was adopted in March 201467 which set out key values and aims of Alberta 's health system and the roles and responsibilities of patients and providers within the health system. The Health Charter (Appendix 1) outlines that, when someone interacts with the health system, the individual: Can expect that his/her health status, social and economic circumstances, and personal beliefs and values are acknowledged Be treated with respect and dignity Has access to team -based primary care services Has the confidentiality and privacy of his/her health information respected Be informed in ways that the person understands so that he/she may make informed decisions about his/her health, health care and treatment Be able to p articipate fully in his/her health and health care Be supported through his/her care journey and helped to find and access the health services and care that he/she requires Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 54 Classification: Public Receives information on the health system and education about healthy living and we llness Has timely and reasonable access to safe, high quality health services and care Has timely and reasonable access to the individual 's personal health information Has the opportunity to raise concerns and receive a timely response to his/her concerns, without fear of retribution or an impact on his/her health services and care Implicit in the Health Charter is the belief that individuals should be given information on services and treatment provided in the Alberta health system to enable them to \"make informed choice \" and decision on services to be delivered. Privately Funded C are and Services In Alberta, both publicly and private ly funded health and personal care services are available. Albertans can access publicly funded services by working with an AHS case manager; private services are arranged and paid for by the individual. It is also possible to arrange a combination of public and private services to ensu re all the client 's needs are met . Publicly funded services include FBCC and home care. An AHS case manager works with the client to assess their health needs an d arrange s for the publicly funded continuing care services appropriate to meet their needs. Publicly funded FBCC is provided by private for -profit and private not -for-profit FBCC operators contracted by AHS, as well as directly by AHS and its subsidiaries . Private care facilities can be accessed without working with an AHS case manager. Individuals apply directly to the independent housing operator s, and all fees for health and personal care services and accommodation are paid for by the individual. Fees are set by the housing operator s. Individuals may choose to supplement the publicly funded service s they receive by paying for additional private home care services. They may also choose not to be moved to any of th e publicly funded FBCC sites and to pay for privately funded sites and care instead . 3.6.1.1 Strengths Alberta is one of a few jurisdictions in the world that has proclaimed a Health Charter for its citizens. The Health Charter embodies the values and principles governing the Alberta health system. These same values and p rinciples also apply to the delivery of continuing care services in Alberta. 3.6.1.2 Areas of Opportunity The principle of choice applies in two levels in continuing care, at the system level and the individual level. Application of the prin ciple of choice at the system level Continuing care currently has three streams of services: LTC, DSL and home care. When appl ying for these continuing care services, the client is assessed for eligibility by means of the InterRAI Assessment Tools. If assessed as requir ing FBCC , the person will be referred for admission . Individuals are not given a choice of providers or o ptions to receive care outside of a facility setting (e.g. their own home, smaller congregate home settings etc.). If the individual selects a site in which there is a wait ing list, the applicant can state three preferences of sites to live in . Those waiting in a hospital for placement begin Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 55 Classification: Public paying for FBCC accommodation fees after being assessed as needing FBCC. The applicant is then offered a space on a first-available basis within the three sites selected . If they choose to accept the space offered, they can remain on the waitlist for their most preferred option. If a FBCC space is offered and refused , the applicant goes back to the b ottom of the waiting list. The applicant may also look for alternatives outside of the publicly funded system. This system of assessment and referral to FBCC is generally used by all provinces, with some provincial variations. Application of the principle of choice at the individual level At the individual level, choice is important to the resident regarding the way services are delivered. As seen in Section 3.6.2.2 below, interview and survey respondents feel that FBCC residents should have more choices with regards to bedtimes, meal selections and mealtimes, bathing times and frequency , clothing choices, recreation choices , visiting options, and accommodation choices ( e.g. the ability to receive services in smaller congregate home settings , and the ability to continuing living with spouses and loved ones). A self -directed system of care (see Section 3.6.3 below) could allow individuals who require high levels of support to choose to live outside of FBCC in a variety of settings such as their own home, private assisted -living, smaller cong regate homes and shared and cooperative housing. It could also allow relatives (except direct family members and spouses) to receive government support for providing care for these individuals. The existing self -managed care program is utilized successfull y in Alberta but does not get offered consistently across the province and is not available to people assessed as requiring FBCC. Monitoring the self -directed care system One challenge of the self -directed care model is to ensure that there is sufficient oversight for self - directed care options. The monitoring mechanism should be simple and not pose a barrier to the provision of services. It should be effective in reviewing key aspects of self -directed care options such as proper use of funds based on ass essed need, the quality of services provided (e.g. 2 -3 assessments per year to monitor client outcomes), and licensing status of providers. Privately paying for additional amenities at FBCC sites Another option that is already occurring across Alberta is to allow flexibility for residents to pay for additional services and amenities in publicly funded FBCC sites. This allowance would provide the choice and variety for the services delivered. 3.6.2 What We Heard 3.6.2.1 Expert Panels The Expert Panel members reported that choices for FBCC residents could be improved through: Increasing focus on person centered models of care, by ensuring that the resident is at the centre of all choice, including care planning o Ensure care plans meet the goals chosen by residents Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 56 Classification: Public o Provide more choice with regards to where Albertans want to receive care o Offer more choices with regards to living spaces such as smaller home options, and options that provide the ability to live in the community longer Removing barriers to receiving home care services, and broaden the basket of home care services Increasing access to self -directed care options both at home in the community as well as in other living environments such as smaller congregate living facili ties and supportive living facilities o Implement income testing to support self -directed care models o Have monitoring mechanisms in place to assess the quality of services provided through self -directed care options Providing residents with the choice to li ve at risk Increasing resident choice on meals, menu choices and mealtimes o Provide opportunities to submit feedback to nutritionists and food staff Providing more choice with regards to daily schedules for FBCC residents o Increase resident choice about bedt imes and wake up times o Increasing resident choice for recreational services 3.6.2.2 Surveys and Interviews/Focus Groups Overall, respondents to the resident, FBCC administrator, and the FBCC staff surveys ranked a resident 's level of influence in making informed c hoices/decisions about their own continuing care services at 6.8 to 7.7 out of 10 ( Figure 23). This was about 2.3 to 3.1 points out of 10 higher than the rankings provided by families/caregivers and external organizations.

Respondents also reported that the level of influ ence over health care decisions is limited by constraints associated with staffing levels/flexibility and care funding. Survey respondents were asked to rank their level of support for four different options regarding choices for continuing care clients t o use public funding to pay for care in different settings including: Option 1: Choosing between receiving care in the home versus in a facility if the person is willing to pay for additional services to supplement what home care can provide Option 2: The ability to choose to use public funding (based on assessed need) to subsidize care at a private pay facility that is not contracted by Alberta Health Services (i.e., residents would make up the difference in cost themselves) Option 3: The ability to choose to use public funding (based on assessed need) to purchase private pay in -home care from a provider chosen by the client Option 4: The ability to choose to use public funding (based on assessed need) to pay a family caregiver instead of moving to a facility The option receiving the greatest support was option 1, and the option with the lowest support was option 2 (Figure 24).

Howe Institute reviewed the manner provinces delivered their continuing care services in their research report, Shifting Towards Autonomy: A Continuing Care Model for Canada (2016)68, and concluded that \"Canadian provinces ' one-size-fits-all approach to helping seniors continues to steer individuals towards institution -based care even when they would prefer to receiv e it elsewhere. Going forward, Canada must encourage a greater role for patients in choosing their care paths and doing so means expanding access to a more self -directed system. \" A proposed self-directed system is endorsed by many other evaluation studies and already implemented in countries like Japan, Australia, Germany, and France69. In fact, many advanced nations have moved to wards continuing -care models that give clients a much larger say in the suite of services that they receive . In 2020 , Blomqvist and Wyonch drafted a memorandum addressed to Merrilee Fullerton, Ontario Minister of Long -Term Care regarding a self -directed care option for patients eligible for LTC. It suggests that Canada can learn from, adapt and implement LTC related inno vations by other nations (e.g. France, Germany, Australia) that have designed flexible and efficient model for LT C and continuing care, and that a good starting place would be the implementation of a self-directed care option for patients eligible for LTC70. Models that allow the clients to choose between care in -kind or a cash subsidy (or restricted cash transfers ), have become a widely accepted feature in most developed nations as they seek to promote more independent living. For example, an eligible client could choose to wait for a LTC space in a subsidized licensed LTC home , or opt for a cash subsidy to be used to pay for care in an unsubsidized LTC facility (only those inspected and approved by government can be accept ed). A client is free to choose an y such facility, but there are no restrictions on fees. Some argue that the subsidy amounts could be roughly equivalent to the in -kind cost to government. Any difference between the value of the subsidy and the provider 's charges would be paid by the client . The rationale for introducing a greater reliance on cash -based, self -directed models vary. They include: Increased recognition of diversity in care needs and the slow responsiveness of publicly managed care to these needs Home care substitution and preference over institutional care The need to put health costs on a more sustainable path The need to ensure choice The desire to improve the consistency of care for all people with similar needs The desire to better incorporate informal caregiving into care plans The desire to introduce more competition into care markets Job growth in caregiver services The importance of promoting independence among the elderly Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 62 Classification: Public The desire to remove the distinction between age -related disabilities from overall policy towa rd those with disabilities71 Self-directed care models could also help free up beds in acute -care hospitals where many are occupied by patients that could be cared for in a LTC facility. Some patients could be accommodated in approved private facilities even if no public LTC spaces are available. In Hong Kong, the Social Welfare Department (SWD) launched the Pilot Scheme on Residential Care Service Voucher (RCSV) for the Elderly in March 2017 with a total of 3 ,000 RCSVs to be issued within a period of three years. The Pilot Scheme, adopting the 'money -following -the-user' principle, provides an additional choice for people in need of residential care services (assessed to be of moderate level of impairment) and are wait -listed for care -and-attention places on the Central Waiting List (CWL). This pilot scheme has been extended for 3 years (March 2020 to March 2023)72. Features of the Pilot Scheme include: 'Money -following -the-user' provides greater flexibility and choice: people can freely choose and switch residential care homes for the elderly (RCHEs) under the Pi lot Scheme according to their needs. 'Users pay in accordance with affordability ' allows those who can afford less to receive more subsidy from the Government: the co -payment level is determined based on the asset and income of the person on an individual basis. People under Level zero (the lowest level) do not have to pay for the 'standard service package' included in the monthly voucher value. For the income test, the monthly income of the voucher applicants is benchmarked against the latest Median Monthl y Domestic Household Income (MMDHI) for singleton households. Waiting time is shortened: people can receive subsidised residential care services in a shorter period of time. Six-month trial period: People can consider admitting to RCHEs and try to adapt to life in RCHEs. The Pilot Scheme allows voucher holders to make top -up payment up to an amount of 150 per cent of the voucher value to purchase enhanced or value -added services which are outside the standard service package. Examples of top -up services inc lude additional physiotherapy/ occupational therapy sessions, upgraded dormitory, acupuncture, Chinese medicine and massage service . Person -Centered Care and Choice In the UK, the Health Foundation concluded that p erson -centred care is a relationship in wh ich health care professionals and patients work together to: understand what is important to the person, make decisions about their care and treatment, identify and achieve their goals . The following positive outcomes of p erson -centred care were further de scribed: Supporting patients with long -term conditions to manage their health and care can improve clinical outcomes. When people play a more collaborative role in managing their health and care, they are less likely to use emergency hospital services. The y are also more likely to stick to their treatment plans and take their medicine correctly. Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 63 Classification: Public Patients who have the opportunity and support to make decisions about their care and treatment in partnership with health professionals are more satisfied with thei r care, are more likely to choose treatments based on their values and preferences rather than those of their clinician, and tend to choose less invasive and costly treatments. Individuals who have more knowledge, skills and confidence to manage their heal th and health care are more likely to engage in positive health behaviours and to have better health outcomes. Person -centred care is good for health care professionals too. As patient engagement increases, staff performance and morale see a corresponding increase73. 3.6.4 Policy Direction and Recommendations Based on the findings articulated above related to client/resident choice , three recommendation s were developed. Policy Direction 7: Expand the choices available to Albertans who require continuing care services. Recommendation 2 3: Introduce self -directed care as an option for people assessed as needing continuing care (expanding the option within home care and introducing FBCC options) , to provide greater choice regarding locations, types, and providers of services . Recommendation 2 4: Develop a monitoring mechanism for the self -directed system of care. Recommendation 25: Enhance client choice by s upporting a greater percentage of continuing care clients in the community rather than FBCC sites. Additional details regarding these recommendations can be found in Section 4.2.7 below. 3.7 Governance, Accountability, and Transparency 3.7.1 Current Context74 Governance AHS is Canada 's first and largest province -wide, fully integrated health system, responsible for delivering health services to nearly 4.4 million Albertans. It is a single provincial health authority operating under the Regional Health Authorities Act of Albe rta, RSA 2000, c. R -10 (RHAA)75. The governance of the Alberta health care system involves both AHS and Alberta Health , each with different roles and responsibilities. Alberta Health is responsible for the developments of province -wide health services strategies, legislation and regulations pertaining to health services, and service standards. It also has an evaluative function in overseeing and reporting on the overall performance of the health system. Under the Regional Health Authorities Act , AHS is charged with the following responsibilities: Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 64 Classification: Public Promoting and protecting the health of Albertans and working towards the prevention of disease and injury Assessing the health needs of Albertans on an ongoing basis Determining priorities in the provision of health services in Alberta and allocating resources accordingly Ensuring reasonable access to quality health services for Albertans Promoting the provision of health s ervices in a manner that is responsive to the needs of individuals and communities and supporting the integration of services and facilities in Alberta AHS reports to the Minister of Health via the Alberta Health Services Board. Key features of AHS include : More than 103,000 direct employees (excluding contracted service providers) with almost 11,800 of whom work in AHS ' wholly owned subsidiaries such as Alberta Precision Laboratories, Carewest and CapitalCare Group Programs and services offered at over 85 0 facilities throughout the province, including hospitals, clinics, continuing care facilities, cancer centres, mental health facilities and community health sites The annual operating budget of AHS in the 2019 -20 fiscal year was $15.365 billion76. Ownershi p There are three types of ownership for FBCC in Alberta (AHS/public, private -for-profit, and private not - for-profit). According to the AHS 2019 Bed Survey, the relative LTC bed capacities of these three ownership types were 29.5 per cent AHS/public, 33.2 per cent private not -for-profit, and 36.6 per cent private -for-profit. In terms of DSL spaces, the proportional distributions were 6.5 per cent AHS/public, 40.1 per cent private not -for-profit, and 53.4 per cent private -for-profit. Figure 27: Number of LTC and DSL Spaces by Ownership Type in Alberta77.

Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 65 Classification: Public Public ownership of FBCC facilities (by AHS ) AHS operates FBCC spaces and also audits, monitors, inspects, and enforces compliance of these FBCC spaces as well as FBCC spaces owned and operated by private -for-profit and private not -for-profit operators. Many operators and stakeholders perceive AHS to be in a conflict -of-interest as the funder, operator, and auditor of its own FBCC spaces . This concern was expressed in survey responses (see below). In the AHS Performance Review, Ernst & Young recommended that \"AHS should reconsider LTC facility ownership in cases where private delivery may be more efficient and appropriate. \" 78 Private Ownership of FBCC facilities Across Canada, private ownership of LTC facilities has become a major conce rn during the COVID -19 pandemic. In many provinces, private LTC facilities have a higher proportion of outbreaks and fatalities than non -private facilities. This discrepancy has raised serious concerns about proper infection prevention and control protocol s and care safety in private facilities. FBCC review survey respondents expressed similar concerns. Comparison of FBCC Site Data by Ownership Type There is currently a perception in Alberta that private -for-profit FBCC sites perform worse than the other ow nership types. However, this is not the case based on FBCC outcome data. Hospital stay data for FBCC residents by ownership type was provided by AHS. The data shows that the average number of inpatient stays per FBCC resident for all three ownership types is similar, with AHS facility residents having the highest rate of inpatient stays per resident . The data also shows the average number of ED visits per resident is similar for all three ownership types, with AHS residents also having the highest rate of ED visits per resident ( Figure 28). Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 66 Classification: Public Figure 28: Rate of Acute Care Visits per Resident by Ownership Type and Level of Care 1.63 1.59 1.56 1.52 1.56 1.57 1.371.31 1.311.40 1.36 1.37 0.000.501.001.502.00 AHS Private Not-for-Profit Private-for-ProfitInpatient per FBCC Resident SL3 SL4 SL4D LTC Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 67 Classification: Public An analysis of FBCC resident CPS scores (evaluates the level of cognitive impairment affecting a FBCC resident) and ADL long -form scores (evaluates a resident 's ability to perform activities of daily living such as mobility in bed, transfers, locomotion, d ressing, eating, toilet use and personal hygiene) also show similar outcomes from AHS, private not -for-profit, and private -for-profit operated sites for LTC and DSL ( Figure 29 and Figure 30).

In these settings, operators must comply with the Continuing Care Health Service Standards (CCHSS) as well as the Accommodation Standards . Over the last 15 years, the quality assurance approach for Alberta 's contin uing care system has significantly evolved to better meet citizen expectations of service quality, safety and care in home care, DSL and LTC settings. It involves multiple Government of Alberta ministries, AHS programs/divisions, contracted providers , stakeholders , multiple standards, and quality assurance mechanisms. Continuing Care Compliance Monitoring Since 2010, all accommodations serving four or more individuals where the operator provides or arranges for 24/7 safety and security measures and provide s or arranges for either one meal per day or housekeeping services, must be licensed by Alberta Health under the Supportive Living Accommodation Licensing Act (SLALA) and comply with 32 Supportive Living Accommodation Standards. Similarly, LTC accommodations are certified by Alberta Health and monitored to their compliance with 30 LTC Accommodation Standards, pursuant to the Nursing Homes General Regulation . All FBCC accommodations are monitored for compliance with Accommodation Standards , to ensure the provision of high -quality accommodation services that promote the safety, security, and quality of life for Albertans living in those facilities. Alberta Health 's licens ing inspectors, complaints officers and investigators conduct monitoring visits, inspections and investigations to determine compliance with legislation, regulations and standards ; as well as compliance to the Resident and Family Councils Act which gives r esidents and their families the right to establish self -governing councils at any FBCC site. Where there are collateral authorities and funders, results of monitoring visits are shared to support the operator in achieving compliance. Ministerial Directive D1-2018 requires AHS and its contracted third -party providers to comply with the CCHSS. The CCHSS set the minimum requirements that operators in the continuing care system must comply with in the provision of publicly funded continuing care services. These standards guide staff in providing safe, quality , standardized and individualized care based on assessed unmet needs of each resident/client. The CCHSS apply to publicly funded home care offices and contracted providers in the Co-ordinated Home Care Program, DSL sites, nursing homes and auxiliary hospital LTC facilities. Currently, Alberta Health 's health compliance officers (HCOs) and the AHS Continuing Care Provincial Audit Te am (an independent team within AHS to audit FBCC services) collaborate on CCHSS compliance monitoring activities, including audits to the CCHSS, to support the health, safety and well - being of continuing care clients. Alberta Health provides oversight and monitors processes established by AHS and audit outcomes. The AHS audit team conducts routine audits , and AHS and Alberta Health jointly conduct high priority audits, which may be triggered by complaints and incidents that have direct and immediate impact on client care and safety. Alberta Health also conducts independent CCHSS audits as required. AHS creates and shares two additional reports regarding compliance and monitoring including the Quality Management Report (QMR) and the Risk Assessment Report (RAR). Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 70 Classification: Public The QMR enable s operators to understand site performance, to identify quality improvement opportunities, and to measure progress towards quality goals in support of quali ty improvement. The RAR fla gs problems at a site/operator level based on minimum levels of acceptable performance for use by Zones/AHS leadership. During the COVID -19 pandemic, monitoring has changed because of emergent needs to ensure compliance with the Chief Medical Officer of Health orders. Accreditation In 2008 , Alberta Health issued a directiv e that all publicly funded health care service providers require health system accreditation. In the context of continuing care, this is applicable to home care, DSL, and LTC service providers. Accreditation provides evidence that health service provider organiza tions have met established accreditation standards and have mechanisms in place to improve the quality of care they provide, manage risk, and assess performance. Generally, accreditation drives best practice while legislation and standards outline minimum expectations to which operators are held accountable through regular monitoring. Accreditation standards are evidence -based and outline best practices that typically exceed minimum requirements. Accreditation standards focus on building quality and safety throughout the organization and on being client centered and responsive to customer needs. In Alberta, there is flexibility for organizations to select the accrediting body , as well as the types of standards that are applied to meet the requirement . The extent to which accreditation standards address the same organizational and care/service delivery requirements are different depending on the accreditation applied. Auditor General Report and Recommendations on Monitoring, 2014: In 2014, the Auditor General of Alberta conducted a follow -up audit on LTC facilities in Alberta. The overarching objective was to \"conclude whether improvements made by the department and AHS resulted in a system that provides adequate provincial oversight for health service deliver y in LTC facilities. \"79 The Auditor General made three recommendations regarding monitoring in Alberta : Auditor General Recommendation 11: Monitoring care at the resident level Develop a system to verify that facilities provide residents with an adequate number and level of staff, every day of their operation Develop a system to verify that facilities deliver the right care every day by implementing individual resident care plans and meeting basic needs of residents Auditor General Recommendation 12: Manag ing performance of LTC facilities Define clearly which program areas within AHS are responsible for managing the performance of individual facilities Establish a formal mechanism to use compliance data to review periodically the overall performance of each facility, and then initiate proactive compliance action with facilities based on the level of risk to health and safety of residents Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 71 Classification: Public Establish a formal mechanism to escalate compliance action for higher risk facilities Auditor General Recommendation 13: O versight at the provincial level Alberta Health define and separate its role and responsibilities from those of AHS in monitoring Improve public reporting on what results the provincial LTC system is expected to achieve and whether it is achieving them Finish the review of the continuing care health service standards Implement a mechanism for timely analysis and action on the accommodation cost data In response to the AG recommendations: The Continuing Care Quality Management Framework was released by AHS in 201480 AHS produced the Alberta Long Term Care Quality Indicators Report in 2016 -201781, comparing Alberta 's performance of the RAI QI indicators with those of other provinces o Alberta performed well in comparison with other provinces in quality indicators reported by CIHI AHS developed an independent audit team to monitor FBCC sites Alberta Health and AHS have refined processes to improve the coordination of Continuing Care Health Service Standards monitoring activities Quality Monitoring Results Data provided by AHS shows that quality at FBCC sites in most AHS zones has improved or stayed relatively consistent from 2018/19 to 2019/20 based on the quality indicators of depression, presence of pain, pain worsened, and mid -loss ADL functioning ( Figure 31). With that said, there are differences in the level of assessed quality across zones for all indicators, suggesting inconsistencies in the actual levels of care or the method for assessing quality across zones. The results for safety indicators, including antipsychotic use, restraints, falls , and pressure ulcers were also relatively consistent within zones ( Figure 32). However, assessed quality does differ across zones as well.

HQCA regularly conducts surveys of FBCC residents and their families on their perception of the quality of care delivered in FBCC sites . In these surveys, in gene ral, residents and families were satisfied with their facilities and staff. However, residents and families have expressed concerns about inadequate staffing levels . For LTC, family members rated the overall quality of care at their facilities at an averag e of 8.4 out of 10, and 93 per cent would recommend their facility to others82. For DSL, residents ' overall rating of their facility was 7.8 out of 10 (8.4 by family members). Ninety per cent of residents, and 94 per cent of family members would recommend their facilities to others (Figure 33)83,84. Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 74 Classification: Public Figure 33: Summary of HQ CA Family Experience Survey Results 3.7.1.1 Strengths Governance Alberta has had a long history of policy development and innovations in FBCC in Alberta, with the support of research and expert panels . Examples of these developments include the successful implementation of the recommendations of the Mirosh Report, A New Vision for Long -term Care, 1988 ; the Broda Report, Healthy Aging and New Directions for Care, 1999 ; and the Continuing Care Strategy, 2008 . Furthermore, there has been a wel l-established continuing care system with historical partnership amongst government, industry, and AHS. The consolidation of the planning and delivery of health services into one single authority enables AHS to: Acquire equipment and supplies for the entir e health system, thus enabling economy of scale Transfer funding and resources from one service sector to another within AHS to address immediate demands Plan for the utili zation of spaces and the delivery of all health services from a provincial, regional , and/or zonal perspectives as necessary, with the ability to remove and transfer spaces across the province as needed The advantages of these strengths were evident in the acquisition of PPE and other pandemic -related equipment, and in the flexible manage ment of spaces and staff resources during the COVID -19 pandemic crisis. 908472857593 958673877894 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100Meeting Basic Needs (0 to 100)Providing Information and Encouraging Family Involvement (0 to 100)Food Rating (0 to 100)Kindness and Respect (0 to 100)Staffing, Care of Belongings and Environment (0 to 100)Propensity to Recommend (0 to 100) DSL Fam (2019) LTC (2017) Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 75 Classification: Public Ownership All three FBCC ownership types have been partners in the delivery of continuing care services since its inception. Outcome measures for each ownership type have been similar between 2015/16 to 2019/20. Each has its unique strengths and contributions to th e diversity, efficiency, and effectiveness of the Alberta continuing care system. It is beneficial for Alberta to have the continued contribution of these ownership types. Monitoring Alberta Health has a long history of creating tools and measurement indic ators and using them for monitoring care. Many advanced health information systems were initiated , e.g. Patient Portal, Connect Care, the Alberta Continuing Care Information System (ACCIS) automating the InterRAI suite of care planning tools, and the Finan cial Information Reporting and Management System (FIRMS). The expertise embodied in these initiatives w ill assist greatly in the monitoring of FBCC services. 3.7.1.2 Areas of Opportunity Governance With respect to FBCC, three ongoing governance issues have been ra ised by stakeholders including: The need for better role clarity between Alberta Health and AHS, especially with regards to monitoring and inspections . AHS fund s and administer s the entire continuing care system, and owns and operate s FBCC spaces . This is perceived as a conflict of interest as AHS is the owner, funder, auditor, and inspector of its own facilities. AHS ha s a direct clinical role in assessing the care needs and designing care plans for individual residents in all DSL facilities , which coe xists with its role as an overall funder, administrator, and inspector of continuing care services . o Since AHS is responsible for the overall management of FBCC , it is perceived as inappropriate for it to maintain the role of individual client assessment a nd care planning at the facility level. Public ownership of FBCC sites (by AHS ) AHS ownership should be continued as one of the three FBCC ownership types. Public facilities have unique strengths and contributions. They play a unique role in addressing th e needs of very complex cases, in providing restorative and sub -acute care, and in linking to acute care hospitals. In addition, some AHS rural facilities are very small and managed as combined facilities with acute care hospitals. It would be economically infeasible to operate a small FBCC site independent of acute hospitals in these circumstances. To avoid the perceived conflict of interest as described above, several actions need to be considered. There should be transparency that AHS -owned -and-operated FBCC sites are subject to the same funding policies as other FBCC operators. These AHS-owned FBCC sites should also provide independent financial statements apart from overall AHS operations. Using independent inspectors and Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 76 Classification: Public auditors (such as Alberta Healt h) should also be considered for monitoring AHS -owned -and-operated FBCC sites if it is felt that there is insufficient independence with the current Audit Team structure in AHS. Private Ownership of FBCC sites The Public Health and Emergency Measures Working Group of the CD Howe Institute researched the incidence of COVID -19 outbreaks in public and private -for-profit nursing homes. The study concluded that many factors could have significant effects on the severity of outbreaks. These factors included staffing levels, size and configuration of rooms, facility layout, and patient complexity. It recommended that \"all provincial governments should work to address the ongoing challenges in the residential care sector and seniors ' care more generally \"85. Desc riptive data provided by Alberta Health suggest that private -for-profit LTC/DSL facilities have a higher incidence of COVID -19 outbreaks than other ownership types . However, a higher incidence of outbreaks is largely correlated with rates of community tran smission near a facility and facility size and facility age which could explain the difference86. Finally, respondents to the 2018 LTC Family Experience and 2019 DSL Family Experience HQCA surveys provide similar care ratings for AHS, private -for profit, an d private -not-for-profit operators for LTC and DSL: The overall care rating was 8.6 for AHS facilities, 8.2 for private -for-profit facilities, and 8.2 for private -not-for-profit facilities on the 2018 LTC Family Experience survey The overall care rating wa s 8.5 for AHS facilities, 8.2 for private -for-profit facilities, and 8. 6 for private -not-for-profit facilities on the 2019 DSL Family Experience survey Given that the overall outcomes for private -for-profit facilities are similar to those of AHS and privat e not-for-profit facilities, Alberta should continue to utilize all three FBCC ownership types. Monitoring Alberta is facing many challenges related to monitoring FBCC services . Due to the impact of COVID -19 on FBCC, families and the public are asking for stronger monitoring, inspection , reporting, and enforcement measures. This trend is national in scope , not only in Alberta. Evaluative studies in other jurisdictions have cited monitoring, enforcement, com pliance and reporting as important factors for improving quality of care in LTC (e.g. Ontario COVID -19 Commission I nterim Re ports87,88, Commonwealth Fund Report89). Operators are requesting for more coordinated auditing and monitoring to reduce the administra tive demands associated with inspections and allow more time for nurses to provide resident care . Operators are in support of unannounced visits to ensure transparency of the system. One strategy to address the se challenges is for all monitoring agencies to meet and coordinate their monitoring methodology and schedules to eliminate duplicate efforts. A coordinated team visit may in fact improve the data obtained for the inspection. This approach would not take away the op tion of Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 77 Classification: Public each individual agency being able to conduct their own inspection, unannounced visits, or in -depth review s in special circumstances . 3.7.2 What We Heard 3.7.2.1 Expert Panel The Expert Panel members reported that monitoring and accountability for FBCC could be improved through: Coordinated and combined audits from AHS and Alberta Health to reduce duplication and administrative burden for site operators o The effectiveness of unannounced audits should be examined Monitoring and accountability should focus on outcomes -based measures rather than task - based measures Audits should be publicly available and easy to find in one place/simple to navigate in order to hold operators more accountable and to enable the public to make informed decisions about their, or a family members ', care o Ensure that outcomes are reported in plain language to improve transparency Information sharing between different levels of the health system needs to be improved (i.e. patient information from acute care to FBCC facilities and lodges) 3.7.2.2 Surveys and Interviews/ Focus Groups Governance Respondents to the FBCC administrator and external organization surveys were asked to comment on the ideal role of each stakeholder in FBCC . A summary of the distribution of responses is provided in Figure 34. Most respondents see the role as A lberta Health as a policymaker and funder, with approximately 48 -50 per cent of respondents perceiving AHS having these same roles as well. Respondents also see an equal role for Alberta Health and AHS as auditors. FBCC operators and external organizations had different views on the role of AHS as an operator. The FBCC operators perceived that AHS should not be involved in operations, while external organizati ons perceived AHS should be involved in operations of facilities. Interview respondents felt there is a need for more clarity regarding the role of A lberta Health and AHS related to conducting FBCC audits. It was also felt that there is role for AHS in op erator FBCC sites, as they provide care to complex high needs residents as well as residents in more rural settings that otherwise might not receive services. However, it was also felt that AHS should not audit its own facility operations, and these facili ties should be audited by an independent party.

The are varying views amongst different stakeholder regarding the effectiveness of private -for-profit operators as well as AHS as an operator. The following is a summary of those views: Multiple stakeholder groups perceive that the quality of care provided by private -for-profit facilities is lower than facilities run by AHS and private -not-for profit operators AHS is perceived by some to have higher operating costs than private -for-profit and private not-for profit operators, as well as an unfair advantage of subsidizing FBCC costs on top of funded levels to pay staff higher wages and benefits There were some respondents that commented that they would like to see all three FBCC ownership types (AHS, private -for-profit and private not -for profit ) continue to be funded in the future Current System for Monitoring FBCC Ser vices Over 60 per cent of respondents to the FBCC administrator survey either completely agreed or somewhat agreed that the current system for monitoring the quality of FBCC accommodation services was effective; and over 50 per cent agreed or somewhat agre ed that the current system for monitoring the quality of health services was effective. In contrast, over 60 per cent respondents to the external organization survey either completely disagreed or somewhat disagreed that the current monitoring systems for accommodations and health services was effective. One key area for improvement identified by respondents to the surveys and interviews/group interviews was the need to better coordinate audits by Alberta Health and AHS to reduce duplication. This observat ion was noted by operators as well as representatives from associations, Alberta Health and Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 79 Classification: Public AHS. Operators found the duplication to be time -consuming and to take time away from nursing staff that could be better utilized providing care to FBCC residents. I n addition, it was identified that there are inconsistencies between Alberta Health and AHS staff conducting the audits on what passes and what fails, which creates confusion for operators. Some respondents did indicate that Alberta Health and AHS had impr oved the coordination of audits during the COVID -19 pandemic, and that this could be carried forward to improving the coordination of audits for the future. Survey and interview respondents also identified a need for improving role clarity for audits betw een Alberta Health and AHS. A wide variety of opinions were provided with this regard, with no agreed - upon option, including: Have A lberta Health conduct the audits related to health services and accommodations, and AHS focus on assisting sites with implementing quality improvement efforts to address audit results Have AHS focus on the health services audits, and A lberta Health focus on the accomm odation audits Have a separate party (i.e. separate from AHS) audit AHS operated sites o Although AHS has worked on creating distance between its audit function and FBCC site operations, multiple stakeholder groups perceived there still to be a conflict of interest to have AHS audit their own sites Consolidate the audit function completely under one entity, including the possibility of creating a new entity for this purpose In addition to reducing duplication, the following improvements to FBCC monitoring an d compliance were identified by interview and survey respondents: Shift the focus of compliance audits from tasks and processes to more of a focus of outcomes and resident quality of life o Some operator associations note that Accreditation Canada audits hav e a greater focus on quality of life than A lberta Health /AHS audits Have a consolidated system level audit for sites, rather than separate functionally orientated audits o For example, operators found there to be repetitiveness between health s ervices and accommodation audits Shift the focus of compliance audits from being punitive in nature to supporting quality improvement at sites Better coordinate unannounced audits by A lberta Health /AHS o Unannounced audits were perceived to be effective, and should con tinue Improve training for auditors to ensure audits are completed more consistently Increase the transparency of audit results to the public Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 80 Classification: Public 3.7.3 Policy Direction and Recommendations Based on the findings articulated above, four recommendations were developed : Policy Direction 8: Consolidate monitoring pro cesses and improve the coordination of inspections, while enhancing accountability and public reporting. Recommendation 2 6: Develop and implement a more coordinated and integrat ed system of monitoring where oversight bodies consolidate and integrate their efforts where possible when inspecting FBCC sites. Recommendation 27: Enhance the evaluation of, and public reporting on, the performance of all ownership types in FBCC. Recommendation 2 8: Enhance enforcement procedures for facilities violating government regulations, standards, and/or public health orders. Recommendation 29: Introduce added transparency for the funding and reporting of AHS owned and operated FBCC sites by requiring independent audited site-specific financial statements for its FBCC operations, as is required of other FBCC operators. Additional details regarding these recommendations can be found in Section 4.2.8 below. 3.8 Technology and Innovation 3.8.1 Current Context 3.8.1.1 Strengths The current implementation of MyHealth Records and ConnectCare systems are good examples of digital transformations of the health system in Alberta. ConnectCare is a common provincial clinical information system that is currently in the process of being imp lemented by AHS. It is expected that the implementation of ConnectCare in FBCC sites will start in 2022 and end in 2023. 3.8.1.2 Areas of Improvement In addition to digitizing clinical information, the digitization of information for continuing care c ould include facility features (e.g. programs and services), and inspection results including any violations for FBCC sites. This information w ould allow users to review FBCC sites and make their own choice of which is suitable for themselves or their loved one s. Some FBCC operators are exploring the use of innovative technologies to improve resident quality or care and quality of life as well as to improve the workplace for staff. Examples of technologies include using assistive technology for vital sign s and m edication monitoring, and electronic charting. However, the implementation of innovative technologies in the delivery of FBCC services is currently not funded by PCBF, which limits the ability of FBCC operators to implement technology in providing services . The importance of technology in all aspects of FBCC should be recognized in planning for future continuing care services. Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 81 Classification: Public 3.8.2 Leading Practices/Other Jurisdictional Research In February of 2021, the McMaster Health Forum developed an Evidence Brief that mo bilized both global and local research evidence to support and inform deliberations for improving LTC homes in Canada through the use of technology90. This Evidence Brief also provided several system -level factors that made it historically difficult to iden tify and harness the potential of technology in LTC settings as well as three elements that may address these challenges. It was noted that the COVID -19 pandemic created a catalyst for change and a directed a sharp focus on LTC home residents who were dis proportionately and negatively impacted by the infectious disease. This led to the development of several recommendations for strengthening the sector including the use of technology for helping address fundamental problems in LTC and ultimately optimize p hysical health and well -being, as well as improv ing communications (e.g., via remote visits with health care teams and caregivers, family and friends, etc.) through: Interdisciplinary and inter -facility communication (e.g., electronic health record systems ) Safety monitoring (e.g., location tracking or GPS for wandering residents, health monitors, emergency response, and monitoring usage of appliances) Touchless hardware and voice activated devices (e.g., asking \"Google \" or \"Alexa \" to call the nurse and/or front desk staff; and activate features in rooms such as lights, blinds, heating and air-conditioning , ventilation, and entertainment) Artificial intelligence which can support implementation and enhance functionality and usability The adoption of specific technologies needs to be done with respect to enhancing person -centered approaches for residents , caregivers, and family and friends, rather than only for enhancing efficiency and cost reduction, which can lead to de -personalized care and potentially exac erbating many of the fundamental issues that are present in LTC (i.e., using technology as a substitute for human interaction as opposed to using it to free up staff to have more interaction with residents). There are a tremendous number of new advancements and technologies targeted towards LTC. Figure 35 articulates 14 different types/groupings of technologies that could be further developed and implemented in LTC. Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 82 Classification: Public Figure 35: Taxonomy of Technologies in LTC Homes 3.8.3 Policy Direction and Recommendations Based on the findings articulated above, one recommendation was developed . Policy Direction 9: Optimize the use of technology, research, and innovation in transform ing FBCC Recommendation 30: Develop and implement a \"Research, Innovation and Technology Strategy for Continuing Care \" in Alberta Details regarding this recommendatio n can be found in Section 4.2.9. Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 83 Classification: Public 3.9 Sustainability and Affordability 3.9.1 Current Context In 2019/20, Alberta spent $1.8 billion on funding FBCC services, or an average of $66,251 per person. This lower than the average cost of $80,873 per person for LTC in BC91, and 68,286 per person for LTC in Ontario92. Care Funding for LTC Facilities All LTC facilities in Alberta are funded by AHS through the Patient Care Based Funding (PCBF) system. PCBF consists of three components : a variable component, a fixed component, and a quality incentive component. The variable component provide s funding for nursin g, personal care, and therapy hours. PCBF assesse s the worked hours and paid hours for a facility based on its Case -Mix as measured by the RUG -III system using the InterRAI suite of tools. Care staffing percentage s are determined by PCBF , and the hourly pa id rates for care staff are determined by AHS based on the average wage of care staff working in LTC . Some operators report that the average wage rates paid by AHS are higher than the funded rates which they have to pay their employees. Some operators also perceive that the PCBF rates do not cover fringe benefits and pension benefits93. Other variable component items include site -specific adjusted Care Related Supplies (CRS), and the client turnover costs . The f ixed component includes resident care management (funding for the Director of Nursing, Nursing Administration, therapeutic administration, Medical Director etc. ), and care related administration (funding for In-Service Education, General Administration, Contracting of General Administration, an d Management Fee s). The cost per space for these services are set by AHS annually. Some operators perceive that wage rates set by PCBF for these positions do not match the actual market rates. There is also a quality incentive component that provides a small percentage of funding used to reward operators with good performance as measured by quality indicators. This component has a separate funding pool. PCBF has taken the philosophy that it is a n \"allocation model \" and distributes funds from a finite pool of funding. \"PCBF does not control the overall amount of provincial funding to be applied; rather, it is an allocation methodology used to determine the most optimal distribution of such funding \" 94. As shown in Section 3.4.1, the average worked hour s funded by PCBF for nursing and personal care are 3.02, which translates to 3.67 paid hours for 100 CMI. This funded number of care hours has not increased since 2014/15 . During this same period, the level of acuity of LTC residents has increased . The CHAA showed that the actual CMI for the not -for-profit operators they represent has increased from 102.3 in 2010/11 to 108.6 in 2019/20 ( Figure 15). These findings are consistent with system wide CMI data provided by AHS which demonstrate an increase in the number of resident days in RUG -III categories with higher CMI ratings (categories 1, 2 and 3) between 2015 to 2019, and decreases in the number of resident days in RUG -III categories with lower CMI ratings (categories 4, 5 and 6, Figure 16). The average length of stay in LTC facilities has also decreased (Figure 17 in Section 3.4.1), suggesting that residents Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 84 Classification: Public are being admitted closer to their last years of life with higher acuity, thereby requiring more complex and intensive care. The level of funding for care hour s for LTC through PCBF is a concern to operators, staff, and residents . The need to increase staffing hours in FBCC was a major theme identified from stakeholder engagement (Section 3.4.2.2 ). Accordingly, options for increasing direct hours of care for LTC have been considered in this report (Section 3.4.1.1 and Recommendation # 16). Operators and industry associations ha ve submitted numerous briefs raising concerns about the PCBF funding system. Some examples of these submissions are: Letter by Alberta Continuing Care Association on Continuing Care Review, funding models, May, 2020 ; and a b rief submitted by the Christian Health Association of Alberta on the Economic and Operational Impact of Patient Care Based Funding on Not -for-Profit (Voluntary ) Operators of LTC Spaces, January 2021. Concerns include : Insufficient staffing hours pr ovided to match the acuity increase of residents Lack of flexibility in the accountability measures of the funding system Adverse impacts of the funded average wage rates on some operator types Lack of responsiveness of the funding system to the needs of s maller facilities Care Funding for DSL Currently in Alberta , there is no standard funding methodology for DSL. AHS Zones fund DSL based on historical experience or negotiation with individual facilities . AHS intend s to replace the existing methods of fund ing DSL with the PCBF funding model in the future , but many operators ha ve indicated that this change should not happen until the weaknesses of PCBF are addressed . Like LTC, a key area of concern of DSL operators, staff and residents is the need to increase the funded level of direct care hours. Accordingly, options for increasing direct hours of care for DSL have also been considered in this report (Section 3.4.1.1 and Recommendation #1 6). Accommodation Fees FBCC residents pay for their room and board expenses in the form of an accommodation fee. This fee ranges fro m $69.70 a day for a private room ($2,120 per month) , to $60.30 a day for a semi -private room ($1,834 per month) , and $57.30 a day ($1,743 per month) for a standard room (as of January 2021). The average accommodation fee in Alberta increases annually base d on the core inflation rate in Alberta. Alberta uses a different approach than other provinces for charging accommodation fees to residents . Most provinces adopt an income test for their accommodation charge with a minimum and maximum payment. Their accommodation charges are set at a much higher rate than those in Alberta . Alberta uses a flat rate accommodation charge for all residents and is the only jurisdiction in Canada that does not use a formal income test to set the accommodation fee for resid ents. However, Alberta Seniors and Housing does conduct an income testing process to identify residents who require a subsidy to pay for their accommodation fee. In 2019/20, a total of 13,296 FBCC residents received the S upplementary Accommodation Benefit (SAB) from Alberta Seniors and Housing, resulting in total payments of $86 million. The number of SAB Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 85 Classification: Public recipients has continued to increase annually since 2015/16, which had 11,958 recipients and total of $72 million. Currently, Alberta has the highest av erage actual FBCC accommodation fee in Canada (Figure 36). However, the maximum accommodation fee charged in Alberta is one of the lowest in Canada . Figure 36: Average and Maximum Accommodation Charge Across Canada Operators have expressed concern that the current accommodation fee structure does not cover the full cost of room and board for residents, nor the costs of maintenance, up grades, and regeneration. In addition, the current accommodation funding structure for FBCC does not include a stream of funding to cover the debt -service costs associated with the replacement of aged facilities and developing new FBCC spaces. As seen belo w, the current accommodation fee margins for DSL operators is higher than that of LTC operators, and there are LTC operators that need to subsidize their accommodation operations with other sources of funding. Financial Performance Trends LTC Operators Over the last five years (2015/16 to 2019/20), the total operating margin for many LTC operators ( except for AHS facilities) has improved slightly by 1 to 2 per cent . The increase was driven by very small increases in the care margin and larger increases in the accommodation fee margin, especially for private -for-profit and private not -for-profit operators ( Figure 37). This suggests that the current approach to increasing accommodations fees in Alberta has been improving accommodation margin s for LTC operators. However, the accommodation margin for private not -for-profit operators remains negative, and the current accom modation margin for all LTC operators is not sufficient to cover debt - service costs for capital replacement/development . Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 86 Classification: Public Figure 37: Trends in Operating Margins for LTC Operators, 2015/16 to 2019/20 DSL Operators Over the last five years (2015/16 to 2019/20), the total operating margin for DSL operators has decreased slightly by 1 to 5 per cent (Figure 38). The decrease was driven by decreases in care margins for private -for-profit and private not -for-profit operators, with the care margin for private not -for-profit operators reaching -4 per ce nt in 2019/20. However, in contrast to LTC operators, the accommodation fee margin for private -for-profit and private not -for-profit operators ranges from 19 - 27 per cent and is sufficient to cover debt -service costs for capital replacement/development. Another difference reported by DSL operators is the requirement to pay property taxes (which are included in the accommodation margins) , which is currently not charged to LTC operators because they are tax exempt.

For example, m edication and all health care service costs are covered for LTC residents . However, DSL r esidents must pay for additional expenses such as co -payments for pharmaceuticals , medical supplie s and equipment, incontinence supplies, and ambulance transfers. It has been reported anecdotally that some individuals had to move from DSL to LTC facilities as they could not afford the additional costs associated with DSL. This inequity creates an incentive to seek LTC instead of DSL and should be removed to create a n equitable system to ensure that the right services can be provided to the right people at the right time.

Many of these spaces are shared accommodations in LTC facilities. There are also an additional 720 shared acc ommodation spaces that require replacement in facilities less than 30 years of age. The cost of developing a FBCC space varies significantly by ownership type as follows: AHS/public facility - $575,000 per space Private not -for-profit: $337,400 per space Private -for-profit: $250,000 per space The total estimated cost to redevelop these FBCC spaces is approximately $3. 2 billion (in 2020 dollars), based on the current ownership structure of these spaces. The allocation of these development costs between the Government of Alberta and operators will be dependent on the structure of capital grant programs moving forward (see below). Capital Funding Considerations Alberta Health has provided capital funding for FBCC spaces through capital grants . However, fundi ng is limited and is only available through a competitive Request for Grants (RFG) process for the development of new FBCC spaces. Thus, some operators may struggle to upgrade old facilities if they cannot access this funding. The average level of funding for successful grant applications has been the same to develop new LTC and DSL spaces. The average levels of funding awarded include : 39 per cent of the development cost per FBCC space for private not -for-profit operators 28 per cent of the development cos t per FBCC space for private -for-profit operators Given the current challenges for LTC operators related to funding capital replacement and development projects through debt-financing , combined with the pressing need to replace aging FBCC infrastructure (many of which are in LTC) over the next 10 year s, it is recommended that an approach that encourages owners/operators of aging/obsolete facilities to replace or upgrade their buildings to meet current design requirements be developed. The approach should be competitive while at the same time acknowledging the relationship that has existed with the community and AHS in the operation of their facility. A process can be developed to approach current operators/owners to determine the future of their facilities. If an affirmative and competitive response is not provided by the operator/owner , then an RFG can be initiated to replace the specific facility in a community. 3.9.1.1 Strengths There is general support for the principle of funding by case -mixes in Alberta through PCBF . The support is for the principle that care hours should match the care needs of the residents. The Alberta Auditor General 's audit report on seniors ' care in 2014 also supported the use of the case-mix funding approach . Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 89 Classification: Public Although there are concerns with the current funding model for FBCC , operators are still interested in service contracts for providing care, even if they are responsible for paying for capital development costs on their own. 3.9.1.2 Areas of Opportunity Care Funding Model Ensuring that the funding system for FBCC compensates facilities properly for delivering the right kind of care to residents based on their needs will be important moving forward . The funding system should be fair, equitable, and transparent to operators as well as residents and families. Considering the concerns expressed about PCBF, Alberta Health should consider a thorough assessment of the underlying assumptions/principles/objectives, and associated impacts of the funding model . Growing Demand for Continuing Car e Services A key challenge related to sustainability will be the ability to meet the growing demand for all continuing care services in the future . Based on data provided by AHS, the demand for continuing care services in 2020, including LTC, DSL (3, 4 and 4D), and long -term home care (LTHC) services was 69,732 spaces ( Figure 39). Currently, LTC accounts for 22 per cent of continuing care spaces, DSL accounts for 17 p er cent of continuing care spaces, and LTHC accounts for 61 per cent of continuing care spaces. The cost per day for services is highest in LTC, followed by DSL4D, DSL4, DSL3 and LTHC. Figure 39: Current Distribution of Continuing Care Services Continuing Care Service Current Capacity Per Cent of Current Capacity Cost per Space per Day Projected Capacity in 2030 (based on current distribution of services Future Proposed Model for 2030 (Increase LTHC) Per Cent Capacity of Proposed Model in 2030 LTC 14,076 20.2 per cent $202.46 per cent $272.11 2,574 1,589 1.4 DSL4D 3,500 5.0 per cent $159.29 5,670 5,648 5.0 per cent DSL4 6,840 9.8 $146.73 11,080 10,912 9.7 DSL3 1,513 69,732 112,960 112,960 By 2030, the demand for continuing care services is expected to grow to 112,960 spaces (does not include ALC spaces). If Alberta were to continue to meet future demand with the same distribution of 5 Includes approximately 80 programs with specialized care, which are different th at basic LTC services. Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 90 Classification: Public services, there would be a need for 9,711 additional LTC spaces, 7,348 additional DSL spaces, and 26,169 additional LTHC ''spaces ''. The a nnual operating cost for continuing care services is projected to be $4.2 billion by 2030 under this current model, an increase of $1.8 billion. In addition, the total capital costs to develop an additional 17,059 FBCC spaces is estimated to be $4.9 billio n (Appendix 2). The challenge facing Alberta is to choose a continuing care model to meet future demand that maintain s sustainability while at the same time meeting the needs of Alberta ns. Based on the findings of this Review, a continuing care model tha t increases the proportion of services provided in the community and reduces the proportion of services in FBCC, would both improve quality of life for residents, while at the same time, reducing annual cost increases moving forward, thereby improving the sustainability of the system. This model would also reduce the need to build new LTC capacity and focus capital investment on replacing existing aged infrastructure and new DSL spaces, further improving sustainability. Shifting the allocation of continuin g care services in 2030, such that 13.9 per cent of demand is met by LTC, 16.1 per cent by DSL, and 70 per cent by LTHC, could result in annual operating cost savings of $452 million per year, and cumulative capital cost savings of $ 1.7 billion ( Figure 40 and Appendix 2). Further, if the direct hours of care are increased in the new model as proposed in Recommendation 1 6, the total annual cost increase for the new model compared to the current model (with no direct hours of care increase) is $46 million . Accordingly, shifting the allocation of services in 2030 covers most of the cost increase of $498 million associated with increasing direct hours of care. Figure 40: Summary of Cost Implications of New Model Current Model Proposed Model Cost Difference (Proposed - Current) Projected Cost of Providing Continuing Care Services in 2030 $4,207,017,382 $3,755,435 ,827 -$451,581,555 Projected Cost of Increasing Direct Hours of Care in 2030 $0 $497,512,375 $497,512,375 Total Annual Operating Costs $3,262,161,278 -$1,661,490,574 Zero-Capital Options for Capital Replacement Another option for the redevelopment of aged FBCC infrastructure is to use and convert existing private operated living spaces into FBCC spaces. Recently, AHS issued an expression of interest to gauge interest in this option and received many responses from facilities to convert some of their spaces into FBCC spaces at no cost to the Government of Alberta. Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 91 Classification: Public 3.9.2 What We Heard 3.9.2.1 Expert Panels The Expert Panel reported that the funding for FBCC and continuing care services more broadly could be improved through the following approaches: Shifting the focus from providing care to Albertans in FBCC facilities to enhancing continuing care options in the community to allow individuals to remain in the home/community longer o There is a preference for Albertans to receive care in their own homes/communities versus in a facility o There is a need to enhance caregiver supports to support this shift o There is a need to increase health and social service supports in the community o Consider the us e of mobile diagnostic services and paramedics to keep people in the community longer o Increase choices of service and accommodation options for seniors and pe ople with disabilities Have more living options in one location such as continuing care campus developments to keep couples and loved ones together as long as possible Ensuring equity regarding the types of care costs covered by government in each level of continuing care, so that residents choose where they want to live and receive services based o n personal preference rather than affordability and cost considerations o Individuals should not be choosing LTC over DSL or home care because the costs of pharmaceuticals are fully covered only in LTC o Define what services will be covered by Government for all Albertans receiving continu ing care services Increasing the use of self -directed care options for home care and supportive living o Implement income testing to ensure sustainability of this option o Targeted care options through self -directed care will p rovide individuals more choices to receive services in the community longer o Provide oversight for self -directed care to ensure the quality of services provided, and the proper use of public funds o Support self -directed care with a strong assessment process, to ensure users receive the appropriate level of funding Focusing capital infrastructure investments to support a shift towards increasing care in the community versus in a facility o Focus on replacing older LTC spaces versus building new capacity o Elimina ting shared accommodations in FBCC o Developing smaller congregate facilities located in communities/campuses of care Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 92 Classification: Public o Balance the need of having accommodation fees appropriately support capital development/maintenance versus maintain an affordable cost of l iving for FBCC residents Continue to support all Albertans who cannot afford the accommodation fee schedule for FBCC, to ensure equity across the system o Provide a funding and capital grant structure that attracts private investors while maintaining a high quality of care/life for FBCC residents Consider development models that incorporate life leases 3.9.2.2 Surveys and Interviews/Focus Groups Operational Costs Overall, 46.7 per cent of respondents to the FBCC administrator and 54.7 per cent respondents to external organization surveys perceived that the current level of revenue received by continuing care facilities was insufficient to provide appropriate care and services to residents. Only 19.4 per cent of FBCC administrator respondents an d 6.8 per cent of external organization respondents perceived the current level of revenue as being enough. According to survey respondents, the five areas where revenue is the most insufficient include direct care HCA, direct care nursing, equipment upgra des, therapeutic services, and meal services ( Figure 41). Figure 41: Perceived Areas of Operation That Revenue is Insufficient Survey and int erview respondents provided the following opportunities for improving funding for FBCC services: 8.28.87.64.37.47.16.96.27.18.9 8.69.08.35.77.77.96.95.37.18.1 0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 MaintenanceEquipment Upgrades Scale of 0 (no increase) to 10 (increase needed)What Areas is Revenue Insufficient External Organizations FBCC Admin Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 93 Classification: Public Improve funding and supports for expanding home care services so that seniors and pe ople with disabilities can receive care at home or in the community longer Allow for more flexibility in the FBCC funding model to shift staff requirements based on the needs of the resident Have equity across all continuing care streams with respect to what is funded by government and what the client/resident is responsible for o Review the damage deposit rules for DSL versus LTC Have equity across LTC and DSL for the payment of property taxes Increase accommodation fees so that providers don 't have to subsidize accommodation costs with care funding Improve funding for supporting E lders in Indigenous communities Review the effectiveness of the current P CBF funding model o Examine if an outcome -based funding model could be introduced o There is a need for a comprehensive funding model that optimizes services based on resident need o Look into implementing the RUG -III plus methodology o Improve the consistency of case management and assessments o Include funding for medical leadership to have a medical director and clearly defined roles and responsibilities for this position o Funding needs to re flect the true acuity level of residents, to ensure their needs are being met Enhance the use of self-directed care models to support client choice Accommodation Fee Increases All survey respondents were asked their opinion about increasing accommodation fees to better fund facility upgrades and replacement. As seen below ( Figure 42), the leve l of support for increasing accommodation fees ranged from 1.7 to 4.4 out of 10, demonstrating very little support for increasing accommodation fees at this time . Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 94 Classification: Public Figure 42: Level of Support for Increasing Accommodation Fees Overall, many respondents reported that they felt the level of accommodation fees was high already, and that capital upgrades should be covered by the government or FBCC owners. Capital Upgrades Respondents to the surveys and interviews identified the fo llowing capital upgrade opportunities to improve FBCC: Replace or update aging infrastructure and equipment, and eliminate all shared accommodations in FBCC facilities o Bathrooms at some sites need to be renovated and made larger o Ensure that all rooms have closet space o Improve ventilation systems in older facilities o Upgrade furniture in common areas and bedrooms o Ensure that all rooms have adequate lifts Develop more flexible living options for residents such as: o Smaller facilities o Develop campuses/communiti es to accommodate multiple level of care at one site Develop spaces that allow couples and loved ones to stay together Improve financial support for operators to fund the cost of capital upgrades/development through increasing accommodation fees, or enhanc ing capital grant funding Enhance technological equipment and internet connectivity 1.92.73.23.63.12.94.41.71.9 0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 7.0 8.0 9.0 10.0PublicExternal OrganizationsFBCC Staff All OtherFBCC Staff - HCAFBCC Staff - Prof TherapyFBCC Staff - NursesFBCC Staff - AdministratorsFamilies/CaregiversResidents Average Rating (0 -10)Stakeholder GroupIncrease Accomodation Fees Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 95 Classification: Public 3.9.3 Leading Practices/Other Jurisdictional Research Many other countries in the world have an older population than Alberta. The province can learn from these countries on w ays of developing a continuing care system that is sustainable and can provide high quality care. Denmark has been widely recognized as a leader in the care for its elderly population and is often cited by experts as a model of elder care. In the 1980s, D enmark faced demographic trends not unlike those facing Canada today with increasing numbers of elderly people and a declining work force. At that time, Denmark relied heavily on an institutional system of care. About 29 per cent of the elderly population were receiving some form of LTC, and 19 per cent were receiving home help. In the early 1980s, Denmark 's national government took a policy direction of expanding 24 -hour home care services as an alternative to LTC homes. Services included home help (e.g. assistance with domestic tasks such as housecleaning) as well as nursing care. After -hours service for acute needs was provided in addition to regularly scheduled visits. In 1988, legislation was passed limiting the construction of new LTC homes, and the remaining LTC homes were converted to housing units with single -occupancy rooms only. New housing for elders were constructed, where everyone must have at least one bedroom, sitting room, kitchen, and bath. Individuals pay for housing and the government pa ys for the necessary health and social services, regardless of the setting in which care is received. Some converted LTC homes became hubs for community support services that include a senior cent re, day care, rehabilitation, 24 -hour home care, and assiste d living. Between 1985 and 1997, the number of LTC beds in Denmark decreased by 30 per cent . This reduction was accompanied by an increase in adapted dwellings for elders and in the use of home help. Between 1985 and 1998, the number of sheltered housing and other adapted dwellings in Denmark increased by 331 per cent , and the proportion of people aged 67 and older receiving home help increased from 19 to 25 per cent . The number of people receiving 13 or more hours of home care per week increased by 196 per cent , reflecting the greater level of need in the community due to the shift in housing policy. This shift in policy resulted in the total LTC expenditures as a percentage of the Danish GDP decreasing from 2.4 to 2.2 per cent 95. Value for Money in Long Term Care Value for Money in LTC, as outlined in 2011 by Colombo96, relates to a) cost efficiency (maximizing output ) and b) cost -effectiveness (maximizing outcomes ) for a given amount of resources . At the time of this study, it was suggested that many Organization of Economic Co -operation and Development (OECD ) countries d id not have operational concepts, measures , or indicators of efficiency in LTC systems. As such, there was little ability to evaluat e the impact of such policies , making it difficult t o determine or improve value in LTC. That said, the following is a summarized list of what OECD countries were doing under the broad umbrella of policies to improve efficiency in LTC: Important measures to improve efficiency in LTC have focused on 3 main a reas: o Choice of settings - Nearly all OECD countries have been encouraging \"Aging in Place \" policies (as opposed to institutional care). In 2008, 60 per cent of total LTC costs were Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 96 Classification: Public spent on institutional care which is disproportionate to the number of those that received institutional care (only 3/10) in OECD countries. o Incentives facing providers (payment mechanisms and incentives for provider competition) : Linking payments to quality and efficiency in \"pay for performance \" funding schemes. Little data was available at the time of the report regarding effectiveness . Some evaluations in Iowa indicate improvements in resident satisfaction, employee retention rates, and nursing hours. Providing users with choice over the carer they prefer can stimulate competition and encourage providers to deliver better care/at a lower cost. For example, the use of vouchers for LTC in Nordic countries enabl ed users to choose the provider that best meets their needs, leading to higher user satisfaction, and improvements in quality and cost effectiveness. However, higher administration costs are associated with implementing a voucher system which can be reduced with technology. o Impact of technology and productivity. Technological solutions could assist in reducing the workload and stress of carers and improve work co -ordination, allowing carers to allocate their time more effectively. Key measures aimed at impro ving efficiency at the \"interface \" between LTC/health care include: o Incentives for appropriate use of LTC vis -\u00e0-vis acute care settings . In order to prevent misuse or inappropriate referrals to acute care, some countries implement Health system support mea sures (e.g. higher involvement of primary care providers/GPs in placement) , incorporate financial measures to limit acute care services use for LTC (e.g., Ireland imposes additional charges for those who remain in acute hospitals when their acute care phas e is over) , make changes in administrative responsibilities for care (e.g. In Sweden a new act transferred the responsibilities for LTC to municipalities who became financial ly responsible for older people remaining in hospitals) , and the use of Informatio n and comm unications technology (e.g. using electronic transfer sheets or referrals) . o Health y aging and prevention to reduce cost s in LTC systems by reduc ing potential dependence later in life through lifelong health promotion. 3.9.4 Policy Direction and Recommendations Based on the findings articulated above related to funding, the following five recommendations were developed. Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 97 Classification: Public Policy Direction 12: Ensure sustainability and affordability for the future of continuing care. Recommendation 3 1: Focus gover nment capital investments on the regeneration or replacement of existing FBCC spaces, with some funding ear -marked for the development of new spaces where needed . Recommendation 3 2: Continue to increase accommodation fees for FBCC annually and provide flexibility to increase fees beyond the core inflation rate for Alberta if required. Recommendation 3 3: Evaluate the PCBF funding model, its underlying assumptions / principles / objectives, and associated impacts on FBCC. Recommendation 34: Examine methods for funding the operation of smaller homes to facilitate their implementation. Recommendation 35: Review and standardize t he types of fees and charges in all streams of continuing care, including long -term care, designated supportive living, and ho me care , to improve consistency and equity. Details regarding these recommendations are provided in Section 4.2.10 . 3.10 COVID-19 Responses and Learnings 3.10.1 Current Context The COVID -19 pandemic is one of the most impactful events that has happened in LTC in Canada. The CIHI report shows that Canada has the highest proportion of deaths from COVID -19 in LTC settings among 14 OECD countries. Eighty -one per cent of Canada 's COVID -19 deaths have been in LTC, compared with an average of 42 per cent in other OECD countries.97 The first COVID -19 outbreak at a conti nuing care site in Alberta was recorded on March 11, 2020. The number of COVID -19 cases in Alberta FBCC sites during the first wave of COVID placed Alberta in the middle of the pack when compared with other provinces. However, in the second wave, the numb er of COVID -19 cases and outbreaks in FBCC sites increased substantially. Figure 43 shows the number of COVID -19 outbreaks and deaths in Alberta FBCC sites as of September 2020 ( \"first wave \"), as per data provided by A lberta Health . Figure 44 shows data tracked by CIHI for wave 1 and wave 2 of COVID -1998.

Below is a record of some of the actions taken by Alberta Health and AHS during this period. Communication A one -page information sheet on COVID -19 was dist ributed to operators on February 24, 2020 before any confirmed cases were found in Alberta A coordinated communication approach was rolled out , and b y April 2020, about 95 per cent of congregate living operators, with a total of 1 ,600 sites province -wide ( seniors lodges, adult group homes, FBCC sites) were contacted by AHS Safe Healthy Environments Alberta Health and AHS maintained regular contact with representatives of the four main associations representing FBCC operators Seven webinars and town halls were held with thousands of Albertans in attendance to answer questions and gather input from operators and families regarding the interpretation of Public Health Orders affecting FBCC sites Workforce Workforce supply became the most important issue to be ad dressed , especially during outbreaks o Some facilities reported that staffing decreased between 20 to 50 per cent in the first 24 hours after an outbreak Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 99 Classification: Public Additional staff time was required to rearrang e meal schedules for residents in smaller groups and for those in isolation and quarantine, to clean and sanitiz e the facilities, and to communicat e with family members Increased funding was provided by A lberta Health for $2 hourly wage top -up for HCAs , for increased HCA staffing levels, and for 1 ,000 paid student practicum positions Additional funding was provided by A lberta Health for increased worked hours by FBCC staff FBCC staff were provided with a one -time payment of $1,200 through the Critical Worker Benefit The single -site staffing policy was implemented by Chief Medical Officer of Health Order 10 - 2020. Prior to COVID -19, 72 per cent of HCAs and 7 6 per cent of RNs worked part time or casual hours and many work ed at multiple sites due to the lack of f ull-time positions in many facilities A new data system was developed to collect staffing payroll data to support the single -site staffing policy After implementation of the new policy, 95 per cent of the workforce was limited to working at a single site The scope of practice for Nurse Practitioners and other professionals in LTC w as expanded AHS contracted a central hiring agency to recruit, train and deploy (according to provincial priority needs) Comfort Care Aides, a new pandemic -specific role developed to address workforce shortages arising from the pandemic AHS also provided staffing support on site to facilities with outbreak s if such assistance was necessary Infection prevention and control (IPC) IPC measures have always existed in the CCHSS , and since late March 2020, Alberta 's Chief Medical Officer of Health issued additional guidelines and expectations to support continuin g care operators in their defence against the introduction and spread of COVID -19 in their facilities including : o Screening for staff, residents, d esignated family /support people and visitors o Isolation and quarantine protocols o Continuous masking Visitor restrictions, masking and IPC requirements, and changes to routine life and activities, had significant negative impacts, despite the need for these restrictions to protect the lives of those who were most vulnerable to infection and death. o The res trictions also had a greater impact on people living with dementia and other cognitive impairments (it is estimated that 80 per cent of LTC residents and 100 per cent of DSL4D residents live with dementia ) Shared rooms and shared bathrooms in older facil ities were a challenge for implementing isolation and quarantine measures Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 100 Classification: Public Where possible, facilities were encouraged to cohort infected residents and the staff serving them to prevent the spread of the disease Testing and contact tracing As of September 29, 2020, more than 1,350,800 tests for COVID -19 had been completed in Alberta, with 13,618 on-site tests in LTC and 8,688 on-site tests in DSL settings (this does not include staff or residents who may have been tested off -site) Testing is offered to all residents and staff at a site where a positive case has been identified, in an effort to identify and isolate any asymptomatic individuals who might be unknowingly infected Continuing care residents were offered tests upon admission and tr ansitions between settings (e.g. transfers from hospitals, etc .) Rapid COVID -19 testing was introduced in Alberta in November 2020 , piloted in some FBCC sites in December, and then expanded in February 2021 to a ll FBCC sites Personal protective equipment ( PPE) Alberta Health, AHS and facility staff monitored, reinforced, and trained /coached staff in the proper use of PPE A continuous masking policy was implemented on April 10, 2020 , when eye protection was introduced in continuing care PPE was and continues to be provided to all FBCC sites free of charge by Government of Alberta o Masks were also provided free of charge to all private facilities, home care agencies and Alberta residents during the period of the pandemic when the supply was limited in the private commercial market Alberta was the only province in Canada able to provide free masks to all its citizens during the period of short supply or non -availability commercially Visitor policy an d the role of families Family members are estimated to provide a significant portion of total care given to FBCC residents Initial visitor policies put in place to protect continuing care residents from COVID -19 (CMOH Order s 03-, 09-, and 14-2020), had uni ntended, negative impacts on residents ' mental and physical wellbeing and on the family caregivers who support them o Initial visitor policies limited the ability for families and support people to provide care to their residents at a time when more support would have been useful o This sudden reduction of family support s was detrimental for all FBCC residents, especially those living with dementia or at end of life The visitor policy was revised in July 2020 after extensive consultation with over 6,000 resid ents, families, operators, and staff, through town hall s and surveys Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 101 Classification: Public o The new CMOH Order 29 -2020 , effective July 23, 2020, moved from a restricted to a safe visiting approach , and the policy changed as follows: Two designated family/support people are to be supported per resident, no matter the reason Up to four social visitors are supported per resident outdoors ; and non- designated visitors are also supported indoors in extenuating circumstances (end of life, change in health status, pressing circumstance s) or in the case of indoor social visits, if the site 's risk tolerance assessment allows One major lesson from the COVID -19 pandemic is the essential role played by family members and support people in the care and support for FBCC residents o Family car egivers must be regarded as essential members of the care team in FBCC and should not be cut off from their contacts with their family members in care Impact on residents ' and family caregivers ' overall health and well -being The pandemic , and the policies put in place to combat it, have had many adverse effects on seniors and people with disabilities , whether they are living in FBCC , supportive housing settings, or at home alone , including physical and mental decline Family caregivers have also experienced increased stress and guilt and are mostly unaware of what is happening to their loved ones in FBCC In the summer of 2020, the Calgary Dementia Network published a report on the Impact of COVID -19 on Family Caregivers for Persons Living with Dementia99 and found that: o Family caregivers were \"overburdened \" in their caregiving responsibility, and many of the residents living with dementia had experienced a decline in their well -being and functionality because of pandemic -related restrictive measures o Family caregivers also expressed a great need for increasing support in their role as caregivers for their dementia family members in care o The report made three recommendations to the Government of Alberta: That consistent resources be made available to f amily caregivers so that they can deliver effective care That clear, correct, and concise information on public health protocols be communicated to family caregivers via multiple media sources That family caregivers be granted continued access to care re cipients, as these caregivers are considered as \"essential care partners \", and not just visitors Infrastructure Recent studies by Public Health Ontario, researchers from the University of Toronto, and key researchers from Ontario hospitals and Research Ins titutes100 indicate that residents living in overcrowded LTC facilities (e.g. homes with 2 - to 4-bed rooms, shared bathrooms) are twice as likely to die from COVID -19 than in other settings Infrastructure issues include shared rooms and bathrooms, the age of facilities , the number of spaces in a building, and the use of ineffective ventilation systems Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 102 Classification: Public Infrastructure guidelines should be modified for future new or regenerated FBCC sites based on lessons learn ed from the COVID -19 pandemic A plan needs to be dev eloped to regenerate older facilities to conform with new guidelines and meet public health expectations Oversight, monitoring and compliance The Ontario Long -Term Care COVID -19 Commission101 identified focused inspection, monitoring, and enforcement as important steps to stop the spread of COVID -19 in LTC facilities In normal practice, both AHS and Alberta Health have inspectors visit contracted FBCC sites to ensure that they follow the provin cial health and accommodation standards As a result of the pandemic, some Alberta Health licensing inspectors and health compliance officers were additionally delegated as Executive Officers under the Public Health Act and tasked to inspect facilities agai nst the Chief Medical Officer of Health COVID -19 Orders o All non -compliances with respect to COVID -19 Orders are followed up by A lberta Health to ensure they are rectified o This action typically happens within 48 hours and processes are in place when escalation is necessary A COVID -19 Inquiry Response Team (CIRT) was created by A lberta Health to work with complaints officers to ensure that potential non -compliance with the Orders are investigated by an Executive Officer in a timely manner o Complaints o fficers are also mandated to receive and respond to inquiries directly from the public As of the end of October 2020, CIRT had responded to over 900 inquiries and concerns from residents, operators, family members and visitors relating to the Orders issued by the Chief Medical Officer of Health Increased funding support $260.1 million in pandemic funding was approved by the Departments of Health, and Seniors and Housing to support residents and staff of FBCC and seniors ' lodges, including $35.4 million from the Seniors and Housing budget Funding was provided to cover expenses for HCA wage top -up and extra hours, equipment and supplies, loss in accommodation revenue and reduced occupancy of FBCC spaces Vaccination All LTC and DSL residents and staff were ranked in the first priority group to receive vaccines in Alberta , due to their risk of adverse outcomes Full immunization with two doses offered to all residents and staff was completed in February 2021, the first amongst all provinces and territories Between February and March 2021, all residents in private supportive living, and seniors over 75 years living independently became eligible to receive vaccin es Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 103 Classification: Public Vaccination has dramatically decreased outbreaks in FBCC 3.10.1.1 Strengths It should be noted that staff and operators from FBCC sites as well as Alberta Health and AHS staff demonstrated extraordinary and consistent efforts in managing the pandemic and providing care and services to residents. 3.10.1.2 Areas of Opportunity The pandemic presented many challenges to A lberta Health , AHS, and operators and staff of FBCC sites. Early on, a major challenge was a lack of detailed knowledge on the spread of the COVID -19 virus, and the management and treatment of the disease . A reported lack of PPE supplies and a need for enhanced IPC training were also identified as issues initially . In addition, FBCC had many pervasive weaknesses which existed prior to the outbreak such as a lack of adequate staffing capacity, increasing resident acuity levels, and outdated facility infrastructure which generated operational challenges. The arrival of COVID -19 brought these existing deficiencies to a breaking point. Moving forward, the following systemic issues should be addressed to prevent future chal lenges during outbreaks and pandemics including: Increasing staffing levels Improving staff training to deal with the increasing acuity of residents Improving working conditions for staff Replacing outdated infrastructure and eliminating shared living accommodations Improving preparedness and planning for handling future pandemics Many key lessons were learned in the response to the pandemic such as: The need to enhance IPC training regularly for staff, including the proper use of PPE The need to have p roactive labour -force contingency plans to acquire emergency staffing required by the pandemic The need to create a stable, healthy work place culture The need to have efficient communication and consultation avenues between Alberta Health and families, residents, facility staff, and operators The need to value the emotional and physical support provided by family caregivers to residents and to design policies to enable and support their continued contact with FBCC residents as essential, e specially, but not only, during a pandemic 3.10.2 What We Heard Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 104 Classification: Public 3.10.2.1 Expert Panels The Expert Panel members reported that the COVID -19 pandemic exposed several challenges with FBCC including: A need for increased staffing levels at FBCC sites A need to reduce part -time positions for HCAs and provide more full -time employment The need to replace aged infrastructure and eliminate shared rooms Panel members also thought that the public health orders put in place to respond to the COVID -19 pandemic resulted in social isolation, and declining mental wellness and physical mobility. Finally, panel members reported that o perators felt that they wer e well supported by A lberta Health and AHS during the Pandemic . 3.10.2.2 Surveys and Interviews/Focus Groups Impacts to Resident Quality of Life Respondents to the resident and family/caregiver surveys perceived that resident quality of life decreased during the COVID -19 pandemic ( Figure 45). This was consistent with public perception (Figure 46). Other respondents to the surveys and interviews also perceived that COVID -19 negatively impacted the quality of life of residents due to increased social isolation, reduced physical activity, reduced social activities, and overall decline in physical and mental health.

These relationships between LTC homes, local hospitals and public health units must be based on trust, collaboration, and respect on all sides for the expertise that all parties bring to the priority of ensuring the health, safety, and well - being of residents. The Ministry of Long -Term Care should work with the Ministry of Health to formalize these relationships proactively - there is no need to wait until an outbreak has occurred before a local hospital assists or is compelled to assist a LTC home. Clearly defined supports and surge capacity for each LTC home must be in place and quickly mobilized when an emergency arises. According to Revera Inc 's Expert Advisory Pa ndemic Report103, each Canadian province should establish a regional network for its LTC sector with established relationships between the region 's hospitals and LTC homes. This is less of an issue in Alberta, where there is one provincial health authority. Workforce Recommendations coming out of Ontario 's LTC COVID -19 Commission (for Ontario)104 include: In addition to increasing the supply of PSWs, ensure that LTC staff recruitment efforts address the requirement for an appropriate staff mix to meet the incr easing acuity and complex care needs of residents While staffing flexibility is needed given the 24/7 nature of homes ' operations, more full -time positions must be created to ensure staffing stability and retention, and resident continuity of care Identify the permanent investments required to develop and implement a comprehensive human resources strategy that addresses the full range of staffing issues in the sector Mandate a minimum daily average of 4.0 hours of direct care per resident o The government needs to increase permanent funding for more nurses and support staff, to enable homes to increase their staff to resident ratio, and provide more hours of care, based on residents ' needs. Infection Prevention and Control (IP AC) Recommendations coming out of Ontario 's LTC COVID -19 Commission (for Ontario)105 include: Ensure every LTC home has a dedicated IPAC lead who can monitor, evaluate, and ensure compliance with proper protocols; support and provide basic training for all staff, and access the local IPA C centre of expertise, as required Enhance LTC ministry resources and capacity to provide compliance support immediately o In the short term, inspection staff from the Ministry of Long Term Care and others who can be trained, as well as from the local Publi c Health Unit, should be sent into homes to conduct timely, focused inspections to ensure homes are properly implementing proactive IPAC measures, and are responding effectively to their assessment results Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 107 Classification: Public o These inspections should prioritize visits to hom es based on the same risk measures as those used for the first recommendation under Relationships and Collaboration Given LTC residents are a highly vulnerable population and to date have suffered the highest COVID -19 death rates, provide highest priority access to testing and quick turn -around of results for residents and staff o The government should also prioritize LTC homes for point of care and less invasive tests as they become available Residents who are COVID -positive, especially in older homes, sh ould be given the option to transfer to alternate settings to avoid further transmission of the virus and to help them recover o Given that many LTC homes cannot effectively cohort and isolate because of physical infrastructure limitations, each home should work with its hospital, public health partners and others to put plans in place to quickly decant residents to other facilities, if it is appropriate and safe to do so , and t he plan should identify these facilities in advance According to Revera Inc 's Exp ert Advisory Pandemic Report106, staff should be trained in how to obtain various samples for testing. Until routine testing of asymptomatic residents and staff is available, homes should continue regular testing with P olymerase Chain Reaction detection of viral RNA Management should familiarize itself with the residential areas of staff members and monitor community spread in those neighbourhoods to determine when there is a higher likelihood of staff becoming infected Staff training and Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) According to Revera Inc 's Expert Advisory Pandemic Report107, a several -day supply of PPE must be maintained at every LTC home. Central regional inventories should be established to provide supplementary supplies for homes that require extra supplies during an outbreak. Standards involving IPAC in LTC must be brought to the levels expected in hospitals. This must include, at a minimum, training in hand hygiene; hand hygiene auditing; and the safe, effective use of PPE, including donning and doffing, and a focus on appropriate cleaning methods. Visitor policy and the role of families In late 2020, in a Special Report provided by the Royal Commission of Aged Care Quality and Safety, it was recommended that the Australian Gove rnment should fund providers to ensure there are adequate staff available to deal with external visitors during COVID -19 to enable a greater number of more meaningful visits between people receiving care and their loved ones108. According to Revera Inc 's Expert Advisory Pandemic Report109, designated family members and/or friends should be recognized as \"essential caregivers \" with the same virus screening protocols and testing used for staff. These essential caregivers must also receive IPAC (infection preve ntion and control) training. Recommendations coming out of Ontario 's LTC COVID -19 Commission (for Ontario)110 include: Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 108 Classification: Public Given the essential role of families and caregivers in supporting not just physical care needs but the psycho -social well -being of resident s, ensure that families and caregivers have ongoing, safe, and managed access to LTC residents Impact on residents ' and family caregivers ' overall health and well -being In late 2020, in a Special Report provided by the Royal Commission of Aged Care Quality and Safety, it was recommended that Australian Government increase the provision of allied health and mental health services to people living in residential aged care during the pandemic to prevent deterioration in their physical and mental health. Any ba rriers, whether real or perceived, to allied health and mental health professionals being able to enter residential aged care facilities should be removed unless justified on genuine public health grounds111. Infrastructure Recent studies by Public Health O ntario, researchers from the University of Toronto, and key researchers from Ontario hospitals and Research Institutes112 indicate that residents living in overcrowded LTC homes (e.g. homes with 2 to 4-bed rooms, shared bathrooms) are twice as likely to die from COVID -19 (2.7 per cent vs. 1.3 per cent) than in other settings. Infrastructure issues include shared rooms and bathrooms, the age of the facilities and the number of spaces in a building, and the use of ineffective ventilation systems. Oversight, monitoring and compliance The Ontario Long -term care COVID -19 Commission113 identified focused inspection, monitoring, and enforcement as important steps to stop the spread of COVID -19 in LTC facilities. Increased funding support According to CD Howe Institu te's 2020 expert working group114, among OECD countries for which recent data are available, Canada has fewer nurses and personal support workers per senior citizen than most (i.e. Canada only ranks above Korea, Hungary, and Portugal but below Austria, Germa ny, Estonia, United States, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Demark, Switzerland, and Israel). Rather than blame LTC operators, group members noted that contract rates paid to these providers by government have not kept pace with in creases in case complexity and inflation Group members pointed out that LTC operators have been unable to increase staffing levels and augment staff mix sufficiently given the limited funding increases they have received The expert working group also noted that provinces should increase investment in home and community care and develop policies that increase the freedom of choice for Canadians with respect to where and how they receive care services. Incentives should be designed to encourage those who can receive appropriate care in a non -institutional setting to do so. OECD countries spent 35 per cent on community care and 65 per cent on institutional care, whereas Canada spent 10 per cent on community care and 90 per cent on institutional care o As such, reallocation from institutional care to community care can be supported. Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 109 Classification: Public As already noted, France, Germany , and Australia, for example, have implemented self -directed models of care delivery that support greater independence among the elderly while improving patient satisfaction (Blomqvist and Busby 2014) 3.10.4 Policy Direction and Recommendations Six recommendations presented earlier in the report, if implemented, would aid in preventing the future spread of infectious diseases in FBCC sites and also improve resident quality of care. Recommendation 1 6: Increase direct care hours (includes nursing, personal care and therapeutic) at FBCC sites to an average of 4.5 worked hours per resident day for LTC and up to an average of 4.0 worked hours per resident day for DSL within a four -year period. Recommendation 1 7: Increase the level of professional care hours (nursing an d therapeutic) for FBCC residents . Recommendation 1 8: Increase the level of mental health professional supports for FBCC residents. Recommendation 21: Establish a full -time employment benchmark for nursing, therapeutic and health care aide staff for FBCC a nd include the benchmark as one of the quality indicators for monitoring facility care . Recommendation 30: Develop and implement a \"Research, Innovation and Technology Strategy for Continuing Care\" in Alberta . Recommendation 3 1: Focus government capital investments on the regeneration or replacement of existing FBCC spaces , with some funding ear -marked for the development of new spaces where needed . Further, we developed seven additional recommendations that would aid in preventing the future spread of infectious diseases in FBCC sites and also improve resident quality of care. Policy Direction 13: Learn from COVID -19 experience to prevent future spread of infectious diseases in FBCC sites and improve resident quality of life and care. Recommendation 36: Immediately halt new admissions to rooms that already have two residents. Permanently phase out shared rooms by April 1, 2027. Recommendation 37: Revise the design guidelines for continuing care facilities to incorporate findings regar ding the spread of COVID -19 in FBCC. Recommendation 3 8: Ensure that there is a n on-site leader in each facility who has the expertise or access to expertise to devise an early pandemic management and prevention plan and has the authority to implement that plan to improve issues related to infection prevention and control. Recommendation 3 9: Resolve labour force issues proactively to maintain needed staffing levels at FBCC sites during pandemics and outbreaks. Recommendation 40: Maintain an open communication channel with all FBCC sites and industry associations during emergency situations suc h as pandemics. Recommendation 41: Ensure that FBCC operators and staff always have appropriate access to personal protective equipment and other equipment/supplies for future outbreaks/pandemics. Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 110 Classification: Public Recommendation 42: Reduce social isolation for residents and caregivers during an outbreak/pandemic. Details regarding these recommendations are provided in Section 4.2.11 . 3.11 Federal Funding and Standards 3.11.1 Current Context The COVID -19 pandemic has highlighted two key issues related to LTC nationally: the financing of these services and standards of care. The pandemic has exposed significant shortcomings in Canada 's LTC sector. The Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) reported in late June 2020 that LTC residents accounted for 81 per cent of COVID -19 deaths in Canada, more than double the averag e of 38 per cent across the 14 countries in the OECD 115. Other reports have described extremely poor care services and practices in some provinces116, 117, 118. These problems with LTC services have become a national concern. One of the root causes of these outco mes was identified as the chronic underfunding and understaffing of continuing care and LTC services across Canada. While health care service delivery is within provincial jurisdiction, the federal government assists provinces and territories by providing health transfer funding . The Canada Health Act (CHA) sets out the criteria and conditions that provincial insurance plans must meet in order to receive these federal transfers. The CHA requires that \"medically necessary \" or \"medically required \" hospital and physician services be insured by the provincial or territorial plan. LTC and home care are not included in this provision. These services are governed by provincial legislation. All provinces have their own continuing care programs and services and a v ariety of housing options for clients . Details and options of continuing care programs and services vary by province. Based on a n online survey conducted by Ipsos : 86 per cent of Canadians believed that LTC should be considered an integrated part of the Canadian health system to be funded and administered accordingly119 47 per cent ranked improving the standards of LTC homes across Canada as one of their top five priorities 63 per cent of Canadians aged 65 years and older ranked improving the standards of LTC homes as their most important priority Many organizations, researchers and clinicians argue for the development of national standards as a method of addressing current issue s in LTC120,121. Responding to public concern on deaths in LTC facilities due to the COVID -19 pandemic, The Government of Canada Speech from the Throne (September 23, 2020) indicated that the Government will also: Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 111 Classification: Public Work with the provinces and territories to set new, national standards for LTC so that seniors get the best support possibl e And take additional action to help people stay in their homes longer \"122 On December 10 , 2020, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau wrapped up his 23rd meeting with Canada 's premiers by promising to increase health care funding to the provinces , but not before th e immediate pressure of the pandemic subsides 123. 3.11.1.1 Areas of Opportunity One challenge is for the federal and provincial/territorial governments to find common ground and a shared pathway to proceed harmoniously towards the mutual goal of rejuvenating the con tinuing care sector across the country. The following comments below are offered from a financing and planning perspective. The financing perspective: t he projected cost burden of the LTC system in Canada The impact of the aging population on the future health care costs in Canada is substantial. The population of people over 65 years of age in Canada is projected to increase from 18 to nearly 25 per cent of the population by 2040. This increase is driven i n large part by the baby -boom generation who are now between the ages of 55 and 74 years. They will be entering the 75 plus age group who will be the highest users of the health system. The 2020 Conference Board of Canada report on Health Care Cost Drivers in Canada124 indicate s that, without the impact of COVID -19, health care expenditures are estimated to increase at an average annual pace of 5.4 per cent out to 2030 -31. Of the 5.4 per cent average annual growth, about 46 per cent of the increase is due to inflation, 18 per cent is due to population growth, and 19 per cent is due to population aging. In addition, i t estimate s that because of the COVID -19 pandemic, additional health care funds are needed for testing, treatment, recovery, medical supplies, pha rmaceuticals, and acquirement of vaccine s. The report suggests that the additional health costs due to COVID -19 will range from $20.1 to $26.9 billion in 2020 -21, and the total amount between 2020/21 and 2030/31 will range from $80 billion to $161 billion. Accounting for the COVID -19 pandemic, total health care expenditures for governments are projected to increase by between 20.9 and 27.5 per cent from 2019 -20 to 2022 -23, or by an average annual pace of between 6.5 and 8.4 per cent . As health is a provinc ial jurisdiction, these projected additional health cost expenditures will weigh heavily upon the health care budgets of all provinces. For this reason, the premiers requested the federal government to increase the current 22 per cent of the federal share of provincial government health spending to 35 per cent, which would represent an increase in the Canada Health Transfer of $28 billion annually next year125. The planning perspective: integrated system planning for seniors ' care As the adverse impact of the COVID -19 pandemic is most visible in LTC facilities, there is a tendency to focus the discussion on developing national standards for LTC only . Other countries with aging populations have shown that there are more effective ways of managing the continuing care system Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 112 Classification: Public beyond only focusing on LTC. The C.D. Howe research report on Shifting Towards Autonomy: A Continuing Care Model for Canada126, observed that \"other OECD countries, on average, spend a much larger share of their health and LTC budgets on home care services than Canada (OECD Stats 2012), as they have shifted large shares of their health budgets towards delivering care to the frail elderly in their homes. \" Thus, what is needed in Canada is a national discussion on the bigger policy question on an appropriate integrated continuing care system in the future. Discussion of national standards, common elements, and outcome measures of the future system should be part of the discussion. Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 113 Classification: Public Detailed Recommendations Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 114 Classification: Public 4 Detailed Recommendations 4.1 Future Vision for FBCC Services in Alberta The findings from Section 3 above identified several opportunities to improve FBCC service delivery in Alberta . The findings also identified many strengths to build upon , including a unified health authority, good collaboration between the government and industry, use of proven assessment tools, history of successful policy development and innovations, and the availabil ity of renowned experts and dedicated clinicians. Moving forward, future users of FBCC services may have different life -style preference s from the residents of today, and their vision for healthy aging may also change. Accordingly, it will be important to develop a vision that reflects these differences and addresses the changing needs of residents. Trending studies127,128 and comments by gerontology experts129,130 show that the preferred vision for aging consists of healthy and active lifestyles, an improved qu ality of life, and living in age -friendly communities close to their friends and support groups. People with disabilities have similar goals, to be able to live full lives supported by a network of services in the community131. In November 2019, the Alberta Association on Gerontology hosted a Symposium on Vision 2030132 for Seniors Services in Alberta. More than 250 participants including clinicians, gerontologists, researchers, health care planners, seniors and their family members attended. Healthy Aging Vi sion for Alberta Based on the above considerations, a Healthy Aging Vision for Alberta was developed, and utilized to articulate the desired end -state for healthy aging in Alberta. Albertans are supported to be healthy and active in their community, with an improved quality of life, and they are engaged, empowered, and enabled to live in inclusive communities with social connectedness and healthcare access. In thinking about how to achieve this vision, MNP developed a proposed policy structure that reflec ts key elements including population characteristics, features and support, and policies (Figure 47). Goals for Healthy Aging and Transforming FBCC The goal of the Healthy Aging Vision is to enable as much of the senior population and people with disabilities to live in Layer 1 (minimum care needs) as possible. For Layer 2, home care, community care, and supportive housing services should be augmented, ai ming to have a moderate proportion of seniors and people with disabilities in this group. With these actions, the percentage of seniors and people with disabilities in FBCC (Layer 3) should decrease over time Currently, 22.5 per cent of continuing care cli ents are in LTC, and 17 per cent are in DSL (39.5 per cent total), with 60.5 per cent served by LTHC. The target for continuing care services is to reduce the proportion of clients in LTC to 13.9 per cent and the proportion of clients in DSL to 16.1 per ce nt, with 70 per cent of clients served in LTHC . Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 115 Classification: Public Figure 47: Health y Aging Vision - Policy Structure for Alberta Layer 1: For Individuals with Minimal Health Care Needs : Required: Population -based Health Policies and Services For Albertans with minimal health care needs, the priority is to implement population -based health policies that encourage individuals to practice healthy eating and active lifestyle habits. All government departments need to collaborate to improve the social determinants of health for seniors and people with disabilities including elimination of abuse, social isolation, and loneliness, improving financial security, and enabling accessible transportation. The health system should be enhanced whereby primary hea lth care, community health programs, and community/home -care services are seamlessly coordinated. Programs and supports should be available to reduce unnecessary early movement into FBCC . Layer 2: For Individuals with Moderate to Complex Care Needs (Living at Home or in the Community): Required: Services and Supports to Deliver Complex Care at Home and in the Community For this group of individuals and people with disabilities, complex services and innovative programs supporting them in their community ar e needed. Such supports could include: New models of supportive housing, such as: \"small \" or cottage -like homes; housing designed specifically for delivering dementia care services; assisted living; campus of care villages; co - Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 116 Classification: Public operative housing; shared housing between students and seniors/people with disabilities ; and specially adapted homes for aging living New models of services, such as: FBCC Services Without Walls 133, 134; self-directed care; intense long-term home care 135; family and relative care optio ns; and re -enablement and restorative care 136, 137 Layer 3: For Individuals with Highest Care Needs Living in FBCC: Based on the findings of the Review, a vision for transforming FBCC was developed. Facility -Based Continuing Care sites provide safe, afford able, inclusive, person -centred care to individuals in need, respecting their dignity, choice, and individual preferences, covering their holistic service needs including physical health, mental health, spiritual needs, cultural needs, and relational needs . The goal is to provide high quality care and services that support resident quality of life and happiness. Sites strive to be a joyous place for residents to live, for staff to work, and for family/caregivers to visit. Required: A Transformed Integrated FBCC System Delivering \"Intense \" Continuing Care Services The following changes are required to support the vision for FBCC : The culture of care is transformed from rigidly scheduled care to person -centred individualized care with quality of life being valued as a priority The culture of working life for staff is transformed from a poor working environment to one with pride, respect, continuous quality improvement, and healthy working conditions that stimulates high morale amongst staff Staffing hours of care and training are enhanced Family caregivers are treated as essential team members f or care Couples and loved ones are not separated when moving to FBCC Individuals have a choice of their providers, locations, and options for continuing care services An easily accessible information system is designed to enable users to select appropriate service options or facilities for care Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 117 Classification: Public 4.2 Detailed Recommendations for Change A total of 42 recommendations for improvement were developed , and organized into 1 1 policy directions. Each recommendation includes: A description of the recommendation The supporting rationale for making the recommendation The expected benefits of implementing the recommendation The key actions required to implement the recommendation The proposed timing for the recommendation The financial considerations of the recommendation An integrated dynamic financial model was developed to assess the financial implications of key recommended changes to the system. Detailed assumptions for the model are provided in Appendix 2. The model determined the projected costs of meeting future dem and for continuing care services based on the current distribution of LTC, DSL and LTHC services, as well as proposed changes to the system based on the future vision for LTC, DSL and LTHC services. Key areas of change in the integrated dynamic financial m odel included: The implications of increasing the proportion of LTHC spaces from 60.5 per cent to 70.0 per cent and decreasing the proportion of FBCC services from 39.5 per cent to 30.0 per cent to meet demand in 2030. This included: o Annual operating cost implications o Cumulative capital cost implications from 2021 to 2030 The implications of increasing the direct hours of care for : o LTC from an average of 3.4 worked hours per resident day to 4.5 o DSL4D from an average of 3.0 worked hours per resident day to 4.0 o DSL4 from an average of 2.7 worked hours per resident day to 3.5 The implications of providing a self -directed care model, with 6.3 per cent of all continuing care clients receiving services through this option by 2030 The implications of adjusting capital grant levels for LTC and DSL space development The implications of developing small homes to replace a portion of aged facilities, as well as for new DSL capacity The implications of replacing a portion of aged facilities with zero -capital options The implications of adding new FBCC capacity specifically in Indigenous communities, in addition to the projected demand for FBCC spaces Implementing the proposed recommendations below, are projected to result in moderate operating cost increases and significant cumulative capital cost savings by the year 2030 in comparison to meeting demand and providing services with the current dis tribution of continuing care services with no increases in direct care hours for LTC or DSL . This includes: A projected cost increase of $68 million per year (in 2020 dollars) in annual operating costs by 2030. Cumulative capital cost savings o f $1.7 billion (in 2020 dollars) by 2030. Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 118 Classification: Public 4.2.1 Policy Direction 1: Establish Quality of Life as the number one priority goal for Alberta 's continuing care system. Recommendation #1: Declare that \"Quality of Life is the number one priority for the continuing care system \" and establish a Quality of Life Task Force to plan for and implement steps to achieve this . Supporting Rationale Quality of life and person -centred care are not a key area of focus in the \"Continuing Care Health Services Standards \" or the Nursing Homes Act or other related legislation Most public survey respondents perceived that resident quality of life in FBCC was poor (38 per cent of respondents) to adequate (36 per cent of respondents) prior to COVID -19, and that the quality of care decreased during COVID -19 (poor rating increased to 52 per cent of respondents and adequate rating decreased to 20 per cent of respondents) Residents in FBCC and their caregivers also perceived that quality of life decreased since COVID - 19 started and requires improvement o Residents rated their quality of life at 7.5 out of 10 prior to COVID -19, and 5.3 out of 10 during COVID -19 o Families/caregivers rated resident quality of life at 7.0 out of 10 prior to COVID -19, and 4.4 out of 10 during COVID -19 Internationally, person -centred care is part of a culture -change movement . The culture -change movement includes features such as : o Resident direction o Home-like atmosphere o Smaller homes/facilities o Close relationships o Staff empowerment o Collaborative decision -making (resident and caregivers, and collaborative care team members) o Quality -improvement processes Many demonstration projects have been implemented in the world as part of this culture change, including the development of specific models such as the Green Hous e Model, the Butterfly Household Model, and Eden Alternative o Although additional research on the Green House Model 's quantifiable impacts to quality of life is required, it achieves the creation of a family -type/real home setting138 where implemented o For per sons with dementia, the Butterfly Household Model of Care developed by Dr. David She ard (of Dementia Care Mat ters) in the UK has been shown to have positive impacts on improving the quality of care for people experiencing different stages of dementia Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 119 Classification: Public o Likew ise, the Eden Alternative has been successfully shown to reduce fall rates, resident - initiated assaults (on staff), and resident depression139 Expected Benefits This declaration will continue to shift the culture of care delivery in FBCC towards person -centred care, where relational care is valued, client 's choice and dignity are respected, and cultural diversity and values are observed Key Actions Required Declaration by Government of Alberta that Quality of Life is the number one prior ity for the continuing care system Formation of Quality of Life Task Force to implement Quality of Life Declaration : o Identify changes required to care protocols and approaches to inform the development of Quality of Life Standards o Oversee work of the Quality of Life Outcome Measures Expert Group , and provide guidance for the development of quality of life outcome measures Many research studies identif y the following steps as essential to achieving culture change with a focus on quality of life: o Emphasiz e the leadership role of elected officials , administrati on, medical professionals , and front -line staff in fostering culture change o Redesign the \"structure, process and outcome \" of the organization to achieve culture change (see Recommendation #2) o Redesign the workforce where the goal is to \"flatten \" the hierarchy o Restructur e the physical design of facilities to provide more privacy in a home -like environment Timing Next 24 months Financial Considerations Time commitments from Quality of Life Task Force members and Government of Alberta staff Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 120 Classification: Public Recommendation #2: Develop new Quality of Life Standards to be included in FBCC standards. Supporting Rationale Quality improvement experts recommend that, to be successful in improving and transforming any existing system, a formalized way of changing the \"structure, process and outcomes \" of the existing system should take place The new standards should become the new values and culture for FBCC service delivery Expected Benefits A change in focus from tasked -based care to person -centred care and quality of life for FBCC , which should address the choices and preferences of FBCC residents o This includes moving towards a more holistic model of care to address spiritual, social, emotional, intellectual, financial, environmental, mental, and physical needs o For example, providing residents with the choice to observe their cultural ceremonies, religion, and practice s (including food choices) during their stay in FBCC Key Actions Required The Quality of Life Task Force should design an implementation plan for mandating the achievement of quality of life standards for all FBCC residents o The implementation plan should consider existing services, meals, facility design, staff work schedules and workplace practice s, and work cultures that may need to be adjusted to achieve quality of life for all FBCC residents Identify changes required in care protocols, approaches, and relationships with residents in the above areas and formulate new approaches Pilot and evaluate these new approaches o One key aspect of the evaluation will be to assess the impact on the quality of life as well as the satisfaction of residents and their families Champions and leaders of the new approach should provide in -service training to all FBCC staff Identify the successful approaches and include them as the new Quality of Life Standards Timing Next 24 months . Financial Considerations Time commitments from staff involved in developing new Quality of Life Standards Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 121 Classification: Public \\ Recommendation #3: Develop quality of life outcome measures for FBCC and mandate the public reporting of these measures . Supporting Rationale Quality improvement research indicates that the measurement of outcomes, and the public reporting of the same, is a way to achieve greater transparency and ensure facilities are accountable for their actions There have been vigorous research efforts to develop quality of life outcome measures by many countries in the world over the last ten years. Alberta can learn from the experiences of these countries Facility operators and external stakeholders perceive that the focus of audits should shift to assessing outcomes Expected Benefits Measurement of quality of life outcomes in FBCC and public reporting of the same will foster a culture of continuous improvement relating to FBCC residents ' quality of life Key Actions Required Identify experts with knowledge and experience with developing quality of life outcome measures Form a Quality of Life Outcome Measures Expert Group or leverage existing groups/projects to select/develop qua lity of life outcome measures for Alberta, as well as to develop a reporting process for these indicators Mandate the public reporting of these quality of life outcome measures Timing Next 24 months Financial Considerations Time commitments from staff and expert group members involved in developing new quality of life outcome measures Time commitments from Government of Alberta to introduce and implement the quality of life outcome measures Consultant costs Time commitments to track data and report on q uality of life outcome measures Information systems and infrastructure needed to measure/report on quality of life outcomes, as well as the time commitments of staff required for beta testing Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 122 Classification: Public Recommendation #4: Support couples */loved ones to remain living together , if they choose, in continuing care facilities . Supporting Rationale It has long been the complaint of residents that existing policies often separate couples/loved ones with different care needs, by moving them to different facilities o In some cases, these facilities are quite far apart or even in different towns The separation of couples/loved ones has, in many instances, led to poor physical and mental health outcomes o The Nova Scotia Legislature recently passed a law called Life Partners in Long -Term Care Act, mandating that, effective 01 March 2021, couples who require different levels of care in LTC must be admitted to the same facility Keeping couples/loved ones together was an opportunity for improvement identified by residents and caregivers In furtherance to the prioritization of quality of life of residents, it is recommended that \"keeping couples/loved ones together \" be a policy principle respected in the admission of FBCC residents , and that t his principle override other policie s of FBCC o Couples/loved ones requiring FBCC should be admitted to the same facility, in the same or connecting rooms (if they prefer) at the highest level of care required, provided that at least one individual is assessed as requiring FBCC services Expected Benefits This proposed policy will avoid further instances of couples/loved ones being separated while living at FBCC sites Key Actions Required Amend any access, admission, wait -list management or other policies to support \"couples/loved ones to stay together \" Timing Immediate Financial Considerations Availability of suites to house couples/loved ones Time commitments by Government of Alberta to identify and modify all applicable policies/regulations Determining how to apply accommodation rates for couples/loved ones who live together *Couples defined as married, common -law, etc . Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 123 Classification: Public Recommendation #5 : Include primary caregiver (s) of FBCC residents as essential members of the Care Team and provide them with supports to reduce burnout. Supporting Rationale With an intimate understanding of FBCC residents, primary caregivers can play many roles in the care and supports of residents including : o Companionship and emotional support for residents o Assisting in the provision of care activities such as eating, assistance in toileting, mobility (if residents prefer) o Providing input into the development of care plans, etc. Survey and interview respondents identified a need for increasing caregiver involvement in care plan development and decisions For this reason, it is recommended that the resident 's primary caregiver(s) have a larger role in care planning and decision making both during and following the COVID -19 pandemic o In addition, in relevant continuing care policies, it is recommended that th e role of primary caregivers be recognized as an essential Collaborator of the Care Team Multiple studies140,141 have documented various negative impacts on primary caregivers including: o Caregiving responsibilities affect caregivers ' physical and mental well-being, as in disturbed sleeping patterns, reduced social activities, and engendering psychological dysfunctions such as depression, guilt, worry/anxiety, loneliness, and emotional distress o Studies have found that caregivers are burnt out and require s upport from the government and social agencies to continue with their role Expected Benefits This inclusion of primary caregivers will formally recognize their special role and empower them to participate in the planning and delivery of care for their resident family members /friends Key Actions Required Amend policies to recognize primary caregivers as collaborators of care (e.g. in standards; in legislation; in care assessment documents etc.) Provide training for FBCC staff on how to engage and include primary caregivers in care plan development and decision making Provide primary caregivers with mental health and social supports as needed to help alleviate caregiver distress Timing Immediate Financial Considerations Time commitments by Government of Alberta to identify and modify all applicable policies/regulations Staff training and change management Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 124 Classification: Public Recommendation #6 : Improve the overall quality of meals ( e.g. nutrition, menu selection, taste, presentation, and dining experience) at FBCC facilities. Supporting Rationale Food was consistently ranked as one of the most important dimensions of quality of life for LTC residents based on previous research studies142 Malnutrition is a concern for individuals living in LTC and prevalence of this condition is high; recent estimates suggest that 44 to 58 per cent of residents are malnourished which can be attributable to poor consumption and menus not provid ing the appropriate levels of micronutrients, vitamins, and minerals143 The FBCC residents and caregivers who completed the review survey ranked \"increase the quality and variety of the meals \" as one of top areas for improvement in FBCC sites. Quality of meals was also identified as an area of improvement by FBCC staff and the public The provincial facility average for the Food Rating Scale on the 2017 HQCA Survey was 71 out of 100, and facility results ranged from 47 to 88 out of 100 In response to the Health Q uality Council of Alberta Long Term Care Family Experi ence Survey conducted in 2018, family members said that the quality, temperature, taste, variety, nutritional value, preparation, and serving of meals to residents could be improved o Some said the meals could be more \"home -like\", better reflecting what residents grew up eating and that tableware similar to a family dinner table should be used o Many family members said that nutritious options were not always available, as food was processed, ready -made, or canned. In general, they felt not enough fresh whole fruits and vegetables were used o Some said that meals were not always suitable for residents ' dietary needs. Care plans that detailed meal requirements were not always followed or accommodated o Regarding meal preparation, many said meals lacked variety (meals rotated through a schedule). Many said meal preparation could be improved with innovative and qualified chefs Expected Benefits The quality of meals and dining experience provided to FBCC residents is improved Key Actions Required Bring together nutritionists, chefs , and representatives of the restaurant business to assess the quality and variety of meals provided, including the preparation, serving and presentation, and nutritional value of meals Form a Task Group comprised of FBCC operators and representatives from Alberta Health and AHS to implement the recommendations to improve the quality and variety of meals provided in FBCC Timing Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 125 Classification: Public Immediate Financial Considerations Resources to bring together experts Time and effort of Task Force members to implement the recommendations Potential for higher cost of food services Recommendation # 7: Refocus capital grant programs to prioritize a greater variety of client centred models of care (such as smaller homes /households and campus es of care ). Supporting Rationale Capital grant programs were created originally to fund supportive living spaces as recommended by the Broda Report To respond to changing needs of the aging population, many other models of care have since emerged ; examples of these models include: o Smaller Homes . Over the past thirty years, many models of care have been developed based on the smaller home concept such as Green House Model, Eden Alternative, and Dementia Butterfly Homes. All these models had received favourable evaluation results o These homes usually have 10 to 12 residents, and multi -skilled workers who provide consistent care including nursing care, personal care, daily activities, light housekeeping, and meal preparation o Usually, residents are included in household activities as a form of therapy to support clients to be more indep endent in activities of daily living o The design of these homes better suits the needs of residents (e.g. no dead ends with hallways) and generally provides a more residential feel o Campus of Care Villages. Campus of care villages have also been developed th at include FBCC o These villages are usually comprised of multi -level facilities and may include spaces for LTC, private and publicly funded supportive living, and independent living, including affordable accommodation options for low -income residents o Some villages also include a few smaller homes o These villages may function as the \"hub\" of the community with commercial activities such as coffee shops, beauty salons, and medical clinics for the community housed in village buildings o Some sites may establish l inks with Universities and function as research and education centres for seniors ' services as well o Examples of campus of care villages in Alberta include: Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 126 Classification: Public o Shepherd 's Care Kensington Village in Edmonton o Brenda Strafford Foundation Cambridge Manor/BSF Cen tre on Aging Campus in Calgary which is associated with the O 'Brien Institute for Public Health, University of Calgary It is recommended that the mandate of capital grant funding be expanded to provide funding to a variety of models of care to allow a much greater choice of living options for FBCC residents o New funding mechanisms such as cost -sharing funding with sponsors, private donors, universities, industries, corporations, and private funding should be explored Smaller homes are more suitable for some rural areas and Indigenous communities, where the population is too small to support the building of a larger FBCC site Expected Benefits Greater choice of living options available to Albertans needing continuing care services Improved access to FBCC sites in Indigenous and rural communities A spectrum of accommodation and care options on one campus site may enable smoother transition between levels of care and keep couples closer together when one partner 's care needs change Key Actions Required Amend the mandate and scope of capital grant funding to include the development of a range of models such as smaller homes and campus of care villages as part of the approach for replacing existing aged FBCC spaces and developing new FBCC spaces (see Recom mendation 3 1) o The Government should set a target to develop approximately 1,600 small home FBCC spaces by 2030 as part of the replacement and new development of FBCC spaces in Recommendation 3 1 o Set a target of developing some of the replacement/new FBCC spaces in Recommendation 3 1 in approximately 12 campus of care type of environments across AB (this could include the incorporation of small homes) o Include affordable independent living options within the campus (e.g. lodge settings or self-contained apart ments) Timing Next 36 months Financial Considerations Capital funding from Government of Alberta Other sources of funding from cost -sharing parties Funding to evaluate resident outcomes in the new models of care Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 127 Classification: Public 4.2.2 Policy Direction 2: Enhance overall Quality of Care with emphasis on residents living with dementia . Recommendation # 8: Enhance the overall quality of care provided to FBCC residents by strengthening the relevant services standards, and updating/ redesigning continuing care information systems and care indicators. Promote research, education, and evaluation activities on quality of care. Supporting Rationale Quality of care is critical to quality of life but is only one aspect that contributes t o quality of life The quality of care that FBCC residents receive is most often reported in terms of clinical quality indicators (QIs) Alberta has had a strong focus on improving quality of care over the past ten years: o In 2014, the Continuing Care Quality Management Framework was released by AHS o The Continuing Care Health Services Standards have been updated regularly since 2007, latest amendment in 2018 o Alberta performs well in comparison with other Canadian provinces in terms of quality indicators reported by CIHI, using information from RAI tools o Alberta has chosen the reduction of antipsychotic drugs in LTC homes as a quality initiative since 2011. In 2011/12, the proportion of residents on antipsychotic drugs in LTC homes without a diagnosis of psychosis was 26.8 per cent. In 2019/20, this percentage had decreased to 18.1 per cent, the lowest in Canada o Alberta is now rolling out a similar initiative p rovince -wide that focuses on reducing pain and depressive symptoms o The HQCA regularly conducts surveys of FBCC residents and their families on their perception of the quality of care delivered in LTC and DSL facilities In these surveys, residents and fam ilies expressed concerns about the inadequate staffing levels of these sites. However, in general, residents and families were satisfied with their facilities and staff For LTC, family members rated overall care at their facilities at an average of 8.4 out of 10, and 93 per cent would recommend their facility to others For DSL, residents ' overall rating of their facility was 7.8 out of 10 (8.4 by family members). Ninety per cent of residents, and 94 per cent of family members would recommend their faciliti es to others o The Institute for Continuing Care Education and Research (ICCER) is a network of post - secondary institutions, continuing care provider organizations, and regulatory bodies collaborating to improve continuing care in Alberta by encouraging rese arch, translating knowledge into better practice, enhancing education and informing policy The RAI -MDS 2.0 tool and RUG III system currently used in LTC in most provinces of Canada is scheduled to be converted to a new system, the InterRAI LTC Facility ass essment tool and RUG -III Plus over the next few years Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 128 Classification: Public o CIHI requires the reporting, by all applicable jurisdictions, of data generated by these new tools to its information systems o Funding is required to develop a new provincial information system to co llect the data from these assessments, report these data to CIHI, and to enable analytics required to monitor quality, provide data for public reporting, and support policy development of these new tools and for the monitoring of the new indicators Quality of care in LTC is receiving a tremendous amount of attention as a result of the fatalities resulting from the ongoing COVID -19 pandemic o Many indicate that the current issues with LTC in Canada are chronic and strongly related to the culture of LTC o A transformational cultural change is needed that embodies learning and continuous improvement o An environment that promotes continuing education and training in the light of new research findings is critical to the delivery of leading practices It is reco mmended that additional funding be made available to provide support for activities promoting learning, research, education, and evaluation for continuing care in the province o Examples include organizing Think Tank Discussion Sessions for the improvement of the system, presentations by experts on leading -edge practices, mentoring experiences for front -line care staff, and implementation and evaluation of innovation projects pertaining to quality of care strategies Expected Benefits The recommended activit ies will assist in continuously improving the quality of care in FBCC Key Actions Required Develop an action plan to enhance the quality of care, taking into consideration the factors mentioned above o Modify relevant standards to support monitoring of quality of care indicators over task - based measures Develop a plan to assist in the implementation of the InterRAI LTC Facility and Home Care assessment tools and RUG -III Plus , and develop a new information syst em (e.g. replacing or updating ACCIS, continuing work on Connect Care system) to support the implementation including training, reporting, and trending of new indicators Develop a plan to promote research, education, implementation, and evaluation of innovation projects in F BCC Timing: Next 24 months Financial Consideration Time commitments by Government of Alberta to identify and modify all applicable policies/regulations Funding for future new information system and indicator development Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 129 Classification: Public Funding for research, education, and evaluation projects in FBCC Recommendation # 9: Improve the quality of life for FBCC residents living with dementia, including quality of care, and the physical, mental, and emotional health of these residents. Supporting Rationale Experience has shown that activities aimed at improving the quality of care are more likely to be successful if they are very focused, carried out with concerted efforts of the care staff, and perceived as important, and measurable by indicators Rationale for this recomm endation includes: o Residents living with dementia are estimated to represent 70 per cent to 90 per cent of the population of FBCC and it is estimated this proportion will continue to increase in decades to come o Residents living with dementia very often are unable to express their needs in both the Quality of Care and Quality of Life domains o Alberta Health is currently implementing the five -year Alberta Dementia Strategy and Action Plan , and t his recommendation can build upon and leverage the expertise, knowledge base and momentum gained from the Dementia Strategy o Alberta can learn from demonstration projects focused on dementia care delivery o Evaluation studies ( e.g. CADTH Issues in Emerging Health Technologies: Dementia Villages: Innovative Residential Care for People with Dementia, 2019) have concluded that \"rather than adopting a single model, adopting best practices from each to suit local needs may be a more reasonable approach \" Expected Benefits Improved quality of care for residents living with dementia Improved quality of life for all FBCC residents, including residents living with dementia Key Actions Required Develop a Dementia Quality of Care initiative o It is recommended that both care delivery methods and physical design features be jointly considered as part of this initiative. Certain physical environmental conditions such as design features, colour, and lighting etc. contribute significantly to quality of life Develop a measurement approach for quality of care and life for residents living with dementia Establish trend data for reporting and multi -year targets Timing Next 36 months Financial Consideration Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 130 Classification: Public Project expenses, including contracting expenses for indicator development and reporting tools, FBCC staff time, and evaluation activities 4.2.3 Policy Direction 3: Improve the provision of culturally appropriate continuing care services. Recommendation # 10: Strengthen relationships and the level of collaboration with Indigenous leadership/organizations to provide more culturally appropriate continuing care services , closer to home and integrated with other community services, for Indigenous stakeholders. Supporting Rationale Feedback provided by Indigenous Albertans included: o Indigenous communities need access to more Indigenous -based facilities equipped with culturally relevant services o There is a need to improve the delivery of home care services on -reserve and -settlement o Indigenous communities would like help from the Government of Alberta with building internal cap acity to provide FBCC services without having to give up authority They would like to implement a culture -based model rather than a western model that is imposed on them o There is a need to build mutual trust between all partners (Indigenous, federal , and provincial) o There is a need for better partnerships around funding (provincial and federal) and better coordination among Alberta Health and AHS o There is a need for more consistency in support and communication from Alberta Health /AHS. Many Indigenous groups are unclear of the process for initiating discussions about establishing continuing care services in their communities Expected Benefits Improved access to continuing care services closer to home for Indigenous clients/stakeholders Improved qualit y of care and quality of life for Indigenous clients/stakeholders Key Actions Required Assign a dedicated team from Alberta Health /AHS to work collaboratively with Indigenous leaders/organizations and, as appropriate, representatives from First Nations and Inuit Health Branch (FNIHB) at Indigenous Services Canada (ISC) Have this team work collaboratively with Indigenous leaders/organizations and , as appropriate, representatives from FNIHB to establish a process for dev eloping and funding continuing care services in Indigenous communities Have this team communicate with the Leaders/Health Directors in Indigenous communities the process for developing and operating FBCC services Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 131 Classification: Public o Coordinate consistent communication messagi ng with FNIHB on this process Provide supports to, and work collaboratively with, communities interested in trying to bring FBCC services closer to home. This includes working with representatives from FNIHB and helping to bring them to the table for these initiatives Pilot the \"resource hub \" model concept (see Recommendation 1 4) in some Indigenous communities Timing Immediately Financial Considerations Time and resource requirements of the team dedicated to support Indigenous organizations Funding for culturally appropriate Indigenous services, including capital funding Recommendation # 11: Improve cultural sensitivity, and diversity and inclusion at FBCC sites. Supporting Rationale Expert Panel members reported a need to provide cultural diversity in meals, and delivery language at FBCC sites Indigenous stakeholders reported a lack of consideration for Indigenous peoples ' needs and cultural safety in continuing care facilities in Alberta including: o A lack of cultural sensitivity and acknowledgement of the importance of the land and the community, with which Indigenous peoples have kindship ties o Language barriers can be a challenge off reserve o Facilities lack of access to traditional foods and do not allow family members to bring in traditional foods LTC homes in Canada are challenged to recognize and support the culture s of their residents at a time when their health and mental capacity are declining144 The NIA recently reported a growing need for inclusive care and support that acknowledge and affirm the immense diversity that exists among LTC residents across Canada including race, culture, gender, and sexual orientation145 Expected Benefits Improved quality of care and quality of life for all FBCC clients Key Actions Required Establish a task force to focus on improving cultural sensitivity, and diversity and inclusion in FBCC. Have the task force consider implementing the following actions for improving cultural sensitivity, and diversity and inclusion at FBCC sites: Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 132 Classification: Public o Provide a method for addressing and resolving conflicts related to inter -cultural and diversity issues among FBCC residents, caregivers, and staff o Provide training related to cultural competence and cultural sensitivity, and diversity and inclusion for FBCC staff o Support individuality an d culture within the standardized environment of regulation and compliance o Ensure that sites meet accreditation standards for diversity and inclusion o Implement l eadership training that includes diversity and inclusion, both in academic and in-service sett ings o Include admission questions that ask about an individual 's needs and preferences and integrat e that information into care planning o Provid e traditional foods and sourcing traditional ingredients if possible o Engag e and work with interpreters when needed o Engag e and retain diversity at all levels with FBCC organizations including care staff, supervisors, board of directors ' members and volunteers o Identify languages spoken by staff and assigning shifts to ensure langua ge suppor t Timing Next 24 months Financial Considerations Time and resource requirements for developing task force Support to provide training for cultural sensitivity, and diversity and inclusion Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 133 Classification: Public 4.2.4 Policy Direction 4: Improve coordination in the continuing care system, making it easier to navigate for the client and better integrated with other health, community, and social services. Recommendation # 12: Make easily understandable information about continuing care services available to all Albertans to assist with navigation. Supporting Rationale Most respondents to the public survey indicated that residents and caregivers have difficulty in accessing FBCC services Over 50 per cent of respondents to the public, facility operator and external organization surveys perceived that \"unnecessary system complexity \" was a challenge experienced by FBCC residents and caregivers Alberta Health and AHS recently launched the AHS Continuing Care Facility Directory. This could be used as a starting point for improving information sharing Clear and easily understandable information should be developed to explain the variety of available continuing c are services; this information should be available online for people who prefer or can do self -navigation o However, navigators should be available to support individuals with more complex needs (see Recommendation 1 3) Consideration should also be given to providing educational materials to Albertans on diseases related to aging (such as dementia, physical impairments, etc.) Expected Benefits Improved communication and access to information on continuing care programs and services A better understanding by clients and caregivers on how to navigate continuing care services in Alberta Improved attitudes towards the continuing care system by all system stakeholders Key Actions Required Create information materials that are understandable and easily accessible to improve the navigation of continuing care service options in Alberta The materials would be developed to share information more clearly with clients, potential residents, family members, community members, providers etc. o Materials could include paper and electronic web -based media o Materials should provid e a user-friendly description of services o Materials should be easy to find and suppo rted by navigators to guide Albertans in the use of continuing care services Align th e informatio n with communications materials of AHS and government departments, such as the AHS Continuing Care Facility Directory Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 134 Classification: Public Timing Next 12 months Financial Considerations Staff and resource support to develop and implement the Information Sharing and Communications Plan Cost of developing website content and print materials Cost of translating materials to other languages Recommendation #1 3: Pilot the use of a continuing care navigator function to improve the coordination of services between continuing care, primary care, acute care, mental health care and community/social service providers. Supporting Rationale The navigation function in continuing care in Alberta sits with the case management and case coordination function of the Home Care/ Community Care Case Managers o These case managers are responsible for assessing the continuing care needs of individuals and referring them to a range of continuing/community care services Existing navigation supports provided by non -profits and government agencies vary widely across regions and locations of care in Canada and tend to be for specific situations or health conditions o To mitigate this, some families are reaching out to private advocates and navigators, which creates inequity between those who can afford to hire these services and those who cannot146 Navigators have been found to be uniquely positioned to play an integral role in the changing environment of health care delivery by facilitating access to care, as well as addressing language and cu ltural barriers147 Most respondents to the public survey indicated that residents and caregivers have difficulty accessing FBCC services Over 50 per cent of respondents to the public, facility operator and external organization surveys perceived that \"unnec essary system complexity \" was a challenge experienced by FBCC residents and caregivers Indigenous stakeholders indicated that utilizing navigators would help Elders navigate the continuing care system in Alberta o In addition, professional therapists and ex ternal stakeholders who responded to the survey identified the use of navigators as an option for improving resident/caregiver navigation Expected Benefits More support for clients and caregivers who need to access health social service supports and alternative senior/special needs accommodation options in Alberta, thereby reducing frustration Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 135 Classification: Public Key Actions Required Pilot the Navigator function at the primary care, acute care or social/community service levels in a few urban settings and a few rura l settings o The Navigator function would be separate from case management but would work collaboratively with case managers o Also pilot the Navigator function specifically with Indigenous stakeholders Have the Navigator establish contacts with primary care physicians, home care case managers , FBCC sites, hospital emergency departments and admission/discharge offices, senior and special needs housing providers and community care and social services agencies o Indigenous Navigators would also establish connections with representatives from FNIHB, First Nation and M \u00e9tis Settlement home care staff, and M \u00e9tis Nation of Alberta representatives Assess the effectiveness of the function at different levels (i.e. primary care, acute care, social/community servic e levels) to determine if this function should be implemented province wide or not Timing Next 24 months Financial Considerations Additional funding to pilot new Navigator positions o Fund up to 10 positions to test the effectiveness of the role in different settings o The expected cost to pilot these 10 positions is $650,000 per year, including salaries and benefits Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 136 Classification: Public Recommendation #1 4: Pilot the use of some FBCC sites to function as the \"resource hub\" in communities where this approach would better meet community needs. Supporting Rationale Research has shown that strong community support services are needed to support seniors and persons with disabilities to receive care in the community FBCC sites are positioned to play the role as the \"community hub \" providing such community support services, particularly in cultural communities as well as more rural settings where there are typically less community and social supports available o A lack o f services available in small, rural, and northern communities was identified as a challenge to accessing continuing care services by FBCC staff o Indigenous stakeholders indicated that having a \"community hub \" could improve the coordination of continuing ca re services in their community FBCC sites have physical space, equipment, catering, and recreational spaces which could be shared with the community (this includes cultural, Indigenous and rural communities) FBCC sites could also provide respite and meal supports (including offering cultural meals) as well as home care services (on an outreach basis) to the community by drawing on its staffing pool Senior Lodge sites offer similar benefits in rural and remote communitie s where FBCC is not available and become \"community hubs \" to expand the reach of services Expected Benefits FBCC and Seniors Lodge sites and their surrounding communities will support each other to provide stronger neighbourhoods to enhance the goal of \"aging in place \", particularly in rural , cultural, and Indigenous communities FBCC would be able to broaden its role in the community, in areas such as day programs, support services, and respite care These communities would have better and stronger social networks to prevent isolation and loneliness of its seniors/elders Key Actions Required Determine the features of resource hub role. Options include: o Providing home care services to residents of the surrounding areas on an outreach basis Determine what additional staffing capacity is required to provide outreach home care services Work with AHS to coordinate home care service delivery o Serving as the resource for the community, providing educational and support -group services, as well as providing physical space for community development activities This undertaking could also include a partnership in the \"age friendly \" and \"dementia friendly \" initiatives Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 137 Classification: Public Determine which FBCC sites are positioned to act as a test site in their communities (consider sites in multiple settings such as cultural, Indigenous and rural communities) , including Senior Lodges in rural and remote areas and where Lodge Partnership Programs for joint Lodge/ FBCC spaces already exist o A formal endorsement of this role by the Government of Alberta would be useful to provide support of, and recognition for this role Timing Next 24 months Financial Considerations Providing pilot sites with the financial flexibility to act as resource hubs Determining the additional staffing requirements to provide outreach home care services Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 138 Classification: Public Recommendation #1 5: Improve case management in continuing care including consideration of responsibilities and functions, with a particular focus on DSL facilities. Supporting Rationale Currently, the case management function for LTC residents is the responsibility of LTC operators, but the case management function for DSL residents is the responsibility of AHS For DSL sites, operators are expected to provide working space for AHS case m anagers who are responsible for preparing the RAI assessment and care plans as well as the approval for transfers of DSL residents o Very often the assessment and care plans devised by the AHS case managers are prepared without the involvement of the DSL ca re staff AHS case manage rs are only at DSL sites during office hours on weekdays o If DSL staff need to send their residents to emergency departments or make an urgent transfer to another location of service, they have to locate the AHS case managers to obtain the latter 's approval before they can complete the transfer Survey and interview respondents identified a need to improve the integration of case management services across continuing care o DSL operators indicated that it would improve continuity of car e for residents and be more cost effective for their staff to provide case management functions as staff are already located in the same site The dichotomy of assessment/care planning functions being undertaken by AHS case managers and care delivery functions by DSL staff has created many problems in the delivery of services in DSL includ ing miscommunication, service gaps, and lack of continuity of care Expected Benefits Improved communication in the care planning of FBCC residents Delays incurred by the need to obtain untimely approval for transfer of DSL residents to emergency departments and other services could be avoided Key Actions Required Form a task force comprised of FBCC operators and representatives from Alberta Health and AHS to review the function , roles, and responsibilities of case management for FBCC residents o Identify opportunities to improve the case management function in FBCC, to ensure better c are planning and improved transitions throughout the health and social systems o Develop measures to monitor the effectiveness of the case management system Timing Next 24 months Financial Considerations Time and effort of Task Force members to develop and implement recommendations Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 139 Classification: Public 4.2.5 Policy Direction 5: Increase staffing hours and consistency of staffing to improve quality of care. Recommendation #1 6: Increase direct care hours (includes nursing, personal care and therapeutic) at FBCC sites to an average of 4.5 worked hours per resident day for LTC and up to an average of 4.0 worked hours per resident day for DSL within a four -year period. Supporting Rationale The availability of staff in FBCC sites (LTC and DSL) was a key area for improvement identified by respondents to all surveys o A need to increase staffing levels for HCAs, nursing staff, professional therapy staff, and non-professional therapy staff was ide ntified through survey and interview feedback FBCC staff reported high workload was an issue leading to decreased staff morale at their sites According to the H QCA, a predominant concern across multiple survey iterations for LTC and DSL was related to understaffing and high staff turnover o The Health Quality Council of Alberta LTC Family Experience Survey of 2017 stated that family members ' top recommendation for improvement was to ensure enough staff were available to meet residents ' care needs and staf f's job responsibilities Only 18 per cent of families said there were always enough nurses and health care aides Fifty-three per cent of respondents indicated that, in the previous six months, they had to help their family member with toileting because the nurses or aides either didn 't help or made them wait too long o The 2019 DSL Resident and Family Experience Family survey found that 43 per cent of residents and 23 per cent of family members felt there were always enough nurses and aides in the site The US Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) report to the US Congress, \"Appropriateness of minimum nurse staffing ratios in nursing homes \" in 2001, recommend ed 4.1 direct nursing and personal care hours per resident per day as the minimum for facilities, without which there could have adverse consequences o The recommended minimum hours were endorsed by many Canadian and international organizations o In December 2020, the Ontario government indicated that it would invest up to $1.9 billion annual ly to implement 4.0 hours of direct care daily for each LTC resident in Ontario within a four -year period o Manitoba is proposing 3.6 hours of care per resident day in legislation o Nova Scotia has 3.5-4.3 hours of direct care per resident day with minimum on e hour provided by a RN o PEI has 3.0 -3.8 minimum hours per resident day depending on level of care Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 140 Classification: Public AHS currently funds an average of 3. 4 direct hours of care per day for nursing , personal care , and professional and non -professional therapies for LTC residen ts; and an average of 2.7 - 3.0 direct hours of care per day for nursing, personal care, and professional and non -professional therapies for DSL4 and DSL4D residents o This funding level was implemented in 2014/15 and has not changed for six years while a t the same time, the acuity of Alberta FBCC residents has increased over this time span o The Christian Health Association of Alberta (CHAA) found that the actual LTC case mix index (CMI) for voluntary not -for-profit LTC operators increased from 105.3 in 2014/ 15 to 108.6 in 2019/20 o An analysis of RUG and CMI data for LTC facilities in Alberta provided by AHS shows that : There has been an increase in the number of resident days for RUG categories with higher CMI scores (RUG -III Category 1, 2 and 3) from 2014/15 to 2018/19 The analysis also showed a decrease in resident days for RUG categories with lower CMI scores (RUG -III Category 4, 5, and 6) over the same time frame This suggests there could be an increase in acuity of FBCC residents over this time frame The length of stay of Edmonton LTC residents decreased from 1.9 years in 2008 to 1.1 years in 2015, and for Calgary, it decreased from 1.8 years in 2008 to 1.3 in 2015 , indicating that residents entering LTC are now frailer than they were in the past The Ontario LTC staffing study found that r esidents would benefit from more involvement by allied health and other profes sionals such as occupational therapists, physiotherapists, social workers, and recreation therapists Based on stakeholder feedback, HQCA findings, and a review of studies and reports it is recommended that the direct hours of care in LTC and DSL be increas ed for nursing, personal care, and therapy staff to improve the quality of care provided to FBCC residents Expected Benefits The proposed increase in direct care hours may enable FBCC staff to provide a higher quality of care to residents while at the same time reducing staff stress and burnout There is expected to be less care incidents such as pressure sores, skin trauma, and weight loss and increased functional improvement for the residents as they receive more therapeutic support Resident and family satisfaction should also increase Key Actions Required The average nursing, therapeutic (e.g. physiotherapy, occupational therapy, mental health counseling, recreation supports etc.) and personal support direct care worked hours in LTC should be increased to 3. 7 hours for year 1 (2022/23), 4.0 hours year 2 (2023/24), and 4.3 hours for year 3 (2024/25) o After year 3, the funded hours should be reassessed against the acuity of the residents as well as the performance of quality indicators Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 141 Classification: Public o The proje cted increase in care hours for year 4 (2025/26) could be 4. 5 hours but it may be adjusted based on evaluation results The average nursing, therapeutic and personal support worked hours should be increased over four years as follows for DSL: o DSL4 - 2.7 hours to 3.5 hours o DSL4D - 3.0 to 4.0 hours Timing Next 4 years Financial Considerations The total projected cost for increasing the direct hours of care in FBCC based on 2020 service levels is $ 410 million o The preliminary estimated annual cost of increasing the direct hours of care from 3.4 to 4.5 for LTC is $ 266 million, once fully implemented (see Appendix 2) o The preliminary estimated annual cost of increasing the direct hours of care for DSL (see 4-year targets listed above) is $1 44 million per year once fully implemented (see Appendix 2) Continuing Care Stream Current State Cost Future State Cost Cost DifferenceAverage Annual Increase Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 142 Classification: Public Recommendation #1 7: Increase the level of professional care hours (nursing and therapeutic) for FBCC residents . Supporting Rationale Evaluation studies on staffing patterns show that different types of staff are appropriate for different types of FBCC residents, e.g., in place of RNs or LPNs, therapists may be more suitable to assist in the mobility of residents, or mental health profes sionals in the mental wellbeing of residents Many research studies have shown that higher direct nursing care hours lead to less restraint use, fewer pressure ulcers, decreased probability of hospitalization, decreased mortality, and decreased urinary trac t infections in LTC facilities The CMS study which proposed 4.1 direct nursing and personal care hours for LTC facilities also proposed a minimum 0.75 RN hours per resident day, and 0.55 LPN hours per resident day AHS data show that DSL (which does not have RN coverage) has a higher rate of transfer of residents to hospital emergency departments Increasing the availability of professional therapy supports was reported as an area for improvement in the stakeholder engagement surveys , and t here needs to be flexibility in the staffing pattern to address these needs Expected Benefits Better quality outcomes should be achieved if more appropriate staff types are used for care Reduced adverse outcomes in FBCC sites such as pressure ulcers, urinary tract infect ions, and lessen the need for transfer to hospital emergency departments Increased flexibility by FBCC operators to use care hours to provide therapeutic supports (recreation, mental health, etc.) when appropriate Improved quality of care and quality of life for FBCC residents Key Actions Required Amend accountability requirements for staffing for FBCC sites Regularly review data regarding changes of length of stay, and acuity of the FBCC population Assess the need for the proportionate increase of professional care staffing funded annually as the acuity of FBCC population changes Timing Next 4 years Financial Considerations Funding increases to support increased professional care , which have been included in the cost estimates in Recommendation 1 6 Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 143 Classification: Public Recommendation #1 8 Increase the level of mental health professional supports for FBCC residents. Supporting Rationale Increasing the availability of mental health wellness supports was reported as an area for improvement in the resident/caregiver, FBCC staff, FBCC administrator, and external stakeholder surveys , and t here needs to be flexibility in the staffing pattern to address these needs The National Institute of Aging found that COVID -19 has significantly increased Canadians ' feelings of social isolation and loneliness The 2019/20 Alberta LTC Resident Profile shows that 36 per cent of residents have depression Expected Benefits Improved mental wellness supports for FBCC residents Key Actions Required Assess the need for additional mental wellness supports for FBCC residents Ensure that the increase in direct care hours from Recommendation 1 6 includes staffing considerations for enhancing mental wellness supports Provide FBCC staff with education/resources to understand mental wellness Timing Next 4 years Financial Considerations Provide flexibility in direct hours of care and staffing mix to provide additional mental health supports o This includes increasing direct hours of care allocated for this purpose Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 144 Classification: Public Recommendation #1 9: Support FBCC operators to implement consistent staffing assignments. Supporting Rationale Interview and survey respondents reported that improving the consistency* of staffing assignments could improve the quality of care provided to FBCC residents o Consistency of staffing could provide better knowledge of care needs, better relationships between staff and residents, and limit the potential for miscommunication between staffing shifts Expected Benefits An expectation that better care outcomes for FBCC residents can be achieved The potential to improve workplace satisfaction and engagement for FBCC staff Key Actions Required Facility management leadership to assign consistent staffing assignments for each FBCC resident o Recommendations 16, 17 and 21 should provide operators with supports to implement more consistent staffing assignments Alberta Health and AHS can support this recommendation by communicat ing the importance of consistent staffing assignments and provid ing examples of how to do it o Alberta Health and AHS can also explore ways in which to make this a requirement of operators by changing standards Timing Next 12 Months Financial Considerations None *Assigning the same staff members to care for a resident to the degree it is possible Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 145 Classification: Public 4.2.6 Policy Direction 6: Develop a Workplace Improvement Action Plan to enhance working conditions for staff working in both FBCC and home care. Recommendation # 20: Develop a provincial Human Resource Strategy for continuing care (taking into consideration FBCC, home care, etc.). Supporting Rationale Alberta will have the fastest growing aging population in Canada over the next ten years and will need a workforce with special training and understanding in continuing care and geriatric services o Knowledge of the aging process, dementia, chronic disease management, and palliative care will also be necessary in the delivery of continuing care services for all types of roles including administration and management, through to front -line and support staff COVID -19 has demonstrated the instability of the supply of the workforce in FBCC particularly with respect to HCAs o Special attention must be paid to ways to attract potential HCAs, to enhance their training, and then to retain them to work in FBCC Cultural change and leadership were identified by many reports as key in transforming the current sys tem The Human Resource Strategy needs to identify ways of attracting qualified leaders and enhancing their training to enrich the future delivery of continuing care services Expected Benefits This plan should enable the training and provision of qualified staff to address the health care needs of Alberta 's aging population through the continuing care system Key Actions Required The Human Resource Strategy should address the future human resource requirements needed to reform the continuing care system as per the recommendations in this report Key steps to develop the plan include: o Develop a forecasting methodology for the demand and supply of staff to meet the needs of the continuing care system The model should specify the types and numbers of health care providers such as physicians, geriatricians, nurse practitioners, registered nurses, licensed practical nurses, therapists, and health care aides The model should address the staffing requirements needed to meet the increase in direct care hours proposed in Recommendation 1 6 Collaborate with post secondary institutions to ensure sufficient training spaces are created Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 146 Classification: Public Market this area of work to potential students Timing Next 36 months Financial Considerations Staff time (multiple stakeholders and organizations) and investments to support the development of the forecasting model and the Human Resource Strategy Recommendation # 21: Establish a full -time employment benchmark for nursing, therapeutic and health care aide staff for FBCC and include the benchmark as one of the quality indicators for monitoring facility care. Supporting Rationale Having a high percentage of care staff with part -time employment is not beneficial to the consistency of care provided to FBCC residents Prior to COVID -19, 69 per cent of HCAs and 74 per cent of RNs in FBCC sites worked part -time or casual hours HCAs and professional therapy staff both expresse d an interest in increasing the number of full - time positions at their facilities in the respective surveys Nursing staff expressed an interest in having a more balanced mix of full -time and part -time positions The high use of part -time positions creates instability and an unhealthy working environment in FBCC o In critical times such as the flu season and during pandemics, this instability is extremely detrimental to the normal functioning of FBCC sites The current Public Health Order in response to the COVID-19 pandemic mandates all care staff of FBCC sites work in a single facility o Alberta Health established a data base on single -site policy and worked with AHS to allocate staff to single sites More than 95 per cent of existing staff have now been deployed to work in single sites o Prior to the single site policy, part -time staff often worked at more than one facility It is expected that the employment situation will revert to the pre -COVID situation after the expiration of the Public Health Order, if there is no further government intervention The COVID -19 pandemic has exposed the danger of having a high percentage of part -time workers in FBCC sites Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 147 Classification: Public Expected Benefits An expected increase in organizational and labour force stability in FBCC sites in times of high sick time, pandemic, and high staff turnover The quality and consistency of care provided to residents should improve Expected improvements in the working conditions for care staff and overall job satisfaction Key Actions Required Alberta to establish a full -time employment benchmark for nursing, professional and non - professional therapy and HCA positions in FBCC sites in consultation with industry associations, labour groups, operators, and AHS o The benchmark can be expressed as a percentage or proportion of the workforce o The goal of the benchmark is to safeguard the organizational stability of FBCC sites to ensure quality of care Implement the benchmark and establish it as one of the care indicat ors for monitoring FBCC Timing Next 24 months Financial Considerations Increasing the number of full -time employees may have financial implications for some employers related to additional benefits cost Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 148 Classification: Public Recommendation # 22: Form a Workforce Improvement Task Force to assess ways of improving workforce design, workforce culture and working conditions for staff working in FBCC. Supporting Rationale Workforce issues were identified as significant problem in FBCC sites by multiple studies148,149,150 o One specific problem relates to the non -regulated and insufficient training of HCAs who provide 70 per cent to 90 per cent of care in FBCC o The Government of Alberta has recently announced Bill 46: Health Statutes Amendment Act Bill 46, which introduces the regulation of HCAs under the College of Licensed Practical Nurses of Alberta , which i f passed, will enhance the regulation of care provided by HCAs and could lead to higher standards of training and service All FBCC staff responding to the FBCC surveys reported a need to improve workplace supports, training, and recognition for FBCC staff , as well as a desire to increase the use of collaborative care teams to provide care and have improved communication between management and staff The University of Alberta 's TREC project (Translating Research in Elder Care) has identified ways of improving working conditions for HCAs as well Expected Benefits Improving working conditions and workplace culture should improve employee engagement and satisfaction for FBCC staff Empowered and engaged staff should enhance the quality of care and life of FBCC residents Key Actions Required The Workforce Improvement Task Force should develop strategies to: o Improve workforce culture in FBCC o Emphasize team planning o Provide opportunities for and empower all team members to be leaders o Cultivate a learning culture by encouraging continuing education and career -laddering o Collaborate with universities, colleges/certificate programs, educators, and researchers to enable continuing care staff to participate in research and education opportunities The Task Force should develop specific actions to promote more stable , full-time positions in FBCC, to enhance sick pay and fringe benefits , and improve wage parity for FBCC workers A team concept in care planning should be used, and HCAs should be accepted as team members and included in care conferences for residents Timing Next 24 months Financial Considerations Staff time (multiple stakeholders and organizations) and investments to support the development and implementation of the Workforce Improvement Task Force Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 149 Classification: Public 4.2.7 Policy Direction 7: Expand the choices available to Albertans who require continuing care services. Recommendation #2 3: Introduce self -directed care as an option for people assessed as needing continuing care (expanding the option within home care and introducing FBCC options), to provide greater choice regarding locations, types, and providers of services. Supporting Rationale Users of the continuing care system indicated that current services are provided in an overly restrictive manner prohibiting resident choice on the types, locations, and providers of services o A self -directed system of care enables continuing care clients to hav e this choice o This type of self -directed care system is already implemented in countries like Japan, Australia, Germany, and France o Self-directed care will permit clients to use an approved level of public funding to purchase services from a provider of choice A self -directed system of care would allow individuals who require high levels of support to choose to live outside of FBCC , and allow relatives (except direct family members and spouses) to receive government support for providing care for these in dividuals Survey respondents were open to using public funding to receive care in the home but were less receptive to using public funding to receive care in private pay facilities The existing self -managed care funding option through home care is utilized successfully in Alberta but does not get offered consistently across the province and is not available to people assessed as requiring FBCC Income testing should be considered to ensure fairness and sustainability of the system Expected Bene fits More choice is provided to continuing care clients regarding the location, types, and providers of services o It will allow clients to have more choice in the type of accommodation they live in while still receiving publicly funded care It will broaden the delivery of the \"FBCC types \" of services to include a variety of non -publicly built sites, thus reducing public funds needed to build more FBCC spaces It will encourage innovation in the design of models of care, as well as provide the impetus for the development of a variety of supportive housing options including campuses of care, shared housing, co -operative housing, cottage type smaller homes, intergenerational housing, student/older adults shared housing etc. Key Actions Required Develop a self-directed care program that a llows clients to choose to access services through FBCC or receive direct care funding to provide them with the choice of their own provider of services Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 150 Classification: Public Implement income testing to support the model Develop a consistent and reliable method for assessing self -directed care clients, and a methodology for costing assessed services Pilot and evaluate the new self -directed system model Develop associated legislation, regulations, directives, policies etc. to provide authority for the funding of the model Develop a new monitoring and enforcement system to support the model (Recommendation 24) Timing Planning and piloting to take place over the next 12 months (2022 to 2023) Implementation to take place over the following 24 months (2023 to 2025) Financial Considerations It is expected that up to 5 to 10 per cent of clients would use this model once it is fully implemented It is expected that self -directed care services will be funded at 80 per cent of the costs to provide the same service in a continuing care facility or through AHS home care Administrative costs are estimated to be 10 per cent of funded service costs Overall, the projected annual cost savings to the system by 2030 for self -direct ed care is approximately $23 million (see Appendix 2), assuming 6.3 per cent utilization of the program Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 151 Classification: Public Recommendation #2 4: Develop a monitoring mechanism for the self-directed system of care. Supporting Rationale A new self -directed system of care is recommended to give more choice to individuals with respect to the types of providers and location of care. If this new type of care is to proceed, a new monitoring mechanism must be developed for the following reasons: o Protection of the recipients of care who may be vulnerable, frail, and receiving care at home or in private pay settings o Unregulated service -providers are not currently held to the same standards or inspected in the same manner as FBCC sites, and thus ove rsight by a third party is needed o A need to ensure that public funds are being used as intended based on the assessments provided to clients Survey respondents all identified a need to properly monitor self -directed care Expected Benefits Upholding quality and safety for clients who choose to access self -directed care at home or in private pay settings Key Actions Required Design a new monitoring mechanism for the self -directed system of care Determine who will have the authority and responsibility for monitoring self -directed care services o The monitoring mechanism should be simple and not pose a barrier to the provision of services o The monitoring mechanism should have the credibility to gain the confidence of the public o Based on survey feedback, stakeholders would like to see regular inspections, with the results shared publicly Timing Development and piloting to commence the next 12 months (2022/23) with implementation to follow the next 12 months (2023/24) Financial Considerations Staff time and resources to design and implement the monitoring system The projected cost for administering and monitoring the self -directed care program is 10 per cent of funded service costs (Appendix 2) Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 152 Classification: Public Recommendation # 25: Enhance client choice by supporting a greater percentage of continuing care clients in the community rather than FBCC sites. Supporting Rationale Survey respondents all showed a preference for options where clients could receive publicly funded care at home versus in a private -pay facility Seniors have repeatedly stated their preference to \"age in place \" at home ; however, the current system of continuing care does not provide individuals with many choices if they need higher levels of care CIHI has shown that one in nine residents currently admitted to LTC in Canada could have been looked after at home In comparison with other countries, \"about 90 per cent of funding for seniors ' care in Canada is directed to institutional care with only 10 per cent directed to home - and community -based long-term care o Canada falls well below the OECD average of 35 per cent of LTC expenditures being directed to home and community care151 o In Alberta, home care costs represent 23 per cent of total continuing care costs This report recommends increasing home care and social supports in the community as well as introducing a client -directed system of delivery of continuing care in Alberta with an accelerated increase in a variety of supportive living and home -based options to be provided to individuals as alternativ es to institutional care o Many jurisdictions (such as New York, New Brunswick) have successfully developed projects to delay or avoid admitting seniors to LTC The average care cost per day for a LTC facility space is $202, for DSL -4D $159, for DSL -4 $147, for DSL -3 $100, and for long -term home care (LTHC) $35 o It is estimated that, for complex care home care clients, the care cost per day would be $112, approximately half the cost of care provided in a LTC setting Policy leadership in shifting funds from institutional expenses to supportive housing and home - based services is needed Expected Benefits Seniors, and people living with disabilities can \"age in the right place \" and receive continuing care services at home or at their location of their choic e Key Actions Required Government of Alberta support the development of multiple options and multiple streams in the delivery of continuing care services It is recommended that a target o f shifting from FBCC spaces to community -services be set annually Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 153 Classification: Public o The shift should be evaluated by measuring its impact on client satisfaction and quality of life, and the quality of care provided Under this system, the \"assessed continuing care needs \" of clients would be determined by trained assessors using the scientifically tested RAI -tools o The \"assessed continuing care needs \" will be publicly funded and provided o This transformational change should take place over a three -year period from 2022 -2025 o Self-directed care options will also be made available, as per Recommendation 2 3 Consideration for innovative approaches to increase community supports for continuing care clients should be examined to delay and prevent admission of high -needs clients to FBCC sites Government of Alberta to provide legislative framework and monitoring mechanisms for these new options Timing Next 3 years, 2022 -2025 Financial Considerations If the Government of Alberta continues to provide care with the same distribution of services across LTC, DSL (3, 4 and 4D), and LTHC, the projected annual cost for continuing care services to meet demand in 2030 is $4.2 1 billion, $1.8 4 billion more than the cost of services t oday By shifting care to a model where the percentage of continuing care clients receiving LTHC services increases from 61 per cent (current) to 70 per cent (desired), the projected annual cost for continuing care services increases to $3.76 billion in 203 0, an increase of $1.39 billion compared to the cost of services today, but a reduction of $452 million per year compared to providing care with the same distribution of services (Appendix 2) Projected Operating Cost of Current Model of Care (61 per cent LTHC/39 per cent FBCC) in 2030 Projected Operating Cost of New Model (Shift to 70 per cent LTHC /30 per cent FBCC ) in 2030 Cost Difference in 2030 New Model - Current Model $4,207,017,382 $3,755,435,827 -$451,581,555 Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 154 Classification: Public 4.2.8 Policy Direction 8: Consolidate monitoring pro cesses and improve the coordination of inspections, while enhancing accountability and public reporting. Recommendation #2 6: Develop and implement a more coordinated and integrated system of monitoring where oversight bodies consolidate and integrate their efforts where possible when inspecting FBCC sites. Supporting Rationale Alberta Health and AHS are both involved in monitor ing and inspecting FBCC sites. Historically, Alberta Health and AHS had done separate site visits to inspect facilities, creating a layer of duplication with inspections o Operators expressed concerns about the amount of time taken by multiple inspections, with inspectors sometimes asking similar questions o Visits are perceived as not being coordinated and can sometimes be disruptive to care o The issue of duplication in monitoring and inspecting FBCC sites has been looked at multiple times historically, further demonstrating a need to change the way that monitoring is carried out o Survey and interview respondents reported that Alberta Health and AHS had improved the coordination of audits during the COVID -19 pandemic, and that this could be carried forward to improving the coordination of audits in the future Respondents to the resident, families/caregivers, public, and FBCC administration surveys all support the importance of audits, including those that are unannounced to uphold accountability Expected B enefits Minimize the duplication and sometimes inconsistency of reviews by improving the coordination of monitoring between oversight bodies and consolidating the inspection protocols used by all oversight bodies Save the time of facility staff in dealing with multiple individuals from a variety of agencies Key Actions Required It is recommended that the monitoring agencies design a coordinated review process and try to conduct reviews as a team if possible. In addition, timing for the reviews of the same facility should be coordinated to avoid disruption to the facility Individual agencies should still have the authority to conduct specialized and independent inspections when necessary Timing Next 24 months Financial Considerations Time commitments from Alberta Health and AHS staff to work together and improve the coordination of monitoring activities Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 155 Classification: Public Recommendation # 27: Enhance the evaluation of, and public reporting on, the performance of all ownership types in FBCC . Supporting Rationale The survey results demonstrated that public and external organization respondents had a much lower perception of the quality of care at FBCC sites, than residents, families/caregivers and FBCC staff and management o Given that public per ception is currently not aligned with the perception of residents and staff at FBCC sites, there is a need for improving transparency and public reporting on the performance of all FBCC sites Some public stakeholders are advocating that private -for-profit -owned FBCC sites should not be funded going forward Ownership of LTC facilities has become a matter of public interest, particularly in view of the devastating impact of COVID -19 on LTC facilities o Private -for-profit LTC facilities in some cases have experienced higher COVID -19 outbreaks and fatalities , which has led to calls for the review of private -for-profit ownership of LTC facilities The Public Health and Emergency Measures Working Group of the CD Howe Institute researched the incidence of COVID -19 outbreaks in public and private -for-profit LTC and concluded that many factors could have significant effects on the severity of outbreaks includ ing staffing levels, size and configuration of rooms, facility layout, and patient complexity o It recommended that \"all provincial governments should work to address the ongoing challenges in the residential care sector and seniors ' care more generally \" Descr iptive statistics suggest that private -for-profit LTC/DSL facilities have a higher incidence of outbreaks in Alberta ; however, the incidence of COVID -19 outbreaks is largely correlated with rates of community transmission near the facility and facility siz e, which could explain this difference o The spread of COVID -19 in all these facilities showed the importance of improving the monitoring and enforcement mechanisms of FBCC sites in the future The HQCA measures the quality of care of the three ownership type s of FBCC sites in Alberta regularly in its survey reports o Its latest LTC Family Experience Survey Report of April 2018 indicated that there were no statistically significant differences in family experiences with the overall care rating across operator ty pes (AHS, private -for-profit and not -for-profit) The overall care rating was 8.6 for AHS facilities, 8.2 for private -for-profit facilities, and 8.2 for not -for-profit facilities Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 156 Classification: Public o Similarly, the overall care ratings for DSL facilities in the 2019 DSL Famil y Experience Report were also similar with 8.5 for AHS facilities, 8.2 for private -for-profit facilities and 8.6 for not -for-profit facilities The overall care ratings provided by residents were also similar with 7.7 for AHS facilities, 7.7 for private -for-profit facilities, and 8.0 for not -for-profit facilities Each FBCC ownership type has its unique strengths and contribut es to the diversity, efficiency, and effectiveness of the Alberta continuing care system o It is beneficial for Alberta to have the con tinued contribution of these ownership types In the U.S.A. and many other countries, inspection reports of LTC facilities, their staffing patterns, worked hours of care, services provided, performance on outcome indicators are posted on their respective we b sites for residents and families to be able to review o Alberta should strive to make public reporting on indicators relating to FBCC sites a priority Enhanced evaluation and reporting of outcomes for all ownership types is needed to inform the public of the strengths and weaknesses of all FBCC sites to better inform decisions and public opinion Expected Benefits Enhanced transparency and accountability for Albertans on the quality of care provided by facilities operating under all ownership types The ability for FBCC residents and caregivers to make more informed choices about which type of facility (i.e. private -for-profit, not -for-profit, AHS) they want to receive care from Key Actions Required Support the continuation of the three ownership types (public, not -for-profit, and private -for- profit) of FBCC sites in Alberta Improve the monitoring and enforcement mechanisms for the review of these FBCC sites (as per Recommendations 3, 2 5, 26 and 28). Enhance the evaluation of, and public reporting on, the operational and quality performance of these three ownership types , including any violation of regulations/ standards (Recommendation 27). Timing Immediate Financial Considerations Ongoing staffing and resource support for monitoring all sites by Government of Alberta. Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 157 Classification: Public Recommendation #2 8: Enhance enforcement procedures for facilities violating government regulations, standards, and/or public health orders. Supporting Rationale Many studies in other jurisdictions have cited monitoring, enforcement, compliance and reporting as important vehicles for improving quality of care in LTC (e.g. Ontario COVID -19 Commission Interim Reports, Commonwealth Fund Research Report) Respondents to the facility operator and external stakeholder surveys noted a need to shift the focus of audits f rom processes to facility outcomes Alberta recently started publicly reporting the results of accommodation standards audits and are moving to do the same for health service standards audits which could be used as a starting point to improve the reporting of results Continuous quality improvement activities are needed as a follow -up of any review Alberta Health, training insti tutions, and professional bodies can all play a role in providing training and educational materials in areas identified as common care challenges in Alberta based on inspection reports Expected Benefits Continuous quality improvement, enhanced accountability for facilities, and increased transparency for end -users of FBCC services Key Actions Required Post inspection reports on FBCC sites on appropriate web sites Identify the important indicators pertaining to FBCC sites for public reporting and plan to report these indicators to the public on a regular basis. Include Alberta Health , AHS, FBCC operators and other impacted or key stakeholders in this process o Identif y process and timelines for developing and implementing improvement plans o Determine enforcement penalty options, should implementation of improvement plans be unsuccessful Focus reporting on resident outcomes, rather than outputs and processes Provide fac ilities that violate standards with the opportunity to address deficiencies by developing improvement plans o Alberta Health should provide quality improvement staff supports as required to develop improvement plans o Have operators report on progress on implementing improvement plans o Enforce penalty options, should implementation of improvement plans be unsuccessful Provide an update on the progress that sites have made to address deficiencies on appropriate websites Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 158 Classification: Public Timing Next 24 months Financial Considerations Staff time and resources to support enhanced enforcement and reporting Recommendation # 29: Introduce added transparency for the funding and reporting of AHS owned and operated FBCC sites by requiring independent audited site -specific financial statements for its FBCC operations, as is required of other FBCC operators. Supporting Rationale Private -for-profit and private not -for-profit operators produce audited financial statements and provide annual financial reports for FIRM S Some concerns have been expressed regarding the ownership of FBCC sites by AHS o The perceived problem relates to the fact that the funding amount for these facilities is not transparent, leading to the suspicion that they may be more high ly funded than other FBCC sites o In addition, it is seen by some as a conflict of interest that AHS staff inspect and audit their own facilities The FBCC Review recommends AHS ownership be continued as one of the three ownership types of facilities because public facilities have unique strengths and contributions in the Alberta system o In addition, some AHS rural facilities are of smaller size, managed as combined facilities with acute care hospitals , and i t would be difficult to find another operator in this kind of circumstance AHS-owned -and-operated facilities should be subject to the same funding policies as other FBCC sites Expected Benefits Improved transparency related to the performance of AHS owned and operated FBCC sites in Alberta Key Actions Required AHS-owned -and-operated FBCC sites should provide independent audited financial statements to Alberta Health for its FBCC operations (AHS owned and subsidiaries) apart from overall AHS operations Timing Next 12 months Financial Considerations Additional staff time from AHS to develop separate financial reports for each site Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 159 Classification: Public 4.2.9 Policy Direction 9: Optimize the use of technology, research, and innovation in transforming FBCC . Recommendation # 30: Develop and implement a \"Research, Innovation and Technology Strategy for Continuing Care \" in Alberta . Supporting Rationale Seniors have indicated their desire to use alternative models of care, different from the design and care delivery method of current FBCC The McMaster Health Forum developed an evidence brief that shows technology has a significant role to play in addressing fundamental problems that currently exist in FBCC as well as for improving resident quality of care and quality of life o Technology can improve the delivery of care through im proving clinical and personal care tasks /processes, information management, education, communication with staff and family members/friends, and supporting primary caregivers Innovation in FBCC could be supported through two approaches: o The first component is to develop an Innovation Funding envelope for FBCC operators to utilize technology in the delivery of care o Second, t he Government of Alberta could empower the collaboration of a number of government departments (e.g. A lberta Health , Alberta Innovates, and Jobs, Economy and Innovation Department) to work with the industry sector and sponsors to develop a long-term investment strategy for the development of innovations for FBCC Expected Benefits The innovative services and technology d eveloped could broaden the range and variety of continuing care options available to Albertans Partnerships with industry could bring economic and commercial activity in this area linking technology development with services to seniors Key Actions Required Develop an Innovation Funding envelope for FBCC operators to fund the use of technology in the delivery of FBCC services o Funding should be made available to support the purchase of new equipment as well as ongoing annual operating costs Examples of the u se of technology in care delivery include : use of assistive and robotic technology for care delivery; medication monitoring, monitoring of falls, health incidences and wandering , and SMART condo -living o Operators should demonstrate the benefits (outcomes and financial) of these technologies after they are in op eration Develop a long -range partnership with industry and sponsors to invest in innovations such as: Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 160 Classification: Public o Digital transformation of FBCC systems: Design digital entry to continuing care where individuals can view and assess facility sites, assess suitability of individual home for their own needs and view service options o Facility Design: Campus of Care; Dementia Villages; Intergenerational Housing; Co - operative Housing; Student/Older Adults Com panion Care Shared Housing ; laneway homes Develop forums for e xploratory discussions and planning amongst innovative technology planners, design engineers, architects, aging experts, and university researchers on new ways of providing continuing care o Estab lish partnerships with universities and colleges for research and education in the area of continuing care Create a Task Force to plan for the development of a long -range Research, Innovation and Technology Strategy for Continuing Care Schedule Think Tank sessions and forums with national and international experts regarding new technology, innovation and facility design enhancements for future transformation of continuing care Timing Next 10 years, 2021 to 2031 Financial Considerations Development of an innovation fund to support FBCC operators with the cost of purchasing and implementing technology into their day -to-day operations Government of Alberta staff time and resources needed to support the development of a task force and innovation fund Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 161 Classification: Public 4.2.10 Policy Direction 10: Ensure sustainability and affordability for the future of continuing care. Recommendation #3 1: Focus government capital investments on the regeneration or replacement of existing FBCC spaces, with some funding ear -marked for the development of new spaces where needed. Supporting Rationale AHS estimates that there are over 8,000 FBCC spaces in facilities that are over 40 years of age which no longer meet current design standards , and an additional 800 to 1000 spaces need to be developed each fiscal year to replace the 8,000 spaces at end of useful life o In addition, it is estimated that there will be another 2,475 spaces that will be 40 years or older by 2030 which will also require replacement , bringing the total requirement for replacement to 10,475 spaces o Approximately 6,800 FBCC spaces are in shared accommodations; most of these spaces are in older LTC facilities However, 720 of these spaces are in sites less than 30 years of age Past capital grant funding programs were focused on the development of new spaces to increase capacity in the system , and going forward, consideration should be given to provide funding to replacing existing aged facility spaces o The levels of grant funding should also be examined with consideration for increasing grant levels for LTC spaces versus DSL spaces o An analysis of the accommodation fee margins for private -for-profit and private not -for- profit LTC operators revealed little margin is available to fund debt -service obligations for capital developme nt (see Appendix 2) o However, the margin for private -for-profit and private not -for-profit DSL operators could support a higher debt structure to fund capital development projects with the same level of government capital grant funding (see Appendix 2) The average capital construction cost for a FBCC space in 2018/19 currency is $250,000 for private -for-profit operators, $337,400 for not -for-profit operators, and $575,000 for public operators Expected Benefits Improved quality of life for residents by replacing aged infrastructure with more modern and safe facilities Improvements to infection prevention and control The potential to improve sustainability for the Alberta continuing care system, by providing opportunities to attract more private development to replace aged infrastructure versus the full cost to replace an AHS space Key Actions Required Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 162 Classification: Public Re-examine the approach to providing capital grant funding to replace aged infrastructure over the next 10 years Focus capital construction investments in Year 1 and Year 2 (2022/23 and 2023 -24) on the regeneration of existing FBCC spaces to improve the living environments of FBCC residents, with some funding for the development of new spaces o The focus should contin ue to be on providing private rooms for residents o Options for replacing aged FBCC spaces should include the development of spaces to support a variety of models of care such as smaller homes and campus of care concepts It is assumed that 1,120 replacement spaces and 637 new spaces will be developed in smaller home settings o Options for replacing aged FBCC spaces with zero capital options should also be considered, and 10 per cent of the needed replacement spaces (1,120 spaces) is assumed to be covered by th is option In year 3, 2024/25, further models of care and home/community -based services would be expanded, while continuing to replace aged infrastructure It is projected that a total of 17,565 spaces (11,195 for replacement and 6,370 new FBCC spaces) will be developed to support the shift proposed in Recommendation 25 above o It is projected that an additional 1,930 new FBCC spaces will be developed to meet the needs of Indigenous communities (Appendix 2) Form an Implementation Team to strategize the developm ent and implementation of policies, staffing, and service options required Timing Next 10 years Begin the shift to replace aged spaces versus build new capacity immediately over the next 12 months Financial Considerations The projected cost of replacing aged infrastructure, developing spaces to support a variety of models of care, and add ing new DSL spaces as part of the shift to care in the community (thereby not needing to increase LTC capacity), is $ 2.74 billion (in 2020 dollars) by the year 2030 o This is approximately $2. 19 billion lower than costs associated with increasing capacity by 2030 to meet demand while maintain ing the current distribution of services in 2030 (see Appendix 2) o Note, t he projected savings from replacing 10 per cent of aged FBCC spaces with zero cap options will result in savings of $335.5 million that could used for capital upgrades at other sites.

Supporting Rationale FBCC residents pay for their housing costs through an accommodation fee o Alberta has the highest average actual FBCC accommodation fee in Canada o The maximum accommodation charge in Alberta has been increasing over the last five years based on the core inflation rate in Alberta This practice has been improving the margin for operators, but the accommodation margin is still not sufficient to cover debt -service costs for capital replacement/development for LTC operators Alberta should continue the practice of increasing accommodation fees annually based on the co re inflation rate in Alberta The accommodation fee in Alberta does not cover the full cost of room and board for private - not-for profit LTC operators and for AHS operated FBCC spaces o Many operators need to subsidize the accommodation costs of their facilities with care funding All survey respondents (including a majority of facility operators) showed a strong preference for not increasing the accommodation fees in Alberta o There is a concern that the fee is already too high for FBCC residents, and th at increasing the fees would make FBCC more unaffordable for Albertans The current practice of having Alberta Seniors and Housing subsidize the accommodation fee for low-income residents should continue to remain in place Expected Benefits Increased funding to support accommodation operations for FBCC operators over time Predictable increases to accommodation fees for FBCC residents and operators, based on established practices and regulations Key Actions Required Modify the regulations governing FBC C accommodation fees to provide Alberta Health with the flexibility to increas e accommodation fees beyond the core inflation rate in Alberta o Any increases beyond the core inflation rate in any given year should be explained , with the explanation posted on the Alberta Health website Maintain the current practice of having Alberta Seniors and Housing subsidize the accommodation fee for low -income FBCC residents but change the process for flowing subsidy funding such that Alberta Seniors and Housin g flows the subsidy directly to the FBCC operators to eliminate the need for residents to have to transfer the subsidy to operators Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 164 Classification: Public Timing Immediately Financial Considerations The accommodation fee margin for operators should continue to improve over time, freeing up funds to support capital upgrades and replacement of aged infrastructure Recommendation #3 3: Evaluate the P CBF funding model, its underlying assumptions/principles/objectives, and associated impacts on FBCC . Supporting Rationale PCBF was implemented in Alberta in 2010 as a method for funding LTC operations (DSL sites are not funded by this model) While there is general support for the case -mix funding methodology, there have been concerns expressed about the funding level and fund ing policies of PCBF includ ing: insufficient funding for hours of care; lack of appropriate consideration of rising acuity; inequitable compensation of wages between the three LTC facility ownership types; lack of compensation for fringe and pension benefits for staff; insufficient funding for facilities with smaller space sizes; and rigid accountability measures These concerns are documented in the Christian Health Association of Alberta (CHAA) study on the \"Economic and Operational Impact Patient Ca re Based Funding on Not -for-Profit Operators of Long-Term Care Spaces January 2021\" o Alberta Continuing Care Association operators also have expressed similar concerns Although t he mandate of the current FBCC Review does not include an in -depth review of the PCBF funding system , it is recommended that a separate in -depth study of the PCBF system be conducted as soon as possible to address these concerns Expected Benefits A more equitable and adequate funding system to address the needs of all FBCC reside nts Key Actions Required Conduct an in -depth study to evaluate the underlying assumptions/principles/objectives of the PCBF funding model and the associated impact s on Alberta FBCC sites to improve funding for FBCC services o Revise the PCBF model based on the recommendations of the study, and communicate the changes to government, AHS and FBCC operators Ensure that d ecisions on appropriate funded hours of care are based on evidence -based research Timing Next 12 months (2022 -2023) Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 165 Classification: Public Financial Considerations Funding to conduct an in -depth review of PCBF funding model Significant investment of time of A lberta Health , AHS, operators to support the review Recommendation # 34: Examine methods for funding the operation of smaller homes to facilitate their implem entation. Supporting Rationale Research shows that a smaller, home -like setting is more suitable for the care of some residents, (such as individuals living with dementia), resulting in improved quality of life and care outcomes for residents Smaller homes are more suitable for some rural areas and Indigenous communities, where the population is too small to support the building of a larger FBCC site These homes need multi -skilled workers (including specialized training to support those living with dem entia) to handle all aspects of personal care for the residents, including activities of daily living, personal care, light housekeeping, and meal preparation The current funding formula was designed for sites with high space counts and isn 't seen as appro priate for smaller homes Expected Benefits Better care outcomes, and increased resident choice Key Actions Required Develop a new funding method for the staffing and operation of smaller homes o Examine approaches to improve efficiencies with operating smaller homes, for example clustering them in campus of care settings to share services (i.e. laundry, food services etc.) Timing Next 12 months Financial Considerations Time requirements of Government of Alberta and AHS to explore how to appropriately fund small facilities There may be funding implications associated with implementing a small home funding mode Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 166 Classification: Public Recommendation # 35: Review and standardize the types of fees and charges in all streams of continuing care, including long -term care, designated supportive living, and home care, to improve consistency and equity. Supporting Rationale Currently, medication, equipment, and medical supplies are provided to LTC facility residents free of charge as are ambulance and medical transfers , while c onversely, residents of DSL and home care clients are responsible for these costs (although programs exist to subsidize low income individuals and individuals over the age of 65 for some expense s) In addition, residents of DSL are sometimes asked to pay other charges (such as damage deposits or charges for toiletries) that LTC residents are not required to pay It has been reported anecdotally that some DSL residents choose to move to LTC facilities as they cannot afford the additional costs associated with DSL o This inequity creates an incentive to seek LTC which has the highest cost per day in comparison with o ther continuing care services Expected Benefits Individuals receiving continuing care services from different streams of services would have similar out -of-pocket expenses irrespective of the location of services o The elimination of the inequity would negate the incentive to seek the highest public cost alternative Individuals would choose the type of continuing care services most appropriate to their need Key Actions Required Review the types of costs in each stream of continuing care, and which are the responsibility of the client/resident Collaborate with Blue Cross, Aids to Daily Living , Alberta Seniors and Housing, AHS, and FBCC operators to plan and determine what types of care services/expenditures will be covered by the Government of Alberta ac ross all continuing care streams, and what care services/expenditures will be the responsibility of the client/resident o The aim is to ensure a level playing field for all the recipients of continuing care services o The charges to be reviewed would include, but not be limited to, drugs and medication, equipment and supplies, ambulance and transportation, and damage deposits o Any additional fees to be introduced to ensure equity of payments for all users would only apply to new admissions, not to existing re sidents. Align with income testing for self -directed care Make changes to regulations to support changes Communicate changes to charges to clients, residents, families, and operators Timing Planning: next 3 years Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 167 Classification: Public Implementation date: March 2025 Financial Considerations From the resident/client perspective, this could result in decreased out -of-pocket care costs for DSL residents and home care clients, and/or increases in out -of-pocket care costs for LTC residents, depending on how the system is changed to be made consistent From the operator perspective, there could be lost revenue from residents not paying for damage deposits Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 168 Classification: Public 4.2.11 Policy Direction 11: Learn from COVID -19 experience to prevent future spread of infectious diseases in FBCC sites and improve resident quality of life and care. There are many recommendations provided in the earlier policy directions which if implemented will also prevent the future spread of infectious diseases in FBCC facilities and improve resident quality of care during infectious disease outbreaks . These include: Recommendation 1 6: Increase direct care hours (includes nursing, personal care and therapeutic) at FBCC sites to an average of 4.5 worked hours per resident day for LTC and up to an average of 4.0 worked hours per resident day for DSL within a four -year period. Recommendation 1 7: Increase the level of professional care hours (nursing and therapeutic) for FBCC residents. Recommendation 1 8: Increase the level of mental health professional supports for FBCC r esidents. Recommendation 21: Establish a full -time employment benchmark for nursing, therapeutic and health care aide staff for FBCC and include the benchmark as one of the quality indicators for monitoring facility care . Recommendation 30: Develop and im plement a \"Research, Innovation and Technology Strategy for Continuing Care\" in Alberta . Recommendation 3 1: Focus government capital investments on the regeneration or replacement of existing FBCC spaces , with some funding ear -marked for the development of new spaces where needed . In addition to the above recommendations, we provide the following recommendations for preventing the future spread of infectious diseases in FBCC facilities and improving resident quality of care based on learnings from the ongoing COVID -19 pandemic. Recommendation # 36: Immediately halt new admissions to rooms that already have two residents. Permanently phase out shared rooms by April 1, 2027. Supporting Rationale Recent studies by Public Health Ontario, researchers from University of Toronto, and key researchers from Ontario hospitals and Research Institutes indicate that residents living in overcrowded LTC facilities (e.g. two - to four -bed rooms, shared bathrooms) are twice as likely to die from COVID -19 than those in private rooms o Upon release of this study, Ontar io's Chief Medical Officer of Health issued a directive in June 2020, immediately banning residents from being admitted into rooms with more than one res ident already living in them, effectively banning three - and four -bed rooms going forward o However, residents who already liv e in those rooms are not affected Alberta currently has 80 three - or four -bed rooms in the LTC and DSL system, representing 0.3 per cent of the total spaces Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 169 Classification: Public Alberta has 6,820 semi -private spaces (rooms with two beds) in FBCC , representing approximately 25 per cent of total spaces Expected Benefits Increased privacy for residents, which will improve resident quality of life The fatality rate of residents in FBCC sites is expected to be lower during future instances of infectious disease outbreaks Key Actions Required Immediately halt new admissions to rooms that already have two residents Permanently phase out three - and four-bed rooms from FBCC effective April 1, 2022 Phase out semi -private rooms by April 1, 202 7, with the exception of couples ' suites to be reserved for couples and loved ones etc. Convert some existing capital grant funding into funds for the regeneration of FBCC sites (see Recommendation 31) Timing Phase out three - and four -bed rooms in the next year Phase out semi -private rooms over the next five years Financial Considerations The financial impacts have been articulated in Recommendation 3 1 Recommendation # 37: Revise the design guidelines for continuing care facilities to incorporate findings regarding the spread of COVID -19 in FBCC. Supporting Rationale Public Health infection control and pandemic guidelines have strict protocols regarding social distancing, isolation of sick patients, and grouping of residents in less crowded rooms in congregate settings The current design guidelines were updated in 2018 prior to COVID -19, and provide recommendations for developers, but are not mandatory Infectious diseases were named one of the top 10 risks in terms of adverse impact in the world for the next 10 years by the 2020 Global Risks Report. The occurrence of pandemics is expected to increase in the future in light of globalization and more freque nt travel Expected Benefits Increased privacy for residents, which will improve resident quality of life Smaller pods are more amenable to residents with cognitive challenges The fatality rate of FBCC residents during future outbreaks of infectious diseas es will be lowered Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 170 Classification: Public Improved clarity for operators regarding expectations Key Actions Required Amend Design Guidelines and issue new guidelines as mandatory requirements for future FBCC projects including renovations and new developments Adjustments should include the following: o All newly constructed rooms to be private rooms, except for eight couple suites per 100 units o Lowering the number of units in each household in continuing care facilities from 18 to 14 o Increasing the number of sma ller dining rooms and recreational spaces to enable physical distancing o Creating isolation rooms for sick residents or visitors if isolation cannot be safely met in the resident 's room o Increasing more outdoor green spaces o Providing culturally appropriate s paces o Upgrading the ventilation systems of old facilities to provide clean air Timing Next 12 months Financial Considerations Staffing time commitments from Government of Alberta and AHS to review and modify the design guidelines Capital development implications Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 171 Classification: Public Recommendation #3 8: Ensure that there is a n on-site leader in each facility who has the expertise or access to expertise to devise an early pandemic management and prevention plan and has the authority to implement that plan to improve issues related to infection prevention and control. Supporting Rationale Many studies in Canada and the USA have documented lessons that can be learnt from the first wave of COVID -19 to prevent the future spread of infectious diseases in continuing care facilities o Amongst these studies, one common factor that seems to contribute greatly to their success is the presence of a proactive Senior Management Leader with the expertise to develop and implement a suitable pandemic prevention and control plan, as well as the authority to affect such a plan Expected Benefits Proactive leadership in planning for and manag ing pandemic s will improve the preparedness of facility staff to respo nd to a pandemic crisis in a more proficient manner More effective responses to future pandemics Key Actions Required Below are the key str ategic actions that could contribute to a successful response plan: 1. Ensure that there is a proactive leader with authority to manage crises, with an early management and prevention plan 2. Ensure there is regular training on infection and control protocols an d proper use of PPE, such training to be refreshed quarterly 3. Identify an infection prevention and control lead responsible for staff training and managing the clinical issues relating to the prevention and isolation of infectious diseases 4. Develop a means o f communicating with family members and a method of allowing family support in a considerate and humane way Identify and train leaders in the continuing care system o Recognize them as mentors and facilitate the development of in -service training courses Timing Next 12 months Financial Considerations Staff and management time investment at the facility level Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 172 Classification: Public Recommendation #3 9: Resolve labour force issues proactively to maintain needed staffing levels at FBCC sites during pandemics and outbreaks. Supporting Rationale The pandemic has affected the labour force in FBCC sites in a major way Very often, labour force issues are the major factor affecting outbreak management of a FBCC site Sites should have a proactive plan to address problems of worker absence due to sickness and isolation, and the need for additional staffing to meet increased resident care needs during an outbreak o Some sites have reported that staffing decreased between 20 to 50 per cent in the first 24 hours after an outbreak Wages , overtime pay, and sick pay are important issues to be addressed quickly to retain staff Expected Benefits Improved ability to staff FBCC sites during the time of a pandemic Key Actions Required FBCC sites should always have contingency plans for filling vacancies o The contingencies could include making use of casual staff or even residents ' family and friends A single site staffing policy is necessary to prevent the spread of the diseases from site to site similar to what the Government of Alberta enacted for COVID -19 AHS should maintain province -wide lists of potential helpers and be prepared to shift staff from other sites or other sectors of the health system to continuing care o The fact that Alberta has a single health authority is an advantage in the deployment of the labour pool from a central perspective Leadership at FBCC sites should address labour issues proactively Timing Immediately Financial Considerations Staff time to develop plans for Government of Alberta, AHS, and facility operators Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 173 Classification: Public Recommendation # 40: Maintain an open communication channel with all FBCC sites and industry associations during emergency situations such as pandemics. Supporting Rationale To ensure the communication of quick and consistent response policies, it is important that there is a central vehicle which provides information regularly to FBCC operators, industry associations, families, and staff Public Health personnel must be involved to ensure consistent sharing of information between all groups Expected Benefits Improved consistency to responding to a pandemic across the province of Alberta Key Actions Required Implement and maintain ongoing communications with FBCC sites, AHS, and associations, including regular meetings and email communications and consultation on changes to orders Timing Immediately Financial Considerations Time commitments from operators, AHS and Government of Alberta to participate in the process Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 174 Classification: Public Recommendation # 41: Ensure that FBCC operators and staff always have appropriate access to personal protective equipment and other equipment/supplies for future outbreaks/pandemics. Supporting Rationale Increasing the supply and quality of the PPE for future pandemics and outbreaks was identified as an area for improvement by survey respondents, to reduce uncertainty Expected Benefits Improved safety for FBCC residents and staff by reducing the spread of infection during an outbreak Key Actions Required Ensure that congregate living and congregate care facilities always have the ability to access up to date and quality PPE and other equipment/supplies during for future outbreaks or pandemics to the degree that it is possible Timing Imme diately Financial Considerations Providing facilities with the resources to procure PPE and other equipment/supplies during an outbreak/pandemic Partner with Seniors and Housing to coordinate training and support for Senior Lodges Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 175 Classification: Public Recommendation #4 2: Reduce social isolation for residents and caregivers during an outbreak/pandemic. Supporting Rationale Increasing access to in -person visits and social interactions was identified as a key area for improving the quality of life during an outbreak/pandemic by respondents to the public, resident/caregiver, FBCC staff and external stakeholder surveys The National Institute on Aging found that COVID -19 has significantly increased Canadians ' feelings of social isolation and lonelines s Expected Benefits Improved quality of life for residents and caregivers/families Key Actions Required Increase and enable in-person visits in a safe manner for FBCC residents during outbreaks/pandemics , especially for family care partners, who provide essential care for residents o Increase access to technology to facilitate virtual social interactions Increase social interactions and activities in a safe manner between residents and between residents and staff during outbreaks/pandemics Timing Immediately Financial Considerations Potential need for investments in technology to improve virtual interactions Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 176 Classification: Public Next Steps Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 177 Classification: Public 5 Next Steps To keep the momentum established by the FBCC Revie w, the next important activity will be to develop action plans for implementing each of the 42 recommendations outlined in the report. Action planning will include the development of implementation working groups, including members from across stakeholder groups who informed the Review recommendations. The action plans are expected to include: An articulation of the l evel of system change required , including change management requirements A prioritiz ation of timing for implementing recommendations The key activities needed to implement recommendations, including opportunities to leverage existing projects/initiatives Detailed r esource requirements (human and financial resources) to implement recommendations Timeframes for implementing recommendatio ns, including key milestones Accountabilities and responsibilities for implementing recommendations Interdependencies and risks associated with implementing recommendations The Action Planning Phase is e stimated to be completed by October 31, 2021. Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 178 Classification: Public Appendices Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 179 Classification: Public Appendix 1: Alberta Health Charter Overview Alberta 's Health Charter was adopted in March 2014. The Alberta Health Act requires the Government of Alberta to have a Health Charter. Alberta's Health Charter sets out key values and aims for Alberta 's health system and the roles and responsibilities of patients and providers within the health system. It is intended to guide the actions of health service organizations, providers, patients and government in the broader health system, both publicly funded and those services purchased through insurance or directly. The Alberta Health Advocate Offices use the Health Charter as a lens to consider concerns and complaints brought to its attention by Albertans. T he Health Advocate also provides education about the Health Charter and how it applies to Alberta's health service system. Health Charter When I interact with the health system, I expect that I will: have my health status, social and economic circumstances, and personal beliefs and values acknowledged be treated with respect and dignity have access to team -based primary care services have the confidentiality and privacy of my health information respected be informed in ways that I understand so that I may make informed decisions about my health, health care and treatment be able to participate fully in my health and health care be supported through my care journey and helped to find and access the health services and care that I require receive information on the health system and education about healthy living and wellness have timely and reasonable access to safe, high quality health services and care have timely and reasonable access to my personal health information Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 180 Classification: Public have the opportunity to ra ise concerns and receive a timely response to my concerns, without fear of retribution or an impact on my health services and care Taking my circumstances into account and to the best of my abilities, when I interact with the health system, I understand th at I will be asked to: respect the rights of other patients and health providers ask questions and work with providers to understand the information I am being provided demonstrate that I, or my guardian and / or caregivers, understand the care plan we have developed together and that steps are being taken to follow the plan treat health services as a valuable public resource learn how to better access health services make healthy choices in my life As I work to be a healthy citizen within Alberta, I exp ect that: when economic, fiscal , and social policies are being developed by the Alberta government, the impact of those policies on public health, wellness and prevention will be considered and steps taken to ensure that public policy is healthy policy Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 181 Classification: Public Appendix 2: Financial Model Detailed Assumptions Financial Model Components An integrated dynamic financial model was developed to assess the financial implications of key recommended changes to the system. Detailed assumptions for the model are provided below . The model determined the projected costs of meeting future demand for continuing care services based on the current distribution of LTC, DSL and LTHC services, as well as proposed changes to the system based on the future vision for LTC, DSL and LTH C services. Key areas of change included in the integrated dynamic financial model included: The implications of increasing the proportion of LTHC spaces from 60.5 per cent to 70.0 per cent and decreasing the proportion of FBCC services from 39.5 per cent to 30.0 per cent to meet demand in 2030. This included: o Annual operating cost implications o Cumulative capital cost implications from 2021 to 2030 The implications of increasing the direct hours of care for: o LTC from an average of 3.4 worked hours per resident day to 4.5 o DSL4D from an average of 3.0 worked hours per resident day to 4.0 o DSL4 from an average of 2.7 worked hours per resident day to 3.5 The implications of providing a self -directed care model, with 6.3 per cent of all continuing care client s receiving services through this option by 2030 The implications of adjusting capital grant levels for LTC and DSL space development The implications of developing small homes to replace a portion of aged facilities, as well as for new DSL capacity The im plications of replacing a portion of aged facilities with zero -capital options The implications of adding new FBCC capacity specifically in Indigenous communities, in addition to the projected demand for FBCC spaces Comparison Model Descriptions Current Pr oportion Model - This model is the base case comparator for the proposed model. It represents the how the continuing care system in Alberta will meet future demand for continuing care spaces in 2030 , as projected by AHS, by increasing capacity in cont inuing care stream (LTC, DSL4D, DSL4, DSL3, LTHC) to maintain the same proportion s of space s in 2020 . For example, if LTC represents 2 2.5 per cent of spaces in 202 0, then the system will add LTC spaces to maintain th e same 22.5 per cent distribution in 2030. Accordingly, the proportional mix of LTC, DSL and LTHC spaces will remain the same in 2030, and capacity will be increased in each stream to maintain this mix. Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 182 Classification: Public New Proposed Recommended Model - This model represents the proposed chan ges to the distribution of continuing care spaces in Alberta in the future, based on the findings of the FBCC Review. It represents the desired end state for the mix of continuing care spaces in 2030. The financial impacts of these proposed changes are pro vided from both a capital cost and operating cost perspective and compared to the costs of providing continuing care services in the future in the base case scenario (i.e. the current proportion model) above. It is also assumed that increases to direct hou rs of care, self- directed care services , and capacity for Indigenous communities will only be implemented in the new proposed model. Key Common Assumptions in Both Models For both the current proportion model, and the new proposed model, it is assumed: That all FBCC spaces requiring replacement (i.e. will be 40 years or older by 2030), will be replaced over the next 10 years. Grant funding contribution levels for supporting capital development will remain the same for both models. Summary Comparison of Annual Operating Costs in 2030 The estimated annual operating cost s (in 2020 dollars) to meet the projected demand for continuing care services in 2030 for each model is summarized below . Overall, the projected annual operating cost to meet the demand for continuing care services in 2030 under the current proportion model is $1.8 billion higher than present costs in 2020 dollars. The projected annual operating cost to meet the demand for continuing care services in 2030 under the new proposed model is $1.9 billion higher than present costs in 2020 dollars. Overall, the estimated annual operating costs of providing services in 2030 with the new proposed model are approximately $68 million higher (in 2020 dollars) than meeting demand with the current proporti on model in 2030. Accordingly, shifting the allocation of services in 2030 covers 83 per cent of the cost increases associated with increasing the direct hours of care and providing additional FBCC services to Indigenous communities .

Overall, the projected cumulative capital costs required to meet the demand for continuing care services in 2030 under the current proportion model is $4.9 billion in 2020 dollars. The projected cumulative capital costs required to meet the demand for continuing care services in 2030 under the new proposed mode l is $2.7 billion in 2020 dollars. Overall, the cumulative capital costs required to provide services in 2030 with the new proposed model are approximately $1.7 billion lower (in 2020 dollars) than meeting demand with the current proportion model. $2,000,000,000$2,500,000,000$3,000,000,000$3,500,000,000$4,000,000,000$4,500,000,000 Present Cost (2020) Projected Annual Costs 2025 Projected Annual Costs 2030Comparison of Annual Operational Cost Increase Over Time Total Costs Current Model 2020$ Total Costs Proposed Shift Model 2020$ Present Cost (2020)Projected Costs 2030Projected Costs for New Model in 2030 Change Compared to Current Model in 2030 Cumulative Capital Costs for Replacement and Capacity Increases $0 $4,923,651,851 $2,738,289,278 -$2,185,362,574 Additional Cumulative (Shift to 70% LTHC/30% Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 184 Classification: Public $0$1,000,000,000$2,000,000,000$3,000,000,000$4,000,000,000$5,000,000,000$6,000,000,000 Present Cost (2020) Projected Costs 2025Projected Costs 2030 Increase Capacity in Current ModelComparison of Cumulative Capital Cost Increase Over Time Total Cost Current Model 2020$ Total Costs Proposed Shift Model 2020$ Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 185 Classification: Public Detailed Assumptions Regarding Service Levels by Stream Based on data provided by AHS, the projected demand for continuing care spaces will be 112,960 by 2030, an increase of 43,228 'spaces ' (including FBCC spaces and the number of long -term home care clients) compared to current capacity of 69,732 \"spaces \". The graphic below summarizes the differences in capacity by continuing care stream for the current proportion model and proposed model in 2030. Compared to 2020, LTC ca pacity does not increase in the proposed model (it remains at the current 2020 levels), DSL capacity increases by 6,370 spaces, and LTHC capacity increases by 36,858 \"spaces \". Compared to the current proportion model in 2030, there will be a reduction of 9 ,711 LTC spaces and 978 DSL spaces, and an increase in 10,689 LTHC \"spaces \". Of the 79,072 LTHC 'spaces ' in the proposed model, it is assumed that 44,900 will remain at current complexity levels, 17,086 will have a moderate complexity level, and 17,086 will have complex care needs.

It is assumed that these spaces will be replaced in both the current proportions model as well as the new proposed model. The graphic below summarizes the key assumptions related to the timing of replace ment , as well as the breakdown of spaces between LTC and DSL. Based on the assumptions above related to service levels by stream, it is estimated that there will be a requirement to develop 5,445 additional new FBCC spaces (all DSL) for the new proposed model, and a need to develop 17,059 additional new FBCC spaces f or the current proportion model. It should be noted that the number of new FBCC spaces required for the new proposed model will be reduced by the number of self -directed care clients assessed as requiring DSL level services. Based on the current assumption s, a total of 1,540 self -directed care clients are projected to require DSL level services (see below ) and will not require a DSL space . Assumptions regarding the cost of developing a space by ownership type or other development type, the distribution o f developing replacement and new capacity FBCC spaces by type, and grant funding levels by type are provided in the table below. Note that small facility spaces and zero capital options each represent 10 per cent of replacement spaces.

It is estimated that 7,075 continuing care clients (6.3 per cent of total clients) will access services through the self-directed care model by 2030. It is assum ed that self-directed care clients will be funded up to 80 per cent of the assessed cost to receive care in typical setting, and that the costs of administering and monitoring these services will be an additional 10 per cent of funded service costs. Based on these assumptions, the annual costs of funding and monitoring self -directed care for these 7,075 clients is estimated to be $23 million l ower than if they received similar care in typical settings.

The population in this demographic is expected to grow to 11,552 in 2030. Based on recent submission requests for FBCC services from 12 First Nations, the ratio of people aged 60 years and older per FBCC space is 7.6. Applying this ratio to the projected population of First Nations 60 years and older in 2030 results in a projected need for 1,528 FBCC spac es by the year 2030. Assuming that 72 per cent6 of those requiring FBCC services choose to receive services on -reserve, there will be a need for 1,100 FBCC spaces by 2030 . Based on data provided in the Metis Settlement and Fist Nations in Alberta Community Profiles (January 2021 update), the total population for Metis settlements in 5,632. Based on 2016 Census data, it is assumed that 6.1 per cent of the population, or 344 people, are 65 years or older , and that the population of this age group wil l grow to 1,371 by the year 2030. Assuming that the ratio of people aged 65 years and older per FBCC space is 7.6, results in a need for 181 FBCC spaces by the year 2030. If 72 per cent of those requiring FBCC services choose to receive services on -settlem ent, there will be a need for 130 FBCC spaces by 2030. Based on the above analysis, it is estimated that there is a need for 1, 230 FBCC s paces by the year 2030 to better meet the needs of Indigenous people in Alberta. Given that there are currently 142 existing FBCC spaces specific for Indigenous communities in Alberta, the total need for new FBCC spaces is 1,088. The total estimated capital costs to develop these 1,088 FBCC spaces in $ 524 million. The projected annual operating costs for these spaces by the year 2030 is approximately $ 46 million if 744 of the 1, 088 FBCC spaces are developed and are in operation. 6 Based on other recent planning projects with Ontario First Nations.

The purpose of the analysis was to examine potential debt -service structures that operators could support for future FBCC space replacement and development , based on continuing with the current approach of increas ing accommodation fee s based the core inflation rate in Alberta over the next 10 years . The analysis assumes that all debt -service costs should be covered by the accommodation fee margin only and assumes that care margin s should not be used for the purpose of covering debt -service expenses and used for funding care only. Trends for t he accommodation margins, care margins, and total margins for private -for-profit and private not -for-profit FBCC operators Care MarginAccomodation MarginTotal Margin Improving Quality of Life for Residents in Facility -Based Continuing Care 199 Classification: Public Assuming that accommodation fees increase by an average of 1.8 per cent per year over the next 10 years, based on the average core inflation rate in Alberta (previous 5 years) , it is estimated that private - for-profit LTC operators could sustain a f inancing structure for developing LTC spaces whereby 50 per cent of their portion of development costs are financed through debt (assuming 35 year s amortization , and an interest rate of 2.45 per cent ) by the year 2027 (as measured by the ability to maintai n a debt - service coverage ratio (DSCR) of 1.25 or higher). However, private not -for-profit LTC operators will not achieve a DSCR of 1.25 by the year 2030 under the same conditions, suggesting for the need to provide higher up -front capital grant funding to these operators to fund capital development costs . The same analysis for private -for-profit DSL operators shows that the accommodation fee margin is already sufficient to support debt -financing to fund 50 per cent of their portion of development costs for a DSL space, and private -not-for-profit DSL operators could support the same level of debt financing by the year 2022.
