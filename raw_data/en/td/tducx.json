Since then, multiple studies have proven his claim to be true and is one of the most effective treatments for certain cancers. When large amounts of vitamin C is introduced into the bloodstream, bypassing the body's digestive system, it breaks down into hydrogen peroxide and bombard affected tissues and cells. Normal cells have several ways to remove hydrogen peroxide, keeping it at very low levels so it does not cause damage. Comprised cells have difficulty removing the hydrogen peroxide, resulting in oxidative damage that will eradicate cancer and energy homeostasis that will block cancers high need for energy. This makes intravenous administered vitamin C a unique and targeted treatment. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) admits, based on laboratory studies, that vitamin C can help slow the growth of cancer cells as well improve quality of life. Both animal and human studies have also shown that IV Vitamin C therapy can help block tumor growth, while also significantly improving the patient's quality of life.
