'Paper anything is ripe for fraud' explains Nenette Day. She is an assistant special agent in charge at the Department of Health and Human Services' inspector general's office. And she is investigating a number of blatant examples. We hope she cracks down hard because fake vaccination cards undermine our safety.

Saoud Khalifah is chief executive of Fakespot, a company that specializes in rooting out online fraud. He told Washington Post 'There's demand from people who don't want to get vaccinated. But also people who think they can use the cards to skip the line and say, 'Hey, I got dose one, can I get dose two?'
