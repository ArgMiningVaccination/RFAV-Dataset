Symptoms of Sensitive Stomachs in Cats While there are many possible causes of a sensitive stomach in a cat, the signs are similar. If your cat has a sensitive stomach and is experiencing digestion issues, they may show the following symptoms: - Vomiting - Diarrhea - Loss of appetite - Lethargy - Poor skin and fur health - Weight loss - Refusing to eat If you notice your cat is exhibiting any of these symptoms, consulting your veterinarian can help determine the cause of your cat's stomach issues and possible treatments. They will also check for any other severe underlying issues. Your vet may recommend certain sensitive stomach cat foods to help manage their symptoms. What to Look for in Cat Food for Sensitive Stomach There are an endless amount of cat food options available for cats suffering from sensitive stomachs, both in stores and online. It might be hard to know what is best for your feline friend, especially when they have digestive issues. When shopping for sensitive stomach cat food, consider the following: Easily digestible ingredients Try to avoid cat foods that contain a lot of filler ingredients. Cheaper foods will include fillers like rice or corn, which can be harmful and hard to digest. Cat foods that have added fiber or gentle ingredients are safe for their digestive system. Nutrition value It is vital for all cats to get sufficient protein and nutrients, especially those with sensitive stomachs. Look for foods that are high in protein and contain essential vitamins and minerals. Their new sensitive stomach cat food should also have healthy fats like omega fatty acids. Type of Food We covered all types of sensitive stomach cat food, from human-grade fresh to dry food kibble. Consider what kind your cat prefers or experiment with new kinds to see what is best for your cat. Be sure to also consider the moisture content of the food you're buying. While dry cat food is not as effective in hydrating your cat, it is still suitable for sensitive stomachs as long as your cat is getting sufficient hydration through other means. Age and weight of your cat Certain foods may be better suited for adult or senior cats rather than kittens. Kittens need food that is specially formulated for them to receive a sufficient amount of protein and nutrients. The serving you feed your cat will depend on their weight. In order to determine how much cat food you should buy, consider how much you'll be feeding them daily. Ingredients to Avoid for a Cat with a Sensitive Stomach Certain ingredients that are common in many cat foods can be harmful or add no nutritional value. Cats with sensitive stomachs may have an especially hard time digesting these ingredients. There are a lot of ingredients that cheap cat food includes to make them less costly or appear to be healthier. The best cat food for sensitive stomachs will exclude irritating and non-nutritious ingredients. These are some examples of ingredients you should avoid if you see them on a cat food label: Fillers Cats commonly have a sensitivity or allergy to fillers like grain, corn, soy, and rice. Some of these also do not add any nutritional value. Cheap fillers are considered irritating ingredients for kitties with stomach issues. Sugar Sugar can come in many forms in cat food, such as corn syrup, beet pulp, and dextrose. Cats only require a small amount of daily sugar. Too much sugar can cause hyperactivity, weight gain, and diabetes. Cellulose This is a poorly [fermentable](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27080580/) fiber for cats. The food may pass through their system too quickly, preventing nutrients from being absorbed. Chemical preservatives BHA and BHT are examples of potentially harmful preservatives that are present in some pet foods to help them last longer. FAQ What causes a cat to have a sensitive stomach? Many different factors can cause a cat to have a sensitive stomach or experience symptoms like diarrhea. Common causes of upset stomach in kittens and cats include: - Stress: Sudden or chronic stress can lead to an upset stomach in cats. Stressors for cats can include moving into a new home, introducing a new pet or family member, and changing their diet too quickly. - Eating foreign objects: If a cat consumes something that can't make it through the digestive tract or gets stuck, it can cause stomach issues, like vomiting. - Food allergies: The most common allergies for cats are chicken, fish, beef, dairy, and eggs. Food allergies can affect the stomach and the skin. Symptoms of a [food allergy in cats](https://pointgreyvet.com/food-allergies-intolerance-your-cats-sensitive-stomach/#:~:text=Cats most commonly develop food,hair loss or reddened skin.)include itchy skin, loss of appetite, diarrhea, and vomiting. - Food intolerance: When a pet has a [food intolerance](https://pointgreyvet.com/food-allergies-intolerance-your-cats-sensitive-stomach/), their digestive system has trouble breaking down an ingredient or food. It can also happen when a cat lacks an enzyme needed to fully digest a certain food. If your cat's food is too high in fat or has a fiber imbalance, it might cause them to have a strong reaction. - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD): [Cats with IBD](https://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-cats)have a hard time absorbing nutrients and moving food through the GI tract. They may require a special diet or medication. More serious causes can include: - Intestinal parasites: Cats can contract parasites from several sources such as infected animals or fleas. Types of parasites that appear in cats and kittens include roundworms, toxoplasma, and tapeworms. - Bacterial infections: Contaminated water, food, or undercooked meat are some factors that can cause [bacterial infections](https://www.nasc.cc/pet-university/bacterial-infections-and-cats/#:~:text=The source of bacteria is,housed in the same area.), like salmonella. - Gastrointestinal cancers - Hyperthyroidism - Kidney disease Is wet or dry food better for a cat with a sensitive stomach? Cat food for sensitive stomachs can come in many different forms. Wet food has a higher moisture content to help cats get more hydration. It is also a great addition to your cat's diet because it helps them absorb more nutrients. While wet food is generally recommended more for cats with sensitive stomachs, dry food can still be a good option, as long as your cat gets a sufficient amount of hydration. Some cats may also prefer one food over the other. If you add moisture to your cat's dry food, like water or bone broth, it increases the moisture content. Be sure to also have clean water available to your cats at all times. What are the benefits of sensitive stomach cat food? Switching to a cat food for sensitive stomachs can help your feline friend in many ways. Most notably, it can eliminate or reduce their digestive issues and symptoms. Food that contains prebiotics or probiotics can also help maintain the pH balance in your cat's gut. Many of the sensitive stomach cat food options are also suitable for sensitive skin. The gentle and nutritious ingredients in these foods also help to maintain healthy skin and coat. Sensitive stomach cat food can also help prevent hairballs and protect your cat's teeth. What is human-grade cat food? Cat foods that are labeled as human-grade are considered safe for humans to eat because the food was handled in accordance with FDA and USDA regulations that apply to human foods. Human-grade ingredients may not automatically mean the cat food is better, but it can be of higher quality. It often contains higher-quality protein, more nutrients, and is easily digestible. Some cat foods for a sensitive stomach are considered human-grade. Human-grade does not always mean better quality, so further research of the food brand and product is always recommended. What is raw cat food? Some raw food can provide cats with excellent nutrition, but they pose real risks. [Studies](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24824368/) show that commercially prepared raw food can be contaminated with foodborne pathogens, like salmonella, listeria, or E.coli. Freeze-dried raw cat food, like the one offered by Smalls on our list, is considered safer than typical raw food. Freeze-dried food is dehydrated and has a longer shelf life than other raw food. By removing water, harmful [bacteria](https://www.fdacs.gov/Consumer-Resources/Health-and-Safety/Food-Safety-FAQ/What-conditions-encourage-bacteria-to-grow) are less likely to grow in a low-moisture environment. It is high in protein and other nutrients. Do cats need to eat grain-free food? Cats need high-protein, low-carb diets. Foods with grain may cause them to be higher in carbs. A grain-free diet can help to keep carbs under control. The best cat food for your cat may or may not be grain-free. Grain-free diets are not always necessarily better, but they can offer some benefits, especially for cats with a grain or food allergy, IBD, or sensitive stomach. How do you introduce a new food into your cat's diet? A sudden change in food may cause issues for your cat, like vomiting and diarrhea. If you're introducing a new cat food for sensitive stomachs, it's important to slowly introduce it to your cat to allow their system to adjust to it. For the first two days, you should feed your cat 75% of their old food and 25% of the new food. For days 3 and 4, change to a 50%-50% mix. On days 6 and 7, feed 75% new food and 25% old food. After that, you can completely switch over to the new food. If your cat is not tolerating the new food well, go back to the amount that was tolerated and transition slower. What is a meat by-product? [Meat by-products](https://www.aafco.org/consumers/what-is-in-pet-food/#:~:text=\"Meat by-products is the,intestines freed of their contents.) are the non-rendered parts, other than meat, derived from slaughtered animals. This includes the lungs, kidneys, brains, blood, bone, and fatty tissue. It does not contain feces, hooves, or hair as some pet owners may believe. While you may not know what exactly is in the cat food, meat by-products are generally considered safe. They are still a good protein source and full of healthy fat. It all depends on what you feel comfortable feeding your pet. What is an elimination diet? An [elimination diet](http://www.perthcathospital.com.au/food-elimination-diets-in-cats/) is an effective way to identify if your cat has a food intolerance or allergy. You'll stop feeding all foods except one protein and one carbohydrate that your cat has not eaten before. Then, you'll gradually re-introduce foods one at a time and see if your cat experiences any allergic reactions. It can take 10 to 16 weeks to complete. This way, you can identify what ingredient your pet reacts to and start to buy the proper food for them. There are also different types of elimination diets. How can I help my cat with a sensitive stomach? Besides switching to a new, healthier food suited for a cat with a sensitive stomach, there are some other changes that might help them. Avoid feeding your cat leftovers or food scraps since human food is generally not suited for cats. It's possible your cat has a habit of eating inedible objects, like strings or leaves. Try to avoid having things in the house that your cat could try to eat. In addition, it is a good idea to keep track of your cat's toys since they eventually start falling apart and your cat may try to eat them. If your cat's digestive issues persist or worsen, they may need medical attention. Getting your cat diagnosed and treated by a vet is the best way to help them. Cats with Food Allergies If your cat has food allergies, you're no stranger to buying them special food. While sensitive stomach cat food can be a great option for cats with allergies, it has to also exclude the ingredient they are allergic to. [Hypoallergenic cat food](https://www.dallasnews.com/branded-content/2022/12/22/best-hypoallergenic-cat-food-top-picks-for-sensitive-cats-in-2023/) may be a safer option to include in their diet.
