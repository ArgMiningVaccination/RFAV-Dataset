The capitated, risk-based Managed Care Program was implemented under a Section 1915(b) Waiver which established a mandatory Managed Care Program, serving recipients in urban Clark County and Washoe County. The mandatory program became effective on January 1, 1996 and served eligible recipients in the programs that were then known as \"Aid to Families with Dependent Children /Aid to Dependent Children (AFDC/ADC)\" and related programs as well as the Child Health Assurance Program (CHAP) and other child welfare programs. On April 1, 1997, the voluntary Medicaid Managed Care Program was also implemented in Nevada. Subsequent to the close of the 1997 Nevada Legislature, the U.S. Congress pa ssed the Balanced Budget Act (BBA) of 1997. Under the BBA, states are given the ability to implement managed care programs without a waiver. Th is generally simplified approva l at the federal level. On October 1, 1998, Nevada's Managed Care Program was approved by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), which was formerly known as the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) as a state plan amendment. The State of Nevada Division of H ealth Care Financing and Policy (DHCFP) oversees the administration of all Medicaid Managed Care Organization s (MCOs) in the state. Nevada Medicaid operates a Fee-for-Service (FFS) a nd a managed care reimbursement and service delivery system with which to provide covered medically necessary services to its eligible population. MCO contracts are comprehensive risk c ontracts and are paid a risk-based capitated rate for each eligible, enrolled recipient on a Per-Member, Per-Month (PMPM) basis. These capitated rates are certified to be actuari ally sound. There is also a formula for Stop Loss, when costs of inpatient care exceed a threshold dur ing a specified time period ; Very Low Birth Weight Newborns (VLBW); and the Primary Care Physician (PCP) enhancements, according to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) and as approved by the CMS. The mandatory Managed Care Program is currently available to Medicaid and Nevada Check Up (NCU) recipients in urban Clark and Washoe counties. The DHCFP may, at a future date, designate other geographical lo cations as mandatory managed care areas in accordance with Nevada Administrative Code (NAC) 695C.160. All MCO 's must be in compliance with all applicable Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS), NAC, the Code of Federal Regulations (C FR), the United States Code (USC) , and the Social Security Act (SSA) which assure program and operational comp liance as well as assuring services that are provided to Medicaid and NCU recipients enro lled in an MCO are done so with the same timeliness, amount, duration, and scope as those provided to FFS Medicaid and NCU recipients. July 22, 2013 MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATION Section 3600 Page 1 MTL 10/13 DIVISION OF HEALTH CA RE FINANCING AND POLICY Section: 3600 MEDICAID SERVICES MANUAL Subject: INTRODUCTION Participating MCOs shall provide to enrolled Medicaid and NCU recipients a benefits package covering inpatient and outpatient hospital care, ambulatory care, physician services, a full range of preventive and primary health care services, a nd such other services as the DHCFP determines to be in the best interests of th e State and eligible recipients to include in benefits package. The MCO is responsible for reimbursing claims of e ligible enrollees for services covered under the contract or for each month a capitated payment is made. The DHCFP will continue to provide, on a FFS basis, certain services that are not contained in the MCO contracts or the capitated benefits package. Currently, the DHCFP contracts with two Health Maintenance Organizations (HMO) as MCOs for the State of Nevada. Enrollment in an MCO is mandatory for the Family Medical Category (FMC) categories of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (T ANF) (Section 1931) and Child Health Assurance Program (CHAP) (poverty le vel pregnant women, infants, and children) recipients when there is more than one MCO op tion from which to choose in a geographic service area. Enrollment in an MCO is mandatory for all NCU recipients when there is at least two MCO option s in the recipient's geographic service area. The eligibility and aid code determination functions for Medicaid and NCU applicant s and eligible population s are the responsibility of the Division of Welfare and Supportive Services (DWSS). The enrollment function is the responsibility of Medicaid Manageme nt Information System (MMIS). All Medicaid policies and requirement s (such as prior authorization) are the same for NCU, with the exception of the certain areas where Medicaid and NCU polic ies differ as documented in the NCU Manual Chapter 1000.

Residential Treatment Ce nter (RTC) Limitations It is the MCO's responsibility to provide reimbursement for all ancillary services (i.e., physician services, optometry, laborat ory, dental and x-ray services, and similar services ) for enrollees under the Title XXI, NCU , throughout their RTC admission. These enrollees will remain enrolled with the MCO throughout their RTC stay. The RTC bed day rate will be covered by FFS for NCU enrollees commencing the first day of admission. Enrollees who are covered under Title XIX Medicaid will be disenrolled from the MCO the first day of the next administratively possible month following the RTC admission. It is the MCO's responsibility to provide re imbursement for all RTC charges including admission, bed day rate, and ancillary services until properly dise nrolled from managed care. The RTC admission, bed day rate , and ancillary services will be reimbursed through FFS thereafter for Title XI X Medicaid recipients. Hospice Recipients who are receiving Hospice Services are not eligible for enrollment with the MCO. Hospice Services are an optional program under the Social Security Act XVIII Section 1905(o)(1)(A) and are governed by 42 CFR 418 and 489.102(I). Once admitted into hospice care, Medicaid members will be disenrolled immediately. NCU recipients will not be disenrolled. However, payment for NCU hospice services will be billed as FFS. It is the responsibility of the MCOs to provide reim bursement for all ancillary services until properly dise nrolled from managed care. Institutions for Mental Diseases (IMDs) Federal regulations stipulat e that Medicaid can only reimburse for services to IMD/psychiatric hospital patients who are 65 years of age or older or under the age of 21 years.

Home and Community Based Waiver (HCBW) Services Recipients who are receiving HCBW Services are not eligible for enrollment with the MCO. If a recipient is made eligible for HCBW Services after MCO enrollment, the recipient will be disenrol led and the HCBW Services will be reimbursed through FFS. All Pre-Admission Screening and Resident Review (PASRR) and Level of Care (LOC) Assessments are performed by the State's Fiscal Agent. Conducting a PASRR and LOC will not prompt MCO disenrollment, however, if the recipient is admitted to a nursing facility as the result of a PASRR and LOC, the MCO is responsible for the first 45 days of admission (see # c above). SED/SMI The MCO must ensure enrollees who are re ferred for evaluation for SED/SMI or who have been determined SED/SMI by the health plan are obtaining the medically necessary evaluations by an in-network provider and that enrollees are transitioned, as necessary, to another provider in order to obt ain their mental health servi ces if such services are not available within the network. The MCO is re quired to notify the DHCFP if a Title XIX Medicaid recipient elects to disenroll from the MCO following the determination of SED/SMI and forward the enrollee's medical records to the provider from whom the enrollee will receive the covered mental health services. However, in the event the Medicaid enrollee who has received such a dete rmination chooses to remain enrolled with the MCO, the MCO will be responsible for providing all patient care. The MCO is required to adhere to MS M Chapter 400 and 2500 for all SED and SMI referrals and determinations and must reimburse providers of these se rvices pursuant to the referenced MSM Chapters. Such services include, but are not limited to: case management; lab work; prescription drugs; acu te in-patient; and, ot her ancillary medical and mental health services required by the pl an of treatment. Title XIX Medicaid eligible recipients have the option of di senrolling from the MCO, if de termined to be SED or SMI. Title XXI, NCU recipients must remain enrolled with the MCO who is responsible for on-going patient care. If a Title XIX eligible recipient elects to disenroll from the MCO following a determination of SED or SMI, the disenrollment will commence the first day of the next administrative ly possible month and the services wi ll then be reimbursed by FFS. The State, at its sole discretion, may re move the option for these Medicaid recipients determined SED or SMI to be volunta rily disenrolled from managed care. Out-of-Network Providers SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS FOR SELECTED COVERED SERVICES July 22, 2013 MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATION Section 3603 Page 6 MTL 10/13 DIVISION OF HEALTH CA RE FINANCING AND POLICY Section: 3603 MEDICAID SERVICES MANUAL Subject: POLICY When it is necessary for enrolled recipien ts to obtain services from out-of-network providers (e.g., the enrollee needs to see a specialist for which the MCO has no such specialist in its network) the MCO must: 1. Coordinate with out-of-network prov iders with respect to payment; 2. Offer the opportunity to the out-of-netw ork provider to become part of the network; and, 3. Negotiate a contract to determine the ra te prior to services being rendered. B. Emergency Services The MCO must cover and pay fo r emergency services regardle ss of whether the provider who furnished the services has a contract with the MCO. The MCO must pay the out-of- network provider for emergency services applying the \"prudent layperson\" definition according to the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) of an emergency, rendered at a rate limited to the amount that w ould have been paid if the service had been provided under the state's FFS Medicaid program, unless a lower amount is mutually agreed to between the MCO and th e party(ies) rendering service. Pursuant to 1932 (b)(2)(D) of the Social Security Act, a non-contracting provider of emergency services must accept as payment in full no more than it would receive if the services were provided under the state's FFS Medicaid prog ram. This rule applies whether the non- contracting provider is within the State or outside of the State in which the managed care entity has a contract. No prior or post-authorization can be requir ed for emergency care provided by network or out-of-network providers. The MCO may not deny payment for treatment obtained when the enrollee has an emergency medical conditio n and seeks emergency services, applying the \"prudent layperson\" definition of an emergency; this includes the prohibition against denying payment in those instances in which the absence of immediate medical attention would not have resulted in placing the health of the enrollee in serious jeopardy, serious impairment to bodily function, or serious dysfunction of any bodily part or organ. The MCO may not deny payment for emergency serv ices treatment when a representative of the MCO instructs the enrollee to se ek emergency services care. Pursuant to 42 CFR 438.114, the MCO may not limit what constitutes an emergency medical condition as defined in this section on the basis of lists of diagnoses or symptoms nor refuse to cover emergency services base d on the emergency room provider, hospital, or fiscal agent not notifying the enrollee's PCP, MCO, or the DHCFP of the enrollee's screening and treatment within ten calendar days of the presentation for emergency services. July 22, 2013 MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATION Section 3603 Page 7 MTL 10/13 DIVISION OF HEALTH CA RE FINANCING AND POLICY Section: 3603 MEDICAID SERVICES MANUAL Subject: POLICY An enrollee who has an emergency medical co ndition may not be held liable for payment of subsequent screening and treatment need ed to diagnose the specific condition or stabilize the patient. The attending physician or the provide r actually treating the enrollee is responsible for determining when the enroll ee is sufficiently stabilized for transfer or discharge and that determin ation is binding on the MCO. C. Post-Stabilization Services The MCO is financially responsible for: 1. Post-stabilization services obtained within or outside the network that are pre- approved by a network provider or MCO representative; 2. Post-stabilization services obtained within or outside the network that are not pre- approved by a network provider or ot her organization representative, but administered to maintain the enrollee's stabilized condition within one hour of a request to the MCO for pre-approval of fu rther post-stabilizat ion care services; 3. Post-stabilization care services obtained within or outside the network that are not pre-approved by a network provider or othe r MCO representative but administered to maintain, improve, or resolve the en rollee's stabilized condition if the MCO does not respond to a request for pre-approval within one hour or the MCO cannot be contacted or the MCO and the treati ng physician cannot reach an agreement concerning the enrollee's care and a ne twork provider or other organization representative is not ava ilable for consultation. In th is situation, the MCO must give the treating physician th e opportunity to consult wi th a network physician and the treating physician may continue with care of the enrollee until a network physician is reached or one of the criteria in 42 CFR 422.113(c)(3) is met. Pursuant to 42 CFR 422.113(c)(3), the MC O's financial responsibility for post- stabilization care it has not pre-approve d ends when a network physician with privileges at the treating hospital assumes responsibility for the enrollee's care or a network physician assumes re sponsibility for the enrollee' s care through transfer or the MCO and the treating physician reach an agreement concerning the enrollee's care or the enrollee is discharged. D. Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) and Rural Health Clinic (RHC) The MCO must pay for services provided by a n FQHC or a n RHC. MCOs may enter into contracts with FQHCs or RHCs, provided that payments must be at least equal to the amount paid other providers for similar services and no lower than the Medicaid FFS rates. If the MCO does not have a contract with an FQHC or RHC, the MCO must pay at a rate equivalent to that paid by the DHCFP FFS ra te schedule. This does not apply to out of July 22, 2013 MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATION Section 3603 Page 8 MTL 10/13 DIVISION OF HEALTH CA RE FINANCING AND POLICY Section: 3603 MEDICAID SERVICES MANUAL Subject: POLICY E.

The MCO must report to the DHCFP payments and visits made to FQHCs and/or RHCs. Out-Of-State Providers When it is necessary for recipients to obt ain services from an Out-Of-State (OOS) provider, the MCO must negotiate a contract to determine the rate prior to services being rendered. The MCO must inform the provider to accept the MCO's reimbursement as payment in full. The only exception is for Thir d-Party Liability (TPL). The provider must not bill, accept or retain payments from Medicaid or NCU recipients. Out-of-state providers of emergency services must accep t as payment in full no more than it would receive if the services were provided under the State's FFS Medicaid program, pursuant to 1932(b)(2)(D) of the Social Security Act. Obstetrical/GYN Services 1. Care Coordination for Certain Pregnant Women The MCO is responsible for the identific ation and medical management of women identified as having a risk of pret erm birth or poor pregnancy outcome. A pregnancy is defined as \"high risk\" wh en there is a likelihood of an adverse outcome to the woman and/or her baby that is greater than the incidence of that outcome in the general pregnant population. It is the responsibility of the MCO to assess the risk status of all enrolled pregnant women. Subsequently, the MCO is responsible for providing medical case management to all enrolled women who have been iden tified as having a high risk pregnancy. The MCO is also responsible for referring enrolled pregnant women identified with specified soci al needs to the Division of Welfare an d Supportive Services (DWSS). The DWSS staff is available to provide information regarding available community support programs to enrollees identified as experiencing any of the specified high risk social issues. The DHCFP District Office staff is available to assist in limited care coordination. The DHCFP will verify that appropriate coordination and communication by the MCO case managers/staff with the DWSS and the DHCFP District Office care coordination st aff is occurring and that such coordination and communication is effective in intervening on behalf of these enrollees.

Obstetrical Global Payment Length of time that the pregnant woman is enrolled in the health plan is not a determining factor in payment to the obstetrician. Payment to the delivering obstetrician for a normal routine pregnanc y shall be based upon the services and number of visits provided by the obstetr ician to the pregnant woman through the course of her pregnancy. Payments are determined by Current Procedural Terminology (CPT ) codes submitted by the provi der. The MCO must provide separate payment for covered medically necessary services required as a result of a non-routine pregnancy. A Global Payment will be paid to the delivering obstetrician, regardless of network affiliation, when the enrollee has been seen seven or more times. If the obstetrician has seen the enrollee less than seven times , the obstetrician will be paid according to the Medicaid FFS visit- by-visit schedule. a. Network Providers For all cases, the MCO must have po licies and procedures in place for transitioning the Medicaid or NCU elig ible pregnant recipient to a network provider. b. Non-network Providers The MCO may reimburse a non-network provid er at a negotiated rate less than the FFS rates established for pre gnancy-related CPT codes. c. New Enrollees within the Last Trimester of Pregnancy A pregnant woman who is enrolled with the MCO within the last trimester of pregnancy must be allowed to remain in the care of a non-network provider, if she so chooses. The MC O must have policies and procedures for this allowance. d. Prior Authorization The MCO's prior authorizat ion policies and procedures must be consistent with the provision of prenatal care in accordance with community standards of practice. Th e DHCFP, at its discretion, may require removal of the prior authorization requirement for various procedures based on reported approval data and any other relevant information. The MCO is required to provide written notificati on to all affected network providers July 22, 2013 MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATION Section 3603 Page 10 MTL 10/13 DIVISION OF HEALTH CA RE FINANCING AND POLICY Section: 3603 MEDICAID SERVICES MANUAL Subject: POLICY 3. 4. 5. within 30 days of end of reported qua rter regarding the elimination of the prior authorizati on requirement. Under no circumstance will visits not covered by Medicaid or NCU be applied toward the minimum number of visits required for a global payment. Certified Nurse Midwife Services The MCO must make certified nurse midwif e services available to enrollees, if such services are available in the MCO's service area. If the MCO does not have a contract for said services, the MCO must pay the certified nurse midwife provider according to the Medicaid FFS schedule for se rvices rendered to the recipient. Maternity Kick Payment (aka Supplemental Omnibus Reconciliation Act (SOBRA) payment) The MCO will receive a maternity kick payment from the DHCFP to cover the maternity costs of any birth, still born, or miscarriage occurring in the third trimester of pregnancy for which an obste trical payment has been made and there is an accompanying provider claim for the delivery. The third trimester commences at 27 weeks of gestation. Maternity kick payments will be generated upon submission of encounter da ta confirming the delivery. The maternity kick payment is intended to offset most of the costs to the health plans for costs associated specifically with the covered deli very of a child, including prenatal and postpartum care. Ante partum care is included in the capitation rate paid for the mother. Cost s of care for the newborn are included in the capitation rate. The DHCFP will not pay a SOBRA payment in a situation where there is no accompanying provider claim for the delivery. Family Planning Services Federal regulations grant the right to an y enrollee of child-bearing age to receive family planning services from any qualified provider, even if th e provider is not part of the MCO's provider network. Th e MCO may not require family planning services to be prior authorized. Family planning services are provided to enrollees who want to control family size or preven t unwanted pregnancies. Family planning services may include education, counseli ng, physical examinations, birth control devices, supplies and Norplant. Pursuant to MSM Chapter 600, tubal ligations and vasectomies are a covered benefit for recipients 21 years of age or older. In accordance with federal July 22, 2013 MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATION Section 3603 Page 11 MTL 10/13 DIVISION OF HEALTH CA RE FINANCING AND POLICY Section: 3603 MEDICAID SERVICES MANUAL Subject: POLICY 6. 7. regulations, the recipient must fill out a consent form at least 30 days prior to the procedure. The physician is required to send the consent form to the fiscal agent with the initial claim. Tubal ligations and vasectom ies to permanently prevent conception are not covered for any recipien t under the age of 21 or any recipient who is adjudged mentally incomp etent or is institutionalized. The MCO must, at a minimum, pay qualifie d out-of-network providers for family planning services rendered to its enrollees at the FFS rate paid by the DHCFP. The MCO will be responsible for coordinating and documenting out-of-network family planning services provided to its recipients and the amounts paid for such services. Coordination of Care Pursuant to 42 CFR 438.208(b )(2, 3, and 4) the MCO is required to implement procedures to coordinate se rvices it may provide to the enrollee with the services the enrollee may receive from any other MCO and implement procedures to share with other MCO serving the enrollee the re sults of its identification and assessment of any CSHCN to ensure services are not duplicated. The MCO must implement procedures to ensure that in the pro cess of coordinating care, each enrollee's privacy is protected consistent with the c onfidentiality requirem ents in 45 CFR 160 and 164 (HIPAA) . The MCO case managers will be responsible for coordinating services with appropriate non-Medicaid programs. This coordination includes referral of potentially eligible enro llees, including women with high risk pregnancies, to appropriate community resources and social service programs. The MCO case managers will also be respons ible for coordinating the transition of services for those enrollees transferring to or from FFS, another MCO, and/or the Silver State Health Insu rance Exchange (HIX). Freestandi ng Obstetric/Bi rth Centers Section 2301 of the Affordable Care Ac t (ACA) requires coverage of services furnished at freestanding birth centers. The MCO is required to provide services at freestanding obstetr ic/birth centers. A freestanding birth center is described as a health faci lity that is not a hospital or physician's office, where childbirth is pla nned to occur away from the pregnant woman's residence. The birth center must be in compliance with applicable state licensure and nationally recognized accr editation organization requirements for the provision of prenatal care, labor, delivery and postpartum care. \"Obstetric Center\", Nevada's legal term for birth center, complies with Section 2301 of the ACA birth center requirements related to the health and safety of recipients provided services by lic ensed birth centers. July 22, 2013 MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATION Section 3603 Page 12 MTL 10/13 DIVISION OF HEALTH CA RE FINANCING AND POLICY Section: 3603 MEDICAID SERVICES MANUAL Subject: POLICY The DHCFP birth center coverage and reimbursement is limited to medically necessary childbirth services which use na tural childbirth procedures for labor, delivery, postpartum care and immediate ne wborn care. Birth center coverage and reimbursement are limited to women admitted to a birth center in accordance with adequate prenatal care, prospect for a normal uncomplicated birth defined by criteria established by the American Colle ge of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and by reasonable generally accepted clinic al standards for maternal and fetal health. Prior authorization is not required.

Refer to Attachment A, Policy #02-01, of MSM Chapter 200 for comprehensive birth center covered se rvices and provider requirements. G. Essential Community Providers (ECP) As defined by the ACA and Secti on 340(B)(a)(4) of the Public Health Service Act, ECPs are providers that have hist orically provided services to underserved populations and demonstrate a commitment to serve low in come, underserved populations who make up a significant portion of its patient population or, in the case of a sole community provider, serves underserved patients within its clinical capability; and (b) waives charges or charges for services on a modified sliding f ee scale based on income and does not restrict access or services because of a client's fina ncial limitations. The MCOs must make a good faith effort to negotiate a contract with th e ECPs who are located in the plan's geographic service area. The Health Re sources and Services Admini stration (HRSA) provides a non- exclusive list of ECPs; however, the DHCFP re serves the right to m odify this list at any time. 3603.6 ADDITIONAL PREVENTIVE SERVICES The MCO is encouraged to offer additional preventive or cost-effective services to enrolled recipients, if the services do not increase the cost to the State. 3603.7 DENTAL SERVICES Dental services are included in the MCO bene fit package in geographic areas designated as mandatory managed care areas. The MCO will be re sponsible for all covered medically necessary dental services pursuant to MSM Chapter 1000 and the State Plan, Section 3.1-A.

Medications not covered in the MCO's formulary must be available through a non-fo rmulary request process based on physician certification and justification of medical necessity. Pharmacy coverage benefits are based on the State Plan. The MCO may use generic substitutions unless the physician/dentist justifies the medical necessity of the brand name pharmaceutical. The MCO must have a policy for transitioning a r ecipient's prescriptions from FFS, another MCO or the HIX, to the MCO , vendor or HIX. The MCO will not be allowed to terminate a current prescription without first conducting a medical examination of the recipient. The MCO then must document why a drug is not medically necessary , if a current prescription is terminated. The DHCFP shall approve the MCO's formular y prior to implementation. The MSM Chapter 1200 stipulates the conditions with which a prescrib er must comply to certify that a specific brand of medication is medically necessary for a part icular patient. The physician should document in the patient's medical record the need for the bra nd name product in place of the generic form. The procedure of the certification must comply with the following: certification must be in the physician's own handwriting; and, ce rtification must be written di rectly on the prescription blank and a phrase indicating the need for a specific br and is required (an example would be \"Brand Medically Necessary\").

Disenrollment at the Request of the Enrollee Enrollees eligible in the 90-day \"right to change\" period may request disenrollment from the MCO without cause at any time during this period. The enrollee is required to notify the DHCFP fiscal agent by mail of his/her decision to disenroll and, if he/she is a mandatory recipient, as defined by the mandatory managed care geographical areas of urban Clark or Was hoe County, will be assigned to the other MCO. The effective date of change in the MCO will be based on the monthly administrative cutoff date but not later than the first day of the second month following the month in which the enrollee makes the request to disenroll. After the first 90 days of enrollment, the enrollee will be locked into an MCO until the next open enrollment period. There will be one open enrollment period annually. If the enrollee wishes to disenroll at any tim e during the lock-in period, they must contact the appropriate MCO and provide good cause for doing so. The MCO will determine good cause as defined in 42 CFR 438.56. NCU enrollees may request disenrollmen t from the MCO without cause during the first 90 days of enrollment and are requi red to contact the NCU office if they request disenrollment from the MCO and if he/she is a mandatory recipient, must select another MCO. After the first 90 days of enrollment, the enrollee will be locked into an MCO for the remainder of the current open enrollment period. There will be one open enrollment period annually.

Most often, a cap itation payment error is introduced due to an inaccuracy in eligibility or enrollment status. Some errors are corrected automatically by the MMIS, others by manual fina ncial transaction. Depe nding upon the nature of the error in a particular instance, capitation may be paid or re covered from the MCO. Capitation is also reconciled periodically, typi cally for a three-month period. a. Errors automatically corrected by the MMIS The MMIS automatically adjusts up to thr ee months of capitation for newborns when updated Welfare eligibility data for the curren t month also includes previously unreported eligibility. In those instances where an eligibility agen t has corrected an estimated date of birth forward in time, the MMIS automatically recovers the incorrectly paid capitation. Should an error extend beyond three months, the instance must be researched and corrected manually by fi nancial transaction. b. Errors Corrected Manually by Financial Transaction The MCO, in order to recover unpaid capitation, is required to submit such instances on a periodic basis via the process described in the Contract (Forms and Reporting Guide). The Business Lines unit reconc iles and authorizes payment of these retro-capitation payment requests on a quarterly basis with suffi cient lag time (typical ly three months) to allow automated MMIS corrections to occur. The Business Lines unit also re conciles and authorizes capita tion recovery in instances where it is discovered that capitation has been incorrectly paid. This may occur on either a periodic or per-instance basis. c. Reconciliation of Capitation Payments The Business Lines unit determines the validity of retro-capitation requests or may use an appropriate sample for a large number of payment requests.

TPL also includes the Coordination of Bene fits (COB) cost avoidance a nd COB recovery. Under Section 1902(a)(25) of the Social Security Act, the DHCFP is required to take all reasonable measures to identify legally liable third parties and treat verified TPL as a resource of the Medicaid and CHIP recipient. For the DHCFP's contracts with MCOs, subrogation is the principle under wh ich an insurer that has paid a loss under an insurance policy is entitled to all the rights and remedies belonging to the insured against a third party with re spect to any loss covered by the policy. The MCO shall act as the State's authorized agent for the limited purpose of TPL collection, within the limitation of the Fair Debt Coll ection Practices Act, 15 USC \u00a7 CFR 433.147. The MCO's capitated payments include an offset in the rates for these collectio ns. The MCO shall vigorous ly pursue billing prior resources and report their TPL and subrogation collection result s to the DHCFP quarterly, as these amounts are considered pa rt of their capitation. MCOs are required to secure signed acknowledgements from enro lled Medicaid recipients or their authorized representative for any prior resources (Medicare, worker's compensation, private insurance, and similar resources ). The MCO must pursue TPL in accordance with 42 CFR 433.139. The MCO must also determine if casualty cl aims are filed and r ecover costs through subrogation on behalf of both Medicaid and CHIP recipients. The MCO is responsible for not only pursuing third party resources that it identifies but also for pursuing third-party resources identified and communicated to the MCO by the DHCFP. All information on the third party, including collections and collection attempts, are to be re ported to the DHCFP (including circumstances under which the third party refuses to pay) on the Third Party Quarterly Report Form. The DHCFP will monitor and evaluate the MCO' s TPL and subrogation collection reports to validate collection activities and results . The MCO will then be expected t o m e e t o r e x c e e d baseline target collections as determined by the DHCFP and its actuaries. If the MCO does not meet or exceed baseline TPL and subrogation collections, the DHCFP will conduct a review to determine if there is a legitimate re ason. If there is no legitimate reason as determined by the Division , the difference between baseline and actual collections will be deducted from the MCO's costs before the data is used to set future rates. The DHCFP will prospectively adjust capitation rates downward to account for expected TPL collections. July 22, 2013 MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATION Section 3603 Page 37 MTL 10/13 DIVISION OF HEALTH CA RE FINANCING AND POLICY Section: 3603 MEDICAID SERVICES MANUAL Subject: POLICY The vendor is required to obtain TPL information independently of the DHC FP for the purpose of avoiding claim payments or recovering payments made from liable third parties. TPL recovery may be incorporated into the capitated rate development by the DHCFP and its actuary. The vendor has 365 days from claim paid date to recover the TPL paym ent; after 365 days, the vendor forfeits the right to recovery to the State unless the vendor can provi de evidence that the recovery effort is active and/or in dispute. 3603.24 PROHIBITION ON PAYMENTS TO INSTITUT IONS OR ENTITIES LOCATED OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES Pursuant to Section 6505 of the ACA, which ame nds Section 1902(a) of the Social Security Act (the Act), the vendor shall not provide any paym ents for items or services provided under the State Plan or under a waiver to any financial ins titution or entity located outside of the United States (U.S.). Payments for items or services provided under th e State Plan to financial institutions or entities such as provider bank accounts or business agents located outside of the U.S. are prohibited by this provision. Further, this Section prohibits payments to teleme dicine providers located outside of the U.S. Additionally; payments to pharmacies located outside of the U.S. are not permitted. Any payments for items or services provided under the State Plan or under a waiver to any financial institution or entity located outside of the U.S. may be recovered by the State from the Vendor. For purposes of implementing this provision, Section 1101(a) (2) of the Act defines the term \"United States\" when used in a geographical sense, to mean the \"States.\" Section 1101(a)(1) of the Act defines the term \"State\" to include the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and American Samoa, when used under Title XIX. The phrase, \"items or services provided under the State Plan or under a waiver\" refers to medical assistance for which the State claims Federal funding under section 1903(a) of the Act. Tasks that support the administration of the Medicaid State Plan that may require payments to financial institutions or entities located outside of the U.S. are not prohibited under this statute. For example, payments for outsourcing information processing related to Plan administration or outsourcing call centers related to enrollment or claims adjudication are not prohibited under this statute. 3603.25 MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM (MIS) A. The MCO shall operate the MIS capable of maintaining, providing, documenting, and retaining information sufficient to substantiate and report MCO's compliance with the contract requirements.

Enrollee Grievances and Appeals The MCO's grievance and appeal system must be in writing and submitted to the Division of Health Care Financing and Policy (DHCFP ) for review and approval at the time the MCO policies and procedures are submitted. The DHCFP will refer all enrollee grievances and appeals to the MCO for resolution. The MCO must provide information about the grievance and appeal system to all providers and subcontractors at the time they enter into a contract. The MCO is required to provide access to state fair hearings in the event an enrollee's MCO appeal is not resolved wholly in favor of the enrollee. An enrollee may file for an MCO appeal or grievance either orally or in writing. A provider, acting on behalf of the enrollee and with the enrollee's written consent, may also file an appeal. 1. Action The MCO must provide standard authorizat ion decisions as expeditiously as the enrollee's health requires and within the State's established timelines that may not exceed 14 calendar days following receipt of the request for service, with a possible extension of up to 14 additional ca lendar days if the enrollee or provider requests the extension; or, the MCO ju stifies (to the DHCFP upon request) a need for additional information and how the extension is in the enrollee's interests. For cases in which a provider indicates or the MCO determines that following the standard timeframe could seriously jeopa rdize the enrollee's life or health or ability to attain, maintain, or regain maximum function, the MCO must make an expedited authorization decision and provide a Notice of Decision (NOD) as expeditiously as the enrollee's health condition warrants and no later than three working days after receipt of the reque st for service.
