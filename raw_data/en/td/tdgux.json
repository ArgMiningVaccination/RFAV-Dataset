Homeopathy is safe, effective and has no side effects! Updated: Mar 9, 2021 As you can tell from my previous posting, I am very much in Camp \"Get Vaccinated\"! I support this opinion even if you have had negative reactions to vaccines in the past, even if you know that you are sensitive to the egg suspension they used previously to preserve and deliver the vaccine to the body, even if you know you are metal toxic and react to the mercury or aluminum that also used to be used as a preservative and to stabilize the suspension liquid. I support this opinion even if you or your child is Autistic. I know this last statement is going to drum up a lot of controversy, but this is my opinion and this is my forum to express that opinion. I am not proposing that you abandon all your stands against the whole category of vaccines. I am proposing that you consider the risk of NOT getting this vaccine. That risk outweighs any perceived benefits of not getting vaccinated. I am also not proposing that you do this without support. There are many things that can be incorporated into your daily life briefly prior to getting the vaccine and may be used only temporarily until any symptoms or side effects of receiving the vaccine have subsided. How the mRNA Vaccine Works: Messenger RNA is a small piece of copied DNA code that is really a set of instructions used to build a new protein structure. Viral infections are different than bacterial infections because viruses are not technically alive, so they cannot be killed. What are viruses then you ask? Well, viruses are simply bits of RNA coding waiting for a host cell to unwittingly incorporate it into the daily production routine. With the coronavirus, there is a protein on the surface of the cell infected with COVID called a spike protein, which is how the virus infects a new host. Scientists have been able to isolate the specific piece of coding that will produce this same spike protein and that is the basis for the new mRNA vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna. So, to finally answer the question - the vaccine contains a small amount of the mRNA coding instructions to make that \"spike\" protein that the virus uses to infiltrate our lungs so effectively; when our bodies receive the vaccine that contains the mRNA instructions to build the protein, that's what happens... our bodies begin to literally produce the protein found on the surface of the viral cell. This is why you have a \"reaction\" to the vaccine. I want to make sure to note that the mRNA vaccines never enter the nucleus of the cell, where our DNA is stored. After injection, the mRNA from the vaccine is released into the cytoplasm of the cells. Once the viral protein is made and on the surface of the cell, mRNA is broken down and the body permanently gets rid of it, therefore making it impossible to change our DNA. Now, many people have a reaction to the Flu vaccine as well, that is because the flu vaccine is made from viral DNA coding, which means that there are extra steps involved in breaking down the code before the body is able to find the appropriate instructions and build the flu protein. The coronavirus mRNA vaccine delivers the specific instructions in a condensed, \"Reader's Digest\" version, if you will, while the DNA in the flu vaccine is more of a whole manual in which the specific instructions can be found. Once your body produces this coronavirus protein, it can then start the process of figuring out what it is so that it knows what to do with the \"foreign invader\" now and in the future if/when encountered again in the \"real world\". Because the vaccine contains only a small amount of genetic coding, only a small amount of protein will be generated. Prior to the vaccine, when infected, a person's immune system was easily overloaded with material containing the instructions to make the protein that was causing all the problems and so the body continued to make viral protein until all of the material containing instructions to make the protein was used up. By that point, however, it was too late, the protein instructions had been causing the body to produce an overabundance of the virus and it proved to be too much for many, many, many people to handle. How Naturopathic Medicine and Homeopathy Can Help Support You Through the Vaccination Process: There are a variety of symptoms that will occur as your body's immune system gets triggered by the existence of the protein that was produced from the mRNA vaccine. First a report about the problems... then an offered solution. These are the possible symptoms that are created by the immune system once it starts to fight against the invasion: Headache Fever Nausea Body Aches and Pains Chills (with or without fever) Fatigue Diarrhea (may or may not alternate with constipation) So, my next topic was going to be about support for the mercury, aluminum and egg suspension reactions, but the only research I can find says that the new mRNA vaccines contain none of these things. Now, don't get me wrong, I did not stop searching after finding this at one source... no, no, no, no, no.... I continued to hunt and, of course, came up with several more sources saying the same thing. Because conventional vaccines rely on weakened and inactivated pathogens or a fragment of the pathogen to trigger an immune response, aluminum was used to help trigger the immune system's response while egg and mercury suspensions were used primarily as preservative and stabilizing agents. In contrast, the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines use a novel approach by which whole, unattenuated mRNA is delivered into our cells to provide the instructions for our own cells to \"temporarily\" make a small amount of a very \"specific\" viral protein. The viral protein that is produced triggers an immune response all by itself, so there is no need for the aluminum. The mercury and the egg are rendered obsolete because the mRNA provided in this COVID-19 vaccine is neither fragmented, weakened nor inactivated so there is nothing to help \"preserve\". The main ingredients in the vaccines are simple. What the vaccine DOES contain are: Lipids - Their main role is to protect the mRNA and provide somewhat of a \"greasy\" exterior that helps the mRNA slide inside the cells. Salts - To help balance the acidity in your body. Sugar - Basic table sugar, also known as sucrose, helps the molecules maintain their shape during freezing. The remaining ingredients, including acids and acid stabilizers, all work together with the lipids, salt and sugar to maintain the stability of the vaccine after it's produced. THAT is literally all there is to it!!! I now can find absolutely no reason for anyone not to chomping at the bit to be the next in line to receive this small and simple yet necessary measure to keep not only yourself, but your loved ones - those you treasure most - saver, with less risk of contracting the illness - let alone dying from it - and that much closer to eradicating it entirely!!! As promised, potential solutions offered to help support you through the vaccination process. Outside of what was talked about above, my aunt is both an MD psychiatrist and a long-time sufferer from what was finally labeled as an Auto-Immune Disease; although, no one was able to identify where, why or how she had gotten sick. She remains healthy and active due to management of her symptoms with medications. She was also eligible to receive the vaccine as she is in that age-group. She signed up as fast as possible. She also experienced symptoms of her particular autoimmune pattern, which originally felt to her like a relapse which was scary, but after consulting her doctor they both realized that her original trigger must certainly have been viral in origin and so they were prepared for the second round. The second shot did cause her to experience some symptoms, but nothing similar to the first set and again, they had a plan. So, why the long tirade after telling you I have solutions? To let you know that I have personal experience about what kinds of things can go wrong following the injection and that I am here without expectations, without judgment and without prejudice. If you feel you are sensitive to the possible after-effects of receiving the vaccine, there are avenues to removing the obstacles getting in the way of the goal. Of course, there are the basics of health support: vitamins C, D and A to support the immune system anti-viral botanical tinctures such as Olive Leaf, Lemon Balm and/or St. John's Wort Immunoglobulins and probiotics to increase quercetin, bromelain and/or boswellia There are also Homeopathic medicines that will help you reduce the severity and frequency of your symptoms but I can only offer a suggestion after hearing about your specific condition, set of symptoms and asking a few questions that give me insight into your susceptibility and current condition of general health.
