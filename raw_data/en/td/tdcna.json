Homeopathy originated in Europe in the late-eighteenth century by Samuel Hahnemann. The development of homeopathic remedies evolved to replace some of the prevailing medical treatments in that time period that were considered extreme and excessive. Homeopathy evolved in an endeavour to reduce antiquated medical treatments such as blood-letting, prescription mercury, and even arsenic. Doctors, healers, and patients were ready for new medical methods and treatments, and homeopathy became a system of alternative medicine evolving side-by-side with modern medicine as we know it today. For this reason, Homeopathy is often referred to as alternative medicine and is a medical system based on the belief that the body can balance itself. Homeopathic remedies use natural substances such as plants and minerals to stimulate the healing process. Though homeopathy is common in many European countries it's not quite as popular here in the United States yet. Homeopathic History Dr. Samuel Hahnemann (1755-1843), a German physician, [became the father of homeopathy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TC7ZGPRyJyw&t=2s). He became interested in the idea of 'Similia Simibilus Curenter', a theory first noted years earlier by Hippocrates, that any substance causing ill symptoms will, when diluted serve to remedy that same condition. Hahnemann began this process based on research from the Cinchona tree. Its bark contains quinine, which has been used to treat malaria. Hahnemann ingested cinchona bark extract and began suffering from symptoms of malaria. Thus, he concluded that substances used on a healthy individual would reveal the symptoms for the ailment he was trying to cure. Homeopathy means 'same suffering'. Meaning that a healthy person who ingests small amounts of a substance that creates negative symptoms, would actually help to heal the unhealthy person's immune system to respond more efficiently and effectively: immunoregulation. Homeopathy for Allergies An allergy is the hypersensitive reaction of your immune system to a stimulus. Of all the allergies that adults suffer from around the world, Allergic Rhinitis or Hay Fever ranks 5th! More and more people are experiencing allergies as we are being exposed to more and more stimuli. You may have never had allergies where you were born and grew up, however they may have only shown up after you moved to a place with completely different pollens, trees, or pollution levels. Homeopathy deduces that intentionally introducing the allergen at microscopic doses, your immune system should respond. If your body comes into contact with the allergen, your immune system will have a map to fight even harder for you. This logic is how someone can be tested for allergies. An allergist will scratch your skin with various allergens and watch the effects. This logic is also how vaccines were developed, and is the forerunner in food allergy treatments. Food allergies have increased a hundredfold in mere decades and can produce serious illness to some. For example, someone with a peanut allergy may eat a solitary peanut a day just to increase their tolerance (if you have a peanut allergy, please consult with a physician before eating any peanuts). Homeopathy has had a great track record over the past few centuries, and that is why it is still popular today, so [when it comes to allergies](https://cbhenergetics.com/signsoftheseasonsensitivities/), speak to a physician to see if a homeopathic remedy is right for you.
