We'll take our time and use our knowledge / skill-set to treat these problems & guide you to your desired outcome. With pain management (think typical daily aches, spinal pain, headaches etc) we can easily manage these problems. With acupuncture, we deal with a significant portion of the fertility population in the region, working in conjunction with local specialists. Dr. Tricia is widely recognized for her expertise in this field. We also deal with a large portion of chronic pain management patients with acupuncture, working with the local VA. We handle all of these things and many more, the takeaway being we will tailor our therapies to your individual needs and desired outcomes. Our clinic consists of individual treatment rooms, it is not an open room concept. We believe in privacy and one on one time with our providers. We do not double book our appointment times, your appointment time is reserved for you alone so our wait times are as minimal as possible. We understand the value of your time. We work in conjunction with your medical providers, not against them. Over the past two decades, our clinic has achieved excellent outcomes with very high patient satisfaction rates.
