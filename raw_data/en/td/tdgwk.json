Essential Oils Essential Oils have so many uses and are better for the body than their chemical counterparts. Lemongrass, Peppermint, Eucalyptus, Cedarwood, and Lavender all help to repel or kill fleas. Remember! Essential oils should never be used undiluted on the skin- especially on pets. Not all pets are equal, thus some smells/oils may effect your pet more than others. Keep this in mind and always start with very small amounts first. This is a recommendation for dogs. Do not use essential oil on cats. Trying putting oils on your dog's collar to help get rid of fleas naturally that way, like a homemade flea collar! Just a few drops in a circle around the collar will help immediately. Replenish the oils about once a week. Apple Cider Vinegar By now you probably have heard of all the wonders of Apple Cider Vinegar. It also works to repel fleas - with the added benefit of improving your pets fur! To use externally, add half a cup of water and half a cup of vinegar to a spray bottle, then generously apply to your pet and around your home. Feel free to add a few drops of essential oils as well for a better smell! Homemade Flea Powder With a few herbs and essentials oils, you can make your own homemade flea powder to help prevent fleas. Herbs like catnip, rosemary, sage, and yarrow have some flea repelling properties. Grind up these herbs with diatomaceous earth and add in a few drops of cedar or eucalyptus oil and apply to your dog (or leave out the oils for your cats) once a month or as needed.

Bathing & Shampooing While there are several recipes out there for homemade dog shampoo for fighting fleas, here is one of our favorites that works well for dogs with sensitive skin. 1 quart of water 1 cup of white vinegar or apple cider vinegar 1 cup of baby shampoo or non-toxic dish soap (many sites recommend Dawn by name)* 2-3 drops of lavender essential oil (Not for cats) Cut the recipe in half if you are bathing a smaller dog or a puppy. Work the homemade dog shampoo into your dog's fur, particularly along hard-to-reach areas. Comb or brush your dog during rinsing to get rid of dead fleas and catch any surviving ones. ** Note: Dawn and baby shampoo should not be used frequently on dogs as it may dry out a dog's skin and should not be used on dogs with a chronically dry skin disease.
