INTEGRATIVE AND HOLISTIC MEDICAL CARE Family Holistic Health Services Classical Homeopathy is a form of alternative medicine using safe and effective natural remedies to stimulate the body's inherent healing mechanisms. These are not the same as supplements or herbs, though they may be derived from plants, minerals, or animal substances. Homeopathic remedies are extremely dilute, and very safe. Homeopathy has been used worldwide for over 200 years. It is used to treat all manner of disease, whether physical or mental/emotional. For more information about homeopathic medicine, including links to research, visit the website of the American Institute of Homeopathy, [HERE](https://homeopathyusa.org/homeopathic-medicine.html). Osteopathic manipulation is a gentle form of therapeutic body manipulation. In our practice, a variety of techniques are used (including cranial osteopathy, the 'mother' of craniosacral therapy) to help the body regain proper structure/function relationships, and to improve health. For more information about osteopathic manipulation, visit the website of the American Osteopathic Association, [HERE](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/70381).

A variety of anthroposophic therapeutic modalities are used in our practice, including natural remedies and nursing care.
