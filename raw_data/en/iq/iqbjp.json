Some of this research has shown that there appears to be good evidencefor the plasticity of the physiological system evenafter age 60 years. While biological aging isinescapable, the functional consequences of this process can apparently be minimized byregular physical activity . Singh reported several physiological changes due to aging that aremodifiable by exercise. A few of the relevantchanges include increases in aerobic functioning,greater motor coordination, improved musclestrength and tissue elasticity , greater total energyexpenditure, and improved REM sleep durationand attention span. Exercise Adherence Patterns of Seniors Clearly , physical activity has important implications in altering many of the biological changes associated with aging. However, in order to enjoy these physiological improvements, a regular exerciseprogram must be maintained. Herein lies thechallenge facing most seniors. Although thereappears to be a modest increase in physicalactivity in early old age (65-75 years) due to anincrease in leisure time after retirement, exerciseintervention studies have documented drop outrates from 6 to 34 per cent with most recidivismoccurring within the first 3 months of beginningan exercise program.Martin and Sinden examined exercise adherence rates of older adults (>55 yrs) across 21 randomized controlled trials. They concluded that on average,participants completed 78% of their prescribedexercise sessions and that adherence rates weregreater for strength and flexibility programs (87%attendance) than aerobic based programs (75%).They concluded that adherers tended to be fitter at baseline, were previously physically active, non-smokers, and had a high sense of confidencein their ability to exercise. Similarly , a recent study by Goggin and Morrow found that 89% of 403 adults over the age of 60 were aware of the health benefits of physicalactivity but only 31% of them were participatingin sufficient physical activity to obtain suchbenefits. Physical activity was also found todecrease with age and men tended to be morephysically active than women. Clearly , there is aneed to better understand how to help seniorsinitiate and maintain an exercise program that benefits them on a number of health dimensions. 36 1 VOLUME 104 JULY 2003Older Americans Because of the increase in life expectancy and decrease in birth rates, the proportion of thepopulation over 65 is increasing. In 1985, morethan 11 percent of the population was over 65.By the year 2030, approximately one-fifth of the population is expected to be over age 65. (In Nova Scotia in 2003, more than 14 percent of the population is over 65. By the year 2025,approximately one-quarter of the population isexpected to be over age 65.) The aging process begins at birth and continues throughout life. However, some persons may seem old at 60 and others are alert, vital, and enthusiastic at 70 years of age. Did you ever wonder why?There are many reasons. The physical reasons for aging are related to the way we treat the body . Do you eat right? Do you exercise? Do you get enough rest? Do you have physical checkups regularly? Each person receives a unique genetic makeup,but good nutrition and healthy habits can keepthe body from aging faster than it should. There are psychological reasons why some persons age more than others. A person's attitudeabout life and aging can shorten or lengthen life,causing one to experience depression or vitality .Healthy attitudes keep the mind and body strong;unhealthy attitudes erode the mind and body . 1. Expect and adjust to change. Change is an inevitable part of life and living. Look atchange as an opportunity for growth. 2. Maintain a sense of humor. Life maintains a sense of balance and perspective whenhumor is retained. Take time to enjoy lifeand to laugh! 3. Do something each day you like to do. This gives you something to look forwardto and adds interest to life. 4. Do something each day that you do not like to do, but must be done. This addschallenge and a sense of accomplishment to your day . 5. Do something each day for someone else. This gets your mind off yourself and yoursituation. It forces you to look towardothers and how you can help others. 6. Exercise. Walking is one of the best forms of exercise or join a group exercise program. 7. Eat properly . a) Eat a variety of foods. b) Maintain healthy weight.c) Choose a diet low in fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol. Choose a diet withplenty of vegetables, fruits, and grainproducts. d) Use sugars only in moderation. e) Use salt and sodium only in moderation. f) If you drink alcoholic beverages, do so in moderation. 8. Maintain connectedness with others. It is important to have a network of friends andfamily members with whom to talk andexperience this business of life and living.Enjoy persons from different generations.Nurture a child? Talk with a teenager? 9. Maintain enjoyable surroundings. Most persons enjoy familiar surroundings.Surround yourself with colors youappreciate, flowers if you enjoy them, or with a collection of stamps if that isimportant to you. 10. Make it a point to learn something new each day . 11. Be open to new ideas and interests. 12. Focus on the positive. Look for the good things in your life. Smile, keep your chin up, and move forward. 13. Nurture a sense of personal worth. You are unique. Enjoy the person you are. 14. Nurture self-confidence. Maintain confidence in your abilities. 15. Use resources wisely . Resources include time, talent, money , and energy . 16. Invest in life and living. Look forward to each new day .

Influencing the Physical Activity Patterns of SeniorsWe attempted to evaluate a community exercise group geared toward seniors in order to gain abetter understanding of how two potentiallyimportant items, self-confidence and socialsupport may influence participation rates of theexercising elderly . Self-Confidence A factor that plays an important role in themotivation to be involved in health pursuits and to be physically active is self-confidence.Self-confidence is an individual's beliefs in theirabilities to complete desired actions. The strongeran individual's sense of self-confidence, the morelikely they are to choose to engage in certainactivities, the more effort they will extend andthe longer they will persist. Individuals whobelieve in their abilities to perform and plan forexercise are motivated to persist in their exercise- related behavior (i.e, adherers). Less self-confident people do not hold such beliefs to the same extent and as a result their exercise-related behavior isless persistent, more irregular, or halts altogether.Various researchers have found that beliefs about personal ability are robust predictors of maintenance to exercise programs in older adults. Social Support Another important factor that influences exercisebehavior concerns the other people who alsoengage in the physical activity . This factor hasbeen labeled social support and has beenconsidered both as the quantity and quality ofsupport that individuals receive from significantothers. Uchino, Cacioppo, and Kiecolt-Glaserfound in their review of 81 studies that socialsupport was related to positive effects on thecardiovascular, endocrine, and immune systems.Weiss proposed six social functions or provisions which may be obtained from social interactions:attachment (emotional support), social integration (network support), reassurance of worth (esteem support), reliable alliance (tangible aid), guidance (informational support), and opportunity for nurturance . 2 31Secretariat Newsletter The Secretariat Newsletter is published four times a year by the Senior Citizens'Secretariat and distributed free of charge.We welcome letters, articles, and items of interest from you. Please include yourname, address, and telephone number on all correspondence. The Senior Citizens' Secretariat was established in 1980 to facilitate the planning and development of services and programs for seniors by coordinatingplans, policies, and programs presented by the departments of the provincial government. The Secretariat serves as aone-door entry to government for seniors,seniors' groups, and other provincial bodies concerned with ageing issues. The Secretariat develops plans, policies,and programs in partnership with otherlevels of government and agencies responsible for seniors. The Secretariat's office is located at 1740 Granville Street, 4th floor Sun worshippers, cover your eyes! Studies have shown that permanent damage to the eyes can result from prolonged exposure tothe sun without adequate protection. Ultra violet(UV) light is the component of sunlight mostresponsible for eye damage. Excessive exposure, especially from light reflected from sand, snow orpavement, can produce a burn on the surface ofthe eye. Like a sunburn on the skin, eye surfaceburns are usually painful, but temporary . Of more concern is the cumulative damage of repeated exposure that may contribute to chronic eye disease. UV exposure can affect not only itssurface, but also its internal structures (the lensand retina). UV light is a risk factor in the development of pterygium (a growth that invades the corner ofthe eyes), cataracts (clouding of the lens) and macular degeneration (breakdown of the macula). Those at risk include people who spend a lot of time in the sun, those who live at highaltitudes or near the equator, and those who take photosensitizing drugs such as psoralens(used to treat psoriasis), tetracycline,doxycycline, allopurinol or phothiazine. During cataract surgery , the natural lens is removed and replaced with a synthetic lens. Newer intraocular lens implants filter UVradiation. This eliminates any concern about UV eye protection after cataract surgery . To protect your eyes from the sunlight, it is recommended that you wear a wide brimmed hat and sunglasses that filter out 99-100 per cent of the UV light. Eye Facts\u2014Sunglasses Here are a few tips to help you choose a pair of sunglasses that can protect your eyes from the damage that can be caused by prolongedexposure to sunlight. First, look at the label. Although universal standards are not in place, most manufacturerslabel their products stating their protectiveability . The Canadian Ophthalmological Societyrecommends that glasses block 99-100 per cent of UV light (both UV-A and UV-B). If you spend a lot of time in the sun, it is recommended that you buy wrap-around glasses to prevent the sun from entering your eyes fromthe sides. Don't be deceived by color or cost. Dark lenses do not necessarily mean good protection. Also,expensive glasses do not guarantee goodprotection. Price may be an indication of betterquality or durability , but more often, it is areflection of current fashion.

Your participationwould be much appreciated. The study is fundedby the Alzheimer Society of Canada. Source: Hazel MacRae, Mount Saint Vincent UniversityCutrona and Russell found that social provisions were related to positive health outcomes in theelderly . The strongest predictors were reliablealliance and guidance. With respect to exercise,Sharratt and Brawley found that subjective normor what individuals perceive others would wantthem to do, an aspect of social support, was akey variable in predicting exercise behavior ofthe elderly . Relationship between Social Support and Self-Confidence Social support can enhance people's beliefs in their abilities. Positive emotional support,guidance, or advice may result in greater self- confidence. In turn, this increased self-confidence may lead to improved coping behavior such as awillingness to try harder, generate more effort orpersist longer. Thus, the social support receivedinfluences behavioral outcomes by virtue ofenhancing self-confidence. In their studies with seniors, Cutrona and Russell noted that the elderly face problems that affecttheir independence regarding health and lifestylewhich they did not face in earlier years. Anexercise program geared toward seniors is a likely source of social support that is capable of influencing feelings of confidence and howfrequently an individual exercises. Social supportin the form of provisions is provided for theparticipants by class members and the classinstructor. Given that positive social support hasbeen related to better health, social provisionsaimed toward improving physical capability arelikely conducive to increasing physical activitypatterns. Study Findings Sixty-two seniors (51 females and 11 males) were the volunteer participants in the study . Their mean age was 69.8 years for a sample ranging in agefrom 54 to 83 years. They were enrolled in five different community-based 10 week fitness classes. All were healthy and 73 percent were retired with the remainder still engaged in some form ofwork. The classes in which they took part wereleader structured and occurred twice per week. With respect to social support, we evaluated three provisions that class members and theinstructor may provide to the exerciseparticipant: reassurance of worth, guidance, and social integration. Three self-confidencemeasures were also evaluated. They were self-confidence for a) in-class exercise components(e.g., for completing aerobic or muscularendurance aspects), b) exercise programattendance (e.g., making it to class twice perweek or rescheduling), and c) other physicalactivity (e.g., shoveling snow in the winter orgardening in the summer. The objective of thestudy was to explore the possible influence ofsocial support and self-confidence on fitness class adherence for seniors. In general, it was found that seniors have relatively high levels of self-confidence and modest levels of social support. What is mostinteresting is the high degree of variabilityexpressed in the measures indicating thatparticipants in the same exercise classes can feelvery differently with respect to amount of socialsupport they are receiving or their perceptions of ability (self-confidence). Adherence was not a problem for this group of exercising seniors, with individuals attending amean 81% of the 10 week classes. The socialprovision of reassurance of worth stronglyinfluenced all three types of self-confidence. As well, an individual's self-confidence to attendclasses regularly predicted how frequently theyactually did attend the exercise classes. Therefore,the findings appear to capture an additiverelationship, where social support (particularly reassurance of worth) influences self-confidence and self-confidence (particularly attendanceconfidence) influences attendance. It appears that in order to keep seniors regularly active, they need to feel capable about their abilities. One way to ensure that they do feel self-confidentis to provide a highly supportive exerciseenvironment that promotes feelings of self-worth. 30 3Blood Pressure Two Numbers You Should Know A blood pressure measurement has two numbers you need to pay attention to\u2014systolic anddiastolic pressures. If either number is high, it means your heart is working harder to pump blood through yourarteries. This can eventually lead to diseasedarteries. A pressure that's \"high-normal\" or higher puts you at risk. Urinary Tract Infections If you're a post-menopausal woman and havebeen having frequent urinary tract infections(UTIs), it may mean your blood sugar levels arerunning too high. Women with diabetes typically experience more UTIs than nondiabetic women. Source: Diabetes Care , Vol. 25, Pg. 1778For Bones More than just calcium So often, you hear that calcium is what you need for strong bones. The truth is, there's a whole team of nutrients your bones need to stay strong. Calcium is justone. In addition to 1,200 mg of daily calcium, you also need lesser amounts of magnesium,phosphorus, boron, copper, manganese,zinc, vitamins B-6, C, D, K, and folic acid. The best way to get many of these nutrients is to eat a variety of colorful vegetables\u2014especially leafy greens such as kale andcollard, roots like carrots and turnips, andcruciferous vegetables like broccoli,cauliflower, and cabbage (and of course,dairy products are high in calcium). You also need protein so your body can manufacture collagen\u2014important to skinand bones. You need healthful fats (e.g., fatty fish, olive oil, nuts, seeds, flaxseed), which help yourbody absorb vitamin D. Suspected Bone-Robbers Smoking. Caffeine and soda pop (especially colas)\u2014in excess. Excess animal protein and refined processed foods (sugar and white flour products). Bothcontribute to an acid condition in the bodythat can leach minerals out of your bones. Excessive sodium (more than about 2,400 mg per day , or about 1 tsp. of salt). We getour highest doses of sodium from processedor restaurant foods (e.g., TV dinners, cannedsoups, fast foods, etc.). Sources: Robert P . Heaney , up 90 and up High Normal 130-139 85-89 Normal Less than 130 Less than 85 Low Normal Less than 120 Less than 80Application and Recommendations It appears that when fellow exercisers and the class instructor reassure seniors of their worthrelative to exercise class and other physical activities, they gain exercise-related self-confidence either vicariously and/or through the verbal persuasion of others who attend the class. In the present group of exercisers,anecdotally we found it was quite common forseniors to view the exercise group not only as ameans to exercise but also as a social group towhich they enjoyed belonging. This demonstratesthe importance of social support in a positiveexercise setting for seniors. To a group of exercising seniors, the class environment plays much more of a role thansimply providing a place to move muscles. It is an environment where participants feelconfident about their ability to attend as well asto complete the necessary in-class components.Most importantly , the self-confidence developedwithin an exercise setting appears to begeneralizable to other domains that necessitatesome degree of physical activity . This is paramount when dealing with a senior population. The primary concern of most aging individuals is to maintain their livingindependence. This appraisal of independence is based largely on their ability to continue dailyactivities. Most daily living activities entail somedegree of physical ability (e.g., cleaning thehouse, shoveling the snow , etc.). Therefore, as practitioners designing and implementingexercise programs for seniors they must considerusing tools and strategies that raise self-efficacyappraisals both inside and outside the class. Specifically , this means developing exercise programs that are congruent with the exerciseability of the class and not beyond the class'sphysical ability . Therefore, all components of the exercise class including the warm-up, cardiocomponent, strength training component, andcool down should be aimed at the ability of the average participant. The class should bechallenging, yet not defeating. In order to helpgeneralize feelings of capabilities outside theclass, skills that are necessary for outside activitiesshould also be incorporated into the class. For example, balance is a necessary tool for manydaily activities so this should be included in acomplete exercise program designed for seniors.The stamina developed from the conditioningcomponent of the class and the muscular strengthdeveloped through some type of strength trainingaspect will also be applicable to everyday livingactivities. The instructor needs to be thoughtfuland resourceful when designing programs gearedtoward the specific needs of seniors. The exercise group is also a primary reference group for social support. Exercising with a groupof similar individuals provides many socialaspects for the individual. This study highlightsthe need for guidance and reassurance of worth.This again suggests how important it is for thehealth practitioner or exercise leader to facilitatea supportive and enriching environment. This may mean providing time before or after the class for individuals to talk among themselves.The instructor might also incorporate a walkingsection to the class where people walk in pairs or small groups and encourage communication.During the cool down period at the end of theclass, an instructor might also incorporate asharing component where seniors are encouragedto openly discuss any challenges that they arecurrently facing. Social support can also beincluded outside of the exercise class as well with social activities planned or suggested. The bottom line is that any creative tool that facilitates both self-confidence and social supportis a necessary component of a senior's exerciseprogram. From a physical and health standpoint,this will increase the probability of seniorsadhering to the exercise program, thereby gaining all of the physical benefits accruedthrough regular exercise. From a mental healthperspective, seniors will gain the wellness benefit from feeling supported and independentlycapable not only in an exercise setting but intheir everyday lives as well.

Strength, flexibility , and balance are important tomaintaining your independence as you get older. To see how you measure up, take this test. If your scores are less than \"normal\" for your age group, ask your doctor about exercises you cando at home to increase your fitness level. You canalso check into classes offered for seniors, suchas aerobics or tai chi (through your local parksdepartment and/or senior centre). 30-Second Chair Stand (measures lower-body strength) Sit in a chair with your feet flat on the floor. Cross your arms over your chest. Count the number of times in 30 seconds you can come to a full stand. Two Minute Step-In-Place (measures endurance) Let a partner find the point midway between your hip and knee. Mark that target height on a table leg or a wall. March for two minutes and count how often the right leg reaches the target height.Sit-and-Reach (measures flexibility) Brace a chair against the wall and sit on the edge. Place one foot flat and extend the other leg with your heel on the floor. W ith your arms outstretched, reach to your toe on the extended leg. Note the position of your fingertips and measure the inches short of (-) or beyond(+) your toes. Note: Do not take these tests if your doctor has told you not to exercise; or if they cause youchest pain, joint pain, or dizziness; or if you haveuncontrolled high blood pressure. Have a partnerwith you and do your best on each test, but donot overexert yourself. Before starting, warm upwith about five minutes of walking and swingingyour arms.

Learning for me can mean so many different things, that it's difficult to know where to start. I could start with the expression I heard recently , that life is one big classroom. I have to agree to apoint. The point being that it is not like theformal classroom I knew as a child\u2014with oneteacher facing a group of youngsters who didmuch of their learning by rote. Life has many teachers and an ever expanding and interconnected classroom. Teachers like our peers,our neighbor's kids, our favorite radio or televisiondocumentary programs, environmentalists whohelp us understand climate change, historians who help us comprehend the origins of the socialturmoil in the Middle East and Iraq. It's experts on comparative religions who clarify mymisunderstandings on Islam, and aid workers whoshare their experiences about their work in theCongo. It is also health professionals who tell meabout the patients who have abused their bodiesthrough smoking, poor eating habits, lack ofexercise, and so on. It's learning about preventionof falls among seniors, bullying in schools, theprevention of AIDS, pollution, and poverty . My classroom also includes pets and it includesgardening and learning to \"smell the roses\"! For someone else it may be finally learning how to golf. Another, as I heard in a recent radiointerview learned weightlifting in her retirement.Or, it could be learning to work with groups oncommunity boards and committees of all kinds. I ponder about these few examples of learning and what they mean. They truly are, as Jarvissays, \"the whole of life\"! Above all, what theymean to me is freedom: freedom of knowing the\"whys\" of certain events\u2014freedom of sheddingold prejudices\u2014the freedom of understandingsome aspect of my health and taking care of it\u2014the freedom of opening my mind and listeningand being \"tuned-in\".

On a practicallevel, the program will consider current policiesand programs that address paid work and familylife and how these can be improved. The ultimate goal of this program is to foster a \"healthy balance\" between women's health andwell-being, family life and earning a livelihood.The interrelated and dynamic program objectivesinclude knowledge generation, knowledgetransfer and transformation, uptake of new ideasand practices, and strengthening researchcapacity . Specifically , we intend to: examine therelationship among unpaid caregiving work (performed on its own or in combination withpaid work), empowerment and health status;foster \"uptake\" of new ideas and practices inpolicies; promote innovation in programs andhealth-service delivery that reflects new insightsinto the values and expectations we bring tocaregiving and paid work; strengthen researchcapacity in Atlantic Canada by recruiting andretaining health researchers.

Q: What I do to sure I'm using over- the-counter (OTC) medications safely? A: Here are 9 ways to get the most from your OTC medications, according to theNational Council on Patient Informationand Education: Read the 1abel, and follow dosage instructions. Take no more than the amount recommended. If a little is good,more is not necessarily better. Look for an OTC medicine that will treat only the symptoms you have. The more ingredients a medicine has, the more likelihood of a drug interaction(combination products often cost more, too). Know what other drugs, supplements, or foods to avoid while taking an OTCmedicine. When in doubt, ask a pharmacist before you buy or use an OTC medicine. Be extra careful when taking more than one OTC drug product at a time (i.e., be on the lookout for any signs thecombination is causing a problem) . Don't combine prescription medicines and OTC drugs without talking to yourdoctor or pharmacist first. Make sure that each of your doctors has a list of all of the medicines you are taking. Only give infants and children OTC medicines that are formulated for their age and weight. Don't use OTC medicines after their expiration date. Each month more than 600 Nova Scotians will receive a Medication Record book and a brochure entitled Knowledge Is The Best Medicine . The record book is compact, so seniors are able to carry it with them to record important health andmedication information. Seniors can keep trackof prescription or non-prescription drugs on theirown, or by having their pharmacist update thebook each time they buy new medication. \"This project will go a long way to improve quality of life for our seniors,\" said medicationawareness committee chair John Harwood. \"We are already in the planning stages for othermedication awareness initiatives that will buildon the record book project.\" Seniors are encouraged to carry the Medication Record with them at all times, so they can show it to their doctor at each visit. This will allow thedoctor to identify drug interactions or side effects that might cause health problems. The record book and brochure will also encourage more communication between seniors and theirpharmacists. \"Canada's Research-Based Pharmaceutical Companies (Rx&D) are pleased to support aninitiative that will improve health outcomes forNova Scotia seniors,\" said Leo Van Dijk, Rx&D representative. \" The Knowledge Is The Best Medicine brochure and Medication Record book will help seniors understand what medications they are taking, why they are talking them, how they should take them and what the side effects might be.\" The initiative is possible through the collaboration of Canada's Research-Based Pharmaceutical Companies (Rx&D), the Senior Citizens' Secretariat and the Department of Health. The brochure andrecord book are being funded by Rx&D. The tools will be distributed by the Department of Health to Nova Scotians two months before their65th birthday . More than 7,000 seniors will receivethe record book and brochure over the next year.

Shanthi Johnson A $150,000.00 research grant from the Nova Scotia Health Research Foundation has recentlybeen awarded to Dr. Shanthi Johnson of AcadiaUniversity and a team of colleagues andcommunity partners, including the VON,Continuing Care and the Wolfville and area SafeCommunities Coalition, who are undertaking athree year study which will look at the role thatnutrition and exercise play in preventing of fallsamong elderly people in Kings County .Unintentional falls are one of the leading causesof mortality and morbidity among frail olderadults. The consequences of falls includeconsiderable physical, psychological, andeconomic costs. Recent analysis of the economicburden of accidental falls in Canada is estimatedto be $3.6 billion annually . In 2002 the CanadianInstitute for Health Information reported thatfalls are the leading cause of injury admissions inCanada's acute care hospitals. As the populationages, the problem is expected to grow and posean even greater challenge to the health services.The study will include 164 individuals over theage of 65 years recruited through ContinuingCare. The VON Home Support Workers willprovide support and encouragement to theparticipants. The project's focus on falls and frailolder adults, along with the factors such asnutrition and functional capacity , is unique andinnovative. The study results could contribute tothe development of an effective falls preventionprogram. Falls prevention programs offersubstantial benefits by reducing falls, therebyreducing hospital costs and demand, and, most importantly , enable older adults to help maintaintheir quality of life.

The Healthy Balance Research Program is funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research(CIHR); other principal partners include theNova Scotia Family Caregivers Association; theIWK Health Centre for Children, Women andFamilies; Mount Saint Vincent University; andthe National Centres of Excellence for Women'sHealth Program. It is well known that throughout their adult lives, women are more likely than men to experiencestress and overwork as a result of their multiplecare and work responsibilities. There isuncertainty , however, about possible healthbenefits to women in the paid workforce. We areonly beginning to understand the extent andnature of women's unpaid caregiving work andits stress and health impacts\u2014whether thiscaregiving work is done on its own or combinedwith paid work. This innovative partnership program will improve our understanding of the ways in whichcaregiving is now organized (e.g., unpaidcaregiving shared between women and men),how caregiving affects people's sense ofempowerment in their lives, and, in turn howthat affects their health and well-being.Researchers will study different kinds of unpaidcaregiving in Nova Scotia and will determinewhich unpaid caregiving situations\u2014on theirown or combined with paid work, are associatedwith positive or negative health.

It is aimed at relief ofsuffering and improving the quality of life forpersons who are living with or dying fromadvanced illness or are bereaved. Currently less than 15% of Canadians have access to these programs and services. If one lives in aremote or rural community , or is living with disabilities, access to hospice palliative careservices can be further limited. The Growing Need for Hospice Palliative Care The population is aging: in the next 40 years, as baby boomers age and die, demands for hospice palliative care will increase. Each year more than 220,000 Canadians die. Each death potentially affects the well being of an average of five other people, or morethan one million Canadians each year. This number will continue to grow. If hospice palliative care programs are readily available, patients and caregivers will gain more control over their lives and illnessthrough better-managed pain and symptomcontrol, enhanced quality of life anddecreased caregiver burden. Access and Availability of Hospice Palliative Care Services in Canada Under health care reform, the number of institutionally based palliative care beds hasbeen cut and care has been devolved to thecommunity , which is not necessarilysupported to provide these services. At the same time, resources to support community-based care (largely home care)have not been increased proportionately .This forces caregivers to take leave fromwork or to leave their jobs permanently with no support to do this. The physical, emotional and financial burden on families is straining their abilityto cope. A 1997 Angus Reid poll said that 90% of Canadians wish to remain in the comfort oftheir own homes yet only 6% of caregiversfeel they can adequately care for their lovedones without hospice palliative care support. 75% of deaths still take place in hospitals and long term care facilities; families oftenadmit dying relatives to hospital when they can no longer cope with providing care at home. Few provinces cover the cost of medication needed in the home. As a result, manypeople suffer needless pain when they cannot fill perscriptions. Current physician billing schedules under provincial health plans need to be changedbecause they discourage physicians frompracticing palliative care counselling;communication is not covered whereasprocedures are. 26 7The basic set of core services in home andcommunity care in each province and territoryshould include: 1. Case Management (assessment of needs, coordination of service & resources); 2. Professional Care (nurses, social workers, therapists, pharmacists & physicians); 3. Personal Care (assistance with the activities of daily living); 4. Home Support (assistance with the instrumental activities of daily living); 5. Caregiver Support; 6. Organized Volunteer Services (meals on wheels, friendly visiting, etc); 7. Palliative Care (services to support dying at home); 8. Necessary medical supplies and equipment; 9. Day programs; 10. Self-managed care options; 11. Access to subsidized prescription drugs. Achieving the Vision Achieving our vision of home and community care requires concrete action that will strengthenpolicies, services, infrastructure and humanresources. We recommend the following essential steps: Establish national principles for home and community care. Establish a basic set of core services that is accessible to Canadians in their homesand communities. Create a 'systems' approach in health care planning and delivery\u2014one that includeshome and community care. Devote new federal resources to raise provincial home and community care to the minimum standard. Build the quality and accountability of home and community care throughinfrastructure developments (informationsystems, standardized classification system,standardized assessment tool); throughresearch; and through the dissemination of best practices. Reduce competition within the health care system and among provinces for scarcehealth care workers, increase educationalopportunities, and establish equitable wagesfor home and community care workers. Establish a national pharmacare program, including coverage for people receivinghome and community care. The basic or minimum system requirements in each province/territory are: 1. A single point of access; 2. Formal linkages among physicians, the acute care sector, the long term caresector and the case management functionin the home and community care sector; 3. Coordinated information systems; 4. Policies that foster the most cost-effective service provision; 5. All-inclusive planning processes.

Since hospice palliative care iscurrently not part of the Canada Health Act, the federal government has no role in ensuring astandard of programs and services across Canada.Each provincial and territorial government isresponsible for managing and funding health care services and programs including hospicepalliative care. Services and programs can varygreatly between provinces/territories and betweenurban and rural centers. Hospice palliative care is predominantly funded by donations and private sources and involveslarge numbers of volunteers. Not having stablegovernment funding makes providingcomprehensive, accessible programs problematic. Influences and Players in Policy Setting In the September 2002 Speech from the Throne, the federal government announced that it willmodify existing programs to ensure thatCanadians can provide compassionate care for a gravely ill or dying child, parent or spousewithout putting their jobs or incomes at risk.This plan is currently being developed and at this stage appears to be taking the shape of an Employment Insurance type plan. Anannouncement on this plan and how the federalgovernment will support it is expected in theFebruary 2003 federal budget. In October 2002, the Senate Standing Committee on Social Affairs, Science and Technologyreleased a report entitled The Health of Canadians -The Federal Role (Kirby Report). This report included a chapter called Expanding Coverage toInclude Palliative Home Care. The Kirby reportmade five key recommendations that included: a $250 million per year co-funded National Home Care Program; an Employment Insurance type program for employed Canadians who choose to take leave to provide palliative care servicesto a dying relative at home; feasibility of expanding tax measures already available to people providing care to dyingfamily members or to those who purchasesuch services on their behalf; expansion of the Canada Labour Code to allow employee leave for family crisissituations such as caring of a dying familymember; and a leadership role for the federal government as an employer that will provide jobprotection for its own employees. In November 2002, the Commission on the Future of Health Care in Canada released its final report entitled Building on Values: The Future of Health Care In Canada (Romanow Report). The Romanow report made a number ofrecommendations related to hospice palliative most notably , that the Canada Health Actinclude palliative home care services to supportpeople in their last six months of life. As well,Romanow recommended that the federalgovernment introduce a new program to provideongoing support for informal caregivers. All of these recommendations are exciting and much needed. It is important, however, thatchanges to how hospice palliative care servicesand programs are funded and delivered are notmade in an ad hoc manner. Changes at thefederal and provincial level must proceed in acomprehensive manner that will ensure theaccessibility and availability of a wide range orrequired end-of-life programs and services. For example, if unplanned, Canadians could end uphaving a national caregiver protection programthat provides some support to family caregiversbut not other services that are much needed suchas respite, access to hospice palliative careprofessionals 24/7 and other necessary medicalexpenses. One fear is that more health careservices will be downloaded onto the backs ofCanadian families without the supports neededto accomplish this in a caring manner. 8 25Eight Fact Sheets \u2014tips, practical advice, statistics, resources listings, and programinformation.

To download from the Excellence In Long-T erm Care , May/July 2002 A Vision for Home and Community Care Developed for the Canadian Home Care Association and the Canadian Association forCommunity Care, 2002, and presented to thereadership for their discussion. A Strengthened Home and Community Care Sector is Essential to the Sustainability ofCanada's Health Care System as a whole. Home and community care is for people of all ages and any diagnosis, at home or in anothercommunity location such as a day program or a\"supported living\" centre. Home and communitycare services assist people to remain in their ownhomes and communities, in the residence of theirchoice; substitute for acute hospital care; andprovide an alternative to long-term residentialcare in nursing homes or other facilities. Theseservices support the family and friends who, inmost cases, provide the majority of the care.Well-planned home and community care is part of a network of services, and can organize helpfrom volunteers and others on behalf of anindividual client and family . The Challenge The challenge is to develop an integrated healthcare system that includes home and communitycare services and meets and respects the values ofCanadians today and in the future. Although the funding for home and community care has increased in recent years, the resources have declined relative to the demands upon them. These demands come from changes in the hospital sector (decrease in the number of hospital beds,shortened hospital stays), changes in the longterm care sector (people prefer to live in theirown homes as they age) and changes in Canada'sdemographics (aging population, sandwichgeneration, increase in women in the workplace). The Vision We envisage the establishment of an equitable standard of home and community care inCanada, including the provision of a basic set ofcore services. As an integral and essential aspectof health care, home and community care wouldbe governed by principles of universality , accessi-bility , home andcommunity care includes: National Standards \u2014that establish the basic set of core services that would ensure that consistentservices are in place, are accessible, and aredelivered. National Values \u2014to drive the delivery of home and community care services that are responsive,flexible, client-centred, innovative andaccountable. Minimum Quality Standards \u2014and monitoring mechanisms for the development andperformance of home and community care in theprovinces and territories. A Systemic Approach \u2014to health care based on collaboration to make \"continuity of care\" a reality . A Stable Workforce \u2014with greater focus on education and training. Leadership in the Hospice Palliative Care Field There have been many leaders and advocates for quality end-of-life care in Canada over the last 25years. Hospice palliative care is currently at anexciting stage of development with more and moreCanadians demanding quality end-of-life care.Caregivers, hospice palliative care professionalsand volunteers know that these services andprograms need more stable funding sources in order to be available for all Canadians. Endorsement of these programs and services as core fundedhealth care programs and services is essential. In 2000, the Senate of Canada issued the report Quality End-of-Life Care: The Right of EveryCanadian . This report made strong recommendations to ensure that Canadians have access to high quality end-of-life care. SenatorSharon Carstairs, Leader of the Government inthe Senate and Minister with SpecialResponsibility for Palliative Care has been anuntiring and remarkable advocate on this issuesince the issuing of the 2000 report.

Seniors' falls result in a loss of independence. In 1998/99, there were 68,897 injury admissions in the senior population accounting for 35 percent of all injury admissions.Seniors are more likely to be admitted tohospital from an injury as a result of a fallthan any other age group. In fact, over half(56%) of all admissions due to falls occurredin persons 65 years of age or over. Veterans Affairs Canada research shows that in the one-year period from June 1996 to June 1997, 37 percent of veteransexperienced one or more than one fall.Seventy-five percent of veterans age 75 orolder experienced an injury related to a fall.As for the oldest group, they tend to indicatemore severe injuries such as loss ofconsciousness, sprains and fractures. In 1997, falls accounted for 20 percent of all injury deaths among adults age 65 or over. Injury death rates rise steeply with age. In 1997, the injury death rates among those65-74 were 51.6/100,000 and 455.6/100,000among those over age 85. About 40 percent of falls among seniors which result in a hospital stay are attributable to hip fractures. These are the most common type of fall injury among seniors and it isexpected that the number of annual hipfractures among seniors will increase from23,375 in 1993 to 88,214 by year 2041. The causes of falling Studies show that many falls result from acombination of personal factors (such as health status and personal heath practices) and lifestyle factors (such as social isolation, reduced physicalactivity and risk-taking attitudes). These factors may also work in conjunction with environmental factors, which may include indoor hazards such as poor lighting, throw rugs, unstable furniture, waxed floors, steep stairwaysand slippery tubs or outdoor hazards such as poor ice and snow removal and bad weather. Nearly half of all injuries among seniors takeplace at home. Constructional features of a houseor building such as floors, stairs and steps areidentified more often in an injury than anyhousehold product. The cost of seniors' falls in Canada The annual direct health care cost of falls is $2.4billion. Caring for seniors injured from a fallrepresents 41 percent of these costs or $1 billion. Canada's aging population Statistics Canada estimates that Canada's senior population will grow to five million by 2011 andto over ten million by the year 2041, or close to23 percent of the total population. As Canada'spopulation continues to age, the development ofeffective falls prevention strategies will take onadded importance. Addressing risk factors and building evidence Studies suggest that falls are often preventable and that health promotion interventions canreduce or eliminate high-risk behaviours and risk factors that lead to falls. However, for themajority of factors found to be associated withfalls, the current state of research is onlybeginning to uncover sufficient evidence of theimpact of risk factor reduction on the incidenceof falls and falls-related injuries for community-dwelling seniors. While some knowledge andexperience exist on falls prevention in Canada, itis not enough. The Falls Prevention Initiative willdeepen existing knowledge by addressing therange of risk factors and by identifying whatpractices, program models and communitysettings are best able to effectively reach veteransand seniors living in the community . You can prevent falls! Various resources and information materials are available to help increase knowledge andstrategies for falls prevention. The You can prevent falls! kit developed by the Initiative will be of interest to seniors, veterans, caregivers andprofessionals alike. It includes: dressing and treatments application (once a day included) health monitoring (TPR, HP , CIS, monthly weight) assistance with dressing weekly assistance with bathing weekly housekeeping and personal laundry services (except dry-cleaning) weekly linen change all physician and professional consultations arrangements recreational services exercise program pick-up and delivery of mail (e-mail services available) maintenance available parking space for one car (garage available for additional fee) outdoor recreational area Contact: Kris and Mariola Ganski Talking With Your Doctor Tips for Good Communication A basic plan can help you communicate better with your doctor, whether you are starting with anew doctor or continuing with the doctor you'veseen for years. The following tips can help youand your doctor build a partnership. Be prepared: Make a list of your concerns. Before going to the doctor, make a list of whatyou want to discuss. For example, are you havinga new symptom you want to tell the doctorabout? Did you want to get a flu shot? If youhave more than a few items to discuss, put themin order so you are sure to ask about the mostimportant ones first. Take along any informationthe doctor or staff may need such as insurancecards, names of your other doctors, or yourmedical records. Some doctors suggest you put all your prescription and over-the-countermedicines in a bag and bring them with you.Others recommend bringing a list of medicationsyou take. Make sure you can see and hear as well as possible. Many older people use glasses or need aids for hearing. Remember to take youreyeglasses to the doctor's visit. If you have ahearing aid, make sure that it is working well,and wear it. Let the doctor and staff know if youhave a hard time seeing or hearing. For example,you may want to say , \"My hearing makes it hardto understand everything you're saying. It helps alot when you speak slowly .\" Consider bringing a family member or friend. Sometimes it is helpful to bring a family memberor close friend with you. Let your family memberor friend know in advance what you want fromyour visit. The person can remind you what youplanned to discuss with the doctor if you forget,can help you remember what the doctor said, orcan take notes for you to review later. Plan to update the doctor: Let your doctor know what has happened in your life since yourlast visit. If you have been treated in theemergency room, tell the doctor right away .Mention any changes in your appetite, weight,sleep, or energy level. Also tell the doctor aboutany recent changes in the medication you take orthe effect it has had on you. Your doctor may ask you how your life is going. This isn't being impolite or nosy . Information about what's happening in your lifemay be useful medically . Let the doctor knowabout any major changes or stresses in your life,such as a divorce or the death of a loved one. Youdon't have to go into detail; you may just want tosay something like, \"It might be helpful for youto know that my sister passed away since my lastvisit with you,\" or \"I had to sell my home andmove in with my daughter.\" Source: Ageing International , Winter 2003, Vol. 28, No.1, p. 98-113 10 23With this objective in mind, the sponsor has brought together a project inquiry group of some20 volunteers from diverse project partnerorganizations across the community . The groupmeets monthly to learn more about falls and fallsprevention and to design and test possiblestrategies for reducing falls among seniors andveterans in the community . \"We expect this group to form the core of a broad community coalition on falls prevention,\"says Brady-Mueller. \"Over time, this coalitionwill develop information and practical resourcesfor use by seniors, their caregivers and familiesright here at the grass-roots level.\" As a retirement community with a higher number of seniors and veterans than many otherCanadian communities, Victoria is an ideallocation for the Falls Prevention Project. Peopleaged 65 and older make up close to 18 percent ofthe region's population, compared to theprovincial average of just under 13 percent. In its efforts to reach out to seniors, the project inquiry group is being assisted by University ofVictoria community psychologist Jennifer Mullett, who is training group members in theuse of an innovative collaborative researchprocess. Dr. Mullett explains that the processbuilds expertise in the community to engage inresearch that is aimed at problem-solving. The research process echoes the capacity building intent of the project. It is aimed at developingstrategies to prevent falls by taking fallsprevention issues directly to seniors and veteransand working with them as partners. \"Theprinciple behind this process is that solutionsmust be based on the knowledge and experiencesof seniors and veterans,\" emphasizes Dr. Mullett.This knowledge from seniors and veterans iscomplemented by input from project partnerorganizations such as the Canadian PeacekeepingVeterans Association, the Royal Canadian Legion and the School of Nursing and Centre on Agingat the University of Victoria, and from a specialproject advisory group made up of health andsocial service professionals who offer theirperspective on the causes of falls in thecommunity and suggestions for prevention. \"What we're doing is building a whole body ofpractical knowledge to go along with establishedresearch on falls prevention,\" says Dr. Mullett. \"This combined knowledge will enable us tocome up with new educational products and newstrategies for falls prevention. These productsshould prove useful to seniors and veteransbecause they are being built, in large part, byseniors and veterans themselves.\" For project volunteer Harold Leduc, National President of the Canadian Peacekeeping VeteransAssociation, participation in the project is aunique learning opportunity which he hopes totranslate into positive outcomes for associationmembers. \"I represent veterans who range in age from 19 to 95 years of age,\" says Leduc. \"Many of them,young and old, are prime candidates for falls-related injuries. I hope to gain a better under- standing of ways to prevent and manage falls sothat I can pass on information to as manyveterans and their families as possible.\" Fellow veteran Larry Gollner, a volunteer with the Alzheimer Society of British Columbia, sayshe was motivated to get involved by thepossibility of acquiring information that wouldhelp caregivers prevent falls among thosesuffering from Alzheimer's disease. Gollner, who is prone to falls himself as a result of a leg injury incurred during military service,adds that the project's emphasis on preventionand education makes it a sound socialinvestment. \"We know that, as a society , we must find better ways and means to reduce or at least stabilize thegrowing financial burden of health care,\" notesGollner. \"Equally , we know that our society isaging. This means that the numbers involvedwith falls will grow. If a well conceived andexecuted Falls Prevention Initiative can helpreduce individual suffering, ease stress on family caregivers, and, as a bonus, take pressure off thehealth care system, then I am all for it.\"Acetaminophen Reminder As many as 100 people die and more than 2,000 are hospitalized each year as a result of liverdamage from acetaminophen overdoses. While the popular pain-reliever is very safe when taken as directed, it is toxic to the liver if youoverdo it. And it's not hard to take too much. What happens is that people take several different remediestogether, say a cold medicine along with aheadache pain-reliever. Both may containacetaminophen. This drug is found in over 200over-the-counter cold and pain remedies,including T ylenol. The recommended dose of acetaminophen for a healthy adult is no more than 4,000 mg a day-oreight extra-strength pills of 500 mg each. Butdoctors say to take the lowest dose that's effectivefor you. However, if you have three or more alcoholic drinks a day , talk with your doctor before takingthis drug. Alcohol and acetaminophen togethercan be a very toxic combination.

The good news is that many of these injuriescan be prevented with proper falls preventionstrategies. With this knowledge in mind, Health Canada and Veterans Affairs Canada have teamed up todevelop an innovative Falls Prevention Initiative designed to identify community-based strategiesfor preventing falls among seniors and veterans. Under the Initiative which was announced in August 2000, Veterans Affairs Canada will invest$10 million over four years to develop fallsprevention pilot projects in Atlantic Canada,Ontario and British Columbia, with fundingbeing distributed through Health Canada'sPopulation Health Fund. Key results from theInitiative will be shared with all interested andinvolved parties in every region across Canadaand it is hoped that communities will continue tobuild identified effective prevention strategies. \"Our focus is on reducing or eliminating risk factors that lead to falls, such as social isolation,reduced physical activity or risk-taking behaviours,\" explains Nancy Garrard, Director ofHealth Canada's Division of Aging and Seniors.\"With its strong emphasis on communityinvolvement, this initiative has the potential tomake a difference for seniors and veterans rightin their own homes and neighbourhoods.\" Garrard says the Initiative's pilot project staff works closely with community volunteer groupsand non-profit organizations and with seniorsand veterans organizations, seeking their adviceand support to develop practical responses tolocal risk factors. \"With this input, we aredeveloping useful falls prevention informationfor seniors and veterans and for their familiesand caregivers;\" notes Garrard. \"This informationis designed to help Canadian seniors maintaintheir long-term health and independence.\" Jeannita Bernard, Director of Veterans Affairs Canada's Health Promotion and RehabilitationDirectorate, says the Initiative is particularlyimportant to Veterans Affairs Canada becausemany of the department's veteran clients are athigh risk of falls. \"Every year, more than one inthree veterans suffer a fall that can have adebilitating impact on their independence andwell-being,\" notes Bernard. Among the Initiative's anticipated benefits, she says, will be the postponement or prevention ofdiseases linked to falls and the improvement of the overall quality of life for veterans and seniorsin their homes, neighbourhoods and communities.Both Bernard and Garrard emphasize that theInitiative is unique not only because of itsinterdepartmental cooperation but also because it has received a great deal of support fromprovincial falls prevention authorities, veteransand seniors organizations, not-for-profitcommunity groups and voluntary organizations incommunities across the country . \"With this kindof local support, the Initiative has all the makingsof a great grass-roots success story ,\" says Bernard. Community involvement a priority for Victoria falls prevention project A key goal of the Falls Prevention Project in Victoria, B.C. is to increase local capacity to respond to falls prevention issues, says project Coordinator Laurie Brady-Mueller. As the Falls Prevention Project sponsor and co- participant, the Vancouver Island HealthAuthority prepared the project funding proposaland is currently providing project leadership andstaff resources. \"This project is part of the Health Authority's commitment to community development,\" saysBrady-Mueller. \"Our objective is not only tocreate a coalition and a project but to create long-term sustainability in falls prevention.\" Pilot Consumer Network on Aging Issues Survey CSA Consumer Services conducted a second survey of its Pilot Consumer Network on AgingIssues. The results of this survey will be used tohelp CSA identify specific products where astandard could be created to help mitigate someof the issues highlighted by survey responses andto prioritize their involvement in standardizationactivities related to Canada's aging population.Following is a brief summary of the results of the survey: 80% of respondents reported that assistive devices generally meet the needs of olderadults who use them 90% of respondents claimed that assistive devices have helped to increase or maintainseniors' quality of life; 80% reportedincreased independence resulting from the use of assistive devices 48% of respondents identified assistive devices that may be difficult for older adults to use\u2014difficulties often result from inadequate training and instructionregarding installation use and maintenance of devices more than 113 of respondents identified assistive devices that pose safety hazards for older adults\u2014mobility devices withwheels were most commonly cited a number of respondents claimed that improvements to instructions accompanyingassistive devices are needed\u2014instructionsshould be written in plain, non-technicallanguage to ensure they may be easilyunderstood by a diverse population ofconsumers 88% identified barriers to the use of assistive devices by older adults including perceivedstigma attached to use of assistive devices,expensive purchase prices, and inability toaccess adequate information and training on assistive technology Recommendations a) CSA has standards for some of the assistive devices identified by the ConsumerNetwork on Aging Issues (i.e. wheelchairsand scooters). There is a need to undertakeadditional work to see what might beneeded to put the CSA B659-0l Design forAging standard into practice for thisproduct sector. Further study should focuson modifications to existing standards. b) Development of new standards may be required to address complaints with assistive devices that CSA does notcurrently have standards for. It is suspectedthat electronic aids offer the largestpotential for standards development c) Changes need to be made to consumer information and instructions forinstallation and use of assistive devices to ensure consumer materials are user-friendly and accessible to all consumers. d) Concerns were also raised regarding compatibility between assistive devices and the residential environment (e.g. inability for wheelchairs to fit through narrow doorways). The CSA B651 Barrier-Free Design standard proposes technical design guidelines to ensurethat interior and exterior facilities provideaccessibility , usability and safety for all users,including the aging population and persons intemporarily disabling situations or conditions.There is a need to undertake additional work tofacilitate the implementation of barrier-freedesign guidelines into common practice,particularly in the residential environment.

One thing that all dental care professionals do agree on is the importance ofgood dental hygiene and preventing the spread ofbacteria in your mouth. Here are some tips thatwill help to keep your mouth free of bacteria andas healthy as possible. When Travelling: Pack your toothbrush in a container with holes to ensure it dries completely betweenuses. Clean the toothbrush container before and after your trip. Use bottled water when brushing your teeth to avoid illness from possible micro-organisms in foreign water. At Home: Buy a new toothbrush every three months. W ash your toothbrush periodically in the dishwasher. Between uses, keep your toothbrush in a cup of mouthwash to discourage bacteriagrowth. W ash your hands thoroughly before flossing. Don't share your toothbrush. Oral bacteria can pass from one person to the next andspread periodontal disease. Dry mouth is a common side effect of many medications. The reduced flow of saliva candamage teeth because saliva rinses awaybacteria. If you are on medication, trychewing sugar-free gum to stimulate saliva.

Numerical literacy , or numeracy , is the ability to understand and use numbers as a means ofcommunication. According to the InternationalAdult Literacy Survey , approximately 43 per centof adult Canadians are at a basic or lownumeracy level. This means four in 10 Canadians struggle with everyday tasks, such as calculating the tax on apurchase, following cookbook instructions,understanding and using media information,converting measurements and helping childrenwith homework. In the most recent adult literacy survey , in 1996, Canada placed ninth out of 22 countries ranked,ahead of the U.S., but well behind theNetherlands, Sweden and Denmark, which helddown the top three spots. Numeracy and mathematics are not exactly the same thing. Numeracy is not quantum physics ordifferential calculus. It involves using simplenumber equations to perform tasks likeanswering a skill testing question to win a prizeor measuring a carpet to fit a room. Numeracy skills affect our career prospects. Tasks like collecting and recording data, conducting customer surveys, and analyzing andpresenting results to colleagues all require somedegree of numeracy skill. And the demand forthese skills will only continue to grow. \"The bar is rising every year,\" says Ann Marie Downie, executive director of Literacy NovaScotia. \"You have to read more, write more anddo more math.\" Literacy Nova Scotia offers people access to community-based literacy and numeracyprograms throughout the province. The numberto call is 1-800-255-5203. Adults wishing to obtain a high school diploma can take courses through community college orschool board programs. \"Nova Scotia has a continuum of opportunities, and you can plug in from wherever you are,\"Downie adds. Having poor numeracy skills doesn't seem to carry the same social stigma as having poor literacyskills. But for anyone with literacy or numeracy difficulties, the most important thing to remember is that you're not alone, and that pursuing selfimprovement is not an admission of failure. \"Our society should celebrate people who want to keep up,\" Downie says. \"Its a step towardsmore participation in society .\" Numeracy is a critical part of the equation for managing personal finances successfully . \"Thereare also a number of on-line resources that canhelp consumers with basic money management. The Canadian Bankers Association has a Web site, www.cba.ca/en/ viewPub.asp?fl=6&sl =23&docid=27&pg=3 that offers assistance withpersonal budgeting, converting your income intoa monthly figure and managing credit. At http://finance.sympatico.ca/family .html you can find a wealth of information on homebuying, insurance, credit reports, Canada SavingsBonds and investments. As part of its math literacy campaign, ABC Canada Literacy Foundation has introduced a set of wallet cards with useful conversions and math tips. The cards are available through the ABC Canadamath literacy Web site at www.mathliteracy .ca,and they're also being distributed by literacyorganizations across Canada. \"We're hoping to trigger that 'aha' moment with people,\" says Alexandra Dunsmuir, director ofcommunications with ABC Canada. \"We wantthem to realize that they do use numbers inmany ways.\" Source: Chronicle Herald , May Halifax-based writerJfitzpatrick.herald.ns.ca 20 13Senior Citizens' Secretariat InformationResource Centre All the material listed below is available for loan from the Information Resource Centre.

Aging Well: Surprising Guideposts to a Happier Life from the Landmark Harvard Study of Adult Development , by George E. Vaillant. \"To know how to grow old is the master-work of wisdom, and one of the most difficult chapters inthe great art of living\"; so wrote Henri Amiel in1874. More than a century later, as more andmore of us are destined to live into our eighties,his challenge becomes more pressing than ever;and we need to decide from whom to gain thatknowledge. As we go through life, we meetoctogenarians who offer us rare role models forgrowing old.. We meet vigorous, generative great-grandparents, and we wonder how they becamethat way . We wonder about their origins\u2014abouthow their pasts might illuminate our ownfutures. Foolproof answers, of course, are notpossible. But if we are to understand successfulaging, we need to ask very old people about theroad they travel. The demographers have told us that today's young adults can expect to live past80, If so, we all need models for how to live fromFriendships in Adulthood Relationships with friends are important to older adults. Friends contribute to our satisfaction withlife, give us a sense of belonging, competence,and self-worth. Friendship involves: Enjoyment and spontaneity\u2014 Spending time doing things together and sharing life experiences. Trust\u2014Believing that our friends act on our behalf. Respect and understanding\u2014Believing that our friends have the right to their ownopinions. Mutual assistance\u2014Helping and supporting our friends and letting them help us. Confiding\u2014Sharing confidential matters with our friends. Types of Friendships Friends are people we know and trust. Friends are special to us socially and emotionally becausethey are our favorite companions and confidants.Friends are usually chosen from among peoplewho are considered \"social equals.\" This meansthat the people we select as friends tend to bethose who: we have grown up with, usually in the same neighborhood. have similar occupations. have children the same age. have similar interests. are the same general age and the same gender. The majority of adults have three or more close friends and more than half of adults have ten ormore friends. Men and women have the same number of friends. Women, however, are likely to confidemore in their friends than men. Men tend toenjoy activities or discuss and practice specialskills (such as golf or hunting) with their friends. Duration of Friendships We expect different characteristics from long- term as compared to short-term friends. Long-term friends are the only people with whom wecan reminisce about memories that occurredduring our lifetime. Changes in life such ashealth changes, widowhood, or retirement areless disruptive on long-term friendships. Short-term friendships help us to deal with changesthat affect our daily roles, such as moving into anew area, volunteering, or starting a new job. Changes in Friendships Adults expect to receive emotional support andcompanionship from their friends. When suchpositive outcomes are not achieved, the resultsmay be breaches of confidence, invasions ofprivacy , criticism, or loss of respect andreciprocity . In times of crisis, we expect close friends to provide support and companionship. Friends Keep Us Healthy Social interactions with friends help us leadlonger and healthier lives. Studies have shownthat people who enjoy the fellowship of friendslive longer and are healthier than theircounterparts who are socially isolated. Friendsare relied upon for emotional support. A closenetwork of friends helps us through thechallenging times of life. 14 19Are You Getting Enough Water? Muscle cramps, Headaches, Fatigue. What sounds like a mild flu is oftentimes somethingeven more ordinary . Dehydration. Most peopleneed at least eight glasses of water daily . Butmany don't drink nearly that much, and that badhabit may be harming their health. Water replenishes and cleanses. An apple a day gets all the press, but drinking plenty of waterprovides many health benefits: Improved weight control. Many people eat, rather than drink, when they feel thirsty .Drinking water helps curb your appetite and your thirst. Better bladder and bowel functioning. Fluids speed the elimination of feces fromthe colon and urine from the bladder,helping to prevent and treat constipationand urinary tract infections. Reduced cancer risk. Fluids may cut the risk of cancer by flushing out or dilutingcarcinogens in the bladder and colon. Less chance of kidney stones. Drinking plenty of water helps prevent kidney stonesfrom developing or recurring. Better respiratory health. Dehydration dries the mucus membranes, thereby possiblyincreasing a person's susceptibility to coldsand other respiratory infections. It alsodecreases the lung function of asthmaticindividuals. A healthier mouth. Drinking water increases saliva, which neutralizes cavity-causing acids in the mouth, washes away food particles andinhibits gum disease and other oral problems. How much do I need to drink? The body is constantly losing water, and themore you weigh, the more water you loseeveryday . On a cool, inactive day , the averageman loses about 12 eight-ounce cups of water,but only consumes about nine cups of water(about half of that from the water in fruits,vegetables and other solid foods).To avoid even mild dehydration, take this simple test to calculate the minimum daily amount ofwater you should be drinking daily: 1. Divide your weight (in pounds) by 2 = the number of ounces of water you should drink. 2. Divide the above number by 8 = the number of cups of water daily . The following factors increase the amount of water you should consume: Exercise. Drink 1 cup of water before exercising, an additional 1/2 cup every 20minutes during exercise, and another cupwithin a half-hour of finishing. High elevations, heat and humidity . Consume an extra 1 or 2 cups of water a day when elevation exceeds 5,000 feet, the temperature exceeds 80 F or the humidity is unusually low. Pregnancy and breast-feeding. Drink an extra cup of water every day if you're pregnant, and 3 to 4 cups extra if you're breast-feeding. Caffeine and alcohol. Consume an extra 1/2 cup of water for every cup of caffeinated oralcoholic beverages you drink. Diarrhea or fever. Consume an extra 8 to 12 cups of water per day when you have diarrhea, and an extra cup for every degree of fever. To stay hydrated, drink steadily over the course of the day . You're getting enough fluid if your urine is clear or very pale yellow and virtually odorless.Get the water you need from a combination ofbeverages and food such as 100 percent fruit juice,low-fat milk, soup, fruits and vegetables. But drinkat least five 8-ounce cups of water itself everyday . Dehydration is a particular concern for the elderly , who often don't drink enough liquidsbecause of a weakened sense of thirst. Olderpeople should set regular times throughout theday to drink, regardless of thirst, to preventcomplications from dehydration such as stroke,heart problems and disorientation.

Most of the sodium in our diets comes from restaurant-prepared (and processed) foods\u2014 not from the salt-shaker. What You Can Do: Choose grilled or baked foods rather than fried foods. Choose fresh meats rather than cold cuts or sausage. Avoid smoked or pickled foods. Order salads, burgers, tacos, omelets, and other foods with-out cheese. Ask that your food be prepared without salt, MSG, or soy sauce. Use unsalted butter or margarine. Request sauces to be served on the side and use them sparingly . Have a salad (with minimal dressing) instead of soup. Order sandwiches without pickles. Use lemon or oil and vinegar instead of bottled salad dressings.

On a cool, inactive day , the averageman loses about 12 eight-ounce cups of water,but only consumes about nine cups of water(about half of that from the water in fruits,vegetables and other solid foods).To avoid even mild dehydration, take this simple test to calculate the minimum daily amount ofwater you should be drinking daily: 1. Divide your weight (in pounds) by 2 = the number of ounces of water you should drink. 2. Divide the above number by 8 = the number of cups of water daily . The following factors increase the amount of water you should consume: Exercise. Drink 1 cup of water before exercising, an additional 1/2 cup every 20minutes during exercise, and another cupwithin a half-hour of finishing. High elevations, heat and humidity . Consume an extra 1 or 2 cups of water a day when elevation exceeds 5,000 feet, the temperature exceeds 80 F or the humidity is unusually low. Pregnancy and breast-feeding. Drink an extra cup of water every day if you're pregnant, and 3 to 4 cups extra if you're breast-feeding. Caffeine and alcohol. Consume an extra 1/2 cup of water for every cup of caffeinated oralcoholic beverages you drink. Diarrhea or fever. Consume an extra 8 to 12 cups of water per day when you have diarrhea, and an extra cup for every degree of fever. To stay hydrated, drink steadily over the course of the day . You're getting enough fluid if your urine is clear or very pale yellow and virtually odorless.Get the water you need from a combination ofbeverages and food such as 100 percent fruit juice,low-fat milk, soup, fruits and vegetables. But drinkat least five 8-ounce cups of water itself everyday . Dehydration is a particular concern for the elderly , who often don't drink enough liquidsbecause of a weakened sense of thirst. Olderpeople should set regular times throughout theday to drink, regardless of thirst, to preventcomplications from dehydration such as stroke,heart problems and disorientation.

Numerical literacy , or numeracy , is the ability to understand and use numbers as a means ofcommunication. According to the InternationalAdult Literacy Survey , approximately 43 per centof adult Canadians are at a basic or lownumeracy level. This means four in 10 Canadians struggle with everyday tasks, such as calculating the tax on apurchase, following cookbook instructions,understanding and using media information,converting measurements and helping childrenwith homework. In the most recent adult literacy survey , in 1996, Canada placed ninth out of 22 countries ranked,ahead of the U.S., but well behind theNetherlands, Sweden and Denmark, which helddown the top three spots. Numeracy and mathematics are not exactly the same thing. Numeracy is not quantum physics ordifferential calculus. It involves using simplenumber equations to perform tasks likeanswering a skill testing question to win a prizeor measuring a carpet to fit a room. Numeracy skills affect our career prospects. Tasks like collecting and recording data, conducting customer surveys, and analyzing andpresenting results to colleagues all require somedegree of numeracy skill. And the demand forthese skills will only continue to grow. \"The bar is rising every year,\" says Ann Marie Downie, executive director of Literacy NovaScotia. \"You have to read more, write more anddo more math.\" Literacy Nova Scotia offers people access to community-based literacy and numeracyprograms throughout the province. The numberto call is 1-800-255-5203. Adults wishing to obtain a high school diploma can take courses through community college orschool board programs. \"Nova Scotia has a continuum of opportunities, and you can plug in from wherever you are,\"Downie adds. Having poor numeracy skills doesn't seem to carry the same social stigma as having poor literacyskills. But for anyone with literacy or numeracy difficulties, the most important thing to remember is that you're not alone, and that pursuing selfimprovement is not an admission of failure. \"Our society should celebrate people who want to keep up,\" Downie says. \"Its a step towardsmore participation in society .\" Numeracy is a critical part of the equation for managing personal finances successfully . \"Thereare also a number of on-line resources that canhelp consumers with basic money management. The Canadian Bankers Association has a Web site, www.cba.ca/en/ viewPub.asp?fl=6&sl =23&docid=27&pg=3 that offers assistance withpersonal budgeting, converting your income intoa monthly figure and managing credit. At http://finance.sympatico.ca/family .html you can find a wealth of information on homebuying, insurance, credit reports, Canada SavingsBonds and investments. As part of its math literacy campaign, ABC Canada Literacy Foundation has introduced a set of wallet cards with useful conversions and math tips. The cards are available through the ABC Canadamath literacy Web site at www.mathliteracy .ca,and they're also being distributed by literacyorganizations across Canada. \"We're hoping to trigger that 'aha' moment with people,\" says Alexandra Dunsmuir, director ofcommunications with ABC Canada. \"We wantthem to realize that they do use numbers inmany ways.\" Source: Chronicle Herald , May Halifax-based writerJfitzpatrick.herald.ns.ca 20 13Senior Citizens' Secretariat InformationResource Centre All the material listed below is available for loan from the Information Resource Centre.

More than a century later, as more andmore of us are destined to live into our eighties,his challenge becomes more pressing than ever;and we need to decide from whom to gain thatknowledge. As we go through life, we meetoctogenarians who offer us rare role models forgrowing old.. We meet vigorous, generative great-grandparents, and we wonder how they becamethat way . We wonder about their origins\u2014abouthow their pasts might illuminate our ownfutures. Foolproof answers, of course, are notpossible. But if we are to understand successfulaging, we need to ask very old people about theroad they travel. The demographers have told us that today's young adults can expect to live past80, If so, we all need models for how to live fromPilot Consumer Network on Aging Issues Survey CSA Consumer Services conducted a second survey of its Pilot Consumer Network on AgingIssues. The results of this survey will be used tohelp CSA identify specific products where astandard could be created to help mitigate someof the issues highlighted by survey responses andto prioritize their involvement in standardizationactivities related to Canada's aging population.Following is a brief summary of the results of the survey: 80% of respondents reported that assistive devices generally meet the needs of olderadults who use them 90% of respondents claimed that assistive devices have helped to increase or maintainseniors' quality of life; 80% reportedincreased independence resulting from the use of assistive devices 48% of respondents identified assistive devices that may be difficult for older adults to use\u2014difficulties often result from inadequate training and instructionregarding installation use and maintenance of devices more than 113 of respondents identified assistive devices that pose safety hazards for older adults\u2014mobility devices withwheels were most commonly cited a number of respondents claimed that improvements to instructions accompanyingassistive devices are needed\u2014instructionsshould be written in plain, non-technicallanguage to ensure they may be easilyunderstood by a diverse population ofconsumers 88% identified barriers to the use of assistive devices by older adults including perceivedstigma attached to use of assistive devices,expensive purchase prices, and inability toaccess adequate information and training on assistive technology Recommendations a) CSA has standards for some of the assistive devices identified by the ConsumerNetwork on Aging Issues (i.e. wheelchairsand scooters). There is a need to undertakeadditional work to see what might beneeded to put the CSA B659-0l Design forAging standard into practice for thisproduct sector. Further study should focuson modifications to existing standards. b) Development of new standards may be required to address complaints with assistive devices that CSA does notcurrently have standards for. It is suspectedthat electronic aids offer the largestpotential for standards development c) Changes need to be made to consumer information and instructions forinstallation and use of assistive devices to ensure consumer materials are user-friendly and accessible to all consumers. d) Concerns were also raised regarding compatibility between assistive devices and the residential environment (e.g. inability for wheelchairs to fit through narrow doorways). The CSA B651 Barrier-Free Design standard proposes technical design guidelines to ensurethat interior and exterior facilities provideaccessibility , usability and safety for all users,including the aging population and persons intemporarily disabling situations or conditions.There is a need to undertake additional work tofacilitate the implementation of barrier-freedesign guidelines into common practice,particularly in the residential environment.

One thing that all dental care professionals do agree on is the importance ofgood dental hygiene and preventing the spread ofbacteria in your mouth. Here are some tips thatwill help to keep your mouth free of bacteria andas healthy as possible. When Travelling: Pack your toothbrush in a container with holes to ensure it dries completely betweenuses. Clean the toothbrush container before and after your trip. Use bottled water when brushing your teeth to avoid illness from possible micro-organisms in foreign water. At Home: Buy a new toothbrush every three months. W ash your toothbrush periodically in the dishwasher. Between uses, keep your toothbrush in a cup of mouthwash to discourage bacteriagrowth. W ash your hands thoroughly before flossing. Don't share your toothbrush. Oral bacteria can pass from one person to the next andspread periodontal disease. Dry mouth is a common side effect of many medications. The reduced flow of saliva candamage teeth because saliva rinses awaybacteria. If you are on medication, trychewing sugar-free gum to stimulate saliva.

While the popular pain-reliever is very safe when taken as directed, it is toxic to the liver if youoverdo it. And it's not hard to take too much. What happens is that people take several different remediestogether, say a cold medicine along with aheadache pain-reliever. Both may containacetaminophen. This drug is found in over 200over-the-counter cold and pain remedies,including T ylenol. The recommended dose of acetaminophen for a healthy adult is no more than 4,000 mg a day-oreight extra-strength pills of 500 mg each. Butdoctors say to take the lowest dose that's effectivefor you. However, if you have three or more alcoholic drinks a day , talk with your doctor before takingthis drug. Alcohol and acetaminophen togethercan be a very toxic combination.

The good news is that many of these injuriescan be prevented with proper falls preventionstrategies. With this knowledge in mind, Health Canada and Veterans Affairs Canada have teamed up todevelop an innovative Falls Prevention Initiative designed to identify community-based strategiesfor preventing falls among seniors and veterans. Under the Initiative which was announced in August 2000, Veterans Affairs Canada will invest$10 million over four years to develop fallsprevention pilot projects in Atlantic Canada,Ontario and British Columbia, with fundingbeing distributed through Health Canada'sPopulation Health Fund. Key results from theInitiative will be shared with all interested andinvolved parties in every region across Canadaand it is hoped that communities will continue tobuild identified effective prevention strategies. \"Our focus is on reducing or eliminating risk factors that lead to falls, such as social isolation,reduced physical activity or risk-taking behaviours,\" explains Nancy Garrard, Director ofHealth Canada's Division of Aging and Seniors.\"With its strong emphasis on communityinvolvement, this initiative has the potential tomake a difference for seniors and veterans rightin their own homes and neighbourhoods.\" Garrard says the Initiative's pilot project staff works closely with community volunteer groupsand non-profit organizations and with seniorsand veterans organizations, seeking their adviceand support to develop practical responses tolocal risk factors. \"With this input, we aredeveloping useful falls prevention informationfor seniors and veterans and for their familiesand caregivers;\" notes Garrard. \"This informationis designed to help Canadian seniors maintaintheir long-term health and independence.\" Jeannita Bernard, Director of Veterans Affairs Canada's Health Promotion and RehabilitationDirectorate, says the Initiative is particularlyimportant to Veterans Affairs Canada becausemany of the department's veteran clients are athigh risk of falls. \"Every year, more than one inthree veterans suffer a fall that can have adebilitating impact on their independence andwell-being,\" notes Bernard. Among the Initiative's anticipated benefits, she says, will be the postponement or prevention ofdiseases linked to falls and the improvement of the overall quality of life for veterans and seniorsin their homes, neighbourhoods and communities.Both Bernard and Garrard emphasize that theInitiative is unique not only because of itsinterdepartmental cooperation but also because it has received a great deal of support fromprovincial falls prevention authorities, veteransand seniors organizations, not-for-profitcommunity groups and voluntary organizations incommunities across the country . \"With this kindof local support, the Initiative has all the makingsof a great grass-roots success story ,\" says Bernard. Community involvement a priority for Victoria falls prevention project A key goal of the Falls Prevention Project in Victoria, B.C. is to increase local capacity to respond to falls prevention issues, says project Coordinator Laurie Brady-Mueller. As the Falls Prevention Project sponsor and co- participant, the Vancouver Island HealthAuthority prepared the project funding proposaland is currently providing project leadership andstaff resources. \"This project is part of the Health Authority's commitment to community development,\" saysBrady-Mueller. \"Our objective is not only tocreate a coalition and a project but to create long-term sustainability in falls prevention.\" dressing and treatments application (once a day included) health monitoring (TPR, HP , CIS, monthly weight) assistance with dressing weekly assistance with bathing weekly housekeeping and personal laundry services (except dry-cleaning) weekly linen change all physician and professional consultations arrangements recreational services exercise program pick-up and delivery of mail (e-mail services available) maintenance available parking space for one car (garage available for additional fee) outdoor recreational area Contact: Kris and Mariola Ganski Talking With Your Doctor Tips for Good Communication A basic plan can help you communicate better with your doctor, whether you are starting with anew doctor or continuing with the doctor you'veseen for years. The following tips can help youand your doctor build a partnership. Be prepared: Make a list of your concerns. Before going to the doctor, make a list of whatyou want to discuss. For example, are you havinga new symptom you want to tell the doctorabout? Did you want to get a flu shot? If youhave more than a few items to discuss, put themin order so you are sure to ask about the mostimportant ones first. Take along any informationthe doctor or staff may need such as insurancecards, names of your other doctors, or yourmedical records. Some doctors suggest you put all your prescription and over-the-countermedicines in a bag and bring them with you.Others recommend bringing a list of medicationsyou take. Make sure you can see and hear as well as possible. Many older people use glasses or need aids for hearing. Remember to take youreyeglasses to the doctor's visit. If you have ahearing aid, make sure that it is working well,and wear it. Let the doctor and staff know if youhave a hard time seeing or hearing. For example,you may want to say , \"My hearing makes it hardto understand everything you're saying. It helps alot when you speak slowly .\" Consider bringing a family member or friend. Sometimes it is helpful to bring a family memberor close friend with you. Let your family memberor friend know in advance what you want fromyour visit. The person can remind you what youplanned to discuss with the doctor if you forget,can help you remember what the doctor said, orcan take notes for you to review later. Plan to update the doctor: Let your doctor know what has happened in your life since yourlast visit. If you have been treated in theemergency room, tell the doctor right away .Mention any changes in your appetite, weight,sleep, or energy level. Also tell the doctor aboutany recent changes in the medication you take orthe effect it has had on you. Your doctor may ask you how your life is going. This isn't being impolite or nosy . Information about what's happening in your lifemay be useful medically . Let the doctor knowabout any major changes or stresses in your life,such as a divorce or the death of a loved one. Youdon't have to go into detail; you may just want tosay something like, \"It might be helpful for youto know that my sister passed away since my lastvisit with you,\" or \"I had to sell my home andmove in with my daughter.\" Source: Ageing International , Winter 2003, Vol. 28, No.1, p. 98-113 10 23With this objective in mind, the sponsor has brought together a project inquiry group of some20 volunteers from diverse project partnerorganizations across the community . The groupmeets monthly to learn more about falls and fallsprevention and to design and test possiblestrategies for reducing falls among seniors andveterans in the community . \"We expect this group to form the core of a broad community coalition on falls prevention,\"says Brady-Mueller. \"Over time, this coalitionwill develop information and practical resourcesfor use by seniors, their caregivers and familiesright here at the grass-roots level.\" As a retirement community with a higher number of seniors and veterans than many otherCanadian communities, Victoria is an ideallocation for the Falls Prevention Project. Peopleaged 65 and older make up close to 18 percent ofthe region's population, compared to theprovincial average of just under 13 percent. In its efforts to reach out to seniors, the project inquiry group is being assisted by University ofVictoria community psychologist Jennifer Mullett, who is training group members in theuse of an innovative collaborative researchprocess. Dr. Mullett explains that the processbuilds expertise in the community to engage inresearch that is aimed at problem-solving. The research process echoes the capacity building intent of the project. It is aimed at developingstrategies to prevent falls by taking fallsprevention issues directly to seniors and veteransand working with them as partners. \"Theprinciple behind this process is that solutionsmust be based on the knowledge and experiencesof seniors and veterans,\" emphasizes Dr. Mullett.This knowledge from seniors and veterans iscomplemented by input from project partnerorganizations such as the Canadian PeacekeepingVeterans Association, the Royal Canadian Legion and the School of Nursing and Centre on Agingat the University of Victoria, and from a specialproject advisory group made up of health andsocial service professionals who offer theirperspective on the causes of falls in thecommunity and suggestions for prevention. \"What we're doing is building a whole body ofpractical knowledge to go along with establishedresearch on falls prevention,\" says Dr. Mullett. \"This combined knowledge will enable us tocome up with new educational products and newstrategies for falls prevention. These productsshould prove useful to seniors and veteransbecause they are being built, in large part, byseniors and veterans themselves.\" For project volunteer Harold Leduc, National President of the Canadian Peacekeeping VeteransAssociation, participation in the project is aunique learning opportunity which he hopes totranslate into positive outcomes for associationmembers. \"I represent veterans who range in age from 19 to 95 years of age,\" says Leduc. \"Many of them,young and old, are prime candidates for falls-related injuries. I hope to gain a better under- standing of ways to prevent and manage falls sothat I can pass on information to as manyveterans and their families as possible.\" Fellow veteran Larry Gollner, a volunteer with the Alzheimer Society of British Columbia, sayshe was motivated to get involved by thepossibility of acquiring information that wouldhelp caregivers prevent falls among thosesuffering from Alzheimer's disease. Gollner, who is prone to falls himself as a result of a leg injury incurred during military service,adds that the project's emphasis on preventionand education makes it a sound socialinvestment. \"We know that, as a society , we must find better ways and means to reduce or at least stabilize thegrowing financial burden of health care,\" notesGollner. \"Equally , we know that our society isaging. This means that the numbers involvedwith falls will grow. If a well conceived andexecuted Falls Prevention Initiative can helpreduce individual suffering, ease stress on family caregivers, and, as a bonus, take pressure off thehealth care system, then I am all for it.\"Leadership in the Hospice Palliative Care Field There have been many leaders and advocates for quality end-of-life care in Canada over the last 25years. Hospice palliative care is currently at anexciting stage of development with more and moreCanadians demanding quality end-of-life care.Caregivers, hospice palliative care professionalsand volunteers know that these services andprograms need more stable funding sources in order to be available for all Canadians. Endorsement of these programs and services as core fundedhealth care programs and services is essential. In 2000, the Senate of Canada issued the report Quality End-of-Life Care: The Right of EveryCanadian . This report made strong recommendations to ensure that Canadians have access to high quality end-of-life care. SenatorSharon Carstairs, Leader of the Government inthe Senate and Minister with SpecialResponsibility for Palliative Care has been anuntiring and remarkable advocate on this issuesince the issuing of the 2000 report.

Seniors' falls result in a loss of independence. In 1998/99, there were 68,897 injury admissions in the senior population accounting for 35 percent of all injury admissions.Seniors are more likely to be admitted tohospital from an injury as a result of a fallthan any other age group. In fact, over half(56%) of all admissions due to falls occurredin persons 65 years of age or over. Veterans Affairs Canada research shows that in the one-year period from June 1996 to June 1997, 37 percent of veteransexperienced one or more than one fall.Seventy-five percent of veterans age 75 orolder experienced an injury related to a fall.As for the oldest group, they tend to indicatemore severe injuries such as loss ofconsciousness, sprains and fractures. In 1997, falls accounted for 20 percent of all injury deaths among adults age 65 or over. Injury death rates rise steeply with age. In 1997, the injury death rates among those65-74 were 51.6/100,000 and 455.6/100,000among those over age 85. About 40 percent of falls among seniors which result in a hospital stay are attributable to hip fractures. These are the most common type of fall injury among seniors and it isexpected that the number of annual hipfractures among seniors will increase from23,375 in 1993 to 88,214 by year 2041. The causes of falling Studies show that many falls result from acombination of personal factors (such as health status and personal heath practices) and lifestyle factors (such as social isolation, reduced physicalactivity and risk-taking attitudes). These factors may also work in conjunction with environmental factors, which may include indoor hazards such as poor lighting, throw rugs, unstable furniture, waxed floors, steep stairwaysand slippery tubs or outdoor hazards such as poor ice and snow removal and bad weather. Nearly half of all injuries among seniors takeplace at home. Constructional features of a houseor building such as floors, stairs and steps areidentified more often in an injury than anyhousehold product. The cost of seniors' falls in Canada The annual direct health care cost of falls is $2.4billion. Caring for seniors injured from a fallrepresents 41 percent of these costs or $1 billion. Canada's aging population Statistics Canada estimates that Canada's senior population will grow to five million by 2011 andto over ten million by the year 2041, or close to23 percent of the total population. As Canada'spopulation continues to age, the development ofeffective falls prevention strategies will take onadded importance. Addressing risk factors and building evidence Studies suggest that falls are often preventable and that health promotion interventions canreduce or eliminate high-risk behaviours and risk factors that lead to falls. However, for themajority of factors found to be associated withfalls, the current state of research is onlybeginning to uncover sufficient evidence of theimpact of risk factor reduction on the incidenceof falls and falls-related injuries for community-dwelling seniors. While some knowledge andexperience exist on falls prevention in Canada, itis not enough. The Falls Prevention Initiative willdeepen existing knowledge by addressing therange of risk factors and by identifying whatpractices, program models and communitysettings are best able to effectively reach veteransand seniors living in the community . You can prevent falls! Various resources and information materials are available to help increase knowledge andstrategies for falls prevention. The You can prevent falls! kit developed by the Initiative will be of interest to seniors, veterans, caregivers andprofessionals alike. It includes: National vs. Provincial Jurisdiction What is offered in hospice palliative care services and programs varies greatly between provincesand territories. Since hospice palliative care iscurrently not part of the Canada Health Act, the federal government has no role in ensuring astandard of programs and services across Canada.Each provincial and territorial government isresponsible for managing and funding health care services and programs including hospicepalliative care. Services and programs can varygreatly between provinces/territories and betweenurban and rural centers. Hospice palliative care is predominantly funded by donations and private sources and involveslarge numbers of volunteers. Not having stablegovernment funding makes providingcomprehensive, accessible programs problematic. Influences and Players in Policy Setting In the September 2002 Speech from the Throne, the federal government announced that it willmodify existing programs to ensure thatCanadians can provide compassionate care for a gravely ill or dying child, parent or spousewithout putting their jobs or incomes at risk.This plan is currently being developed and at this stage appears to be taking the shape of an Employment Insurance type plan. Anannouncement on this plan and how the federalgovernment will support it is expected in theFebruary 2003 federal budget. In October 2002, the Senate Standing Committee on Social Affairs, Science and Technologyreleased a report entitled The Health of Canadians -The Federal Role (Kirby Report). This report included a chapter called Expanding Coverage toInclude Palliative Home Care. The Kirby reportmade five key recommendations that included: a $250 million per year co-funded National Home Care Program; an Employment Insurance type program for employed Canadians who choose to take leave to provide palliative care servicesto a dying relative at home; feasibility of expanding tax measures already available to people providing care to dyingfamily members or to those who purchasesuch services on their behalf; expansion of the Canada Labour Code to allow employee leave for family crisissituations such as caring of a dying familymember; and a leadership role for the federal government as an employer that will provide jobprotection for its own employees. In November 2002, the Commission on the Future of Health Care in Canada released its final report entitled Building on Values: The Future of Health Care In Canada (Romanow Report). The Romanow report made a number ofrecommendations related to hospice palliative most notably , that the Canada Health Actinclude palliative home care services to supportpeople in their last six months of life. As well,Romanow recommended that the federalgovernment introduce a new program to provideongoing support for informal caregivers. All of these recommendations are exciting and much needed. It is important, however, thatchanges to how hospice palliative care servicesand programs are funded and delivered are notmade in an ad hoc manner. Changes at thefederal and provincial level must proceed in acomprehensive manner that will ensure theaccessibility and availability of a wide range orrequired end-of-life programs and services. For example, if unplanned, Canadians could end uphaving a national caregiver protection programthat provides some support to family caregiversbut not other services that are much needed suchas respite, access to hospice palliative careprofessionals 24/7 and other necessary medicalexpenses. One fear is that more health careservices will be downloaded onto the backs ofCanadian families without the supports neededto accomplish this in a caring manner. 8 25Eight Fact Sheets \u2014tips, practical advice, statistics, resources listings, and programinformation.

To download from the Excellence In Long-T erm Care , May/July 2002 A Vision for Home and Community Care Developed for the Canadian Home Care Association and the Canadian Association forCommunity Care, 2002, and presented to thereadership for their discussion. A Strengthened Home and Community Care Sector is Essential to the Sustainability ofCanada's Health Care System as a whole. Home and community care is for people of all ages and any diagnosis, at home or in anothercommunity location such as a day program or a\"supported living\" centre. Home and communitycare services assist people to remain in their ownhomes and communities, in the residence of theirchoice; substitute for acute hospital care; andprovide an alternative to long-term residentialcare in nursing homes or other facilities. Theseservices support the family and friends who, inmost cases, provide the majority of the care.Well-planned home and community care is part of a network of services, and can organize helpfrom volunteers and others on behalf of anindividual client and family . The Challenge The challenge is to develop an integrated healthcare system that includes home and communitycare services and meets and respects the values ofCanadians today and in the future. Although the funding for home and community care has increased in recent years, the resources have declined relative to the demands upon them. These demands come from changes in the hospital sector (decrease in the number of hospital beds,shortened hospital stays), changes in the longterm care sector (people prefer to live in theirown homes as they age) and changes in Canada'sdemographics (aging population, sandwichgeneration, increase in women in the workplace). The Vision We envisage the establishment of an equitable standard of home and community care inCanada, including the provision of a basic set ofcore services. As an integral and essential aspectof health care, home and community care wouldbe governed by principles of universality , accessi-bility , home andcommunity care includes: National Standards \u2014that establish the basic set of core services that would ensure that consistentservices are in place, are accessible, and aredelivered. National Values \u2014to drive the delivery of home and community care services that are responsive,flexible, client-centred, innovative andaccountable. Minimum Quality Standards \u2014and monitoring mechanisms for the development andperformance of home and community care in theprovinces and territories. A Systemic Approach \u2014to health care based on collaboration to make \"continuity of care\" a reality . A Stable Workforce \u2014with greater focus on education and training. Hospice Palliative Care in Canada Will these services be there when they are needed? by Sharon Baxter Hospice palliative care is the combination of active and compassionate therapies intended to comfort and support individuals and familieswho are living with or dying from a life-threatening illness. It is aimed at relief ofsuffering and improving the quality of life forpersons who are living with or dying fromadvanced illness or are bereaved. Currently less than 15% of Canadians have access to these programs and services. If one lives in aremote or rural community , or is living with disabilities, access to hospice palliative careservices can be further limited. The Growing Need for Hospice Palliative Care The population is aging: in the next 40 years, as baby boomers age and die, demands for hospice palliative care will increase. Each year more than 220,000 Canadians die. Each death potentially affects the well being of an average of five other people, or morethan one million Canadians each year. This number will continue to grow. If hospice palliative care programs are readily available, patients and caregivers will gain more control over their lives and illnessthrough better-managed pain and symptomcontrol, enhanced quality of life anddecreased caregiver burden. Access and Availability of Hospice Palliative Care Services in Canada Under health care reform, the number of institutionally based palliative care beds hasbeen cut and care has been devolved to thecommunity , which is not necessarilysupported to provide these services. At the same time, resources to support community-based care (largely home care)have not been increased proportionately .This forces caregivers to take leave fromwork or to leave their jobs permanently with no support to do this. The physical, emotional and financial burden on families is straining their abilityto cope. A 1997 Angus Reid poll said that 90% of Canadians wish to remain in the comfort oftheir own homes yet only 6% of caregiversfeel they can adequately care for their lovedones without hospice palliative care support. 75% of deaths still take place in hospitals and long term care facilities; families oftenadmit dying relatives to hospital when they can no longer cope with providing care at home. Few provinces cover the cost of medication needed in the home. As a result, manypeople suffer needless pain when they cannot fill perscriptions. Current physician billing schedules under provincial health plans need to be changedbecause they discourage physicians frompracticing palliative care counselling;communication is not covered whereasprocedures are. 26 7The basic set of core services in home andcommunity care in each province and territoryshould include: 1. Case Management (assessment of needs, coordination of service & resources); 2. Professional Care (nurses, social workers, therapists, pharmacists & physicians); 3. Personal Care (assistance with the activities of daily living); 4. Home Support (assistance with the instrumental activities of daily living); 5. Caregiver Support; 6. Organized Volunteer Services (meals on wheels, friendly visiting, etc); 7. Palliative Care (services to support dying at home); 8. Necessary medical supplies and equipment; 9. Day programs; 10. Self-managed care options; 11. Access to subsidized prescription drugs. Achieving the Vision Achieving our vision of home and community care requires concrete action that will strengthenpolicies, services, infrastructure and humanresources. We recommend the following essential steps: Establish national principles for home and community care. Establish a basic set of core services that is accessible to Canadians in their homesand communities. Create a 'systems' approach in health care planning and delivery\u2014one that includeshome and community care. Devote new federal resources to raise provincial home and community care to the minimum standard. Build the quality and accountability of home and community care throughinfrastructure developments (informationsystems, standardized classification system,standardized assessment tool); throughresearch; and through the dissemination of best practices. Reduce competition within the health care system and among provinces for scarcehealth care workers, increase educationalopportunities, and establish equitable wagesfor home and community care workers. Establish a national pharmacare program, including coverage for people receivinghome and community care. The basic or minimum system requirements in each province/territory are: 1. A single point of access; 2. Formal linkages among physicians, the acute care sector, the long term caresector and the case management functionin the home and community care sector; 3. Coordinated information systems; 4. Policies that foster the most cost-effective service provision; 5. All-inclusive planning processes. The Canadian Home Care Association and the Canadian Association for Community Carecollectively represent home care programs,community support programs, for-profit and not-for-profit service providers, long-term carefacilities, planning bodies, professionals andparaprofessionals in home and community care, educators, researchers, suppliers andmanufacturers of home care products,pharmaceutical manufacturers and last, but far from least, the users of home andcommunity care services.

Shanthi Johnson A $150,000.00 research grant from the Nova Scotia Health Research Foundation has recentlybeen awarded to Dr. Shanthi Johnson of AcadiaUniversity and a team of colleagues andcommunity partners, including the VON,Continuing Care and the Wolfville and area SafeCommunities Coalition, who are undertaking athree year study which will look at the role thatnutrition and exercise play in preventing of fallsamong elderly people in Kings County .Unintentional falls are one of the leading causesof mortality and morbidity among frail olderadults. The consequences of falls includeconsiderable physical, psychological, andeconomic costs. Recent analysis of the economicburden of accidental falls in Canada is estimatedto be $3.6 billion annually . In 2002 the CanadianInstitute for Health Information reported thatfalls are the leading cause of injury admissions inCanada's acute care hospitals. As the populationages, the problem is expected to grow and posean even greater challenge to the health services.The study will include 164 individuals over theage of 65 years recruited through ContinuingCare. The VON Home Support Workers willprovide support and encouragement to theparticipants. The project's focus on falls and frailolder adults, along with the factors such asnutrition and functional capacity , is unique andinnovative. The study results could contribute tothe development of an effective falls preventionprogram. Falls prevention programs offersubstantial benefits by reducing falls, therebyreducing hospital costs and demand, and, most importantly , enable older adults to help maintaintheir quality of life.

The Healthy Balance Research Program is funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research(CIHR); other principal partners include theNova Scotia Family Caregivers Association; theIWK Health Centre for Children, Women andFamilies; Mount Saint Vincent University; andthe National Centres of Excellence for Women'sHealth Program. It is well known that throughout their adult lives, women are more likely than men to experiencestress and overwork as a result of their multiplecare and work responsibilities. There isuncertainty , however, about possible healthbenefits to women in the paid workforce. We areonly beginning to understand the extent andnature of women's unpaid caregiving work andits stress and health impacts\u2014whether thiscaregiving work is done on its own or combinedwith paid work. This innovative partnership program will improve our understanding of the ways in whichcaregiving is now organized (e.g., unpaidcaregiving shared between women and men),how caregiving affects people's sense ofempowerment in their lives, and, in turn howthat affects their health and well-being.Researchers will study different kinds of unpaidcaregiving in Nova Scotia and will determinewhich unpaid caregiving situations\u2014on theirown or combined with paid work, are associatedwith positive or negative health. The programwill also examine how social and economicfactors interact with paid work, caregiving,empowerment and health status\u2014for examplehow ethnicity , race and culture, as well as ruralSome Thoughts on Lifelong Learning \"Learning is about the whole of life, it is about the personhood of the learner and throughlearning we grow and develop and become thepersons that we are.\"\u2014Peter Jarvis (2001) inLearning in Later Life As Project Coordinator for the Nova Scotia Seniors for Literacy Committee, I was asked toshare some thoughts on lifelong learning. Learning for me can mean so many different things, that it's difficult to know where to start. I could start with the expression I heard recently , that life is one big classroom. I have to agree to apoint. The point being that it is not like theformal classroom I knew as a child\u2014with oneteacher facing a group of youngsters who didmuch of their learning by rote. Life has many teachers and an ever expanding and interconnected classroom. Teachers like our peers,our neighbor's kids, our favorite radio or televisiondocumentary programs, environmentalists whohelp us understand climate change, historians who help us comprehend the origins of the socialturmoil in the Middle East and Iraq. It's experts on comparative religions who clarify mymisunderstandings on Islam, and aid workers whoshare their experiences about their work in theCongo. It is also health professionals who tell meabout the patients who have abused their bodiesthrough smoking, poor eating habits, lack ofexercise, and so on. It's learning about preventionof falls among seniors, bullying in schools, theprevention of AIDS, pollution, and poverty . My classroom also includes pets and it includesgardening and learning to \"smell the roses\"! For someone else it may be finally learning how to golf. Another, as I heard in a recent radiointerview learned weightlifting in her retirement.Or, it could be learning to work with groups oncommunity boards and committees of all kinds. I ponder about these few examples of learning and what they mean. They truly are, as Jarvissays, \"the whole of life\"! Above all, what theymean to me is freedom: freedom of knowing the\"whys\" of certain events\u2014freedom of sheddingold prejudices\u2014the freedom of understandingsome aspect of my health and taking care of it\u2014the freedom of opening my mind and listeningand being \"tuned-in\".

On a practicallevel, the program will consider current policiesand programs that address paid work and familylife and how these can be improved. The ultimate goal of this program is to foster a \"healthy balance\" between women's health andwell-being, family life and earning a livelihood.The interrelated and dynamic program objectivesinclude knowledge generation, knowledgetransfer and transformation, uptake of new ideasand practices, and strengthening researchcapacity . Specifically , we intend to: examine therelationship among unpaid caregiving work (performed on its own or in combination withpaid work), empowerment and health status;foster \"uptake\" of new ideas and practices inpolicies; promote innovation in programs andhealth-service delivery that reflects new insightsinto the values and expectations we bring tocaregiving and paid work; strengthen researchcapacity in Atlantic Canada by recruiting andretaining health researchers.

Q: What I do to sure I'm using over- the-counter (OTC) medications safely? A: Here are 9 ways to get the most from your OTC medications, according to theNational Council on Patient Informationand Education: Read the 1abel, and follow dosage instructions. Take no more than the amount recommended. If a little is good,more is not necessarily better. Look for an OTC medicine that will treat only the symptoms you have. The more ingredients a medicine has, the more likelihood of a drug interaction(combination products often cost more, too). Know what other drugs, supplements, or foods to avoid while taking an OTCmedicine. When in doubt, ask a pharmacist before you buy or use an OTC medicine. Be extra careful when taking more than one OTC drug product at a time (i.e., be on the lookout for any signs thecombination is causing a problem) . Don't combine prescription medicines and OTC drugs without talking to yourdoctor or pharmacist first. Make sure that each of your doctors has a list of all of the medicines you are taking. Only give infants and children OTC medicines that are formulated for their age and weight. Don't use OTC medicines after their expiration date. Application and Recommendations It appears that when fellow exercisers and the class instructor reassure seniors of their worthrelative to exercise class and other physical activities, they gain exercise-related self-confidence either vicariously and/or through the verbal persuasion of others who attend the class. In the present group of exercisers,anecdotally we found it was quite common forseniors to view the exercise group not only as ameans to exercise but also as a social group towhich they enjoyed belonging. This demonstratesthe importance of social support in a positiveexercise setting for seniors. To a group of exercising seniors, the class environment plays much more of a role thansimply providing a place to move muscles. It is an environment where participants feelconfident about their ability to attend as well asto complete the necessary in-class components.Most importantly , the self-confidence developedwithin an exercise setting appears to begeneralizable to other domains that necessitatesome degree of physical activity . This is paramount when dealing with a senior population. The primary concern of most aging individuals is to maintain their livingindependence. This appraisal of independence is based largely on their ability to continue dailyactivities. Most daily living activities entail somedegree of physical ability (e.g., cleaning thehouse, shoveling the snow , etc.). Therefore, as practitioners designing and implementingexercise programs for seniors they must considerusing tools and strategies that raise self-efficacyappraisals both inside and outside the class. Specifically , this means developing exercise programs that are congruent with the exerciseability of the class and not beyond the class'sphysical ability . Therefore, all components of the exercise class including the warm-up, cardiocomponent, strength training component, andcool down should be aimed at the ability of the average participant. The class should bechallenging, yet not defeating. In order to helpgeneralize feelings of capabilities outside theclass, skills that are necessary for outside activitiesshould also be incorporated into the class. For example, balance is a necessary tool for manydaily activities so this should be included in acomplete exercise program designed for seniors.The stamina developed from the conditioningcomponent of the class and the muscular strengthdeveloped through some type of strength trainingaspect will also be applicable to everyday livingactivities. The instructor needs to be thoughtfuland resourceful when designing programs gearedtoward the specific needs of seniors. The exercise group is also a primary reference group for social support. Exercising with a groupof similar individuals provides many socialaspects for the individual. This study highlightsthe need for guidance and reassurance of worth.This again suggests how important it is for thehealth practitioner or exercise leader to facilitatea supportive and enriching environment. This may mean providing time before or after the class for individuals to talk among themselves.The instructor might also incorporate a walkingsection to the class where people walk in pairs or small groups and encourage communication.During the cool down period at the end of theclass, an instructor might also incorporate asharing component where seniors are encouragedto openly discuss any challenges that they arecurrently facing. Social support can also beincluded outside of the exercise class as well with social activities planned or suggested. The bottom line is that any creative tool that facilitates both self-confidence and social supportis a necessary component of a senior's exerciseprogram. From a physical and health standpoint,this will increase the probability of seniorsadhering to the exercise program, thereby gaining all of the physical benefits accruedthrough regular exercise. From a mental healthperspective, seniors will gain the wellness benefit from feeling supported and independentlycapable not only in an exercise setting but intheir everyday lives as well.

Strength, flexibility , and balance are important tomaintaining your independence as you get older. To see how you measure up, take this test. If your scores are less than \"normal\" for your age group, ask your doctor about exercises you cando at home to increase your fitness level. You canalso check into classes offered for seniors, suchas aerobics or tai chi (through your local parksdepartment and/or senior centre). 30-Second Chair Stand (measures lower-body strength) Sit in a chair with your feet flat on the floor. Cross your arms over your chest. Count the number of times in 30 seconds you can come to a full stand. Two Minute Step-In-Place (measures endurance) Let a partner find the point midway between your hip and knee. Mark that target height on a table leg or a wall. March for two minutes and count how often the right leg reaches the target height.Sit-and-Reach (measures flexibility) Brace a chair against the wall and sit on the edge. Place one foot flat and extend the other leg with your heel on the floor. W ith your arms outstretched, reach to your toe on the extended leg. Note the position of your fingertips and measure the inches short of (-) or beyond(+) your toes. Note: Do not take these tests if your doctor has told you not to exercise; or if they cause youchest pain, joint pain, or dizziness; or if you haveuncontrolled high blood pressure. Have a partnerwith you and do your best on each test, but donot overexert yourself. Before starting, warm upwith about five minutes of walking and swingingyour arms. Source: American College of Sports Medicine Normal Scores Step-in-place Sit-and-reach (measured in inches) Cutrona and Russell found that social provisions were related to positive health outcomes in theelderly . The strongest predictors were reliablealliance and guidance. With respect to exercise,Sharratt and Brawley found that subjective normor what individuals perceive others would wantthem to do, an aspect of social support, was akey variable in predicting exercise behavior ofthe elderly . Relationship between Social Support and Self-Confidence Social support can enhance people's beliefs in their abilities. Positive emotional support,guidance, or advice may result in greater self- confidence. In turn, this increased self-confidence may lead to improved coping behavior such as awillingness to try harder, generate more effort orpersist longer. Thus, the social support receivedinfluences behavioral outcomes by virtue ofenhancing self-confidence. In their studies with seniors, Cutrona and Russell noted that the elderly face problems that affecttheir independence regarding health and lifestylewhich they did not face in earlier years. Anexercise program geared toward seniors is a likely source of social support that is capable of influencing feelings of confidence and howfrequently an individual exercises. Social supportin the form of provisions is provided for theparticipants by class members and the classinstructor. Given that positive social support hasbeen related to better health, social provisionsaimed toward improving physical capability arelikely conducive to increasing physical activitypatterns. Study Findings Sixty-two seniors (51 females and 11 males) were the volunteer participants in the study . Their mean age was 69.8 years for a sample ranging in agefrom 54 to 83 years. They were enrolled in five different community-based 10 week fitness classes. All were healthy and 73 percent were retired with the remainder still engaged in some form ofwork. The classes in which they took part wereleader structured and occurred twice per week. With respect to social support, we evaluated three provisions that class members and theinstructor may provide to the exerciseparticipant: reassurance of worth, guidance, and social integration. Three self-confidencemeasures were also evaluated. They were self-confidence for a) in-class exercise components(e.g., for completing aerobic or muscularendurance aspects), b) exercise programattendance (e.g., making it to class twice perweek or rescheduling), and c) other physicalactivity (e.g., shoveling snow in the winter orgardening in the summer. The objective of thestudy was to explore the possible influence ofsocial support and self-confidence on fitness class adherence for seniors. In general, it was found that seniors have relatively high levels of self-confidence and modest levels of social support. What is mostinteresting is the high degree of variabilityexpressed in the measures indicating thatparticipants in the same exercise classes can feelvery differently with respect to amount of socialsupport they are receiving or their perceptions of ability (self-confidence). Adherence was not a problem for this group of exercising seniors, with individuals attending amean 81% of the 10 week classes. The socialprovision of reassurance of worth stronglyinfluenced all three types of self-confidence. As well, an individual's self-confidence to attendclasses regularly predicted how frequently theyactually did attend the exercise classes. Therefore,the findings appear to capture an additiverelationship, where social support (particularly reassurance of worth) influences self-confidence and self-confidence (particularly attendanceconfidence) influences attendance. It appears that in order to keep seniors regularly active, they need to feel capable about their abilities. One way to ensure that they do feel self-confidentis to provide a highly supportive exerciseenvironment that promotes feelings of self-worth. 30 3Blood Pressure Two Numbers You Should Know A blood pressure measurement has two numbers you need to pay attention to\u2014systolic anddiastolic pressures. If either number is high, it means your heart is working harder to pump blood through yourarteries. This can eventually lead to diseasedarteries. A pressure that's \"high-normal\" or higher puts you at risk. Urinary Tract Infections If you're a post-menopausal woman and havebeen having frequent urinary tract infections(UTIs), it may mean your blood sugar levels arerunning too high. Women with diabetes typically experience more UTIs than nondiabetic women.

The truth is, there's a whole team of nutrients your bones need to stay strong. Calcium is justone. In addition to 1,200 mg of daily calcium, you also need lesser amounts of magnesium,phosphorus, boron, copper, manganese,zinc, vitamins B-6, C, D, K, and folic acid. The best way to get many of these nutrients is to eat a variety of colorful vegetables\u2014especially leafy greens such as kale andcollard, roots like carrots and turnips, andcruciferous vegetables like broccoli,cauliflower, and cabbage (and of course,dairy products are high in calcium). You also need protein so your body can manufacture collagen\u2014important to skinand bones. You need healthful fats (e.g., fatty fish, olive oil, nuts, seeds, flaxseed), which help yourbody absorb vitamin D. Suspected Bone-Robbers Smoking. Caffeine and soda pop (especially colas)\u2014in excess. Excess animal protein and refined processed foods (sugar and white flour products). Bothcontribute to an acid condition in the bodythat can leach minerals out of your bones. Excessive sodium (more than about 2,400 mg per day , or about 1 tsp. of salt). We getour highest doses of sodium from processedor restaurant foods (e.g., TV dinners, cannedsoups, fast foods, etc.). Sources: Robert P .

Self-Confidence A factor that plays an important role in themotivation to be involved in health pursuits and to be physically active is self-confidence.Self-confidence is an individual's beliefs in theirabilities to complete desired actions. The strongeran individual's sense of self-confidence, the morelikely they are to choose to engage in certainactivities, the more effort they will extend andthe longer they will persist. Individuals whobelieve in their abilities to perform and plan forexercise are motivated to persist in their exercise- related behavior (i.e, adherers). Less self-confident people do not hold such beliefs to the same extent and as a result their exercise-related behavior isless persistent, more irregular, or halts altogether.Various researchers have found that beliefs about personal ability are robust predictors of maintenance to exercise programs in older adults. Social Support Another important factor that influences exercisebehavior concerns the other people who alsoengage in the physical activity . This factor hasbeen labeled social support and has beenconsidered both as the quantity and quality ofsupport that individuals receive from significantothers. Uchino, Cacioppo, and Kiecolt-Glaserfound in their review of 81 studies that socialsupport was related to positive effects on thecardiovascular, endocrine, and immune systems.Weiss proposed six social functions or provisions which may be obtained from social interactions:attachment (emotional support), social integration (network support), reassurance of worth (esteem support), reliable alliance (tangible aid), guidance (informational support), and opportunity for nurturance . 2 31Secretariat Newsletter The Secretariat Newsletter is published four times a year by the Senior Citizens'Secretariat and distributed free of charge.We welcome letters, articles, and items of interest from you. Please include yourname, address, and telephone number on all correspondence. The Senior Citizens' Secretariat was established in 1980 to facilitate the planning and development of services and programs for seniors by coordinatingplans, policies, and programs presented by the departments of the provincial government. The Secretariat serves as aone-door entry to government for seniors,seniors' groups, and other provincial bodies concerned with ageing issues. The Secretariat develops plans, policies,and programs in partnership with otherlevels of government and agencies responsible for seniors. The Secretariat's office is located at 1740 Granville Street, 4th floor Sun worshippers, cover your eyes! Studies have shown that permanent damage to the eyes can result from prolonged exposure tothe sun without adequate protection. Ultra violet(UV) light is the component of sunlight mostresponsible for eye damage. Excessive exposure, especially from light reflected from sand, snow orpavement, can produce a burn on the surface ofthe eye. Like a sunburn on the skin, eye surfaceburns are usually painful, but temporary . Of more concern is the cumulative damage of repeated exposure that may contribute to chronic eye disease. UV exposure can affect not only itssurface, but also its internal structures (the lensand retina). UV light is a risk factor in the development of pterygium (a growth that invades the corner ofthe eyes), cataracts (clouding of the lens) and macular degeneration (breakdown of the macula). Those at risk include people who spend a lot of time in the sun, those who live at highaltitudes or near the equator, and those who take photosensitizing drugs such as psoralens(used to treat psoriasis), tetracycline,doxycycline, allopurinol or phothiazine. During cataract surgery , the natural lens is removed and replaced with a synthetic lens. Newer intraocular lens implants filter UVradiation. This eliminates any concern about UV eye protection after cataract surgery . To protect your eyes from the sunlight, it is recommended that you wear a wide brimmed hat and sunglasses that filter out 99-100 per cent of the UV light. Eye Facts\u2014Sunglasses Here are a few tips to help you choose a pair of sunglasses that can protect your eyes from the damage that can be caused by prolongedexposure to sunlight. First, look at the label. Although universal standards are not in place, most manufacturerslabel their products stating their protectiveability . The Canadian Ophthalmological Societyrecommends that glasses block 99-100 per cent of UV light (both UV-A and UV-B). If you spend a lot of time in the sun, it is recommended that you buy wrap-around glasses to prevent the sun from entering your eyes fromthe sides. Don't be deceived by color or cost. Dark lenses do not necessarily mean good protection. Also,expensive glasses do not guarantee goodprotection. Price may be an indication of betterquality or durability , but more often, it is areflection of current fashion.

Some of this research has shown that there appears to be good evidencefor the plasticity of the physiological system evenafter age 60 years. While biological aging isinescapable, the functional consequences of this process can apparently be minimized byregular physical activity . Singh reported several physiological changes due to aging that aremodifiable by exercise. A few of the relevantchanges include increases in aerobic functioning,greater motor coordination, improved musclestrength and tissue elasticity , greater total energyexpenditure, and improved REM sleep durationand attention span. Exercise Adherence Patterns of Seniors Clearly , physical activity has important implications in altering many of the biological changes associated with aging. However, in order to enjoy these physiological improvements, a regular exerciseprogram must be maintained. Herein lies thechallenge facing most seniors. Although thereappears to be a modest increase in physicalactivity in early old age (65-75 years) due to anincrease in leisure time after retirement, exerciseintervention studies have documented drop outrates from 6 to 34 per cent with most recidivismoccurring within the first 3 months of beginningan exercise program.Martin and Sinden examined exercise adherence rates of older adults (>55 yrs) across 21 randomized controlled trials. They concluded that on average,participants completed 78% of their prescribedexercise sessions and that adherence rates weregreater for strength and flexibility programs (87%attendance) than aerobic based programs (75%).They concluded that adherers tended to be fitter at baseline, were previously physically active, non-smokers, and had a high sense of confidencein their ability to exercise. Similarly , a recent study by Goggin and Morrow found that 89% of 403 adults over the age of 60 were aware of the health benefits of physicalactivity but only 31% of them were participatingin sufficient physical activity to obtain suchbenefits. Physical activity was also found todecrease with age and men tended to be morephysically active than women. Clearly , there is aneed to better understand how to help seniorsinitiate and maintain an exercise program that benefits them on a number of health dimensions. 36 1 VOLUME 104 JULY 2003Older Americans Because of the increase in life expectancy and decrease in birth rates, the proportion of thepopulation over 65 is increasing. In 1985, morethan 11 percent of the population was over 65.By the year 2030, approximately one-fifth of the population is expected to be over age 65. (In Nova Scotia in 2003, more than 14 percent of the population is over 65. By the year 2025,approximately one-quarter of the population isexpected to be over age 65.) The aging process begins at birth and continues throughout life. However, some persons may seem old at 60 and others are alert, vital, and enthusiastic at 70 years of age. Did you ever wonder why?There are many reasons. The physical reasons for aging are related to the way we treat the body . Do you eat right? Do you exercise? Do you get enough rest? Do you have physical checkups regularly? Each person receives a unique genetic makeup,but good nutrition and healthy habits can keepthe body from aging faster than it should. There are psychological reasons why some persons age more than others. A person's attitudeabout life and aging can shorten or lengthen life,causing one to experience depression or vitality .Healthy attitudes keep the mind and body strong;unhealthy attitudes erode the mind and body . 1. Expect and adjust to change. Change is an inevitable part of life and living. Look atchange as an opportunity for growth. 2. Maintain a sense of humor. Life maintains a sense of balance and perspective whenhumor is retained. Take time to enjoy lifeand to laugh! 3. Do something each day you like to do. This gives you something to look forwardto and adds interest to life. 4. Do something each day that you do not like to do, but must be done. This addschallenge and a sense of accomplishment to your day . 5. Do something each day for someone else. This gets your mind off yourself and yoursituation. It forces you to look towardothers and how you can help others. 6. Exercise. Walking is one of the best forms of exercise or join a group exercise program. 7. Eat properly . a) Eat a variety of foods. b) Maintain healthy weight.c) Choose a diet low in fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol. Choose a diet withplenty of vegetables, fruits, and grainproducts. d) Use sugars only in moderation. e) Use salt and sodium only in moderation. f) If you drink alcoholic beverages, do so in moderation. 8. Maintain connectedness with others. It is important to have a network of friends andfamily members with whom to talk andexperience this business of life and living.Enjoy persons from different generations.Nurture a child? Talk with a teenager? 9. Maintain enjoyable surroundings. Most persons enjoy familiar surroundings.Surround yourself with colors youappreciate, flowers if you enjoy them, or with a collection of stamps if that isimportant to you. 10. Make it a point to learn something new each day . 11. Be open to new ideas and interests. 12. Focus on the positive. Look for the good things in your life. Smile, keep your chin up, and move forward. 13. Nurture a sense of personal worth. You are unique. Enjoy the person you are. 14. Nurture self-confidence. Maintain confidence in your abilities. 15. Use resources wisely . Resources include time, talent, money , and energy . 16. Invest in life and living. Look forward to each new day .
