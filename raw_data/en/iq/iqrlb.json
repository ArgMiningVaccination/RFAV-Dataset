You're in the right place. Whether you're suffering with hot flushes, night sweats, low mood or any other uncomfortable symptom relating to perimenopause, we've listed 12 of the best supplements for a range of different symptoms to help you decide which to buy. Perimenopause is the period in a woman's life where her body makes the natural transition to the full menopause - where their periods completely stop. One of our in-house experts Alexander Thompson explains further: \"Levels of oestrogen, the main female sex hormone fluctuate in this period but ultimately start to decline more and more, causing changes to the length of the menstrual cycle, as well as milder versions of the classic symptoms often experienced during the menopause (hot flushes, mood swings, anxiety, brain fog, dry skin, thinning hair, fatigue, reduced libido and vaginal dryness).\" Tackling perimenopause should be approached from two angles. Firstly, you could try perimenopause supplements that provide deep-acting hormonal support for the longer-term symptoms. And secondly, you could use products that provide targeted extra support for specific symptoms, such as hot flushes, fatigue, dry skin etc. In order to provide the best perimenopause supplements, we asked our team of expert nutritionists to share their recommendations.

However, we have listed a range of different supplements suitable for supporting a whole variety of perimenopause symptoms, so it's best to do your research based on your own experience and choose from that. There are concerns that the hormonal effects of phytoestrogen based products may affect the management of other hormonal related conditions and interfere with hormonal-based medicines. Furthermore, those with a personal/ family history of hormonal cancers should also use these products cautiously. Other products will have specific cautions and these can be varied. Ultimately, it is important to check with a GP or pharmacist before using any product if any there are any other health conditions or if any medicines are being taken. Fortunately, there are an array of different supplements and vitamins for alleviating and managing the symptoms of perimenopause. We hope you've found our list of the best supplements for perimenopause useful for supporting you on your journey.
