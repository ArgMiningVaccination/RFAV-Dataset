Our residential participants received their first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine earlier this month, and they have appointments scheduled for their second dose in February. We're grateful for the efforts of our program and clinical staff in taking this critical step forward. Phase 1A qualified adult services staff were offered the opportunity to receive a COVID vaccine at Penn Medicine-Princeton Medical Center. Adult services staff who received their first dose of the vaccine have been scheduled by Penn Medicine to get their second doses in the upcoming weeks. The State of New Jersey prioritized people who live in group homes in Phase 1A due to the congregate nature of their living arrangement. The State's process for distributing vaccines continues to evolve, and we are continuously working to secure vaccines for Phase 1B qualified school staff, adult participants in our day program, and our students age 18 and older. We are also continuing to follow the health and safety measures that have been put in place across all our programs to protect participants, students, staff, and family members. Staff are required to follow protocols for wearing masks, practicing social distancing, hand washing, monitoring for temperature and other possible symptoms, and following guidelines for disinfecting surfaces in classrooms, day centers, and residences. Professional cleaning and disinfecting will also continue to take place regularly and frequently in all locations. We are thankful for the overwhelming support from our families, staff, and community at this challenging time. "}
