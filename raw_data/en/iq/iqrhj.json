He read the entire manu\u00ad script twice. He has been a constant perceptive critic, and for his pains he has had only the dubious satisfaction of reading the manuscript in nearly all of its revisions. At various stages the manuscript was read by Professor Wei-Kou Lee and Father Joseph S. Sebes, S.J., both at Georgetown University, Washington, D.C., Professor Kenneth P. Landon of the American Uni\u00ad versity, Washington, D.C., Professor Wang Gungwu of the Australian National University, Canberra, Australia, and Professor Howard Matts- son-Boze, my colleague at Geneva College. All encouraged me in the publication of the manuscript and made valuable suggestions about both form and content. I wish to express my thanks for the use of materials and facilities to the staff of the Japanese Section, particularly Messrs. Andrew Y. Kuroda, Key Kobayashi, and Mrs. Lillian K. Takeshita, the Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.; to the staff of Toyo Bunko (Oriental Library); to Kindai Chugoku Kenkyujo (Institute of Modern China), particularly Professor Sasaki Masaya; to Mr. Kishi Koichi of Ajia Keizai Kenkyujo (Institute of Asian Economic Affairs); to the staff of the Foreign Office Archives; and to the staff of Boeicho Kenshujo Senshi-shitsu (Historical Section, Defense Agency), all in Tokyo. I would like to record my deep appreciation to Mrs. Virginia Piatt for editorial work. She worked long and hard to bring order where chaos reigned. My gratitude goes to Professor Grant K. Goodman of the Center for East Asian Studies, the University of Kansas. He gave me useful editorial advice that saved me from embarrassment. My thanks are also due to Mrs. June Futato for typing the entire manu\u00ad script. Finally, my wife has shared many a night into the wee hours with me in giving me moral support. I am alone responsible for those errors of fact and evaluation which surely remain. Fall, 1969 Beaver Falls, Pa. Introduction The relations of Chinese governments with the Nanyang Hua- ch'iao (South Seas Chinese) go back to the Ming dynasty (1368-1636), when the imperial court largely abandoned the Nanyang Chinese and forbade them, on punishment of death, to leave their ancestral land. Furthermore, the Imperial court absolved itself of responsibility for the protection of its emigrants on the grounds that these people were deserters of ancestral tombs and therefore unworthy of China's protec\u00ad tion.1 The policy of the Manchu government (1636-1911) was even harsher than that of the Ming government, particularly during the early years, partly because a large number of Chinese who had migrated to the region beyond China's southern border were self- exiled remnants loyal to the deposed Ming government. Even in the eighteenth century the Manchu government was unwilling to act to protect the lives of unfilial Chinese, leaving them to the mercy of local rulers.2 It is a well-known story that in 1741, Emperor Ch'ien Lung dismissed a Dutch envoy sent to apologize for the infamous massacre of Chinese in Batavia, saying that it caused \"no concern of the Imperial Court\" because these Chinese had disgraced their ancestors by deserting their family tombs in the quest for money.3 In fact, it was only after the 1860's that China became interested in the overseas Chinese, and it was not until 1877 that the first Chinese consulate was set up at Singapore\u2014despite the fact that Chinese had lived there for three hundred years. It took eighteen years for the Manchu government to establish the first consulate in the Philippines. It was set up in 1898; the final decision was based primarily upon eco\u00ad nomic interest.4 Moreover, Chinese who returned from abroad were subjected to extortion and interrogation by local officials because the edicts of 1717 and 17295 had neither been rescinded nor enforced, and the Manchu dynasty law code (Ta-Ch'ing Lii-li) also stipulated harsh penalties for emigration overseas.6 Such a policy naturally engendered ill feelings among the Hua- ch'iao toward the Manchu government. Their anti-Manchu sentiments, however, were not immediately translated into support of Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary movement\u2014at least not financial support. Although some overseas Chinese from Malaya took part in the famous Huang 1 Hua Kang Revolt in April, 1911, much-needed contributions to the revolutionary funds were not forthcoming from Nanyang Chi\u00ad nese until Sun's revolution appeared almost certain to succeed. Only then did they pour money into his coffers.7 The successful revolution enhanced the prestige of Sun and his republican party. For the Nanyang Hua-ch'iao, however, he was only a symbolic nationalist, not the leader of their communities; Sun could not \"extend the help and protection demanded by the overseas Chinese.\" His prestige and the luster of the republican government in Southeast Asia began to wear off, and by 1915 they had little magic power of appeal to the Nanyang Chinese.8 China under Yuan Shih-kai, who usurped the power from the republicans, was weak and ineffectual when Japan presented the Twenty-One Demands. The Twenty-One Demands, which would have made China a Japanese colony had she accepted, aroused Chinese national indigna\u00ad tion. In concert with the boycott movement in China, Nanyang Chinese boycotted Japanese goods; it was a movement conducted largely by Chinese Chambers of Commerce and their affiliates.9 Four years later, they staged another anti-Japanese campaign against the Japanese position on the Shantung question at the Paris Peace Con\u00ad ference.10 Reflecting the May Fourth Movement spirit, students and intellectuals took over the leadership in the campaign. Unlike the 1915 boycott, it was a mass drive supported by the press and schools.11 As Chinese nationalism spread, a reorganized Kuomintang (KMT) government emerged, once again under Sun Yat-sen's leadership. As an old revolutionary active abroad, Sun naturally took interest in the rising political consciousness of the overseas Chinese. As early as 1920, KMT school teachers came to Malaya to staff Chinese schools and inculcate in Chinese children Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles (Nation\u00ad alism, Democracy, and Livelihood), patriotism, and Chinese history.12 Then in 1924, a year after the 1923 anti-Japanese boycott movement that swept China and Nanyang Chinese communities when Japan insisted on holding her territorial claim over the Liaotung peninsula, the KMT government created the Office of Overseas Chinese Affairs \u2014the first concrete step the KMT government seriously considered for protecting the welfare of their overseas compatriots and for mobilizing a mass support for KMT nationalism. The Office, however, was short- 2 lived; already weakened by neglect, it became defunct after Sun Yat- sen's death in 1925.13 In 1926, at the Second KMT Congress, overseas Chinese delegates passed resolutions urging the government to reacti\u00ad vate the Office. The government granted their request.14 After the death of Sun, Chiang Kai-shek inherited the mantle of the deceased leader and unified China in 1927, under KMT control. Being a mass-based revolutionary party, the KMT naturally sought to bring all nationalist movements at home and abroad under its discipline in order to promote Chinese nationalism. The need to solidify them became acute upon the emergence of new forces threatening the via\u00ad bility of China: the Japanese and the Communists. To Chiang, the Communists were less dangerous than the Japanese, who appeared to stand in the way of China's becoming a strong state. The first of a series of military clashes between Japan and China occurred in 1928 at Tsinan. In the 1928 anti-Japanese movement, the KMT government for the first time took an active part in such a campaign, transforming the drive from a resistance movement against aggressors to a nationalist movement for the survival of the Chinese race. In other words, the anti-Japanese campaign now became part of the Chinese nationalist movement. At the same time, the cultivation of anti-Japanese feelings and national-salvation thought through party education became im\u00ad portant. Consequently, the scope of the anti-Japanese movement was broadened to include not only boycotts but also contributions, labor service, investment, and other methods to be used in the national salvation movement. Though the KMT took over the leadership of the national salvation movement after 1928, the systematization had started as early as 1926, and it was strengthened during and after the Manchurian incident. For its overseas operation, three organizations were primarily responsi\u00ad ble for overseas Chinese education, party indoctrination and discipline, guidance, and propaganda: the Overseas Party Affairs Department, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, and the Foreign Ministry with its diplomatic mission abroad (see Figure 1). The reorganized KMT began in 1924 to establish its network in Nanyang Hua-ch'iao communities. By the time the Second Party Congress met in 1926, the KMT had set up headquarters in Burma, French Indochina, Nanyang (Malaya-Dutch Indies), the Philippines, 3 FIGURE 1 A CHART SHOWING RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE KMT GOVERNMENT-PARTY AND THE NANYANG CHINESE CCP CCT LYS KMT CENTRAL EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE CCP HKO TD MMGD \u2014^ KMT GOVERNMENT EXECUTIVE K--IAM s > FKPG KMT OVERSEAS AGENTS 14 --- M General Headquarters Branch Offices Chapters Wards \"7T KMT GOV'T DIPLOMATIC MISSION Consul Generals Consuls Attaches (Education) Overseas Chinese Affairs Officers Commercial Rep.

The overseas party branches were to (1) train and guide party members to plan propaganda and educa\u00ad tional policies in conformity with party directives and to disseminate propaganda through the party newspapers; (2) support Hua-ch'iao schools and social activities; (3) help to organize functional associa\u00ad tions; and (4) plan policy for lower echelon party members.17 These activities were conducted by the Overseas Party Affairs Department, established in July, 1932, which took over activities of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission. The Overseas Party Affairs Department was the most important organization for KMT overseas operation. Working under the direct control of the Central Executive Committee, which coordinated ac\u00ad tivities with the KMT government Executive Yuan, the Department was responsible for organizing and expanding party affairs, disseminat\u00ad ing news through party newspapers and publications, disciplining and indoctrinating party members and training them for overt and covert activities, drafting plans for propaganda in cooperation with the Organization and Propaganda Departments, supervising the consulate's coordination with the party, and protecting the Hua-ch'iao. The De\u00ad partment was the only party agency with a direct line to every segment of Hua-ch'iao communities, serving as a watchdog for the Central Executive Committee. Through its overseas agents (General Head\u00ad quarters, branch offices, chapters, and wards), the Department super\u00ad vised education and party activities within Hua-ch'iao associations. It also investigated the distribution of Chinese, their living conditions, patriotic movements, associations, and attitudes toward the party as well as the policies of Southeast Asian governments toward the Chinese.18 Moreover, in cooperation with the KMT Mass Movement Guidance Department, which was created in the midst of the Sino-Japanese hos- 6 tilities in the spring of 1932, the Overseas Party Affairs Department was responsible for organizing a mass nationalist movement. The Re\u00ad vised Guiding Principles for Mass Movement, issued by the Depart\u00ad ment in February, 1933, spelled out to overseas agents the details of the propaganda policy for achieving their objective.19 The eight-fold objective was stated as follows: (1) To mobilize the masses to engage in a resistance movement against [Japanese] aggression; (2) To enlighten the masses in self-defense consciousness in order to engage them in a systematically planned resistance movement; (3) To encourage the masses to engage in combat and non-combat duties; (4) To organize the masses in a militia to help maintain local security and assist the military; (5) To guide the masses to buy national goods; (6) To organize civil associations to help the government's relief work and to prevent a Communist agitation among refugees; (7) To open the line of communication among the party, the government, and the masses for a better understanding and for the unity of the three bodies; and (8) To encourage the masses to organize special units such as comfort missions, fund-raising groups, and student volunteer corps. In June, the Department announced Plans for Mass Movement To Be Guided by Party Chapters and Wards, which supplemented Propa\u00ad ganda Operation Plans To Be Implemented by the Chinese General Headquarters and Branch Office, passed in February, 1931.20 The Plans stressed the importance of person-to-person communication\u2014 home visitation, individual dialogue, and circuit lectures\u2014in the prop\u00ad agation of party doctrine and proper understanding of KMT national policy. Both Plans and Propaganda Operation Plans emphasized the usefulness of the mass assembly for generating a sense of participation. The press, library and reading clubs, school events, drama troupes, theaters, concerts, garden parties, sports events, merchant guilds, and labor, speech, and religious associations were specifically mentioned as effective vehicles for creating national unity and raising funds. In these two ordinances we see elements that were to crystallize into components of the 1937-1941 Nanyang Chinese National Salva\u00ad tion Movement. That the KMT applied these decrees to the Nanyang Chinese as if they were Chinese citizens, regardless of their nation\u00ad alities, is important. Together with the Propaganda Department and the Overseas 7 Chinese Affairs Commission, the Overseas Party Affairs Department managed and controlled a number of party newspapers published in Southeast Asian countries.21 They were the Hsin Kuo Min Jit Poh (Singapore); the Kwang Wah Jip Poh (Penang); the Pao (Kuala Lumpur); the Ka\\ Min Jit Poh (Rangoon); the Kong Li Po (Manila); the Min Kuo Jih Pao, the Bang\\o\\ Jit Poh, the Hua-ch'iao Jih Pao, the Hua Hsien Jih Pao, the La\\ Muang, the Issara, and the Khao Siam (all in the Thien Sung Jip Po (Batavia); and the Hua-ch'iao Jih Pao and the Annan Jit Po (Cholon). Naturally, the editorial policy of these newspapers was anti-Japanese. Party discipline extended also to non-party Chinese dailies. For ex\u00ad ample, the Propaganda Operation Plans To Be Implemented by the Overseas Chinese General Headquarters and Branch Offices passed in February, 1931,22 empowered the overseas KMT agents to \"re\u00ad organize\" an editorial board and to \"replace\" the publisher or the editor of an non-party newspaper if its editorial was \"reactionary.\" They also were given authority to \"discipline\" a non-cooperative news\u00ad paper publisher if \"persuasion\" failed, to recommend that such a newspaper be boycotted, or to request the Propaganda Department to \"punish\" the publisher. The Chinese wire service came under the same disciplinary control. Furthermore, Chinese publishing news\u00ad papers and magazines were required to register for examination with either local Chinese authorities (Embassy or Consulate) or the Over\u00ad seas Chinese Affairs Commission, according to the Registration Act for Overseas Chinese Newspapers and Magazines, promulgated jointly by the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission and the Internal Affairs Ministry in June, 1934. Publishers were not only prohibited from printing articles detrimental to the KMT government's national in\u00ad terests but also were required to file copies of each edition with the Internal Affairs Ministry, the Overseas Affairs Commission, and the Overseas Party Affairs Department.23 The most influential dailies in the South Seas countries were not party-controlled papers, however. They were the Nanyang Siang Poh and the Sin Chew Jit Poh (Singapore); the Sin Po (Batavia); and the Foo\\ien Times and the Chinese Commercial News (Manila). These widely circulated newspapers were owned, managed, or edited by China-oriented, influential Chinese businessmen and intellectuals in 8 their communities, who supported the KMT government and its party ideology.24 Minor Chinese-operated presses reprinted articles and feature stories from the Big Five and depended upon the KMT govern\u00ad ment's Central News Agency for news service. Jointly with executive branches, the Overseas Party Affairs Depart\u00ad ment supervised and guided all Nanyang Chinese associations. The Nanyang Chinese had a great penchant for organization, from which the Chinese government and the KMT profited enormously. The KMT, in most Southeast Asian countries, used many of these associa\u00ad tions as its front. According to the Organization Laws Concerning People's Associations, passed by the Central Executive Committee in 1933,25 Nanyang Chinese associations were without exception required to submit to the guidance of the KMT and its government agents, adhere faithfully to the Three Principles, and obey government orders (Articles II and III). Another Central Executive Committee decree required executive members of all associations to swear before party officials that they would \"endeavor to execute the principles of the San-Min-Chu-I to the best of [their] ability. . . .\" Should they violate the oath, they were to \"submit to a severe discipline.\"26 The most powerful Nanyang Hua-ch'iao organization was and is the Chamber of Commerce. Chambers of Commerce had been estab\u00ad lished in principal cities throughout Southeast Asia. Leaders of the Chambers of Commerce were China-oriented. In boycott drives against Japan before 1937, the organization had played a leading role. It was only logical that the KMT and its government take upon themselves the task of amending the old laws regulating activities of the Chamber of Commerce. Under a new set of laws issued in 1929, a KMT approval was the prerequisite for founding a new Chamber of Commerce. The raison d'etre of the Chamber of Commerce was primarily economic, but its activities in Southeast Asia extended far into the arena of politics. Its politico-economic influence was pervasive in Chinese com\u00ad munities. Traditionally, the Nanyang Chinese Chamber of Commerce had served as a semi-official agency of the Chinese government and, during the KMT period, it had served as a medium for the cultivation of national consciousness. On the other hand, because the Chamber of Commerce had existed for the protection of Chinese community interests long before the KMT government was founded, it remained 9 to a considerable degree independent of the KMT's attempt to control it. There is another important area\u2014education\u2014in which the KMT executive branch (particularly the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commis\u00ad sion, the Foreign Affairs Ministry through its overseas diplomatic mis\u00ad sion, and the Education Ministry) played a predominant role in shap\u00ad ing and moulding overseas Chinese patriotism. The interest of the KMT government in the education of Nanyang Chinese children was evidenced by the 1929 national educational con\u00ad ferences, held under the auspices of the Commission and Chinan University, together with other party and government agents. At their first meeting, it was resolved that the San-Min-Chu-I was to be the basic doctrine in the teaching of Chinese children abroad, and at the second conference, teachers from abroad expressed their wish to teach the Chinese language and Chinese history slanted towards the KMT ideology. They demanded that KMT members train them without interference from local authorities.27 Later in 1929, the third confer\u00ad ence on education was held, again under the auspicies of the Commis\u00ad sion and the KMT Training Department. From these three conferences emerged a document, the Principles of Hua-ctiiao Education, which was promulgated by the Executive Yuan in 1932.28 Thus, by 1933, the KMT educational policy had been founded on KMT ideology. Both Japanese and Chinese sources agree that the KMT government suc\u00ad ceeded to a high degree in cementing the national unity of the Hua- ch'iao and strengthening their national consciousness through educa\u00ad tional media.29 The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, which had played a significant part in the overseas educational program, was in 1931 placed under the jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan\u2014a step taken apparently to bring the Commission into a closer relationship with the supreme executive body. Under a new Organization Law, promulgated in December, 1931, and amended in August, 1932, the Commission was made responsible, together with the Foreign Affairs Ministry, for supervising Chinese consular operation, which included education. Indeed, the Commission was now the supreme organ under the Ex\u00ad ecutive Yuan for overseeing all overseas Chinese activities and educa- 10 tion, and in the latter area the Commission coordinated with the Edu\u00ad cation Ministry.30 Under the direction of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, the consulate, besides attending to its normal duties through the chan\u00ad nel of the Foreign Affairs Ministry, assumed responsibility for the supervision of education within the ideological and doctrinal frame\u00ad work of the San-Min-Chu-I. Consular duties in relation to the educa\u00ad tion of Chinese youths and children abroad were stipulated in legisla\u00ad tive acts passed by the KMT government, such as the Consular Act for the Guidance of Hua-ch'iao Schools and Auxiliary Schools, the Consular Regulations for the Legislation and Administration of Hua- ch'iao Education, and the Consular Act for the Guidance of Hua-ch'iao Shu Pao She and Other Educational Facilities Concerning Lectures to be Given on Sundays and Memorial Days.31 Together they spelled out policies for the improvement of the educational system and the quality and promotion of national and party loyalty. According to these acts, the consul was to (1) examine the Hua-ch'iao educational system and report findings once a year to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commis\u00ad sion and the Education Ministry; (2) see that all educational ordinances and laws decreed by the KMT government were observed and that education in the party doctrine was enforced; and (3) guide local libraries, newspapers, and cultural organizations, urging them to hold as many lecture meetings as possible on Sundays and memorial days. Such lectures were to stress the tenets of the party doctrine, summarize current affairs, and exalt patriotism. The Chinese government had extra-legal societies through which it reached overseas Chinese communities. They included the C. C. T'uan and the Lan-yi she, of which not much was known except that they maintained a lateral but very close personal relationship with some of the most influential figures in the party and the government. The Lan-yi she, for instance, was a super-secret intelligence and espionage organization operating under the direct command of Tai Li, Chiang Kai-shek's trusted confidant and one of the most feared and powerful men in the KMT government. The C. C. T'uan was known to have been created by two brothers, Ch'en Li-fu and Ch'en Kuo-fu, close friends of Chiang Kai-shek and leaders of one of the controlling KMT factions with a strong conservative and right-wing outlook.32 These 11 secret organizations directly controlled their respective overseas mem\u00ad bers and had dealings with illegal overseas societies. Through these overseas agents, the Lan-yi she and the C. C. T'uan reached overseas Chinese. Another illegal Chinese political party interested in the Nanyang Chinese was the Communist Party. The Communist Party had been active in Nanyang Hua-ch'iao communities since the 1920's. From its headquarters in Singapore, for instance, the Communist-dominated General Labor Union, in close contact with the Chinese Communist Party, coordinated the strategy of Communist operation \"in the labor movement of Sumatra, Borneo, New Guinea, Celebes, and Malay Peninsula, Burma, Siam, and Indo-China.\"33 After the consummation of the KMT-Communist united front, Communist parties and their affiliates in Southeast Asia were increasingly oriented toward the Chinese Communist Party.34 The Communist Party seized upon the anti-Japanese sentiment and nationalism of the Nanyang Chinese in order to gain control of non-Communist organizations. For instance, the Singapore Chinese League, organized to resist Japanese aggression, was taken over by Communists.35 Elsewhere in Southeast Asia after 1937, the Communist presence was felt in the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Movement. The foregoing discussion of the KMT government relations with the Nanyang Hua-ch'iao communities reveals an extensive network that tied them both directly and indirectly to the fatherland. Although the KMT government's attempt to control every aspect of Nanyang Chinese communities was not always welcome,36 the revival of the KMT government's interest in the Nanyang Chinese was instrumental in increasing their nationalism and patriotism. As I will show, the anti-Japanese national salvation movement of 1937 needed no KMT prompting, a good indication that a sufficient national feeling for China already existed. As Professor Emerson once observed, the Nanyang Chinese were politically more conscious \"than their fellows in China itself. . . .\"37 The time was ripe; the national sentiment of the Chinese people everywhere in Southeast Asia was reaching a climax on the eve of the Sino-Japanese war, which broke out in the early morn\u00ad ing of July 7, 1937, at Marco Polo Bridge near Peking. The actors in\u00ad volved in the drama of the Chinese National Salvation Movement were 12 the KMT government and their overseas agents; Nanyang Chinese communities and their organizations (such as the press, schools, and functional associations), at the apex of which stood the Chinese Chamber of Commerce; the local government; and the Japanese. I shall examine not only actions, reactions, and inter-reactions of these actors in the drama but also the motives and behavior of Nanyang Chinese in the National Salvation Movement, the extent of KMT con\u00ad trol, and achievements of the Movement and its contributions to China. I chose the period from 1937 to 1941 for this study for several reasons. First, the Sino-Japanese war was a major incident of historical significance for China. It was a terminal point in Sino-Japanese rela\u00ad tions. It was also the first major war against Japan that Republican China fought with her back against the wall. China and her people for the first time appeared to be determined to fight the Japanese aggres\u00ad sor. Second, from 1937 to 1941, China fought single-handed against what appeared to be formidable odds. The war taxed her already meager financial resources. Remittances and contributions from over\u00ad seas Chinese compatriots had been always one of the Chinese govern\u00ad ment's principal sources of revenue. No sooner had the war erupted than the government appealed to Chinese communities around the globe for more generous contributions. A study of the Nanyang Chinese response to China's call for patriotism during this period will answer stereotyped charges that overseas Chinese are money-minded and apolitical animals. Third, the period covered in this study is unique also because numerous Nanyang Chinese associations forgot their differences and agreed to form a central coordinating body in order to organize a more effective national salvation and boycott move\u00ad ment. For four years they carried out the campaign persistently. What drove them to act as they did ? I hope to clarify the point in this study. Fourth, 1937 marked the beginning of the second KMT-Communist united front. I will attempt to analyze strategies by which the Com\u00ad munists infiltrated the National Salvation Movement, laying the foundation for the struggle of a Communist take-over. Finally, a statement on stages in the development of the National Salvation Movement is in order. The period between July, 1937, and October, 1938, can be called the first stage. During these months, the National Salvation Movement was never centrally directed. It was 13 directed by local leaders in various countries who showed no inclina\u00ad tion to form a central body that would coordinate such movements throughout Southeast Asia and express to the Chinese government the wishes of its Nanyang Chinese compatriots. The period from October, 1938, to December, 1941, was the second stage. After the Nanyang Chinese had organized the Nanyang Chinese Relief General Associa\u00ad tion, the National Salvation Movement became more methodical, giv\u00ad ing more emphasis to a systematic contribution and aid program. Dur\u00ad ing this stage, relations between the Chinese government and Nanyang Chinese communities became strained largely as a result of the govern\u00ad ment's excessive meddling and corruption. By late 1940 or the begin\u00ad ning of 1941, the National Salvation Movement appeared to have ceased to be effective. However, the outbreak of war in Southeast Asia in December, 1941, revived the Nanyang Chinese national salvation spirit. 14 Chapter I The Nanyang Chinese National Salvation Movement, First Phase (1937-1938) The Anti-Japanese National Salvation Movement of the Nanyang Hua-ch'iao which erupted in July, 1937, was the culmination of more than a quarter of a century of Chinese nationalism. In this campaign, devices and methods of the earlier anti-Japanese national salvation movements were employed and more effective tactics and strategies were added. The \"undeclared\" Sino-Japanese war generated an unprecedented wave of nationalism and patriotism among the Nanyang Hua-ch'iao. They held protest rallies against the Japanese aggression and in cable\u00ad grams to Chiang Kai-shek and his soldiers at the front declared their unswerving loyalty to the Nationalist government of China. At the same time, they passed boycott resolutions against Japanese goods and organized relief-fund associations. Thirst for war news was unquench\u00ad able and feelings against Japan ran high, not only in cities but also in remote villages. Chinese in Pontianak, Borneo, for instance, kept their ears glued to the radio for war news from Hong Kong and Nanking. Chinese language newspapers ferried from Singapore three times a week were in demand, and the circulation of even a local Dutch daily shot upward.1 In the Philippine Islands, resist-the-enemy committees sprang up in villages where there were as few as ten Chinese.2 In this resistance movement, the Chinese Nationalists (later as\u00ad sisted by the Communists) played a more prominent and far-reaching role than in previous anti-Japanese drives. The KMT government utilized all available means to extract every ounce of energy and every penny the Nanyang Chinese could contribute. The government dis\u00ad tributed reams of propaganda; increased both the power of trans\u00ad mitters beaming radio programs to Southeast Asia and the hours of transmission; sent out drama and music groups; and dispatched corps of boycott and picket leaders to organize clandestine anti-Japanese organizations with the assistance of local Chinese associations, par\u00ad ticularly Chinese Chambers of Commerce, secret societies, and Com\u00ad munist groups.3 15 Having evidence of the KMT's active role in the campaign and of increasing penetration by Communists under the guise of the united front, local authorities became ever more apprehensive of the politically- oriented Chinese. In the following pages, I shall examine the develop\u00ad ment of anti-Japanese activities country by country. The Straits Settlements and Malaya The Malayan-Chinese received the news of an exchange of shots between Japanese and Chinese troops near the Marco Polo Bridge with restraint despite inflammatory accounts in local Chinese newspapers. For ten days neither did the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Com\u00ad merce take a formal action on boycott nor did the Chinese Consul General at Singapore issue a statement to Chinese residents.4 On July 17, the Chamber of Commerce met to deliberate the boycott question but took no action.5 On the following night, at a meeting of leading Singapore Chinese, the Consul General, Kao Ling-pai, who enjoyed the confidence of Chiang Kai-shek, begged them to \"remain cool and not to boycott.\" Perhaps he counseled restraint because of the possi\u00ad bility of a peaceful settlement through negotiations.6 Both the Cham\u00ad ber of Commerce and the Consulate agreed that it was in their interest not to boycott Japanese goods while the situation was still in flux and while there was a chance for a cease-fire in north China; a common interest dictated prudence. Only three days after the Consul General's plea, however, the fighting in China increased, and hopes for an amicable settlement dimmed. It now appeared likely that the Marco Polo incident would develop into general hostilities.7 Some hot-tempered Chinese stoned Japanese school children and manhandled a Japanese fisherman on the streets of Singapore.8 These assaults were the impulsive acts of a few irresponsible persons, not part of an anti-Japanese campaign. Never\u00ad theless, after a few such incidents the British authorities issued a com\u00ad munique on July 24, enjoining both Japanese and Chinese residents to refrain from violence. The statement declared that the British govern\u00ad ment would observe a strictly neutral policy toward the two nation\u00ad alities and that \"it will not hesitate to exercise its authority against any\u00ad one who causes trouble.\" The government also asked both Japanese and Chinese publishers and editors to use special discretion and forbade 16 both groups to solicit contributions to relief funds or to remit to their respective countries funds for military purposes.9 July passed without violence and boycott; presumably Chinese leaders were still discussing what course to take in response to the changing war situation. Then, in the first week of August, they de\u00ad cided to boycott Japanese merchandise and issued a secret boycott directive to various associations. In Ipoh, Muar, Malacca, Penang, Port Swettenham, and Perak, Chinese coolies refused to handle a ship\u00ad ment of Japanese goods, and Chinese resolved not to buy Japanese- made bicycles. In Singapore, Japanese physicians, dentists, barbers, and merchants were beginning to feel the results of the passive resist\u00ad ance of the Chinese.10 These boycott symptoms became noticeable about August 12. Who prompted the Chinese to adopt the clandestine boycott resolution\u2014Chinese business leaders or the KMT government \u2014has not been determined. Circumstantial evidence seems to sup\u00ad port the argument that the KMT government urged Chinese com\u00ad munity leaders to stage a boycott and that the latter agreed to co\u00ad operate for patriotic reasons. It is known that the KMT government secretly dispatched Ch'en Han-ming to direct a press campaign against Japan and consequently the Chinese-owned Malayan Tribune changed its editorial policy from neutrality to support of the KMT regime.11 The fact that Consul General Kao, who had counseled against boy\u00ad cotting, remained silent when the boycott began lends more evidence to the argument that the KMT government had prompted it. A mem\u00ad ber of Chiang Kai-shek's trusted circle, he could not do otherwise. It does not mean, however, that all of the Chinese leaders, let alone the Chinese residents, accepted the order with enthusiasm, as we shall see. The deteriorating war situation roused the national spirit of the politically active Chinese. On August 15, the day the Japanese war planes bombed Wusung, Nanking, Hanchow, and Nanch'ang, Fukie- nese members of the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce met and formed the Singapore Chinese General Association for the Relief of Refugees in China, and Tan Kah Kee, a long-time prominent busi\u00ad nessman and the most active political leader of Chinese communities, became its president. It should be mentioned that Tan enjoyed an excellent personal relationship with Consul Kao and many KMT government high officials including the Generalissimo. Political and 17 personal interests of the Nanyang Chinese leaders and the KMT gov\u00ad ernment found a common ground, strengthened by an initial en\u00ad thusiasm for the struggling Chinese government. Nanyang Chinese nationalism, which had long existed and which the KMT government had cultivated, had begun to sprout. To circumvent the ban imposed by the British authorities, the As\u00ad sociation ostensibly collected contributions to help refugees and be\u00ad reaved families of the war dead. The Association assured the Colonial administration that the money collected would not be used for anti- Japanese activities or for China's military purposes. Nevertheless, British and Japanese officials were skeptical. The British official source was reportedly wary because it could not ascertain how the funds would be used once the money was out of the British territory. Jap\u00ad anese Consul General Gunji Kiichi was positive, as he reported to Tokyo, that the money would find its way into the war chest of the Chiang Kai-shek government,12 for the real purpose was to \"collect funds for the [national] salvation of China and to subscribe the Na\u00ad tional Salvation [War] Bonds.\"13 As the war turned to general hostilities, the boycott was sometimes enforced through intimidation. As in the past, the Hua-ch'iao were not without dissenters who, for various reasons, were unwilling to sup\u00ad port the KMT's boycott directive. Chinese merchants continued to sell Japanese bicycles, the only ones available. These recalcitrant merchants had to be forced to support the anti-Japanese movement. Intimidating letters signed by the Red Blood Brigade were passed to their stores. \"Do you have a conscience? Stop handling Japanese products im\u00ad mediately. Take this warning seriously,\" the circular reads, \"or you will be sorry.\"14 It is clear from this episode that the KMT, even with its network and with the sympathetic cooperation of the Chamber of Commerce, could not command one hundred per cent patriotism from the Chinese. In this case it was the economic interests of this par\u00ad ticular group of merchants that superseded patriotic commitment to the KMT government. Generally, however, the Chinese took the anti-Japanese campaign seriously. In mid-August, a representative of the Nanyo Kyo\\ai de\u00ad scribed the Chinese attitude toward the Japanese as \"extremely un\u00ad friendly.\"15 Their national sentiments were strong. The formation of 18 the General Association evoked enthusiastic support for their mother\u00ad land, the measure of which was indicated by the mushrooming of similar relief associations in cities throughout the Malayan peninsula. The Nanking government sought to take advantage of the surge of overseas Chinese nationalism by sending to Singapore a former Consul General of that city, Tiao Tso-ch'ien, to promote subscription to Ai- Kuo Bonds.16 Tiao's arrival coincided with a conference of the All Malay District (Fukien) Hua-ch'iao Relief Fund-Raising Associations in the city on October 6. The fact that the Fukienese Hua-ch'iao, led by Tan Kah Kee, held the meeting on the day Tiao visited Singapore indicated harmony between KMT government agents and the Fukie\u00ad nese Chinese group. The assembly voted to divide the entire peninsula into twelve districts and to establish a new information office for the dissemination of propaganda and the promotion of bond subscriptions. The office was headed by Tan Kah Kee, who assumed the chairman\u00ad ship of the entire fund-raising and anti-Japanese movement in Malaya.17 Another business magnate, Aw Boon Haw, a Hakka known in Malaya as the Tiger Balm King, organized his own fund-raising drive under the auspices of his daily newspaper, Sin Chew Jit Poh, and the Hakka Association.18 Evidently Fukien Chinese and the Hakka Chinese thought it unnecessary to unite in support of the Nationalist Chinese government. This apparent lack of coordination can be at\u00ad tributed partly to a long-standing rivalry between Tan Kah Kee and Aw Boon Haw and partly to the clannishness of the Chinese com\u00ad munity. Aw Boon Haw's reason for organizing his own fund-raising campaign is not clear. In the Japanese study of influential Nanyang Hua-ch'iao, Tan Kah Kee was described as \"the most prominent anti- Japanese leader,\" but Aw Boon Haw was classified as only \"a business leader\" and in one study as \"a pro-Japanese businessman,\" not one of the anti-Japanese leaders.19 Perhaps that is the reason that the Jap\u00ad anese military did not execute him after he was caught in Hong Kong and that the Japanese Ketnpeitai (gendarmerie) put a price on Tan Kah Kee, who hid in Malang, Java, during the Japanese occupation.20 Therefore, Aw Boon Haw's gesture appeared to be personal; he was conscious of his rival's patriotic activities. Aw Boon Haw's lukewarm political commitment or his disinclination to participate in political 19 activities explain the fact that he played no prominent role in the National Salvation Movement. Clannishness is one of the weaknesses of overseas Chinese communities which discourages complete unity,21 as will be seen in the organization of the Nanyang Chinese Relief General Association formed in October, 1938. Meanwhile, Chinese boycotting had become more intense and ex\u00ad tensive. In mid-October there were reports of more than forty instances of Chinese picketing to keep Chinese, Indians, and Eurasians not only from Japanese stores but also from Indian and Arabian shops which were selling Japanese goods.22 In Singapore, Penang, Ipoh, and other places, Chinese landowners evicted Japanese tenants, raised rents arbitrarily, or refused to rent houses to Japanese.23 The boycott quickly made its impact on the owners of small and middle-sized Japanese shops. They were soon requesting extensions from their creditors, and several Japanese shops in the cities were facing bankruptcy.24 The anti-Japanese boycott presented special difficulties to the British authorities, for while they could not encourage action against a country with which Britain was on friendly terms, they did not wish to appear pro-Japanese. The problem of the government was to keep the balance between the two communities and to refrain from giving Japan an ex\u00ad cuse for intervention in local affairs on the grounds of Chinese anti- Japanese activity. Therefore, in late November, the British Colonial Office banned the importation from China of textbooks considered anti-Japanese in content, prohibited Chinese pupils from singing anti- Japanese songs at school, and forbade Chinese residents to stage anti- Japanese demonstrations.25 These measures appear to have been prompted partly by the evidence of Communist infiltration into the Chinese National Salvation Move\u00ad ment. The Communists had gained steadily in Malaya since the formation of the KMT-Communist united front in December, 1936, when Chiang Kai-shek was kidnapped by Marshall Chang Hsiieh- liang and released at the intervention of the Communists. The forma\u00ad tion of the KMT-Communist united front \"had . . . repercussions in Malaya.\" The Communists changed the names of their various groups \"to suit the general anti-Japanese policy part; e.g., the General Labour Union now became the Labouring Classes Anti-Enemy-Backing-up Society.\"26 The Communists exploited the war between Japan and 20 China by bringing \"new recruits of their own\" to the Chinese General Association for the Relief of Refugees, the supreme organization of the National Salvation Movement in Singapore. In order to foster anti- Japanese feelings, the Communists formed two kinds of committees\u2014 one for open activities and the other for underground. To the former belonged the China Committee for the Eradication of Inferior (i.e., Japanese) Goods, the China Association for the Promotion of Chinese Goods, and the Chinese General Association for the Relief of Refu\u00ad gees.27 These organizations were created \"to attract anti-Communists and members of other party organizations who would not have joined had they been aware of any Communist influence.\"28 There were nu\u00ad merous Communist underground or front organizations which \"became responsible for recruiting Communists amongst [their] members \"29 They included the Labouring Classes Anti-Enemy-Backing-up Society, the Malaya Anti-Enemy and National Salvation Corps for the Eradica\u00ad tion of Traitors, the Chinese National Liberation Vanguard Corps, the Chinese National Reconstruction Corps, the Anti-Enemy Volunteers' Corps for the Eradication of Traitors, the Guerrilla Squad for the Eradication of Traitors, the Singapore Women's Classes Anti-Enemy- Backing-up Society, and the Singapore All Chinese Classes Anti-Enemy- Backing-up Society. All these illegal associations were controlled by the Malaya All Chinese Classes Anti-Enemy-Backing-up Society, which directed propaganda, contribution, traitor eradication, and boycott ac\u00ad tivities of its affiliated organizations.30 The Colonial police authorities had become increasingly sensitive to the rise of Communist influence in the National Salvation Movement. They arrested some members of the Chinese National Liberation Vanguard Corps as soon as it was identified as a Communist front organization.81 Japanese victories on the Chinese mainland, meanwhile, sharpened the edge of Chinese national feelings against the Japanese. In early December, when the fall of Nanking was imminent, anti-Japanese activities became more pronounced and widespread.32 During the week of December 13, when military operations against Nanking were at their height, one thousand Chinese coolies employed by the Ishihara Mining Company in Johore quit their jobs. As a result, the mining operation was paralyzed. Another mass walkout was reported at a Japanese-owned manganese mine in Trengganu.83 Terrorists frightened 21 Chinese merchants who had placed Chinese labels on Japanese articles or sold them under the table. They cut off the ear of a Chinese mer\u00ad chant in Malacca and wrote threatening letters to many merchants. Similar terrorism occurred in Singapore when a Chinese fishmonger attempted to sell fish caught by Japanese fishermen. Some shops were smeared with filth because they dealt in Japanese merchandise.34 The outbreak of such labor strikes and terrorism was the direct result of a new policy that the Communists had adopted; they were responsible for organizing strikes and intimidation campaigns as well as demon\u00ad strations.35 A more ominous sign of Communist penetration of the Chinese National Salvation Movement was the Party's apparent readiness to play a commanding role in the Chinese anti-Japanese and anti-im- peralist movement. As one Japanese observer saw it, although the British authorities were very firm in restricting Chinese anti-Japanese activities, they were soft in controlling Chinese economic protestation. The Communists, according to this interpretation, had concluded that the lukewarm British policy toward the Chinese derived in part from Britain's sympathy with China and from her fear of Japan's economic encroachment upon Britain's Southeast Asian market.36 Be that as it may, the first clear evidence of successful infiltration was a Communist- inspired demonstration in Singapore on New Year's Day of 1938. Waving Chinese flags, chanting anti-Japanese songs, and distributing handbills printed with Communist slogans and signed by the Chinese National Liberation Vanguard Corps, several hundred Chinese marched through the streets toward a Japanese school where pupils were en\u00ad gaged in a New Year's Day ceremony. A clash with the Japanese was averted only by police action, which dispersed the demonstrators be\u00ad fore they reached their destination.37 A second anti-Japanese demonstration organized by the Com\u00ad munists took place several days later when Sun Fo, the president of the Legislative Yuan of the Chinese Nationalist government, visited Singapore on his way to Europe. He stirred up the feelings of the Chinese residents with his ringing messages, and those who came to the pier to bid him bon voyage on January 6 were in volatile spirits. As they turned homeward, six trucks pulled up in front of the building of the Chinese Consulate General near the pier. Out stepped a large 22 number of Chinese and a few Indians who began to distribute anti- Japanese and Communist handouts to the well-wishers. They soon formed the milling Chinese into a demonstration, and the crowd marched through the streets, waving pennants inscribed with anti- Japanese slogans in Chinese, English, and Hindi. The Police Commis\u00ad sioner ordered the demonstrators to disperse, and the police arrested a number of the Chinese and Indians who were distributing the litera\u00ad ture. A mob of Chinese, however, returned that evening to the central police headquarters and demanded the release of the persons who had been arrested. When the constables refused, a brawl broke out; when it ended at midnight, 155 Chinese and one Indian had been arrested.38 Three days later the British authorities responded to the disorderly Chinese mob by banning all parades and meetings on the street, unless a special permit was obtained from the Office of the Police Com\u00ad missioner. On January 11, the police raided several Chinese under\u00ad ground associations, including a printing shop controlled by the Chinese National Liberation Vanguard Corps. The raiding squads arrested three Chinese on charges of illegal activities and confiscated a volume of anti-Japanese and Communist propaganda literature.39 The riotous behavior, which resulted in a number of arrests and some bloodshed, dismayed KMT officials and the leaders of the Chinese community. The Association of the Fukienese Chinese, the Association of the Cantonese Chinese, the Chinese Chamber of Commerce, and the General Association for the Relief of Refugees all issued statements of regret, blaming for the riots a group of extremists who were trying deliberately to alienate China and Britain. Speaking for the entire Chinese community, Consul General Kao denounced the instigators as unpatriotic persons who \"were attempting to disgrace the good name of the Chinese community, and their aim was to drive a wedge into relationship between the Colonial government and the Chinese.\"40 Strangely he did not refer to the Communists, whose role in the two recent agitations had been quite obvious, for the Communists and other left-wing underground groups that had planned, organized, and in\u00ad cited the mob were directly or indirectly connected with the very per\u00ad sons or organizations that had expressed the regret. For instance, the Malaya Anti-Enemy and National Salvation Corps for the Eradication of Traitors had been founded at the direction of Consul General Kao,41 23 and Tan Kah Kee and other prominent leaders, as already noted, maintained ties with clandestine KMT and Communist organizations. It seems that the anti-Japanese leaders had underestimated the hitherto moderate attitude of the British authorities, mistaking it for their sympathy to China. When the British administration responded with firmness, the KMT officials and Chinese leaders tried to absolve them\u00ad selves from responsibility for the mob violence by placing the blame upon faceless \"undesirable and extreme elements.\" These two incidents also reveal the fictitious reality of the KMT-Communist united front in action. The Communists were vying with the KMT for the control of the Chinese in the National Salvation Movement and were prepared to cooperate with the KMT only when they could advance the cause of the Communist Party; they were not to help strengthen the KMT but to embarrass and weaken it. The KMT, therefore, had a dual problem: how to deal with the Chinese community leaders to get their maximum cooperation, if not control of them, and how to cope with Communist subversion. After the January incident, the British authorities were prepared to take whatever measures were necessary to contain the outburst of Chi\u00ad nese national feelings and to halt increasing Communist activities. That Communist influence was still on the rise was evident in the resolutions adopted by the Assembly for the Support of International Peace spon\u00ad sored by the Chinese Chamber of Commerce.42 Such slogans as \"Get Rid of Trotskyites,\" \"Destroy Japanese Fascists,\" \"Liberate the Chinese and \"Boycott Japanese Goods\" were indic\u00ad ative that Communist influence and penetration were real. The Chinese were not daunted by the government's stern measures, though. Their anti-Japanese operation was executed by the \"Ssu-fan,\" which had been used in the Tsinan incident boycott in 1928. This punish\u00ad ment of recalcitrant members of a guild association, characteristic of the power of the Chinese guild over its members, \"rested upon the doctrine of responsibility which was highly developed in traditional China.\"43 The severity of the punishment increased as offenders re\u00ad peated the violation of boycott rules or persisted in conduct unaccepta\u00ad ble to the guild. The first offense was punished by fine, chastisement, or obligatory public apology; the second by smearing the offender's store with coal tar, filth, or human excrement; the third by ear-cutting; 24 and the fourth by death. The third and the fourth were designed to extort money from non-cooperative members, and the forced con\u00ad tributions were put into the war chest of the Chinese government.44 During 1938, it was reported that countless Chinese received the first warning, about six hundred stores were smeared, twenty-five persons had their ears slashed, and thirty persons were murdered throughout Malaya.45 Moreover, members of the Malaya Anti-Enemy and Na\u00ad tional Salvation Corps still kept vigilance over Japanese stores and physicians to prevent Chinese patronage despite warnings issued by the British authorities.46 An alarming degree of Communist infiltra\u00ad tion into the Chinese National Salvation Movement appeared to be the reason for another ordinance issued by the Colonial government on March 4, which forbade the Chinese to hold meetings, parades, or musical concerts in the street. The decree gave power to constables to break up unauthorized gatherings and parades and provided for criminal prosecution of violators.47 The stiffened British policy was demonstrated by the swift arrest on April 30 of seventy-three left- wing Chinese coolies and laborers who were holding an unauthorized meeting to plan a May Day demonstration against the Japanese.48 Rather than weakening the national spirit of the Chinese, the British police action and a stream of discouraging war news from China invigorated it. In the early summer of 1938, the Japanese troops captured Amoy, the home of the Nanyang Hua-ch'iao, and their air\u00ad planes bombed Canton, Swatow, and Hainan Island. The news stirred up new Chinese hostility toward the Japanese. On June 5 and 25, large numbers of Chinese, mostly Hainanese, staged anti-Japanese demon\u00ad strations in Singapore and the peninsula in defiance of the British or\u00ad dinance. Constables in Singapore arrested scores of the demonstrators, who waved Chinese flags and chanted anti-Japanese songs.49 Anti- Japanese feelings were also high in Penang, Malacca, and Kedah, where Japanese doctors, barbers, and laundrymen had been systematically boycotted, and the Japanese were braced for worse in the months to come.50 The emotions of the Chinese were growing more intense as the first anniversary of the Sino-Japanese war approached, and the atmosphere throughout the British territories was one of fear that something would happen at the slightest provocation. The fears became reality on July 3, when a riot broke out in 25 Penang.51 The Penang revolt was touched off when pickets caught a Chinese secretly purchasing soy beans from Japanese-controlled Man\u00ad churia. The discovery brought a mob of several hundred persons to the hapless man's store, which they ransacked and destroyed, dumping twenty bags of soy beans into the street. The outrage of the local Chinese was transformed into violence as night advanced. By the fol\u00ad lowing morning, a reign of terror and near anarchy had gripped the city. Chinese stores whose owners had been suspected of having dealt in Japanese merchandise were plundered by mobs, and goods were in\u00ad discriminately destroyed in a rain of rocks, stones, coal tar, and sul\u00ad phuric acid. The defiant crowd attacked police contingents dispatched to quell it, and appeals from the Chinese consul in Penang to restore order fell upon deaf ears. The pillage continued throughout July 4 and 5, and a number of stores and factories were set afire. Finally the British authorities sent a small force of troops to assist the policemen in coping with the \"anarchic\" situation. Four days of strict law enforce\u00ad ment brought the riot under control and resulted in the arrest of eighty insurrectionists. Throughout Malaya the approach of July 7, the anniversary of the Sino-Japanese war, threw the Japanese community into near panic. Anticipating Chinese violence, the Japanese community leaders alerted all Japanese residents and closed Japanese schools to protect the children. The Singapore police headquarters, at the request of Japa\u00ad nese officials, reinforced police patrol for an emergency.52 To the great relief of everyone, the Double Seven anniversary passed without a serious incident in Singapore, Johore Bahru, Kuala Lumpur, or Serem- ban. In Singapore a few members of the Liberation Vanguard Corps distributed Communist leaflets but without effect, and in Taiping a half-dozen Chinese terrorists broke into a Chinese shop suspected of having purchased Japanese goods.53 The Penang riot stunned the Chinese leaders in Singapore. Im\u00ad mediately upon receipt of the news, Tan Kah Kee convened a meeting on July 7 to see what could be salvaged from the incident, which he said marred \"friendly relations between Britain and China.\" The patriarch appealed to all Chinese, particularly students and youths, to be more prudent or they would make the Chinese \"a laughing stock.\" In his admonition, Tan painfully pointed out the importance of main- 26 taining cordial relations with Britain, without whose aid China could \"not keep the war of resistance going....\" \"The patriotic Hua-ch'iao,\" he reminded his compatriots, \"must bear this fact in mind.\"54 This statement is of interest in view of the fact that his memoirs, from which it is quoted, were written in 1946, by which time he is known to have been leaning towards Communism. By deliberate omission, Tan did not mention the active role of the Leftists and Communists in many anti-Japanese activities. A week after the Double Seven anniversary day, the British authori\u00ad ties issued a communique aimed at the Chinese. The statement bluntly warned them that the government would henceforth deal sternly with those who organized and incited riots under the pretext of a patriotic movement.55 The terse and straightforward enunciation of the policy had a moderating effect on the Chinese for the time being. No serious incident occurred for the next four weeks, though several minor in\u00ad cidents, such as defacing stores with coal tar and slashing of ears, were reported in the last two weeks of July.56 The outward appearance of calm did not last long, however. On August 17, the Colonial govern\u00ad ment announced the arrest of the Wang Yen-chih, a cadre of the secret Anti-Enemy Volunteers' Corps for the Eradication of Traitors, and Chan Wen-hua, general director of the Malaya All Chinese Classes Anti-Enemy-Backing-up Society, on the charge of Communist activity.57 The next few days witnessed protest demonstrations and sympathy strikes, which spread to Kuala Lumpur, Ipoh, and Penang. The per\u00ad sistent Chinese agitation not only endangered Britain's relations with Japan, which Britain was anxious to maintain in peace, but also irritated the British. The Singapore police force consequently cracked down on both registered and unregistered Chinese societies; the police arrested twenty-two terrorist members of secret societies, ordered the dissolution of the Youth Le-hsin she on the grounds that it had participated in political activities, and issued a warning to eighteen registered Chinese associations for having actively engaged in the anti-Japanese move\u00ad ment.58 Not only did the Chinese exhibit their support for China's fighting cause in the boycott movement, but they also donated a considerable amount of money to the government of Chiang Kai-shek. Money was raised by various methods characteristic of the Chinese. It is instructive 27 to examine the ways funds were collected in order to see the extent of the control of the guild over its members and to see reactions of the Chinese to the campaign. Upon the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese incident, Chinese in Malaya spontaneously raised funds for the relief of their compatriots in China. Donations to China were systematized by the formation of the Singapore Chinese General Association for the Relief of Refugees in China on August 15. In October, similar associations were also established in Malacca, co\u00ad ordinate the operation of the fund-raising drive, the Information Office of the Federation of Malaya Chinese Relief Fund Raising As\u00ad sociation was established within the office of the l-ho-hsiian Club, one of the command posts of the Chinese anti-Japanese campaign.59 The Information Office was merged with the Malay Office of the Nanyang Chinese Relief General Association when the latter organization was set up in October, 1938. Tan Kah Kee served concurrently as chair\u00ad man of the Malay Office and its mother organization. In short, he was general chairman of the money-raising operation throughout Southeast Asia. A study of the Singapore Association, prototype of the fund-raising organization, shows how the system worked.60 The Singapore Associa\u00ad tion was headed by Tan Kah Kee, assisted by vice-chairman Lee Kong Chian, chairman of the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Tan Kah Kee's son-in-law. The thirteen members of the stand\u00ad ing committee were elected by a committee of thirty-one persons who represented the city's guild associations. Of the thirteen, according to Japanese intelligence studies, five were definitely identified as very active in the anti-Japanese movement.61 Tan Kah Kee was in charge of the Association's two most important committees, the committee for bond solicitation and the committee for contributions. The Association almost arbitrarily alloted a quota for bond subscriptions to member organizations and wealthy individuals, and it devised a method for the efficient collection of money as well as a monthly contribution system. For their operation, an influential person was selected for each speech pang (group) and charged with the responsibility of raising funds in his pang. He, in turn, formed a committee and supervised its fund- 28 raising within the pang, which was scattered throughout the city. No Chinese could possibly escape the network of the fund-raising machin\u00ad ery, for the Association had an office in each district of the city. Within each office were sub-offices set up for professional guilds, such as those of seamen, railway workers, retail businessmen, and workers employed by foreign firms. These sub-offices were further split into smaller units according to speech pangs (Fukienese, Cantonese, Hakka, Teochiu, and Hainanese) and other groups, such as women and Babas (local born Chinese). Since the British authorities restricted fund-raising to collecting for relief, the Association was unable to conduct other anti-Japanese ac\u00ad tivities such as propaganda, boycott and use-Chinese-goods drives, help native-provinces drives, and fund raising for airplanes and soldiers. These campaigns were run by the Chinese Aviation Society's Malay Office (Consul General Kao was its chairman), the Chinese Women's Association for Comforting Fighting Soldiers (Mme. Kao was its chairman), and other groups with whom the Association maintained close ties. Contributions to China's war chest were raised by a wide variety of means besides regular monthly donations. The most common were special contributions on important national holidays, ostensibly for the relief of victims of natural calamities; import duties and surtax on items purchased overseas;62 extra donations on memorial days (the Chinese New Year, the anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's death, the anni\u00ad versary of the Huang Hua Kang Revolt, the May 9th National Humilia\u00ad tion Day, the Marco Polo Bridge Incident on July 7, Resistance Day on August 13, Manchurian Incident Day on September 18, the Double Ten National Holiday, Chiang Kai-shek's birthday on October 30, Sun Yat-sen's birthday on November 12, and the Yunnan Revolt Day on December 25); flower and medallion sales on these memorial days; proceeds of drama and stage shows; campaigns for curtailing temple worship expenses; and the setting up of donation boxes in public places. Between August, 1937, and August, 1938, the Malayan Chinese collected 19,900,000 yuan, of which 5,700,000 yuan was credited to Chinese in Singapore, according to a Chinese source.63 In order to institute a monthly contribution system so as to insure a flow of money into the Chinese government treasury, the Singapore 29 Chinese General Association for the Relief of Refugees, at the request of the KMT government, drew up new regulations, effective on May 1, 1938. Singapore was divided into six pangs, and contribution solicitors collected donations according to a check list prepared by the Associa\u00ad tion. The solicitors would secure signatures of donors and also report for newspaper publication the names of persons who refused to sub\u00ad scribe the quota. A monthly quota assigned to factories, firms, shops, and banks was classified into thirteen categories according to ability to pay. For the special category there was no ceiling; for the first, the quota was five hundred yuan and for the twelfth, five yuan. A quota of one-hundredth of their monthly income was prescribed for shop clerks, blue-collar workers, and free workers. Such arbitrary quota allocation infuriated many Chinese. The bond subscription campaign was conducted in the same methodical fashion, and the Malayan Chinese bought bonds worth 12,800,000 yuan; of that amount, the Singapore Chinese accounted for 4,550,000 yuan between August, 1937, and August, 1938.64 However, these contributions and subscriptions were reported to be unsatisfactory to Tan Kah Kee. Figures for contributions raised by the Chinese Aviation Society and the Chinese Women's Association for Comfort\u00ad ing Fighting Soldiers were not available. Tan Kah Kee reported that the latter organization had involved itself in a factional strife with the Women's Affairs Section of the Singapore Chinese General Associa\u00ad tion for the Relief of Refugees, with the consequence that Mme. Kao's association managed to raise only a few hundred thousand yuan.65 Japanese sources admitted that the response to these contribution devices was lively, particularly in the early months of the war.66 The fervor, however, began to subside partly because of resentment against the arbitrariness with which the quotas were alloted and the moneys collected and partly because of a drop in the prices of rubber, copra, and tin. The new regulations for monthly donations appeared to be extortion in disguise. Chinese had two choices: to give or to refuse and have their names published in newspapers. As a result, many Chinese aired their protests in newspapers, charging that the Associa\u00ad tion acted \"as if it had granted an authority to the KMT government to tax Malayan Chinese.\"67 In the midst of the uproar, Tan Kah Kee re\u00ad signed as chairman of the Committee for Bond Subscriptions without 30 an explanation, raising speculation that contributions in the first quarter of 1938 had not been satisfactory, that he had resigned in order to end criticism directed at him for introducing the new monthly giv\u00ad ing regulations, or that he had quit because within the committee there was constant factional strife between the Fukienese and the Can\u00ad tonese.68 The Chinese National Salvation Movement in the British territories became the model for anti-Japanese campaigns in other Southeast Asian countries. For this reason I have described in detail its activities in order to illustrate the extent to which the Chinese reacted to the aggressive action of the Japanese on the Chinese mainland. The fore\u00ad going discussion shows the manifestation of their intense feelings. Its scale and dimensions were unprecedented. Chinese throughout the British possessions were kindled by the flame of national spirit to obstruct Japan's economic activities in Malaya and to back up the Nationalist government of China. Methods used in the campaign had changed little, but the KMT was participating actively, both openly and in secret. To the British a sign more ominous than active KMT involvement was the evidence that the Communists had successfully infiltrated the movement. Many factors contributed to this enthusiastic response of the Malayan Chinese: (1) the demographic distribution of the Chinese, who constituted 41 per cent of Malaya's total population, and the presence of a large number of Hainanese, who were susceptible to leftist propaganda because of their low social status; (2) the steadily deteriorating war situation in China and the spread of the hostilities to South China, with which the Chinese had strong emotional ties; (3) the Hua-ch'iao's realization that a threat to China was a threat to them;69 and (4) the existence of good working relations between the KMT government and local Chinese groups, especially the Chinese Chambers of Commerce, based on common interests and objectives. That is not to say that the Chinese National Salvation Movement was free from problems of boycott enforcement and coordination and factionalism. The fact that members of the Red Blood Brigade and other terroristic societies had to be recruited and the Ssu-fan frequently employed for intimidation in order to enforce the boycott upon reluc\u00ad tant Chinese suggests neither total KMT control of the Chinese com\u00ad munity through local agencies nor total loyalty to the Chinese govern- 31 ment. Indeed, KMT guidelines for the movement aroused resentment among Chinese who did not want to be compelled to contribute. Small merchants, for economic reasons, although appearing to follow the boycott movement for fear of reprisal, traded under the table with the Japanese or paid boycott enforcement agents to overlook their dealings in Japanese goods. The boycott put them in an uncomfortable position; KMT agents and the local Chinese hierarchy urged them to boycott, and British authorities urged them not to boycott. Either choice meant economic privation. Chinese more interested in money than in politics chose the middle ground so as to maintain their facade of boycott cooperation and, at the same time, sustain their business and livelihood. Because of their limited capital, they could not afford to close their businesses regardless of nationalism's demand for their sacrifice. The KMT-Communist united front produced little coordination in the movement. The Communists competed with the KMT for in\u00ad fluence and leadership. Their revolutionary leadership in the January and July affairs aroused British suspicion about the intent of the KMT- led National Salvation Movement, making it more difficult to carry out anti-Japanese activities. The Communists tried to embarrass the KMT, while appearing to work with it when cooperation would en\u00ad hance their own position. Another serious problem in the movement was that of factionalism. Rivalry between Tan Kah Kee and Aw Boon Haw, between the Fukienese and the Cantonese, and between individuals for reasons of personal enmity and business competition weakened the effectiveness of the National Salvation Movement. The Hua-ch'iao community was not a cohesive society; it had too many groups with varied in\u00ad terests. Even a national crisis, the Sino-Japanese war, did not bring them into total unity. Although British policy toward the Chinese National Salvation Movement became more and more stringent because terrorism fre\u00ad quently accompanied the movement,70 it should not be considered anti-Chinese. Britain's position is not difficult to appreciate. She was obliged to maintain law and order in Malaya's multi-racial society and could not permit the Chinese to disrupt the racial peace simply be\u00ad cause they regarded Japan's policy as obnoxious. Britain was not at 32 war with Japan; and because she wished to maintain good relations with China, she was anxious to avoid diplomatic complications which would give Japan an excuse to interfere in local affairs. Moreover, the British police knew that Communists, under the cloak of the KMT- Communist united front, were using the National Salvation Move\u00ad ment to infiltrate labor unions. These appear to be the motives behind Britain's attempt to contain the Chinese National Salvation Movement. The number of arrests and fines imposed upon Chinese in the first twelve months after the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese war suggests the severity of the British authorities. A conservative estimate was 37 persons arrested, 122 fined and 18 imprisoned.71 The Dutch East Indies The initial response of the Indies-Chinese in Java to the Marco Polo Bridge incident, unlike that of Chinese in British territories, was described by both official and unofficial local Japanese sources as \"calm,\" \"passive,\" and \"restrained.\"72 There was no sign of a boycott movement throughout July, and even in late August there was relative calm. Nowhere were there signs of a boycott in the other outer islands of the Indies. Reports from Palembang and Medan in and Ampenan in Lombok suggested that the Chinese were not ready to stage a boycott movement. Only Pontianak in Bor\u00ad neo and Tandjoeongbalai in Sumatra, where Cantonese were numerous, reported that Chinese national spirit was high and that Chinese resi\u00ad dents in these cities had started an unorganized boycott drive.78 Na\u00ad tional spirit was high in both cities because of regular boat service between them and Singapore, large numbers of Chinese (70 per cent of Pontianak's population and 50 per cent of Tandjoeongbalai's), and Chinese economic dominance. The Cantonese were predominantly lower-class laborers, and 40 per cent of them were Sin\\heh (China- born Chinese). The Cantonese were also strong in journalism and education; therefore, they were susceptible to political events in China.74 Only after the Sino-Japanese hostilities spread to central and southern China did Chinese enthusiasm for the National Salvation Movement begin to gather widespread strength. However, it was 33 directed towards a contribution campaign, not a boycott drive, about which the Chinese were undecided. On August 2, the Chinese leaders of Batavia organized a Batavia Hua-ch'iao Charity Committee for the Relief of China and resolved to carry out an anti-Japanese program. Tjong See-gan, a Fukienese and a member of the KMT Legislative Yuan, became its first chairman. Stimulated by the example of the Batavian Chinese, the Chinese in other cities in Java and the outer islands set up similar committees. The Charity Committee was divided into sub-committees, each re\u00ad sponsible for copra donation, contribution boxes, monthly savings, jewel contribution, drama and stage shows, frugality campaigns, athletics, and women's affairs. The Batavia Charity Committee, in cooperation with the city's Chinese Chamber of Commerce, for ex\u00ad ample, sponsored a night market and raised 20,000 guilders, and en\u00ad couraged rice merchants to contribute two cents for every one hundred kilos of rice they traded. In these ways, the Committee was able to collect 1.4 million guilders by October, 1938.75 Following the example of the Malayan-Chinese, the Charity Com\u00ad mittee solicited extra donations on national holidays and memorial days and small contributions from school children by placing donation boxes in Chinese associations and schools. In response to the KMT government guideline, the Charity Committee instituted the monthly contribution program beginning in May, 1938. In Batavia the opera\u00ad tion yielded more than 130,000 guilders by the end of 1938. In the donation drives, the Charity Committee emphasized the collection of medicine, especially quinine, a Dutch East Indies product. In Sep\u00ad tember, the Charity Committee sent 17,000 guilders' worth of quinine, and by the end of 1937, it had sent 120,000 guilders' worth.76 Accord\u00ad ing to an official Chinese source, by the end of 1937, all the Indies- Chinese had sent quinine to a customs value of one million dollars.77 At the request of the KMT government the Charity Committee launched the bond subscription campaign in September, 1937. The campaign required a bit of ingenuity to circumvent a Dutch govern\u00ad ment ban on newspaper advertisement for bond subscription. The Committee followed the chain letter system, a practice employed by the Chinese on the mainland to solicit subscriptions during the Man- churian incident. Although the principle was that of the usual chain 34 letter, this letter came from a friend, not a stranger, and directed the recipient to buy war bonds, not to send money. A typical letter read as follows: In order to achieve objectives of the National Salvation Movement, you who re\u00ad ceive this letter must buy more than five guilders of National War Bonds. You must faithfully carry out this request and write nine letters to your trusted friends. Should you fail to execute these within the next twenty-four hours, a misfortune may fall upon you. The person receiving this letter would buy bonds and report to the Charity Committee his having received the letter and bought bonds. This clever method of subscription to outwit the government was said to be particularly successful in Batavia and Surabaya. The Charity Committee was able to report that the Chinese in Java had subscribed more than 1.25 million guilders by September, 1938.78 Although the Chinese undertook these contribution campaigns, they hesitated to launch an organized boycott. Not until September did the Overseas Chinese Bank in Batavia, the only bank in the Indies authorized to transact foreign exchange, issue a policy statement that it would henceforth cease to correspond with Japanese banks.79 Some wealthy Chinese in Surabaya were reported to have been withdrawing their savings from Japanese banks and either transferring them to Chinese banks or sending them to Singapore.80 A few incidents of coaltarring Chinese shops specializing in Japanese merchandise oc\u00ad curred in October, apparently provoked by Japanese bombings of southern China.81 Meanwhile, the Dutch authorities had been enforcing very strict strike laws upon the Chinese and prohibiting political activity. Al\u00ad ready, some Chinese language newspapers had been either warned or suspended temporarily for having printed articles derogatory to Japan, and teachers were kept under close surveillance. Teachers who per\u00ad sisted in teaching anti-Japanese lessons were expelled from the territory as persona non grata. Immigration officials had been maintaining tight security to prevent the entry of KMT agents and other agitators who might slip in from the British territories. Furthermore, the Dutch government prohibited all forms of contribution except to the Red Cross Society and to charity, censored movies relating to the Sino-Japa- nese war, and banned the import of anti-Japanese texts and books, a 35 list of which was published in an official bulletin. Whenever intimida\u00ad tions of Japanese residents were reported, the police made a thorough search to ensure the protection of Japanese lives and property.82 These steps were consistent with the past Dutch policy toward the Chinese, whose political movements had long been a matter of grave concern to the colonial administration; the Dutch feared that the politically oriented National Salvation Movement might arouse the forces of an indigenous nationalist movement. Despite this firm Dutch policy, the Chinese finally resolved to boy\u00ad cott Japanese goods in the second week of October, shortly after the puasa, a Moslem religious month for fasting, when their warehouses and stores were well stocked with Japanese merchandise. On October 12, the Chinese Importers' Association of the Netherlands Indies adopted boycott resolutions to \"cancel all existing import contracts with Japan\" and to \"purchase Chinese products.\" It was not yet, however, an all-out boycott. The Association, for instance, permitted its members to sell Japanese merchandise on hand, to honor import contracts which were \"difficult to cancel,\" and to conclude by November 21 import contracts with the Japanese.83 Leaders of the Association were ap\u00ad parently mindful of the stern attitude of the Dutch government toward boycott and were also aware of the disadvantages of severing business relations with the Japanese. Japanese sources interpreted these rather mild boycott resolutions as a sign of Chinese economic weakness and vulnerability. \"Chinese merchants in Java,\" said Arimoto Takeshi, manager of the Bank of Taiwan at Surabaya, \"agreed not to buy Japa\u00ad nese goods, because they had a surplus of Japanese merchandise in stock that they had imported during prosperous months in the spring of 1937. In order to clear the accumulated goods, a majority of Chinese merchants decided to refrain from buying Japanese products.\"84 Arimoto's statement implies that the boycott was a business expedient, not a deterrent, to Chinese merchants; once they had sold their surplus stocks of Japanese goods, they would buy more. If direct dealing with Japanese importers proved risky, they would buy from Dutch whole\u00ad salers.85 According to another observer, the Chinese launched the boycott after the puasa, not before it, because Japanese goods were in demand during the Islamic religious month. The merchants waited until they had stocked a supply of Japanese products. That observation 36 emphasizes the economic expediency of the boycott.86 The point of the second observer is that this boycott was a self-centered movement cal\u00ad culated solely by dollar-and-cent economic motives. Such interpreta\u00ad tions are debatable. Judging from the past record of boycotts in the Dutch Indies, it is possible to argue for the Japanese contention. To accept it wholly, however, is a gross exaggeration of the so-called busi- ness-as-a-matter-of-life mentality of the overseas Chinese. Indeed, many Japanese observers minimized Chinese political consciousness and nationalism.87 Perhaps the Chinese boycott was a token to save face under pressures of the KMT government. The KMT could exert pressure on the Chinese leaders but could not force them to an all-out boycott in which Chinese merchants would risk the economic positions that they had laboriously built. If this interpretation, which statistical evidence supports, is correct, the Chinese community and the KMT government did not agree on the boycott question, although they seemed to agree on the contribution campaign. The Chinese found it difficult to maintain an effective boycott in the Netherlands Indies, partly because of the vigorous repressive policy of the colonial authorities, partly because of a sluggish economy, and partly because of their selfish economic interests. As Arimoto observed, Chinese merchants were reported, with increasing frequency, to be dealing with Japanese firms either clandestinely or through a Dutch intermediary. For instance, in Batavia the Association of Chinese Cotton Cloth Merchants resolved to effect a voluntary boycott of Japanese cotton products on December 13, the day Nanking fell into Japanese hands. The resolutions contained such stringent provisions against buying Japanese cotton goods that members could not buy them from either the Japanese or Dutch and Indian merchants. It was obviously an attempt to plug loopholes which permitted merchants to continue to buy Japanese cotton goods. A week after the fall of Nan\u00ad king, Chinese retail merchants declared their readiness to suspend deal\u00ad ing in Japanese merchandise. All these aroused national feelings, however, began to cool as the Indies' export trade stagnated and pur\u00ad chasing power declined. Many Chinese wholesale cotton merchants in the city had stocks of Japanese cotton products which they could not sell. Consequently, in February, 1938, the Chinese merchants retracted their boycott declaration in order to clear their stock. 37 On the other hand, Chinese merchants continued to boycott other Japanese goods, which became more and more scarce in early summer. Unable to make their living as a result of the five-month old boycott, Chinese wholesale and retail businessmen got Japanese merchandise either from European firms or directly from Japanese companies and replaced Japanese labels with European. Economic necessity forced the Chinese to deal secretly in Japanese goods despite pressure from the KMT. A KMT sponsored Sino-Japanese incident anniversary rally on July 7, at which Consul General Ko Tsu-k'uang spoke, did not evoke an upsurge of patriotism in the Chinese audience.88 At Cheribon, Bandoeng, and Serang in western Java, there were no serious boycotts, and the National Salvation Movement confined it\u00ad self to the fund raising campaign. Even when Amoy fell to the Japa\u00ad nese in May, 1938, the predominantly Amoy Fukienese Chinese in Bandoeng were not particularly agitated by the news.89 The Chinese boycott in the Jogja-Solo area and Semarang was also reported mild. However, the boycott against Japanese shops was effective enough to compel local business leaders like the Lie Ngo An family, Lie Kiem Tjoan, and Kwee Bok Ai, who were known to be sympathetic toward the Japanese, to avoid doing business with them for fear of reprisal. In Semarang, the 27,000 Chinese, eighty per cent of whom were Babas, maintained relative calm in the boycott movement until the Cantonese Sin\\heh agitated for boycotting. The Sinkheh, many of whom were intellectuals (teachers and journalists) and skilled tradesmen (carpen\u00ad ters, hardware shop owners, accountants, restaurant owners, and cooks), dragged the apathetic Fukienese-Babas into the struggle. There were several coal-tarring incidents and the bankruptcy of a Japanese shop in the early months of the campaign, but after April or May, 1938, even the intimidation of the Cantonese could not deter the Chinese from doing business with the Japanese. Japanese sources were optimistic about business in Semarang.90 Like most of the Chinese in Bandoeng, the Chinese in Semarang were Babas of the third and even the fourth generation, whom the Cantonese looked down on as \"having lost their 'Chineseness.'\" They were Indonesians first and Chinese second; to them, events in China were more remote than to the Cantonese Sinkheh. They had little reason to support Chinese nationalism; they regarded the Dutch Indies 38 as their homeland and spoke Indonesian and Dutch more fluently than Chinese. Having been educated in Dutch government schools, many had become \"Dutch minded.\"91 This is not to belittle the patriotism of the Fukienese, who constituted over 90 per cent of all Chinese born in Indonesia. Thio Thiam Tjong, a Baba-Fukienese leader of Semarang, deserves mention. He took a major part in the National Salvation Movement, raising funds and giving moral support to the KMT government. When the Japanese occupied Semarang, the Japa\u00ad nese Kempeitai imprisoned him and demanded that he divulge \"in\u00ad formation about others connected with China aid funds. . . .\" Even the Kempeitai's torture did not break his strong will, and he took \"full responsibility\" for the anti-Japanese movement.92 In Surabaya, where there were 40,000 Chinese, boycott effects on Japanese trade were inconsequential because the principal patrons of Japanese stores were the more than 250,000 Indonesians, not the Chi\u00ad nese. Even during the boycott, Chinese wholesalers and retailers dealt in Japanese goods with little hindrance from intimidators. In No\u00ad vember, the Chinese press tried to promote an anti-Japanese campaign but failed. In the outer islands, only Pontianak, Borneo, organized a success\u00ad ful boycott. There was was the Pontianak boycott, however, that no Japanese merchandise could reach a district of the Kapoeas area near the city without a police escort because the Chinese controlled both land and river transportation.94 Meanwhile, Dutch authorities kept a close watch over the Chinese. When the Association of Chinese Cotton Cloth Merchants declared a voluntary boycott of \"inferior goods,\" effective on December 13, 1937, the Dutch police apprehended Tjong See-gan,95 its prime promoter, and more than a dozen leaders, apparently at the request of the Japanese consulate. According to official information,96 Japanese consular officials had an unconfirmed intelligence report of the arrival of KMT members dispatched by the Chinese government to agitate behind the scenes and to promote a boycott. After the declaration of the boycott by the Association of Cotton Cloth Merchants and two assaults upon Chinese merchants, the Japanese officials presented the evidence to the 39 Attorney General with a request for more rigorous enforcement of the Public Peace Regulations upon Chinese boycotting. The Attorney Gen\u00ad eral promised to administer justice but requested that for security rea\u00ad sons the Japanese not divulge the agreement.97 The result was the roundup of the boycott leaders. The police detained Tjong for several hours for questioning about his connection with the assaults and the boycott declaration. Although the police failed to extract conclusive evidence of his complicity, the arrest of the boycott leaders created panic among boycotting merchants and helped prevent further interference with Chinese merchants doing business with Japanese or dealing in Japanese goods.98 When several Chinese stores that handled Japanese cotton goods were smeared with coal tar, Dutch authorities took prompt action, again at the request of the Japanese. Frequently, the Dutch suspended publication of several Chinese dailies for having printed inflammatory articles and advertisements. In May, publication of the Thien Sung Jip Po of Batavia and the Ta Kong Siang Po of Surabaya was suspended for two weeks on the grounds that their editorials were anti-Japanese. In July, publication of the Sin Po, the largest Chinese- operated daily in Batavia, was suspended eight days for having printed anti-Japanese articles. For the same reason, the publisher of the Keng Po of Batavia was reprimanded and the publication of the Sumatra Min Po of Medan suspended.99 Finally, the Dutch administration prohibited \"public auction or propaganda for the sale of war bonds,\"100 although it authorized Chinese banks to sell Chinese bonds. To sum up, the effectiveness and scale of the National Salvation Movement conducted by the Indies-Chinese cannot be compared with that of its counterpart in Malaya. Japan's economic losses from the boycott were not serious, although in some places where the Japanese re\u00ad tail network was weak, Japanese merchants experiencd great difficulty. The boycott had some telling effects on Chinese businessmen who dealt exclusively in Japanese merchandise. Generally speaking, Japanese trade in the Indies suffered only slightly in large cities and towns, thanks to the natives' constant demand for Japanese goods they could afford.101 Although the boycotts produced no spectacular effects, the fact remains that the Indies-Chinese organized the campaigns and com\u00ad mitted themselves to the boycotts for some months. Furthermore, their contributions of money and drugs offset the ineffectual boycotts. The 40 emphasis on donation drives may well have been the result both of economic interests and the tight control the colonial authorities exer\u00ad cised on the boycott campaign. Under the circumstances, the Chinese boycott leaders may have concluded that they could do more for China by emphasizing the contribution campaign instead of carrying out a boycott whose results would be ineffectual. Nonetheless, their national consciousness would not permit them to sit idly by while Chinese in other parts of the Nanyang were boycotting. Boycott was a more con\u00ad crete and direct way than contribution to demonstrate their national feelings. Their national and racial pride as well as their mien-tzu (face) was too important to permit them to remain idle in the time of China's national crisis. Nevertheless, one cannot help admitting the internal weaknesses of the Chinese community, stemming from the demography of the Chi\u00ad nese ethnic groups in the archipelagoes and from a lack of cohesive- ness. The Chinese population was decisively a minority group. A boycott by a minority group, when the police were strict and most of the native population wanted to buy Japanese goods, had little chance for success. The Chinese society in the Indies never had been a cohesive community. It was ridden with factionalism between speech groups and with social distinctions between Babas and Sinkhehs. Fukienese and Cantonese-Hakkas, as in Singapore, were competing for power, For instance, relations between Fukienese and Cantonese-Hakkas within the Batavia Hua-ch'iao Charity Committee were far from satisfactory. As a result, factional strife broke out and the Cantonese- Hakkas challenged Fukienese leadership. By the time of the next elec\u00ad tion of officers, February, 1939, the Cantonese-Hakka group had mustered enough strength to remove Tjong See-gan, a Fukienese, and replace him with Ch'iu Yuan-jung, a Cantonese.102 Ch'iu was described by Japanese official sources as \"sincere\" in business. Although he was known to have spoken against Japan, according to Japanese intelli\u00ad gence, \"his real motives [for his anti-Japanese advocacy] were not ascertained.\"103 As Willmott aptly points out, there are \"linguistic, educational, social, and cultural differences between Totoks [Sinkhehs] and Peranakans [Babas]. As a result, there exist considerable prejudice and social distance between the two speech groups.\"104 This observa\u00ad tion of the post-war Chinese community in Semarang describes gener- 41 ally the social barriers between the two speech groups in the Indies which existed in pre-war years. Still another weakness in the National Salvation Movement was the lack of dynamic leadership in the Chinese community of the Dutch Indies. There was no Tan Kah Kee, who had enough power and prestige to unite the Malayan Chinese. Consequently, unlike the Chi\u00ad nese in Malaya, the Chinese in the Indies could not organize one central body to coordinate either the boycott campaign or the contribu\u00ad tion drive. The Batavia Chinese Charity Committee, the largest or\u00ad ganization, was unable to control the general headquarters of similar associations in either the Indies or Java. Tjong See-gan was reportedly unpopular and considered untrustworthy because he was said to have made a fortune during the Manchurian incident boycott, which he strongly advocated, while secretly importing Japanese cotton goods.105 It is possible that these rumors had something to do with his removal from his office. Finally, the KMT did not seem to have the control over the Chi\u00ad nese community leaders that Japanese sources thought they had. No doubt KMT agents were present and did urge the Chinese to boycott Japanese goods, but there was no immediate response; the Chinese community conducted the boycott when it suited their time schedule and economic interests. The Japanese seem to have overestimated the role of the KMT and its control over the anti-Japanese movement, per\u00ad haps because they were the victims. The Dutch, too, overreacted, but for different reasons. They wanted to check the politically motivated Chinese anti-Japanese and National Salvation Movement for fear of creating a situation which Japan would seize upon as a pretext to ex\u00ad pand her own propaganda machinery.106 The Philippines A week after the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese incident, the Chi\u00ad nese Chamber of Commerce in Manila sent messages to Chiang Kai- shek and General Sung Che-yuan, the commander of the Twenty-ninth Route Army, whose troops were involved in the hostilities, promising that the Chamber of Commerce would support to the hilt the Nation\u00ad alist government's resolute stand against Japan.107 These cablegrams were followed by an invitation to General Ts'ai T'ing-kai, former com- 42 mander of the Nineteenth Route Army, to open a fund-raising cam\u00ad paign. The general spoke to various groups, impressing upon the Chinese the importance of monetary aid as a token of their loyal sup\u00ad port of Chairman Chiang,108 and his speeches engendered a burst of patriotism. Seizing upon that fervor, the Chinese Chamber of Com\u00ad merce at Manila summoned all business and trade associations to an emergency meeting on July 16. Presiding was Alfonso Sycip Hsueh Fen-shih, president of the Chamber of Commerce, which, along with the KMT group and the consulate general, formed a triumvirate in the Chinese community.109 Speaker after speaker pledged unity, and the delegates unanimously resolved to support Chairman Chiang's resistance of the Japanese troops. Finally, they agreed to organize a Philippine Resist-the-Enemy Committee (PREC).110 The primary objective of the PREC was to \"encourage the Chinese to organize a patriotic movement and to assist the Nationalist government with man\u00ad power and materials.\" On July 19, the day the PREC was formed, it sent letters to Chinese organizations in all parts of the Philippine Islands, urging them to form local resistance committees. They were asked to contribute munitions, to stage a boycott, to organize a Double Seven united giving drive and a monthly contribution campaign for financing the war, and to cut wedding and funeral expenses in order to donate to wounded veterans and war refugees.111 Enthusiasm for donations swept the Islands, and money poured in. In late July, wealthy Chinese business leaders in Manila gave 169,000 yuan; and by August 4, donations totaled nearly 260,000 yuan.112 By the end of September, a systematic large-scale contribution campaign and a subscription for National Salvation War Bonds were under way throughout the Philippines;113 each Chinese family was assigned a con\u00ad tribution quota, and each Chinese wage-earner gave 10 per cent of his monthly income to the war chest.114 In contrast, the Chamber of Com\u00ad merce showed little inclination to boycott although some KMT mem\u00ad bers, patriots, and radical PREC leaders had asked local resistance com\u00ad mittees to stage a boycott.115 It appears that only the KMT faction of the PREC wanted one. In early October, Tseng T'ing-chuan (Justo Cabo Chan),116 chairman of the KMT Propaganda Department in the Philippines and an executive member of the PREC, demanded a boy\u00ad cott. On the Double Ten anniversary, Chinese Consul General Hsu 43 also issued a directive calling for one but failed to evoke enthusiasm among leading moderate merchants of the Chamber of Commerce.117 By underscoring the absence of both community solidarity and KMT control, the failure to boycott helps to disprove the opinion that over\u00ad seas Chinese were cohesive and KMT-controlled, an opinion held by many Japanese who were too quick to see the hand of the KMT. Ap\u00ad parently, the KMT faction was out of step, for Kung Hsiang-hsi, Minister of Finance of the Chinese government, settled the issue, for the time being, in favor of the business circles within the PREC. In mid-October, Kung visited Manila on his way to the United States. In his speech to the Chinese community, he set forth the ob\u00ad jectives of the PREC. In particular, he stressed the vital importance of economic assistance from China's loyal sons and daughters abroad. He brought home the point in the following words:118 . . . Our compatriots overseas are asked to make sacrifices, though they are not fighting the enemy on the battle front. There are many ways to serve the country. As the war protracts, the economic affairs [of the country] are as essential as military matters [for the survival of China]. It is, therefore, absolutely necessary that support for people at home must be provided without cease. The final victory of the war will be with us. The patriotism of the Chinese abroad has been second to none. At this hour of maximum national crisis, I feel it is not necessary to waste time in urging you to respond to the call of your country. Although Kung did not use the word boycott in his speech, he seemed to suggest that the Filipino-Chinese could demonstrate their patriotism by contributing money instead of resorting to a boycott, which would be ultimately more injurious than beneficial to the Chinese. The Chinese Finance Minister was aware that the moderate course of con\u00ad tribution would be the best way to tap the resources of Filipino-Chinese wealth. As will be shown in Chapter III, the Chinese in the Philip\u00ad pine Islands contributed more per capita to the Chinese treasury, in both money and material, than any other Chinese group in the South Seas region. The theme of the anti-Japanese campaign set by Kung was reiterated by KMT notables who visited the Islands in late Oc\u00ad tober; they solicited contributions and bond subscriptions but did not mention a boycott.120 Nevertheless, those Chinese youths, intellectuals, school teachers, and laborers who were dominated by the radical faction\u2014KMT and Communists\u2014advocated the severance of business relations with Japan 44 regardless of the consequences. For instance, a large number of Chi\u00ad nese students attended a meeting held on October 31, under the auspices of the League for the Defense of Democracy. The group resolved to denounce the Japanese action in China, to aid China's war effort, to support the position of the Brussels Conference to solve the China question, and to organize a committee for studying effective means of executing a boycott.121 A week later, the League met to dis\u00ad cuss the possibility of carrying out a boycott organized by longshore\u00ad men in order to shut out Japanese goods from the Philippines. In the meantime, Tseng had been travelling throughout the Islands to strengthen anti-Japanese sentiments among his compatriots, and re\u00ad port had it that he had urged leaders of the Sa\\dalista and the Socialist Pedro Abad Santos to spread anti-Japanese propaganda to the non- Chinese elements in the populace.122 The youths, intellectuals, teach\u00ad ers, and laborers were eager to support the KMT campaign because of their long standing nationalist views, for which the KMT ideology of the Three Principles might give them some form of nationalist expression. The business circles, however, remained reluctant to take the plunge into boycotting, despite mounting pressures from the radicals. Repre\u00ad sentatives of nine guild associations met at the Chinese Chamber of Commerce in Manila on November 24, to discuss the boycott, but they could not agree among themselves. Finally, they voted to postpone the issue until the next general session of the Chamber of Commerce.123 Apparently most of the Chamber of Commerce leaders favored post\u00ad poning the boycott, the position now supported by Consul General Hsu, who had changed his stand to follow the soft line since Kung Hsiang-hsi's visit. Chinese community leadership now split, the Cham\u00ad ber of Commerce group and the Consul General committing them\u00ad selves to the contribution campaign and the KMT group to boycotting. The business leaders' hesitancy was due, Japanese sources concluded, partly to their bitter experience of business losses during the Tsinan and Manchurian incident boycotts; partly to the need to stock Japa\u00ad nese goods for Christmas, the Chinese New Year, and the Semana Santa, or Holy Week; and partly to apprehensions that a boycott would bring about trade losses, which would impede the campaign for bond subscriptions and contributions.124 These assessments were 45 supported by statistics, published in 1938 and 1939, that showed a steady increase in Japanese exports to the Philippines between July and December, 1937, and then a sharp decline beginning in January, 1938. They were supported also by the alignment of merchant guild associa\u00ad tions, after January or February, 1938, with the boycott faction led by Tseng T'ing-chiian. On the strength of the evidence, one can hardly disagree with Hara Shigeharu, secretary general of the Japanese Cham\u00ad ber of Commerce in Manila, who characterized the period from July to December, 1937, as one of \"wait-and-see.\"125 The next period, January 1 to February 27, 1938, was the time of the \"behind-the-scenes maneuvering\" of the Resist-the-Enemy com\u00ad mittees Tseng's drive for a boy\u00ad cott had found a common ground for a meeting of the interests of the KMT and those of the Cotton Cloth Dealers' Association. On January 3, the Association adopted boycott resolutions, and other merchant guild associations soon followed their lead or set up subcommittees to study methods of setting up a boycott. In late January, by which time Chinese merchants had stocked merchandise for the Chinese New Year and Holy Week, eighteen organizations boycotted Japanese goods.127 Why did these associations finally decide to observe the KMT-led boycott ? In the short run, boycotts would hurt local Chinese businesses that handled Japanese products. But in the long run, Japan was a potential threat to their interests and a Japan-dominated China would be unable\u2014or at least unwilling\u2014to protect their interests. At the same time, Chinese merchants in the Philippine Islands had one advantage that Chinese businessmen in the Indies, for instance, did not have; they could easily find substitutes for Japanese products, particu\u00ad larly cotton piece goods, in the United States, which was sympathetic to China's cause. By purchasing American products the Chinese could kill two birds with one stone. On the one hand, a boycott would hurt Japan directly, as the discussion of trade statistics in Chapter III will show; on the other, it would increase the volume of trade with the United States, whose sympathy for China could scarcely be ignored. Taking the long view, the Chinese merchants decided to boycott Japanese goods, even though business might suffer at the time, hoping that in so doing they could help China, which needed America's aid. To buy American products was to assist China indirectly. 46 The Manila government grew increasingly uneasy about the ten\u00ad sion that the war and the propaganda of the Resist-the-Enemy Com\u00ad mittees had created among the Chinese. Obviously as a measure to cool the rising temper of the Chinese, President Manuel Quezon issued a proclamation on February 3, requesting both Chinese and Japanese residents to exercise restraint. He asked all Philippine residents, both national and foreign, to \"abstain from all public demonstration in favor of or against any of the parties engaged in armed conflict in China\" and urged them not to form associations \"for the purpose of creating public sentiment in favor of or against any of the contending parties in [the] conflict.\"128 The statement was directed primarily at the Chinese, since it was a shift in their sentiments that had prompted the President's message. The Chinese boycott leaders paid no attention to Quezon's admoni\u00ad tion. In late February, they and the KMT cowed the moderate leaders of the Chamber of Commerce. Tseng T'ing-chiian and Lim Shu-an, a KMT representative from China, taking advantage of the mood of the Chinese merchants, after some intimidation, carried a majority vote in favor of a boycott, to be effective on February 28.129 Tseng's KMT faction was now in the ascendancy in the PREC, which had been created within the Chamber of Commerce and guided by business leaders. A week later the Tseng-dominated PREC ratified the Regula\u00ad tions Governing the Execution of Enemy Goods Boycott. The Regula\u00ad tions were as follows: 1. Orders that have been placed and stocked Japanese goods must be registered at the guild association headquarters, to be completed by March 9; 2. The inspection of these orders and goods must be made by guild officials; 3. A deliberate intent to obstruct the boycott drive will be penalized. The penalty includes fines, exposure of the crime to the public, and branding the offender as a traitor; 4. A permit to deal in Japanese goods for which there are no substitutes must be obtained. Stores dealing in non-substitutable Japanese goods are given an extension of three months for clearance; 5. A permit for the movement of non-substitutable Japanese produce and regis\u00ad tered stock must be obtained with the payment for the fee; 6. Goods that are produced by the Chinese in the Japanese occupied area of China and by joint Sino-Japanese-Filipino factories in the Islands will be exempted from the boycott; 7. The movement of registered Japanese goods must be reported to the guild as\u00ad sociation and the Resist-the-Enemy Committee. Their movement without a 47 permit will be prohibited, violation of which is subject to the confiscation of the goods as contrabands and fine; and 8. Clandestine dealing in Japanese merchandise through foreign merchants will not be permitted.130 Although the Chamber of Commerce circles resigned themselves to the inevitability of the boycott, they were bitter toward the KMT faction, particularly toward Tseng, for the shoddy way the passage of the boycott had been achieved.131 Consequently, the business leaders maneuvered to regain control over the PREC and rid themselves of Tseng. What happened less than a month later showed that they had succeeded. In late March, Consul General Hsu was replaced by Yang Kuang-sheng (Kuangson Young), former executive director of the China Press. Upon Yang's arrival in Manila, the consul general an\u00ad nounced that the PREC would be under the guidance of the Chamber of Commerce and that Tseng would be removed from the PREC's ex\u00ad ecutive board.132 Since the boycott remained intense even after Tseng's removal, it is probable that Tseng was sacrificed for the sake of unity in the Chinese community in Manila. No doubt the central KMT was displeased because Tseng's handling of the boycott issue had alienated the influential businessmen. His dismissal was a way of placating them. The success of the Chamber of Commerce was an indication that the KMT was not in the saddle. Having resolved their differences, the Chinese community leaders and the KMT government set out to intensify the boycott. It was beginning to hurt Japanese business in the Islands, particularly the large importing firms whose business volume was reduced in April, May, and June. The Japanese position became even more tenuous when Japan restricted foreign exchange and shifted to a war economy. As a result, Japanese cloth, foods, and metalware were not only scarce but also too expensive to compete with American products.133 The Chinese victory at Taierchwang in April and the Japanese capture of Amoy, the home of most of the Filipino-Chinese, and Hsuchow in May helped stir up the national spirit of the Chinese. Already, repre\u00ad sentatives of twenty-two organizations in Manila had pledged to sup\u00ad port whatever boycott resolutions the PREC would pass and had vowed to discipline their uncooperative members.134 After the Japanese oc\u00ad cupation of Amoy, which coincided with the expiration of a three- 48 month grace period for disposing of products available only from Japan, the boycott was tightened to plug loopholes through which some Chinese had secretly been conducting business with the Japa\u00ad nese.135 Some Chinese and Taiwanese employed by Japanese firms were intimidated.136 Since early spring there had been a steady rise in the number of gloomy letters from local Japanese officials and businessmen to the Foreign Office in Tokyo. The Japanese Association in Capiz, Panay, predicted that the Japanese shops in that city would be forced to close should the boycott be continued.137 The official journal of the Japan Bicycle Exporters' Association, Yushitsu Jitensha, was even more pes\u00ad simistic: \"The prospect for the import of merchandise from Japan re\u00ad mains very dim as long as the Sino-Japanese war continues.\"138 Japa\u00ad nese importers were helpless and could do nothing but wait, hoping that eventually the boycott would be less strictly enforced.139 To ob\u00ad serve the first anniversary of the Sino-Japanese war, the consul general, the Chinese Chamber of Commerce, and the PREC sponsored a rally in Manila. The Chinese at the assembly hall renewed their pledges to carry out the boycott and promised to donate more money to the Chiang Kai-shek government.140 The Resist-the-Enemy Committees, which had been active through\u00ad out the Islands since August, 1937, were extremely successful in collect\u00ad ing contributions for relief, medicines, airplanes, and munitions and in getting subscriptions for bonds. The results were excellent. Japanese official sources reported that Chinese everywhere were eager to con\u00ad tribute, and that money was flowing into the treasury of local com\u00ad mittees. Even in a small town in Leyte, where there were only forty Chinese, the committee collected nearly six thousand dollars between July 7, 1937, and July 7, 1939. The propaganda, boycott, and contribu\u00ad tion campaigns conducted by the 2,000 Chinese in Davao, a Japanese economic stronghold with a population of over 20,000, were reported to be among the most intense in the Islands. In the two years after the outbreak of war, they gave more than a million yuan. Summarizing the spirit of sacrifice for the National Salvation Movement, the Japanese Foreign Office said: \"Never before has the patriotic passion of the Chinese been so high.\" In Manila, though, enthusiasm for relief work and contributions began to wane in August, 49 1938, when Dee C. Chuan, the most powerful Chinese businessman in the city, went to the United States for medical treatment, leaving the Manila Chinese organization temporarily without a leader. \"Chi\u00ad nese in local provinces,\" said a student of the overseas Chinese, \"are not only giving more than the Chinese in Manila in proportion to their assets and income, but also their local contribution network is reaching more thoroughly than in Manila. The tight-knit organization, the seriousness of administering discipline, and the record of giving are far superior to those in Manila.\"141 The spirit of sacrifice was best seen in the enthusiastic response to the slogan \"Save China by Airplanes.\" In March, shortly after the systematic boycott was declared, the Filipino-Chinese organized a branch of the China Association for the Construction of Airplanes at the request of its headquarters in China. The movement intensified Chinese patriotism. By the end of 1939, thirty-three branches had been organized throughout the Islands. The Chinese in Manila alone gave the Association money for ten airplanes, and by July 7, 1939, the Chinese in the provinces had donated enough for twenty-six.142 The Chinese women did not lag in giving their time, energy, and talents to aid China. They formed the Chinese Women's Association for the Comfort of Self-Defending Soldiers. Executive members of the As\u00ad sociation were wives of prominent leaders of the Chinese community, and its branches mushroomed in local districts to raise money for ambulances, drugs, winter clothing, gas masks, first aid kits, vaccines, and airplanes, and to collect old clothing, transport wagons, and hop sacks. During 1937 and 1938, the Women's Associations raised nearly 400,000 yuan.143 The desire to participate in the National Salvation Movement spread to Chinese school boys and girls. Instead of con\u00ad tributing cash, they voluntarily gave up such \"luxuries\" as dancing and permanent waves, and fined offenders. Even habitual Chinese gamblers and opium smokers were not left out of the National Salva\u00ad tion Movement. Pricked by a local newspaper article reporting that Chinese were smoking opium smuggled from Japan, the Consul Gen\u00ad eral begged Chinese residents to \"stop smoking opium and devote themselves to the cause of the National Salvation Movement.\"144 The most outstanding feature of the Chinese anti-Japanese activities in the Philippine Islands was the absence of violence. Credit for this 50 should be given to level-headed Chinese leaders who saw the advan\u00ad tages of moderation for protecting the interest of Chinese residents and for winning the sympathy of China's friends in the Islands.145 The second reason for the success of the campaign was the legal existence of the KMT. The Party operated with relative freedom from the restriction which handicapped it in the Netherlands Indies, Thailand, and British Malaya. This does not mean that KMT activities were un\u00ad restrained. The Philippine authorities, like the authorities in Malaya, were suspicious of the political overtones of the Chinese National Sal\u00ad vation Movement. The presidential proclamation in February, 1938, showed that the Philippine government did not view kindly the Chi\u00ad nese anti-Japanese activities. In fact, judging from the close relations maintained with Filipino officials, including President Quezon, by the Japanese, the latter seemed to have won the sympathy of the Philip\u00ad pine oligarchy, with whom they had cultivated their ties since 1935.146 Moreover, the Chinese had to cope with the rising tide of Filipino na\u00ad tional consciousness. Since the 1920's Filipino nationalists had been attempting to curb Chinese economic power.147 The Chinese nation\u00ad alist movement, of which the anti-Japanese campaign was part, would bring to the surface the latent anti-Chinese feelings of the Filipinos.148 Undoubtedly, the leaders of the Chinese community carefully con\u00ad sidered this possibility before deciding to impose the boycott, and it must have haunted them during the months the boycott was in effect. Thailand Of all the Nanyang Chinese National Salvation Movements, Thai\u00ad land's is the most interesting to students because Thailand was the only independent nation in Southeast Asia and Japan's influence was in the ascendency in the late 1930's. As Professor G. William Skinner observed, to understand the Thai government's policy towards the Chinese, one must consider its position in international politics. Skin\u00ad ner said: \"As anti-Japanese activities came in the thirties to dominate Chinese politics in Siam, Japanese power was in rapid ascendancy, and the Thai\u2014whether admiration for the Japanese example played a part or not\u2014had to be especially careful not to offend Dai Nippon.\"149 The Thai government, therefore, was cautious in her relations with Japan when the Sino-Japanese conflict occurred. As early as December 51 30, 1937, Luang Pradjist Manudbam, Foreign Minister, declared that his government intended to maintain \"a strict neutral policy toward the Sino-Japanese conflict; it is neither pro-Japanese nor anti-Japa\u00ad nese.\"150 On the other hand, since 1932, the government's policy to\u00ad ward Chinese residents had been discriminatory and nationalistic. Yet its relations with the Chinese government on the eve of the Sino-Japa- nese war were said to be \"... at their most nearly cordial since the mid twenties,\"151 even though the nations did not have formal diplomatic relations; and the Thai government seemingly tolerated the existence of the KMT, though it had been declared illegal. In keeping with its stated policy of neutrality, the Bangkok govern\u00ad ment declined a local Chinese newspaper owner's offer to provide the Thai press with translated Chinese news from the China Central News Agency because such an arrangement might \"infringe upon Thai\u00ad land's international relations.\"152 Three times in July, 1937, the govern\u00ad ment served notices to all publishers and editors, forbidding them to print anything but straight news. They were told to exclude com\u00ad ments that could be construed as derogatory to Japan. Despite this warning, a number of Chinese and Thai newspapers financed by Chinese printed sensational and inflammatory articles about the war and agitated for political action. The government's response was stern; in August it suspended publication of two Chinese-operated news\u00ad papers for having printed anti-Japanese news and in the next two months closed or fined eleven dailies for similar reasons.153 On the other hand, there was no threat of a boycott in the first few months. In August, Minister Murai informed the Tokyo government that cotton piece goods were being boycotted, but the tone of his cables was in no way alarming.154 Only with the spread of the war to central and southern China in September, did the Chinese agitate for a boy\u00ad cott. They were incited by tragic tales spread by newly arrived refugees from China. A systematic boycott began the first week of October, although there was no formal declaration by the Bangkok Chinese Chamber of Commerce. Why did the Chamber of Com\u00ad merce, which directed the boycott, procrastinate until October? Its failure to impose a boycott until it had received numerous orders from the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission and the China Federation of Chambers of Commerce suggests disagreement among the leaders. 52 It seems that some of them were afraid of what the Thai government would do when the Chamber of Commerce openly endorsed the boy\u00ad cott, an act which would incur the government's hostility. On the other hand, the Chamber of Commerce had been under strong pres\u00ad sure to boycott. Caught in this uncomfortable situation, it seems, the Chamber of Commerce acquiesced to the boycott but made no public declaration. Instead, it made the boycott appear to be a voluntary movement while supporting it behind the scenes. Once the boycott was underway, however, the KMT faction exerted more pressure on the Chamber of Commerce. Soon the Japanese felt the initial impact of the boycott. Chinese merchants cancelled contracts with Japanese firms. Japanese im\u00ad porters had to rely upon Indians and Thais to distribute and retail cotton piece goods.155 Chinese coolies refused to unload cargo from Japanese ships, and hot-tempered Chinese assaulted a Mitsui employee. Eight such assaults, in one of which a person was killed, were re\u00ad ported in October.156 The boycott disrupted the shipping of Siamese rice to Japan, although its shipping to Cuba reportedly remained normal. The Mitsui Lines, a leading Japanese trading firm doing busi\u00ad ness in Thailand, conceded that by the end of October the company had lost one-third of the revenue from shipping exports and was hav\u00ad ing difficulty getting cargoes from Thailand to Japan. An official of the Mitsui ascribed the business losses to a walkout staged by Chinese longshoremen, the intensified boycott, and accelerated terrorism.157 The outbreak of terrorism, extortion, and highjacking in October prompted the Japanese Minister to call upon the Bangkok Police Head\u00ad quarters to protect the lives and property of Japanese and of those working for them.158 Acting upon the Japanese request, the Thai police, in the first of a series of police raids, arrested nineteen Chinese on October 27.159 The arrest, however, did not discourage terrorism; more intimidations and attacks followed in November. Members of underground strong-arm organizations threatened or actually assaulted not only Chinese and Japanese but also Indian shop owners in an effort to frighten them into boycotting Japanese merchandise.160 Shortly after the fall of Nanking, KMT agents arrived from Singa\u00ad pore, reportedly to cooperate with the Chinese secret societies in or\u00ad ganizing a boycott inspection corps.161 The presence of the KMT 53 agents provocateurs of terrorism was evident in the fresh outbreak of assaults and arson. A Chinese teak merchant serving as an agent for the Mitsui was attacked by terrorists and lost his arm; a Mitsui truck laden with raw hides was highjacked; a Mitsui warehouse was set ablaze; and wealthy Chinese merchants were compelled to increase their contributions.162 The Thai police reacted swiftly. Policemen raided Chinese associations known to harbor undesirables and arrested a score of suspects, in addition to eight bond subscription promoters sent by the KMT government.163 Several of the arrested leaders were later expelled from the Kingdom, and eighteen secret societies were disbanded.164 The illegal activities were attributed to the Hua-ch'iao Resist-the-Enemy Association for National Salvation, known as Hua~ 1(angf and the organization \"was closely connected with several of the most reputable Chinese community leaders and under the direct con\u00ad trol of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce.\"165 The Thai police action temporarily subdued the Chinese boycott movement, but in April the Chinese resumed an active boycott drive. On April 1, Chinese in Chiengmai, the second largest city in Thailand, joined their compatriots in the boycott campaign. In late May, Chi\u00ad nese assailants murdered a Formosan-Japanese because his firm had bought tea from the Mitsui Trading Company; this was the first murder of a Japanese citizen. The assassination shocked Japanese residents, making them realize the gravity of the anti-Japanese move\u00ad ment. In June and July, high Chinese officials visited Thailand ostensi\u00ad bly to strengthen Chinese national spirit as the Japanese troops ad\u00ad vanced to southern China. Everywhere they went, the visitors preached the need for money for a protracted war, asking their compatriots to put their faith in the ultimate victory of the Chinese. The Japanese bombings of Swatow and Hainan Island intensified the boycott; Chi\u00ad nese newspapers again published anti-Japanese editorials, and terrorist activities resumed.166 The Chinese National Salvation Movement and its persistent illicit activities did not endear the Chinese to the Thais. As early as October and November, 1937, when the Chinese intensified the anti-Japanese drive, angry letters flooded the desks of the editors of the Bang\\o\\ Times and the Siam Chronicle, decrying the behavior of the Chinese and demanding that the police show more resolution in curbing their 54 lawlessness.167 It is significant to note that Thai public opinion toward the Chinese was shifting to the right of center. Before 1938, relations between the mass of the Thais and the Chinese were less hostile than those between the Thai elite and the Chinese.168 Now the angry and unhappy masses who were certainly inconvenienced by the boycott, added fuel to the anti-Sinicism. An ominous sign of Thai nationalism emerged. In 1938, the sentiments that in 1939 would crystallize into an intense campaign against the Chinese were expressed in a news\u00ad paper editorial and in the words of a high government official. On March 1, a local Thai daily vented the exasperation of the public, call\u00ad ing the Chinese the Jews of the Orient;169 and on July 15, Luang Wijit Wathakan, a cabinet minister and director of the Fine Arts Depart\u00ad ment, denounced the Chinese habit of remitting money to their home\u00ad land and compared the Chinese problem in Thailand to the Jewish problem in Nazi Germany.170 The Wathakan episode took the force out of the Chinese anti-Japa\u00ad nese campaign temporarily, but terrorism soon resumed. Rumors of the massacre of Japanese were widespread in mid-August, alerting the Bangkok police and frightening everyone who dealt in Japanese merchandise. Anti-Japanese activists were determined to weaken Japan's position in Thailand. As Otani Chozo, the owner of the Otani Trading Company in Bangkok, said, one of the characteristics of the anti-Japanese drive was \"terrorism executed by agents sent by the KMT government for the sole purpose of murdering in cold blood any Chi\u00ad nese who would handle Japanese goods.\"171 Nowhere else were there so many assaults and assassinations as in Thailand, where by July, 1938, terrorists had killed at least six merchants who had sold Japanese products. The indignant Thai authorities were resolved to clean out the undesirables. On March 8, Thai police arrested twenty-four Chi\u00ad nese, three of whom were indicted; in June, a Thai court sentenced to life imprisonment the assassins of the aforementioned Taiwanese of Japanese citizenship, and the police apprehended three more of his assailants; on July 7, the first anniversary of the Sino-Japanese war, the police arrested nine terrorists in a raid of their headquarters and de\u00ad tained more than a dozen Chinese who were distributing anti-Japanese leaflets; on August 3, police captured six extortionists who were at\u00ad tacking two Chinese merchants; and finally, in September, the police 55 ferreted out 5,808 Chinese opium addicts and arrested them for viola\u00ad tion of the 1937 Alien Registration Act.172 Many of those addicts arrested were suspected of having engaged in anti-Japanese activities. Despite the police roundups, the boycott continued, but with diminish\u00ad ing enthusiasm. The Chinese not only conducted the underground boycott and the anti-Japanese campaign approved by the Chamber of Commerce but, with the cooperation of the KMT Government Office of Commercial Representative and the Thailand Office of the KMT, organized the illegal Thai-Chinese Relief Fund-Raising Association. Ch'en Shou- ming,173 the Commercial Representative, became the chairman of the Relief Association, assisted by eleven committee members; most of them were officers of the Chinese chambers of commerce. The Relief Association was divided into twenty-eight branch offices scattered throughout Thailand, each organized according to guilds and speech groups. The structure was similar to that of branches in Malaya, the Indies, and the Philippines. Under the authority of the Relief As\u00ad sociation, such cultural associations as T'ung-hsi she and Li-chih she and Chinese schools raised money. To implement the Relief As\u00ad sociation's fund-raising drive, the Thailand Office of the KMT created the Hua-k'ang within the San-min she, a youth club which was formed for the dissemination of San-Min-Chu-I. The Hua-k'ang local offices were established throughout Thailand. The Relief Association branches shared office space with the Hua-k'ang's local offices. The illegal Hua-k'ang employed a number of strong-arm men for ex\u00ad tortion, intimidation, and terrorism to enforce the boycott, and it was active in checking the influence of the Communist Party.174 Response to the contribution campaign was said to be excellent in the early months of the war, but it declined because the Teochius and the Hainanese (the Ch'iungchou group) disagreed over the distribu\u00ad tion of the money. The deteriorating war situation magnified their differences. The Ch'iungchou group was reportedly reluctant to put its stake on the Chiang Kai-shek regime and by March, 1938, had withdrawn its support from the KMT government. Even within the Teochiu community, signs of vacillation were detectable. So serious had the situation become that the KMT government and the military are said to have secretly dispatched their high ranking officials to mend 56 fences.175 If this information is true, we find some evidence to support the argument that the Hainanese were oriented to the Left. As the poorest speech group, the Hainanese were more disposed to extremism and more active in leftist organizations than the other groups. The Hainanese did not want the KMT government to get all the money; they wanted the Chinese Communists to get an equal share. They might also have demanded that it be sent directly to a Communist agency, not channelled through the Chungking government. The Com\u00ad munists appeared to have won over the Hainanese in Thailand. In no other country was a speech group alienated from the KMT govern\u00ad ment. Notwithstanding these difficulties, the money raising went on as an underground operation. Probably no one knew how much the Chinese collected because of the clandestine nature of the campaign and because of repeated police raids. Two figures available from Chinese sources give some inkling of the achievement of the fund-rais\u00ad ing for national defense. The China Federation of Chambers of Com\u00ad merce disclosed that the Chinese in Thailand donated 705,086 bahts between August, 1937, and February, 1938. In October, 1938, the Nanyang Chinese Relief General Association reported that the Thai- Chinese had contributed eight million yuan to China between July, 1937, and October, 1938.176 There is no way of ascertaining whether the eight million yuan includes the 705,086 bahts. Eight million yuan is by no means large in comparison with the sums donated by Chinese in other countries. In summary, physical violence and coercion marked the Thai- Chinese National Salvation Movement in contrast to movements in Malaya, the Indies, and the Philippines. Why did the Chinese defy the authority of the host government, risking their lives and the good names of their organizations as well as that of their community ? The first reason may be Thailand's propinquity to China in the north and contiguity with Malaya in the south. A good number of KMT and Communist agents were known to have entered the Kingdom from both directions in order to set anti-Japanese activities in motion.177 Why were so many agitators necessary in Thailand ? We can assume that high authorities were dissatisfied with the community leaders' organization and management of the Thai-Chinese anti-Japanese 57 movement. The Chamber of Commerce's initial reluctance to boy\u00ad cott and the numerous intimidations support that view. Leaders of the Chamber of Commerce were, for good reasons, apprehensive of the economic and political consequences of the boycott, for Thailand was a free market for Japanese merchandise, which provided more than half of the Kingdom's consumer goods market. Because Japanese firms extended convenient credit terms, the Chinese merchants, who had limited capital, could not afford a long boycott. The memory of the economic setback caused by the Manchurian incident boycott strengthened their reluctance. Boycotting Japanese products would certainly engender ill will in the Thais, especially the anti-Chinese Thai elite. The Chinese leaders did not wish to antagonize the Thai elite; they wanted to maintain the status quo as long as possible. That attitude explains why, despite KMT pressure, the support of the boy\u00ad cott was less than whole-hearted at the Chinese Chamber of Commerce meeting in December, 1938. It was disclosed that many influential merchants complained that the boycott was bankrupting them and helping Indian merchants at their expense.178 Their lukewarm attitude may have been a reason for the lax boycott enforcement and the resul\u00ad tant back door deals and intimidations. A study of the Thai-Chinese National Salvation Movement may raise questions about KMT control over the Chinese Chamber of Commerce. It must be pointed out that relations of the Thai-Chinese Chamber of Commerce with both the KMT and the Chinese govern\u00ad ment were unique; the KMT was not a legal party in Thailand nor did the Chinese government have formal diplomatic relations with the Kingdom. The Chamber of Commerce, in the absence of the official representatives of the party and the government, presumably represented their interests. In that capacity, the authority of the Chamber of Commerce was equal to, if not stronger than, the authority of both the KMT and the Chinese government. Therefore, KMT and government agents in Thailand had, it seems, a unique control prob\u00ad lem. The KMT could not completely dominate the Chamber of Commerce, and the Chinese community leaders did not automatically accept KMT directives. In Thailand, economic interests were put ahead of party control. Another interesting facet of the National Salvation Movement deserves mention\u2014the role of Hsiao Fo-ch'eng, 58 the long undisputed leader of the Chinese community. He served on the committee of the Thai-Chinese Relief Fund-Raising Association, but curiously he did not associate himself with the Hua-k'ang, an ex\u00ad clusive KMT organization, although he was an illustrious KMT mem\u00ad ber of long standing. It is not clear why he was not active in the Hua- k'ang; he had been active in anti-Japanese movements after the Tsinan and Manchurian incidents. Perhaps his membership in the South\u00ad western faction, a KMT political clique opposed to Chiang Kai-shek's leadership, made him drift away from Chiang. Consequently, as a Japanese source has suggested, the Chinese Chamber of Commerce, which he dominated until 1938, was not eager to launch the boycott movement.179 That may or may not be true, but it is true that when he died in June, 1939, the Chinese community lost a strong and stable leader. His death weakened the leadership of the Chamber of Com\u00ad merce, perhaps even its disciplinary power over members. Finally, the Thai-Chinese National Salvation Movement, like its sister organizations in Malaya, the Indies, and the Philippines, was plagued by factionalism\u2014the disagreement between the Teochius and the Hainanese\u2014which sapped its strength and weakened its unity. To balance the picture, I wish to stress the fact that the anti-Japa\u00ad nese movement in Thailand continued for months and even years under the most adverse conditions. For reasons stated in this study, the nationalistic Thai government's policy in dealing with the Chinese was one of systematic persecution, a far cry from its professed neutral\u00ad ity. It was, if anything, a neutral policy slanted in favor of Japan. This fact is significant in evaluating the achievement of the Chinese National Salvation Movement in Thailand. French Indochina and Burma In French Indochina, particularly in the Saigon-Cholon area, Haiphong, and Hanoi, there were no overt anti-Japanese and boycott activities in July and August, although agents of the Chiang Kai-shek government had been reported active behind the scenes. Meanwhile, fund-raising organizations for war refugees and China's war chest had been formed in Tonkin, Annam, Cambodia, and Cochin China. The most important association in directing the National Salvation Move\u00ad ment was the General Association for Vietnam and Southern District 59 Chinese National Salvation at Saigon, where 200,000 Chinese had congregated. It was organized in August, 1937, to promote the sale of war bonds and government bonds, to campaign for monthly contribu\u00ad tions, to carry out a drive to eradicate \"inferior goods,\" to train cadres for the National Salvation Movement, and to send trained personnel to China for development projects and comfort missions.180 The KMT Haiphong and Annam Offices were responsible for directing these activities.181 By all indications, the boycott began in late August. Already the transport of Japanese goods from Saigon to Cambodia had been cut off because a Mekong River Transport Company owned by a Chinese refused to take Japanese cargo. The sale of Japanese-made \"ice cake\" dropped sharply as a result of a Chinese newspaper's allegation that it contained poison. A Chinese in Saigon whom boycott inspectors caught in the act of dealing with a Japanese firm was threatened with deportation unless he paid a heavy fine. In the north, Chinese in Hanoi and Haiphong, together with refugees from China, organized a boycott in October.182 The Chinese in Indochina used various methods to collect money for the KMT government. According to a report submitted to the Nanyang Hua-ch'iao Relief General Association, they raised 4.4 mil\u00ad lion yuan in the first year of the war.183 Per capita, they contributed more than the Thai-Chinese, although the total contribution was much smaller. Haiphong Chinese promised to reduce food expenses by one piaster a day in order to donate airplanes to the KMT gov\u00ad ernment. Through this campaign they collected as much as seven thousand piasters a month. In late 1938, the Chinese in Hanoi matched their subscription of war bonds to the amount of the income tax they paid.184 A contrast to the hostility under which the Thai-Chinese had to conduct their anti-Japanese activities was the permissiveness of the French in Indochina. Japanese observers outspokenly criticized the pro-Kuomintang attitude of the French authorities. They attributed the effectiveness of the Chinese boycott and the plight of the Japanese in part to French toleration.185 In Burma, Chinese in Rangoon organized a national salvation as\u00ad sociation on July 20, 1937. The organization adopted resolutions essen- 60 tially identical to those passed by the French-Chinese national salva\u00ad tion association.186 In response to the association's slogan, \"Give your money and give your strength,\" Chinese devoted themselves to a con\u00ad tribution drive for the KMT government's treasury. The result was splendid; they collected 3.4 million yuan in the first year of the war.187 The initial campaign to boycott Japanese goods and to generate patriotism was less vigorous than the fund-raising drive. Some Chi\u00ad nese had formed the Iron Blood Corps and the Tiger Association to enforce the boycott upon Chinese merchants and to intimidate Japa\u00ad nese and Taiwanese residents. Chinese newspapers, intellectuals, and KMT members provided the leadership, and they even tried to mobilize the sympathy of an element of the Indian Congress Party. Meanwhile, for Chinese readers, the Ka\\ Min ]it Poh, a KMT daily, printed news distributed by the Chinese Central News Agency.188 In the long run, however, the Chinese failed to diminish substantially Japan's cotton exports to Burma,189 and their anti-Japanese activities were moderate throughout the rest of 1937 and 1938, except in October, 1938, when the boycott fervor rekindled in conjunction with the fall of Canton and visits of high-ranking KMT officials.190 The inefficacy of the boycott could be ascribed largely to the bal\u00ad ance of economic strength between the Chinese and the Indians in Burma. Chinese dominated economic life in the other Southeast Asian countries but not in Burma. The Indians, who outnumbered the Chinese, dominated the Burmese economy. Japanese articles were readily available from Indian shopkeepers and importers who dealt directly with Japanese firms. I have examined the Nanyang Chinese National Salvation Move\u00ad ment, country by country, in some detail to demonstrate the extent and magnitude of Chinese response to the Sino-Japanese hostilities. The response varied according to local conditions, but among Nanyang Hua-ch'iao everywhere there was a surge of national spirit in support of the Chiang Kai-shek government. They used every conceivable means to mobilize every ounce of their strength and every penny of their resources. It is true that motives were not always patriotic and that some Chinese did not cooperate, but most of them were eager to help the KMT government. It is true that factionalism, rivalry, and disagreement existed, but the anti-Japanese movement was generally 61 well-organized and united. Thanks to the cooperation of local Chi\u00ad nese associations, notably Chinese Chambers of Commerce, the in\u00ad fluence of the KMT increased in Chinese communities. Through these organizations, the KMT organized a rather effective national salvation movement. The KMT did not have exclusive control of the move\u00ad ment, however. Under the cover of the united front, Communists in\u00ad filtrated the National Salvation Movement, and their increasing in\u00ad fluence alarmed local governments. Until October, 1938, there was no attempt to unite the national salvation associations of Southeast Asia under centralized command. However, once this unified headquarters was created on the Double Ten anniversary in 1938, the Nanyang Chinese National Salvation Movement became an even more formidable weapon for China and a menace to Japan. In the next chapter, I shall examine the second phase of the National Salvation Movement. 62 Chapter II The Nanyang Chinese and the Anti- Japanese National Salvation Movement, Second Phase (October, 1938- December, 1941) The Sino-Japanese war patently excited the passion of the Nan\u00ad yang Chinese for their ancestral land, and China's tenacious resistance induced them to sacrifice for the cause of China. Their contributions, bond subscriptions, and other forms of raising funds showed the de\u00ad gree of their response to the war. The Nanyang Chinese, however, had no central headquarters to coordinate their activities and to accelerate their aid program. Dee C. Chuan, a Manila Fukienese who understood the importance of cen\u00ad tralization after the fall of Amoy in May, 1938, appealed to leaders of Fukienese associations in Southeast Asia to call Fukien Chinese to a meeting in Hong Kong.1 Dee's proposal immediately gained the support of leaders of Fukienese associations in other countries, who recommended that the meeting not be confined to Fukienese. Tjong See-gan of Batavia proposed Singapore as the meeting place and sug\u00ad gested that all Chinese speech groups be invited. Having secured Dee's approval, Tjong communicated with Kung Hsiang-hsi, the Vice President of the Executive Yuan and the Finance Minister of the KMT government, explaining the objectives of the meeting and requesting the guidance and direction of the KMT government. Kung, in turn, sent a cable to Tan Kah Kee, a Fukienese prominent in the Singapore Chinese community, informing him of his correspondence with Tjong. Kung's purpose, apparently, was to secure Tan's approval of the meet\u00ad ing. It is interesting that Dee and Tjong had to employ Kung's prestige to persuade Tan, a fellow Fukienese. Available sources provide no ex\u00ad planation for their indirect approach, but Tan's autobiography implies that at first he was not enthusiastic about the project. He hedged about committing himself to it on the grounds that \"complex circumstances existing in Malaya\" would make it difficult to hold such a meeting in Singapore. It appears that Tan was apprehensive of the increasing in- 63 fluence of the Kuomintang in the National Salvation Movement and felt that without its interference he would \"be in a better position to bring in larger donations towards the China Relief Fund.\"2 Tan was, however, pressed by Consul General Kao, who, acting upon Kung's instructions, coaxed the patriarch of the Singapore Chinese com\u00ad munity to support the meeting. Kung and Tan reached an under\u00ad standing in late August. Meanwhile, Kung asked consuls to relay to leaders of Nanyang Chinese communities his requests to send repre\u00ad sentatives to the assembly on October 10. It should be noted that it took less than five months to organize this \"unprecedented\" meeting\u2014an indication of the Nanyang Hua- ch'iao's enthusiasm for the cause of their fatherland. The Nanyang Chinese National Salvation Movement made a landmark when, on October 10, 160 delegates from 45 cities in Malaya, the Netherlands Indies, the Philippines, Thailand, French Indochina, Burma, Sarawak, North Borneo, and Hong Kong gathered at the Hua-ch'iao Middle School in Singapore.3 The convention lasted for six days, but the delegates \"remained jubilant with no sign of fatigue.\"4 The session discussed and adopted resolutions that the Nanyang Chinese would promote the contribution drive; collect funds for the relief of war refugees in Fukien and Kwangtung provinces; expand the market for China's produce; educate people by means of mass media; execute a campaign for savings and frugality; donate medical equipment and drugs; and promote a drive to encourage Chinese to return to China for either military or nonmilitary service.5 Their maxims were, the resolutions declared, \"Give our wealth for the defense of the father\u00ad land,\" and \"Save money to strengthen China's fighting capabilities.\"6 Neither before nor since in the history of Nanyang Chinese nationalism has there been such strong support for China. Nanyang Chinese con\u00ad cern for China's survival transcended old loyalties to family, clan, ancestral province, and guild associations, uniting six and a half mil\u00ad lion Chinese in support of the Chinese government. This sense of unity and allegiance was embodied in a declaration adopted at the meeting: We resolve to aid China's war for self-defense, for the vindication of the prin\u00ad ciples of the League of Nations, and for the peace of the world. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek is the only leader whom 470 million Chinese at home and abroad sup- 64 port. . . . His determination [to resist the Japanese] is the expression of the Chinese people's will to fight. Therefore, we urge Chairman Chiang to fight to the end of the war. The delegates expressed their abiding confidence in victory, pledging to help China \"cleanse herself from one hundred years of humiliation with blood and sweat,\" to buy more government bonds, to buy only Chinese products in order to promote China's industries, and to or\u00ad ganize enterprises for the development of natural resources.7 The assembly elected Tan Kah Kee chairman of the Nanyang Chinese Relief General Association (NCRGA) and Dee C. Chuan and Tjong See-gan vice-chairmen.8 Table 1 is a list of the officers. TABLE 1 A LIST OF OFFICERS OF THE NCRGA Chairman Vice-chairmen Treasurer Secretary Members of the Executive Committee Tan Kah Kee* Dee C. Chuan* Tjong See-gan* Lum Mun Tin* Sun* Chin Hean* Tan leaders in the anti-Japanese movement.) The list of officers shows that the NCRGA was predominantly a Malay- Fukienese association. It is significant too that Aw Boon Haw (Hakka) of Singapore, Ch'iu Yuan-jung (Cantonese) of Batavia, and Hung 65 Yuan-yuan (local-born Fukienese) of Batavia were not executives. Why they were excluded is not known. What is known is that Japa\u00ad nese intelligence described Aw Boon Haw as pro-Japanese and Ch'iu Yuan-jung as politically non-committed.9 The same source reported that Hung Yuan-yuan was very active in anti-Japanese activity. As the publisher of the Chinese-Malayan newspaper Sin Po, he was a leading intellectual in Java and was a KMT ideologist. Moreover, he was a translator for the KMT government's Batavia Consul General.10 His background strongly suggests a committed KMT member and a proponent of its ideology. Perhaps for those reasons he was not named to the executive board. It is interesting that there was only one KMT member, Ong Chuan-sien, on the executive board. One may conjec\u00ad ture that Tan Kah Kee and his colleagues wanted to support China but did not want KMT interference. Also in the realm of speculation is the way that Tan Kah Kee was able to pack the Executive Com\u00ad mittee with so many Fukienese. In view of his independent attitude toward the KMT, it is possible that he wanted to counterbalance Can\u00ad tonese influence in the KMT and KMT influence in the National Salvation Movement. Whatever the consequence of this factionalism, that such a diversified group met at all under one roof for the cause of China was significant to the KMT government, as evidenced by Consul General Kao's presence throughout the session.11 Finally, none of the Singapore-born elite Chinese was added to the executive board. Conspicuously absent, though, were such leading Singapore Chinese as Lim Boon Keng, Song Ong Siang, Wee Swee Teow, Chan Sze Jin, and Lim Han Hoe, who were identified as British-oriented. The fact that local-born Chinese leaders in Malaya, the Netherlands Indies (Hung Yuan-yuan), and the Philippines were excluded from the ruling circle of the NCRGA indicated that it was controlled by a group of China- born and China-oriented leaders. This exclusion of local-born and Western-oriented leaders seems to point out a division between the two groups. Furthermore, the Nanyang Chinese National Salvation Movement appeared to be promoted by the China-oriented Chinese. A test of Nanyang Hua-ch'iao allegiance to the KMT government came when Wang Ching-wei defected from Chungking in December, 1938, and, under the tutelage of the Japanese government, tried to woo the Nanyang Hua-ch'iao away from the Chiang Kai-shek govern- 66 ment.12 Shortly after the capitulation of Canton and Wuhan in Oc\u00ad tober, 1938, Reuters dispatched an unconfirmed report that Wang, vice- chairman of the KMT Central Political Committee, was desirous of a settlement of hostilities. The news drew a lightning response from the NCRGA. On October 22, Tan Kah Kee, in the name of the NCRGA, demanded that Wang Ching-wei explain and urged him to \"maintain a firm attitude and devotion to the cause of national salvation and the war of resistance.\" \"The overseas Chinese,\" Tan declared, \"will not subscribe to or support any peace movement.\" On the same day, the chairman of the NCRGA sent a cablegram to Kung Hsiang-hsi, asking him to verify the Reuters dispatch and to investigate a rumor that Chiang Kai-shek was considering resigning his post. He also exhorted Kung to issue a statement to dispel the black cloud of rumors, lest it cause incalculable damage to the contribution campaign and to the bond subscription drive, both of which were underway.18 On the following day, Tan received a telegram from Wang Ching- wei, who explained: I am absolutely opposed to surrender. But the pursuit of peace and resistance are not contradictory; they are, indeed, compatible. As long as conditions for a peaceful settlement do not compromise China's independence, why should we not pursue peace? There is no reason why this avenue should not be explored.14 In conclusion, Wang begged Tan to try to understand his position. This explanation, apparently unsatisfactory to Tan, prompted him to write two replies in succession. He strongly condemned Wang's im\u00ad prudence in speaking out for peace because his gesture would \"destroy the determination of the Chinese to fight the war.\" The language of the second letter was more blunt. Tan charged that Wang's peace gesture was a \"concession\" which, if accepted, would lead China to national suicide. As a result, China \"would be thrown into a chaotic condition and would become a laughing stock. . . .\" In his accusation, Tan intimated that Wang was guilty of treason similar to \"the plot of Ch'in Kuei to defeat Chang Chao.\"15 In a letter to Chiang Kai-shek, the patriarch demanded that the Generalissimo adhere to the letter and spirit of the Loshan Declaration, in which he had vowed that China would resist Japanese aggression for the preservation of the Chinese race, carry out a scorched-earth operation in order to halt the advance of the Japanese troops, and prepare for a protracted war of resistance.16 67 Both Chiang and Kung assured Tan of their determination to resist, advising him not to be dismayed by the rumors, and appealed for donations to the war coffers. In the midst of the verbal war between the NCRGA and Wang Ching-wei, the news of Wang's defection from Chungking in De\u00ad cember, 1938, was reported. An editorial in the Using Tao Jih Pao (Hong Kong) on December 31, 1938, expressed the Nanyang Hua- ch'iao's opinion of Wang's desertion in . The Konoye declaration [of Three Principles] on December 22 and the Wang declaration [for the cessation of the hostilities and for peace] are identical in their objectives. Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek's great speech [making this war a protracted national revolutionary war] dispel any doubt [as to the ultimate goal of China], and he will crush the sinister plot of the enemy. Wang's statement is nothing but an admission of his own guilt. What Generalissimo Chiang has said until this war is won 'anyone who speaks for peace is a traitor' is crystal clear to us and must not be forgotten. The action of Wang should neither be acquiesced to nor should it be tolerated by all Chinese abroad. Our task is to eradicate a defeatist element from our rank-and-file. Upon reading the Wang declaration, we overseas Chinese are deeply indignant at him.17 Furthermore, a flood of letters and telegrams reached Chungking, de\u00ad manding the arrest of Wang Ching-wei the traitor.18 Following Wang's defection, the Chungking government launched the National Spiritual Mobilization Movement, in February, 1939, to counteract the Wang Ching-wei affair. The KMT government mobil\u00ad ized all available mass media in an attempt to expose Wang's treason and to shatter what the Chinese called an illusory dream of Japan's New Order in Asia.19 On May 1, the Nanyang Chinese joined the Spiritual Mobilization Movement by organizing a similar movement throughout Southeast Asia, sponsored by local Chinese consulates and KMT overseas agencies.20 Every month thereafter the Chinese renewed their vow to continue boycotting Japanese merchandise, to refrain from reading enemy propaganda literature, and to give their money and strength to China. On July 21, at the height of the movement, Chiang Kai-shek delivered an address designed to boost the morale of Chinese abroad.21 Reviewing the \"Destroy-Wang Ching-wei\" movement of 1939, the Nanyang Siang Poh, in a special issue, summarized the campaign as follows: 68 Wang Ching-wei openly rebelled against China and surrendered to the enemy. It was an impudent act to betray the country in order to advance his own personal interest and ambition. Chairman Tan Kah Kee of the NCRGA im\u00ad mediately sent a telegram to the central government, demanding the prosecution of Wang Ching-wei. An anti-Wang campaign has spread rapidly like a prairie fire throughout the South Seas. . . . The will of eight million Nanyang Chinese is united in a determination to fight the traitor and other opportunists. . . . Since the beginning of the anti-Wang drive in Malaya, the feelings of the Chinese people have been high. This is evident in the press, in speech-making gatherings, and elsewhere on the streets. The Wang faction has tried in vain to infiltrate into our communities attempting to sow the seeds of dissension, but we, the National Salvation Movement, have proved our strength. Our solidarity in resistance is attributed to the success in the [Spiritual] Mobilization and education. In the past year, the NCRGA has conducted its anti-Wang movement. . . . Since Wang turned against China, speaker after speaker has delivered anti- Wang speeches every night, and this is a spontaneous reaction. We have observed frequently that youth groups everywhere have presented anti-Wang stage dramas at a fund-raising garden party, and that anti-Wang songs are popular. To sum up, the anti-Wang campaign in Malaya in the past year, in cooperation with the anti-Wang extermination operation in China, has fulfilled its objectives.22 This summary may contain some elements of propaganda and self- exultation, but it is an accurate description of the Chinese attitude to\u00ad ward the Wang Ching-wei episode. As the editorial states, Wang did appeal to the Nanyang Hua-ch'iao for their support. He got in touch with Chinese leaders whom he had known since his revolutionary days in the early 1900's. After his defection, he communicated with his friends in the South Seas, and in a defense of his turncoat behavior confirmed his belief in the Konoye Proclamation of Three Principles.23 His appeals, however, evoked almost no support in Chinese com\u00ad munities. What little support there was came from persons who,24 as a student of the overseas Chinese has observed, were simply expressing their old comradeship with Wang Ching-wei or just making a gesture of courtesy. This critic was skeptical about the ability of these would- be supporters to erase anti-Japanese feelings.25 Although the Nanyang Chinese had for some time been important to Japan's trade in Southeast Asia, it was the Sino-Japanese war that emphasized their potential political and economic value in Japan's war with the KMT government. The numerous studies and publications that appeared after 1937 were evidence of Japan's interest. Govern\u00ad ment and semi-government agencies and institutes, private research in\u00ad stitutes, and business firms that had anything to do with China and Southeast Asia began intensive studies of the \"Nanyang Chinese ques- 69 tion.\"26 As the war went on, the question of the Chinese in Southeast Asia became a matter of great concern. From the Japanese standpoint, the Nanyang Chinese were of vital importance for two reasons: they were a primary source of revenue for the Chungking government, providing precious foreign currency with which it could purchase much-needed war materials; and the Japanese government needed their cooperation and wealth for the realization of its program, the Greater Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere. When the Wang Ching-wei government took office in Nanking in March, 1940, it gave top priority to the creation of the Overseas Chi\u00ad nese Affairs Committee, whose purpose was to entice the Nanyang Chinese to support the new government.27 Wang Ching-wei appointed Ch'en Chi-ch'eng chairman. Ch'en, a man of no national stature, had few qualifications for the position. Ten days after the establishment of the new government, the chairman announced a new program to en\u00ad courage overseas Chinese to invest in enterprises in Japanese-occupied China and to protect the property and welfare of the Overseas Chinese. Not much was heard of the activities of the Committee after that, and Ch'en was replaced the following year. His successor, Ch'en Chun-hui, another relatively unknown official, was no more efficient than his predecessor. The fact that the Wang Ching-wei government appointed two relatively unknown chairmen is a good indication that it did not have men who could command the respect of the Nanyang Chinese. As a matter of fact, the committee was so ineffectual that by the end of 1943, the Nanking government had virtually abandoned the project. Neither Tokyo nor Nanking was able to attract the overseas Chinese to its side and to divert their wealth to the areas controlled by the Japanese.28 The Wang Ching-wei government, groomed by the Japanese as a focal point for the loyalty of the Nanyang Chinese, was a poor alter\u00ad native to the Chungking government. The Nanyang Chinese knew that the Nanking government was a puppet regime of Japan, even though it was presented as an \"independent\" government. Their loyalty to the Chungking government remained unshaken, and they resisted the Japanese until the capitulation of Japan. The Japanese and Wang Ching-wei\u2014despite his close relations with the Malayan Chinese\u2014failed to evoke even lukewarm support. Instead, they 70 faced a solid wall of resistance before December, 1941, and apathy during the Japanese occupation.29 In this respect, it is interesting to note that Wang Ching-wei, in his address at the Greater East Asian Assembly in November, 1943, did not mention any connection between his own regime and the overseas Chinese but stressed the evils of the Chungking government and the advantages of cooperation with the local Japanese-controlled administration.30 Wang appeared to have given up his efforts to entice the Nanyang Chinese to his side. The attitude of the Nanyang Chinese to the Wang Ching-wei gov\u00ad ernment was in evidence long before the installation of the new regime; on February 4, 1940, the Sin Chew Jit Poh, the Union Times, the Sin Chung Git Poh, and the Penang Git Poh cabled a joint statement to Chungking in which they condemned the \"blasphemous crime\" of Wang Ching-wei and pledged allegiance to the Chiang Kai-shek government. The cablegram ended with a demand for the prosecution of Wang, the enemy of all the Chinese people.31 The Nanyang Siang Poh and the Sin Chew Jit Poh, apparently to counter the impact of the inauguration of the Nanking government, which was scheduled for March 30, attacked Wang, branding him the \"traitor of China,\" and vowed to destroy his government. The Nanyang Shang Poh's editorial asserted that the subversive activities of the Wang Ching-wei regime would not break down the morale of the Chinese people but warned the Chinese to be alert to the enemy's scheme for peace.32 When the Nanking regime was established, Chinese newspapers throughout the South Seas opened an intense press campaign against it. They re\u00ad printed the \"Ten Anti-Wang Slogans\" supplied by the Propaganda Department of the Chungking government.33 In the meantime, local Chinese consulates and KMT agencies had taken measures to forestall the infiltration of the Nanking government's agents, who were reported to have smuggled anti-Chiang Kai-shek literature from Japanese-occupied China to Malaya.34 The KMT officials also dis\u00ad couraged Chinese from returning to China through ports in the Japanese-occupied area and encouraged them to remit money through Chungking-controlled banks and facilities so that it would not fall into the hands of either the Japanese or the Nanking government.35 In summary, the Wang government and the Japanese policy found little support in Nanyang Chinese communities. Wang's defection 71 and the establishment of his regime provided the Chinese in South\u00ad east Asia with the opportunity to renew their loyalty to Chiang Kai- shek. Lum Mun Tin, treasurer of the NCRGA, expressed the general sentiment of the Nanyang Chinese toward the war: \"We do not want peace through humiliation [such as Wang Ching-wei has offered to us]; we want an honorable peace.\"36 Never had the national con\u00ad sciousness of the Nanyang Hua-ch'iao been so high, and never had the KMT enjoyed so much prestige and support. On the one hand, increasing KMT interference in local affairs of the Nanyang Chinese created divisions between local leaders and KMT leaders; on the other, it deeply disturbed local governments which tried to avoid a diplomatic complication with Japan. Further\u00ad more, local authorities had misgivings about the dominant role of Communists in the anti-Japanese National Salvation Movement, which had become conspicuous especially after the united front had been completed by 1938. In the following pages I shall survey the development of the anti- Japanese National Salvation Movement after the formation of the NCRGA, trace the KMT and Communist activities in it, and describe the response of local authorities. The Straits Settlements and Malaya As has been noted in the previous pages, the Malayan Communists succeeded in forming a united front with non-Communists within the Chinese community.37 In April, 1939, the Party's Sixth Enlarged Plenum adopted a ten-point Program of Struggle which established an \"All-Races United Front to strive for a democratic system, to safeguard peace, and to implement action against the Japanese-German-Italian Fascist bloc.\" This Plenum also established \"a new party leadership under the controversial Loi Tek. . . .\"38 Communist influence was fast growing within the Chinese community, and the Party had be\u00ad come respectable among Chinese who otherwise would not be enamored of Communists because Communists had united with Na\u00ad tionalist Chinese to oppose the Japanese. To the British colonial authorities, the united front situation presented a difficult problem. They could hardly repress the anti-Japanese activities of the Chinese even though they knew that Communists were instigating the Chinese 72 behind the scenes. However, a change in tactics, adopted by the Malayan Communist Party (MCP) in September, 1939, reflecting the conclusion of the Soviet-German Non-Aggression Pact,39 gave the British authorities an opportunity to move against the Communist- controlled anti-Japanese operation. For instance, in December, the colonial authorities expelled Kow Say Huan, an Executive Board member of the NCRGA and a leader of the Vanguard Brigade, an auxiliary of the Anti-Enemy-Backing-Up Society, on the grounds that he was active, under an assumed name, in the illegal Vanguard Brigade and that he associated with Communists.40 In February, 1940, prominent leaders of the Penang Chinese Relief Fund-Raising Associa\u00ad tion were deported from the colony under the Banishment Ordi\u00ad nance.41 Nor did the growing vociferousness of the Chinese, inspired by their country's struggle against Japan, please the native Malays; indeed, it aroused their hostility. For example, the school authorities of the Johore state government took a serious view of reports that Chinese schools in the state had been using anti-Japanese textbooks and singing anti-Japanese songs to inculcate anti-Japanese spirit in the children. After an investigation, the state government notified the Chinese administrators that it would not permit the use of any teach\u00ad ing material that would help stir up feeling discriminatory against or injurious to the Japanese, warning that it would prosecute them for future violations.42 Meanwhile, war broke out in Europe. The MCP, at a conference in February, 1940, worked out a new policy to meet the situation. Elaborating its anti-imperialistic policies, the Party appealed to the Chinese to concentrate on helping China within the context of the All-Races United Front (now changed to the Anti-Imperialist Racial United Front) and called upon Indians and Malays to carry out their anti-British drives.43 The Communist assault on the British, however, did not continue during the effective period of the Nazi-Soviet Pact. As early as the summer of 1940, the MCP found it necessary to modify its earlier anti-British stance because of the change in the international scene. In July the Chinese Communist Party advised the MCP to \"call off its strikes and other anti-British agitation in view of Britain's current aid to China and the importance to Chungking of gaining London's intervention in the opening of the Burma Road,\"44 and 73 \"henceforth ... to concentrate on consolidating the anti-Japanese front and to support the National Salvation Movement. . . .\"45 The chang\u00ad ing international political situation since the outbreak of the war in Europe in the previous year produced an about-face in party policy, leading to the cultivation of the goodwill of Britain and emphasizing the Chinese anti-Japanese activities. The fact that the MCP had com\u00ad plied with the Chinese Communist Party's directive seems to be, as Brimmel writes, \"the first clear example of the Chinese Party's taking over the functions of the Comintern in South East Asia.\"46 The MCP's compliance with the new Chinese Communist strategy meant that the Chinese Communist Party henceforth would directly involve itself in the Nanyang Chinese National Salvation Movement, guiding the MCP from the South China Bureau of the Communist Eighth Route Army in Hong Kong.47 Chances for an effective united front National Salvation Movement would have looked better, pro\u00ad vided that the KMT and Communists had collaborated closely. How\u00ad ever, the two worked at cross purposes, intent on destroying each other. The struggle between the two parties dampened Nanyang Chinese patriotism, disappointing many oversea compatriots and splitting the unity of the National Salvation Movement. The MCP was determined to enhance its position through its appeal to nationalism and united front tactics (which also insured a certain immunity from police inter\u00ad ference). Its strategy appears to have paid off, judging from the in\u00ad crease in party membership, which by May, 1940, had increased to fifty or sixty thousand and enjoyed the support of over one-hundred thou\u00ad sand Chinese sympathizers.48 Another maneuver was to drive a wedge in the Chinese community leadership circles, creating a split among the leaders. The ultimate objective of this was to extend Communist influence at the expense of the KMT. The episode of Tan Kah Kee was an example. Evidently to cope with Communist expansion, the Chungking government sent Wu T'ieh-ch'eng, Minister of Overseas Party Affairs, to Malaya in the early months of 1940. His mission was ostensibly to solicit contributions and bond subscriptions, but his real purpose was to strengthen KMT influence through \"the so-called Tang-hua chiao- yu or Party-transformed Education of Malayan schools.\"49 After his arrival, a KMT affiliated youth organization known as the San-Min- 74 Chu-I Youth Corps was introduced into Malaya.50 After his departure, the Youth Corps carried out large-scale party activities.51 The KMT further attempted to assert its influence over the Na\u00ad tional Salvation Movement in June, 1940, when the Nationalist govern\u00ad ment issued \"Principles Governing People's Organizations During Emergency Time.\" Article 9 of the Principles made it plain that the new ordinance would apply to overseas Chinese associations. Under Articles 1, 4, and 11, all Chinese associations were to be subordinate to the Nationalist government.52 The conspicuous hand of the KMT in the Malay Chinese National Salvation Movement seemed to irritate a proud man like Tan Kah Kee, who was perfectly capable of or\u00ad ganizing anti-Japanese activities without help from the KMT govern\u00ad ment. Tan had other reasons for disliking the KMT and for becom\u00ad ing disillusioned which may have helped drive him into the arms of the Communists. He was a severe critic of Ch'en Yi, the governor of Fukien, his home province, from whence millions of Chinese emi\u00ad grated to the South Seas region. The governor's repressive policy enraged many Chinese in Southeast Asia. Subsequently, Chinese as\u00ad sociations in Manila and Malaya jointly sent a telegram to Chungking, demanding that Ch'en Yi be removed from office.53 Though Ch'en was dismissed (but not until 1942), Tan continued to attack the KMT maladministration of his native province and its impotence in the war. He became more and more critical of high KMT officials surrounding Chiang Kai-shek and more laudatory of Mao Tse-tung, whom he visited at Yenan during his nine-month fact-finding trip to China in 1940.54 Tan's unhappiness with the KMT was aggravated by the deterioration of the tenuous KMT-Communist coalition, evidence of which was already manifest as early as October, 1940, when Tan was in China. It culminated in the incident of the New Fourth Army slaughter in January, 1941. It is worthwhile to dwell upon the erosion of Tan's relations with Chungking government officials to see how he became enamored of the Communists and alienated from the KMT. Tan left for Chung\u00ad king in late March, 1940, to start a nine-month observation trip of China. As general director of six comfort groups, he travelled with one of the groups until mid-July. Thereafter, accompanied by Kow Say Huan, who had been deported by the British authorities because 75 of his involvement in terrorism and Communist activities, Tan travelled from the high plateau of the Northwest to the shore of the Southeast, meeting with high dignitaries of the Nationalist govern\u00ad ment and the Communist regime.55 From Tan's memoirs, from reports from China, and from other sources, it can be deduced that he was not generally satisfied with what he had found in China. Three things, however, grieved him most deeply\u2014the deteriorating united front, conditions in his native province of Fukien, and conditions on the Burma Road. After his return from the Northwest, as revealed in a press interview on October 4, Tan hastened to visit Yenan because of his concern for the state of the KMT-Communist coalition, which had been plagued with inces\u00ad sant friction. According to one account, Chiang Kai-shek opposed Tan's proposed trip to the Chinese Communist wartime capital and tried to prevent his visit to Yenan, denouncing the Chinese Com\u00ad munists as evil. Tan, however, explained that he was on a fact-finding mission and that he was obliged to report to his compatriots what he had seen in China\u2014including Yenan. It was from this time on, the account continues, that the KMT government attempted to obstruct his fact-finding activities and to put him under surveillance wherever he went.56 During a week's stay at Yenan, Tan exchanged views with Mao Tse-tung, chairman of the Chinese Communist Party; Chu Teh, commander-in-chief of the Chinese Red Army; Chou En-lai, vice- chairman of the Military Committee; and Wang Ming, a top party official. When Tan \"admonished them with tears\" to stop their in\u00ad ternal quarrel with the KMT, they all assured him of their support of Chiang Kai-shek and the Chungking government.57 Tan left Yenan with the conviction that the antagonism would cause no more prob\u00ad lems.58 But it is not surprising that he was impressed by the austerity and discipline of the wartime capital of the Communist regime, ac\u00ad customed as he was to the moral laxity in Chungking-controlled China. Although he had had connections with the Communists through his anti-Japanese organizations and through Kow Say Huan,59 there is no convincing evidence that he turned to Communism after his visit to Yenan in 1940. If there was a turning point in his long career as the leader of Nanyang Chinese communities, it was his visit to his native province 76 of Fukien, which he had not seen for nineteen years. Tan recorded in his memoirs his distress over the miserable conditions in Fukien under the graft-ridden administration of General Ch'en Yi. The land tax, he wrote, was exceedingly high, and the tax assessment was arbi\u00ad trary. People were suffering from taxes paid in silver as well as from the soaring and unstable price of rice. He denounced the corrupt pro\u00ad vincial administration for operating a transport company, which com\u00ad peted with private companies, driving them out of business and forcing up the prices of consumer goods. As a result, people were starving, and some desperate citizens committed suicide. Tan reported that no one dared speak up for fear of reprisal. Such were the conditions that on several occasions moved Tan to write to Chairman Chiang Kai- shek and President Lin Shen. He demanded an immediate correction of the conditions, which, he said, should not be allowed to exist in wartime China. He also confronted Ch'en Yi with demands that he take steps to eradicate the corruption in Fukien province.60 Though Tan received replies from Chiang, and Ch'en Yi was eventually re\u00ad moved, the damage had been done. At the conclusion of the journey that took him into fifteen prov\u00ad inces, Tan, in his speech before the legislative body of the Nationalist government, praised Chiang Kai-shek but rebuked his advisers for incompetency.61 He criticized the poor administration and mainte\u00ad nance of the Burma Road, despite his earlier recommendations for improvement to higher authorities.62 His harshest condemnation fell upon the corrupt Fukienese government and central government of\u00ad ficials, on greedy merchants in Chungking, on demoralized young\u00ad sters, and on stifling press censorship. He said that the press was so severely censored that newspapers were not fulfilling their function; that although the Nanyang Chinese were united in the boycott drive, much enemy merchandise was publicly displayed and sold because greedy merchants were in collusion with corrupt officials to fatten their purses; that high officials and their wives were squandering money night after night at the state guest house, which was managed by Kung Hsiang-hsi; and that men were still wearing the Manchu uniform and short coats, and women were wearing long robes, high- heeled shoes, nail polish, and so much perfume that they were seduc\u00ad tive!63 Then Tan found another opportunity to express his opinions 77 when he was asked to speak about his trip to the northwest before a meeting sponsored by the China Foreign Relations Association. He praised Communist-liberated areas, where oppressive taxes had been abolished, education promulgated, irrigation improved, and agricul\u00ad ture developed, where friendly relations existed between soldiers and citizens, and officials were honest and unselfish. Then he chided KMT reactionaries who persisted in opposing the united front at a time of national crisis, appealing to all political parties to unite at once to resist the enemy and to settle their disputes after China's victory.64 These blunt remarks were reported to have caused consternation among the government officials. Subsequently, according to Tan, the KMT government, through its consulate, asked the British authorities in Singapore to deny him entrance to the city because he was a Com\u00ad munist sympathizer. Immediately following this request, the KMT government sent General Wu T'ieh-ch'eng, Minister of Overseas Party Affairs, to Singapore, where he attempted to interfere with a welcome- home ceremony for Tan and canvassed for the election of NCRGA officers in order to unseat him.65 The New Fourth Army incident in January, 1941, in which the KMT troops attacked and killed many Communist soldiers, was for Tan another source of disappointment in the Nationalist government. His observations on the incident indicate that he was ready to break away from the KMT government. This state of his mind was cor\u00ad roborated by a train of events taking place from January to April. He placed the blame for the attack squarely upon both \"pro-Japanese and anti-Japanese elements\" in the KMT government; viz., Ho Ying-ch'in, chief of the General Staff, and Pai Ch'ung-hsi, deputy chief of the Gen\u00ad eral Staff.66 He called the incident a \"conspiracy\" hatched by the pro- Japanese faction who wanted to surrender to Japan, not to re-arm a \"genuine anti-Japanese people's army,\" the New Fourth Army.67 He seemed certain that because General Ho and General Pai were less anti-Japanese than they were anti-Communist they did not want Com\u00ad munists fighting on the KMT side against the Japanese.68 Tan had drifted away from the KMT government, but he had not embraced Communism, although his interpretation of the New Fourth Army incident was much closer to that of the Communists than to that of the KMT.69 78 Then in February, Tan suddenly and dramatically announced his intention to resign from all public offices connected with the Nationalist government.70 His announcement seemed to be a somewhat theatrical gesture to counteract rumors, allegedly spread by Wu T'ieh-ch'eng, branding him a Communist and a traitor.71 It appears that he sought to force the KMT-Communist issue in order to allow the Nanyang Chinese to judge him; it was a calculated move to decide the issue of the united front which he had supported and in which all Nanyang Hua-ch'iao had a stake. He threatened to resign if he did not get a vote of confidence. Moreover, he was indignant because his integrity had been questioned, and he denounced General Wu and Consul Gen\u00ad eral Kao for calling him a Communist. At the opening meeting of the second congress of the NCRGA, held in Singapore in late March, to which 87 associations sent 164 delegates, he not only reiterated his criticism of the corrupt KMT officials, landlords, and profiteers in Fukien province, and of the KMT government's ignorance of condi\u00ad tions in the lower strata,72 but also attacked General Wu's wartime record as the governor of Kwangtung province. General Wu, he revealed, had removed his personal belongings in military vehicles and abandoned the populace of Canton to the advancing enemy troops.73 Tan's unexpected resignation and his charges against KMT govern\u00ad ment high officials at the NCRGA were a bombshell, evoking a mix\u00ad ture of astonishment, disbelief, and chagrin, and endangering the unity of both the Nanyang Chinese National Salvation Movement and Chi\u00ad nese communities. Consul General Kao, who was present on the opening day of the NCRGA meeting, replied to Tan's charges, ad\u00ad monishing the delegates \"not to destroy a unity ... by spreading words detrimental to the sacredness of the [Chinese] state.\" And, without mentioning Tan's name, he warned him that: \"It is unpardonable to attack the government's internal matters in the name of patriotism and national salvation. It is anachronistic to maintain non-sectarianism [at the time of the national emergency].\"74 Kao's criticism of Tan's policy of non-favoritism to either the Nationalists or the Communists and his intimation that Tan was deceitful threw the conference into an uproar.75 The following day, Tan denounced the Consul General, saying that he had \"insulted the Chinese compatriots abroad,\" and pro\u00ad posed that Kao's speech be censored and Kao barred from the con- 79 ference.76 The motion passed, and the Consul General was shut out for the rest of the session. Meanwhile, General Wu categorically de\u00ad nied the allegation and joined the chorus accusing Tan of having supported Chiang Kai-shek with \"his lips but not with his heart.*'77 Local Chinese newspapers, too, were divided on the controversy. The Sin Chew ]it Poh, Aw Boon Haw's paper, upbraided Tan, claiming that his contempt for the Consul General was tantamount to an insult to the Chinese state,78 but the independent Hsien Tai Jit Poh of Penang demanded that General Wu be executed before a firing squad.79 Tan's re-election to the chairmanship of the NCRGA was proof of his vindication. Tjong See-gan and Yu Khe Thai were vice-chairmen. The attack upon Ch'en Yi and his Fukien government officials con\u00ad tinued at the Nanyang Fukienese Chinese General Assembly, which convened on April l.80 The Assembly gave unanimous support to Tan's demands for reform in Fukien province and for punishment of the evil officials, but it paid tributes to Chiang Kai-shek and Lin Shen, pledging its support of their gallant resistance.81 The Tan-KMT rift caused bad feelings between the Fukienese Chi\u00ad nese and the Chungking government, but it did not do irreparable damage to Nanyang Chinese-Chungking relations.82 Tan did not attack Chiang Kai-shek and Lin Shen during his quarrel with Consul General Kao and General Wu; in fact, he and his organizations com\u00ad mitted themselves to the government at Chungking. The reason for what appeared to be statements sympathetic to the Communist posi\u00ad tion was his strong attachment to his native province and to China, whose moral fiber was being weakened by venal bureaucrats in the midst of the war. Having been active in relief projects and economic and welfare programs for both Fukien province and China for many years, Tan could not tolerate corruption, exploitation, and incompe\u00ad tence in either the KMT or the Communist Party. His first loyalty appears to have been to China, not to a particular political party, as he declared at the second NCRGA meeting. \"If the Chinese want security in the South Seas,\" he said, \"the fatherland must be defended first, and the situation in Southeast Asia will improve when the situation in China turns better.\"83 It goes without saying that Tan supported Chiang Kai-shek because he respected Chiang as the leader of China and as the personification of China's nationalism, not because he ad- 80 mired Chiang's personality and beliefs. There was no evidence that Tan disliked Generalissimo Chiang, and the two leaders had a mutual respect. That respect explains why Tan did not criticize Chiang Kai- shek but supported his leadership and why he told Chou En-lai in Yenan that his position was that of Pu-p'ien-pu-tang (favoring no party). Tan's remarks in praise of the discipline of the Communist Chinese and in denunciation of the laxity of the KMT Chinese were the natural response of a man who admired high standards of morale and competence. His statements are to be viewed in that context; therefore, it seems, Brimmel erred when he said that the Tan-KMT dispute was \"the beginning of the transference of Chinese nationalist allegiance from the Kuomintang to the Chinese Communist Party . . . ,\"84 Neither Tan nor his Nanyang compatriots were preparing in 1941 to transfer their allegiance either to the KMT or the Chinese Communist Party; they were committed to China. It is true that in 1941, Tan was more sympathetic toward the Chinese Communists than he had been in 1939,85 as his continuous association with Kow Say Huan, with whom he travelled to Yenan, and his comments on Communist Chinese discipline and on the New Fourth Army incident showed. Although he may have been a sympathizer, he was not in 1941 an ideological Communist sympathizer.86 To what degree Com\u00ad munists in Singapore helped drive a wedge between Tan and KMT officials is a moot question. That they strengthened their position and profited at the expense of the KMT is undeniable. Meanwhile, relations between the British authorities and the Chi\u00ad nese community had deteriorated, partly because of an eruption of intense Chinese anti-Japanese activity directed by the San-Min-Chu-I Youth Corps87 and partly because of Chinese resentment of a British decision to set the ceiling on remittances at SSJS250 per person.88 The British authorities felt uneasy about the intensified anti-Japanese cam\u00ad paign because it strained Britain's relations with Japan just when Tokyo was increasing pressure on Britain to close the Burma Road. From the summer of 1940, to the summer of 1941, the San-Min-Chu-I Youth Corps stepped up both anti-Japanese and anti-British cam\u00ad paigns. The British authorities were obliged to take a repressive mea\u00ad sure against the Corps in June, 1941, and in November, the British sent a mission to Chungking to adjust Sino-Anglo relations. When the 81 mission returned to Singapore, nothing was said about ironing out the differences in the government's relations with China. Because war with Japan was imminent, Britain was no longer in a mood to employ a policy of neutrality.89 The Japanese invasion of Malaya on December 8, 1941, ended Tan's rift with the KMT, and it brought the British and Chinese together for the defense against a common enemy. On the same day, Chiang Kai-shek addressed the Nanyang Chinese by radio, ordering them to mobilize their resources to resist the invasion90 because the \"victory of the Allies means our victory.\"91 Four days later, General Wu T'ieh- ch'eng urged his overseas compatriots to \"cooperate with local authori\u00ad ties\" to defend Malaya and Singapore against the Japanese.92 Only the Chinese could understand the call because they were threatened by the Japanese, who were the enemy of China, their mother country, which had been fighting for four-and-a-half years. The Nanyang Chinese, one observer said, \"were all sympathetic to Free China's causes and had been greatly stirred by her gallant struggle.\"93 A group of Singapore Chinese community leaders visited Sir Shenton Thomas, the Governor General, and told him that they had agreed to sink their common differences and to give every support to the local government in the prosecution of the war.94 Encouraged by the surge of national spirit, the Governor General invited Consul General Kao and Yeh Kung-ch'ao, chief of the KMT Information Bureau at Singapore, to request Chinese assistance for defense against the Japanese army, which was advancing very rapidly southwards.95 The three having reached an agreement, Kao and Yeh asked Tan Kah Kee to organize a committee to implement the agreement of cooperation. The out\u00ad come was the formation of the Chung Kuo Council for General Mobili\u00ad zation on December 31. The primary objective of the Council was to mobilize Chinese resources for the pursuit of the war. Ian Morrison, a British war correspondent, reported that Chinese under the Council's direction did excellent work in supplying the British with laborers for building defense.96 It is not clear, however, whether Chinese leaders in Singapore de\u00ad manded as a price for cooperation that the British authorities im\u00ad mediately release Chinese political prisoners\u2014including Communists \u2014from the Changi Gaol or whether the British authorities freed them 82 out of humanitarian consideration. Circumstantial evidence seems to support the former conjecture. The British soon freed Chinese prison\u00ad ers from Changi and welcomed the Communists whom they had so recently suppressed. The British did know \"the great influence which the Malayan Communist Party still wielded amongst the poorer sec\u00ad tions of the Chinese population/' and the Party had an excellent or\u00ad ganization in these people, through which the British could mobilize them. Acting as an agent for mobilizing Chinese for civil defense, the local government de facto recognized the Party, which had been illegal. The Communists now joined the British and non-Communist Chinese residents, voicing their determination to give wholehearted backing to the colonial government in the war against the Japanese invaders.97 When the Japanese invasion of Singapore was imminent, the local government decided to call Chinese volunteers and to arm them for fighting. Morrison later described Chinese response to the appeal in the following words: The call for volunteers provoked an immediate and wide spread response. The volunteers were all sorts, labourers and students, middle-aged men and boys in their teens. . . . There were guerrilla experts from China, sent down to Singapore by the Chungking government to teach guerrilla warfare. Most of the volunteers came either from the Kuomintang or from the Communist organiza\u00ad tions.98 Under the command of Colonel Dalley, officials of the Malay Civil Service, the Forestry Service, and the Malay Police, and young planters from up-country trained these Chinese, who were destined to become the nucleus of the Malayan People's Anti-Japanese Army.\" Meanwhile, a large number of the Chinese had enlisted in a small force of irregulars, organized by the Chung Kuo Council, which was directed by ten KMT and ten Communist members, including Tan Kah Kee and Loi Tek, the Secretary General of the Communist Party.100 According to Colonel Sugita Ichiji, a Twenty-fifth Army senior staff officer in charge of intelligence, these irregulars, operating as espionage agents on the mainland of Malaya, \"effectively\" obstructed Japanese military operations behind battle lines.101 In the battle of Singapore, both volunteers and irregulars left for their battle stations singing a song which had been especially written for the occasion: 83 Arise, arise, those who do not want to be slaves. Build a new Great Wall with your flesh and blood.102 Many units fought to the last soldier; a Chinese volunteer platoon made a gallant stand against the invaders in the north of Singapore until all perished. Others, including Tan Kah Kee, gave up the futile resistance.103 After sending to China the 13 million yuan that had been collected in a contribution campaign begun in early December (this drive terminated in late January, 1942), Tan escaped from Singa\u00ad pore to Sumatra in a small ferry boat on the night of February 2. From Sumatra he went to Malang in Java, where he hid from the Kempeitai until the end of the war. No one blamed him for leaving Singapore, however. After the capitulation of the British fortress, thousands of Chinese were arrested in a series of Kempeitai roundups in February and March, and hundreds were executed for anti-Japanese activities between 1937 and 1941.104 Summarizing the Chinese fighting spirit, Morrison, who witnessed Chinese fighting the Japanese troops in Malaya-Singapore, wrote: They had what the Indian and Malay troops lacked, a personal venom against the Japanese, who for over four years had been killing their fellow-countrymen in China. They were inspired by something which nearly all the other fighting forces lacked.105 The Dutch East Indies The KMT and the Communists were less active in the Netherlands Indies than in the British territories. Although the KMT-financed Chinese press had been vocal in appealing to the Indies-Chinese to boy\u00ad cott, the boycott hurt Japan's trade with the Dutch colony less than it hurt her trade with Malaya and the Philippines. Communism was also weak because the Indonesian Communist Party and other left- wing organizations were too feeble to provide leadership. Moreover, the Dutch authorities were so strict in suppressing political movement, regardless of its coloration, that during 1938 and 1939, the Communists complained of the \"pro-Japanese views\" of Dutch officials and of their restriction of the anti-Japanese movement.106 The Communist charge of \"pro-Japanese views\" was not accurate. The policy of the Netherlands government was to avoid giving Japan an opportunity to establish a large-scale propaganda beachhead in the Indies, where she was known to have been giving secret aid to an 84 indigenous national independent movement.107 To minimize the chance of Japanese intervention, the Dutch restricted both Chinese and Japanese activity. For instance, the government banned the teach\u00ad ing of political ideology in Chinese schools as well as the political activity of Chinese teachers, and it prohibited the public sale of twelve anti-Japanese books and magazines.108 The Dutch authorities were equally uneasy about increasing Japanese intelligence activity and a propaganda drive, organized by the Japanese Foreign Office and mili\u00ad tary, to attract local Chinese youths to the Japanese maintained an anti-Chiang Kai-shek editorial policy. The inauguration of the Wang Ching-wei regime accelerated the Japanese campaign with the official blessing of the Koain, in cooperation with the Japanese Army and Foreign Ministries. The Foreign Ministry sponsored a Japanese tennis team's trip to the Indies, where the team played Chinese teams to promote friendship. The Government and related agencies seriously considered a cultural exchange program with the Indies, like the one with the Philippines. Chinese athletes, students and teachers would spend a summer in Japan, and Japanese teachers would teach in Chinese schools in the Dutch colony.110 An official Dutch document describing Japanese subversive activities among the Chinese reads: The Japanese ever since the occupation of Southern China . . . had special means to influence the Chinese residents in the Netherlands Indies. . . . They tried to estrange those Chinese from the government of General Chiang Kai-shek and transform them into followers of the pseudo-Nanking regime. This was done partly by encouraging them to invest in the occupied Southern China sec\u00ad tion and guaranteeing their safety of person and belongings; and partly through pressure in the form of a threat of confiscation or action against the relatives at home. [The] local organization of the so-called Koain, the council for the elevation of Asia, ... in cooperation with the Army and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs . . . , is charged with the execution of the policies of the Japanese government toward the Chinese. There is not the slightest doubt as to the nature of these politics in the light of the instructions of the Japanese Foreign Ministry of the 21st of June, 1939, regarding control on the politics concerning the overseas Chinese.111 On the other hand, Yoshizumi Tamegoro/12 the editor of the Higashi Indo Nippo, who had been active among the Chinese, disagreed with the official approach to propaganda. He argued that most Chinese in 85 the Indies had fused with the Netherlands Indies, and that they wanted \"to become East Indians before anything else. . . .\" There\u00ad fore, he urged, \"let us make use of the common fate of Indonesians and Chinese and arouse their enthusiasm for the construction of a new Asia.\"113 Neither the official policy nor Yoshizumi's plan won the Chinese over to the Tokyo-Nanking alliance to a significant degree before war broke out in December, 1941.114 The Chinese persisted in the National Salvation Movement. Irri\u00ad tated by the dogged National Salvation Movement and its professed support of the Chiang Kai-shek government, the Japanese kept pres\u00ad sure upon the Dutch government to \"exercise rigid control\"115 over Chinese residents' \"pro-Chiang Kai-shek and anti-Japanese attitude,\" and complained as late as August, 1941, of what they regarded as the \"pro-Chinese and anti-Japanese\" posture of the Dutch government.116 The Chinese were, however, aware of their limitations in carrying out the boycott against Japanese merchandise because of the political con\u00ad ditions under which they lived, as Tjong See-gan, vice-chairman of the NCRGA, admitted at the first NCRGA meeting, in October, 1938.117 He was quoted as having said that Indies-Chinese participation in a politically oriented boycott could not match that of compatriots in other countries. Upon his return from Singapore he and other dele\u00ad gates were interrogated by the Dutch police. Consequently, the Chi\u00ad nese concentrated, in response to the Chungking government's re\u00ad quests, on the cash-and-material-donation campaign. In Batavia, the Chinese Charity Committee asked the Chinese com\u00ad munity to economize on New Year's festivals, weddings, and funerals and to donate the money saved. The Batavia Charity Committee also mobilized school children for the contribution campaign. Organized in squads, as were children in Malaya, they solicited contributions on Chinese national holidays and festival days. They had collected 36,000 guilders by late December, 1937. In 1938, they collected 140,000 guild\u00ad ers and in 1939, 50,000 guilders.118 Still another method was one of special contributions on such occasions as the visit of Wu T'ieh-ch'eng to Java and the presidential recognition of Consul General Ko for his distinguished work in raising money. At the reception in honor of General Wu, in October, 1940, Chinese raised six million yuan. While the general was in Java, from October 18 to November 14, 1940, more 86 than twenty million yuan was collected. Chinese communities in Java also raised 60,000 yuan at a party in January, 1941, celebrating the promotion of Consul Ko.119No opportunity to collect from the Chi\u00ad nese was overlooked; proceeds from athletic competitions, concerts, stage shows, movies, garden parties, art exhibits, and Chinese chess games all went into the treasury of the Chinese government. The donation of quinine or of money to buy it continued, but each year the contributions decreased. In 1939, Indies-Chinese sent several million tablets of quinine worth about 400,000 guilders; in 1940, they sent approximately 130,000 guilders' worth. Contributions for the purchase of winter clothes in 1939 and 1940 totaled 60,000 guilders.120 Those facts show that the Chinese were participating in the Na\u00ad tional Salvation Movement as late as 1941, although the boycott had long before ceased to be effectual. It was so weak that it posed no threat to Japanese trade. The cash contributions, too, began to de\u00ad crease in late 1938. That decrease indicates a weakening of Chinese financial capability. However, a drop in contributions should not be regarded as evidence that the Indies-Chinese had lost interest in China. That General Wu was able to solicit twenty million yuan in less than one month in the fall of 1940 disproves such an interpretation. It is also to be noted that Consul Ko appeared to enjoy an excellent relationship with the Chinese community and its leaders. The proof is the fact that Chinese in Java raised 60,000 yuan to celebrate Chiang Kai-shek's recognition of Ko's distinguished work. From this limited amount of information, we can deduce that the longevity of the Chinese National Salvation Movement can be in part attributed to Consul Ko's close personal relationship with leaders of the Chinese community. There is very little information on the National Salvation Move\u00ad ment in the outer islands. Fragmented reports tell that Chinese in northern Sumatra, particularly those in Medan, organized the Federa\u00ad tion of Chinese Associations for the Relief of China when war engulfed Southeast Asia.121 According to those reports, Chinese undertook a variety of anti-Japanese activities, under the leadership of a five-man board of directors cooperating with the Chinese Consulate and the KMT. Chinese in other cities and towns (Tandjoengbalai, Langsa, Pematang Siantar, Padang, Palembang, and Pangkalpinang) followed the example of the Medan Chinese. Like many Chinese leaders in 87 Java, most of the Chinese who had been active in the National Salva\u00ad tion Movement were caught unprepared for the swift Japanese invasion and conquest. A number of them were arrested in the weeks and months following the conquest. In northern Sumatra, five prominent Chinese (one of them was Tjong Ch'ing-te) who composed the board of directors of the Federation were in a group of fifty-nine captured by the Japanese. Twenty-eight were released when they \"pledged loyalty to Japan.\" In southern Sumatra, the Japanese gendarmarie rounded up thirty-three leading Chinese, eliminating, in all likelihood, the core of the Chinese leadership in Palembang. Many are believed to have been executed. The Philippines By the time the Sino-Japanese war was a year old, an economic boycott had spread throughout the Philippine Islands. The boycott and inspection were so competently administered that by September there was little movement of Japanese merchandise. In order to achieve even better results, the Philippine Resist-the-Enemy Committee issued in October new boycott regulations to supplement rules promulgated earlier in the year.122 The new boycott regulations closed loopholes and stiffened the penalties for violation. They also gave boycotting committees and the resist-the-enemy committee more power in enforc\u00ad ing the boycott. For instance, Chinese merchants were forbidden to buy Japanese goods through European and American firms, and a piece of merchandise was declared an enemy article if one-tenth of its content was raw material of Japanese origin. A truck owner was sub\u00ad ject to punishment if he allowed his truck to be used to transport Japanese goods. A person who violated the new regulations would be branded a traitor; his name, address, and domicile in China would be made public; and the Chinese government would be notified that punishment had been administered. Members of the committees were empowered to inspect the stores of suspected violators. As a result, Japanese businessmen felt the impact of the tight boycott regulations, particularly after holiday seasons. Their situation was serious enough to disturb Consul Kihara, who had been lobbying to prevent the passage of an unfavorable immigration bill. For funds, he relied heavily on local Japanese companies. Partly because \"Japanese com- 88 panies in the Philippines were being seriously affected by a Chinese- instigated anti-Japanese boycott,\" Consul Kihara found that \"a short\u00ad age of locally available funds\" forced him to ask the Foreign Ministry in Tokyo for money.123 In May, 1939, the PREC found it necessary to draft new rules for stricter enforcement of the boycott\u2014Regulations Governing the Purge and Registration of Enemy Goods.124 Under the new rules, Chinese merchants were required to register within five days the description, quantity, trade marks, and prices of their stocks. The passage of the two boycott regulations in seven months may indicate that there were still some opportunistic Chinese merchants who could not miss an opportunity to make money by selling Japanese articles or some dis\u00ad sident ones who did not consider the boycott effective in harassing Japan or aiding China. According to a Japanese source, since the be\u00ad ginning of May some Chinese merchants in the Philippines had been importing from Shanghai Japanese shirts, towels, shoes, and other goods labeled \"Made in Shanghai\" at a discount of 30 per cent because of the exchange rate of the yen on the Shanghai market.125 It also appears that the passage of the rules requiring the registration of enemy merchandise was a move to counter Wang Ching-wei's peace appeal to Nanyang Chinese communities following his defection from Chung\u00ad king in December, 1938. Some Chinese, particularly older ones who still owned property in Fukien province, were said to be sympathetic to Wang's peace move. According to reports, they were reluctant to participate in the National Salvation Movement and secretly supported Wang Ching-wei but were afraid to speak out because they feared public accusation and the desecration of their ancestral graves in Fukien province.126 Although the boycott in the Philippines con\u00ad tinued, there were signs that enthusiasm for it was faltering; and in early 1941, it began to lose its effectiveness. The decline was owing partly to limited Chinese capital, which could not endure a prolonged boycott, and partly to the probability of an American-Japanese war. As in the British colonies, KMT influence was on the rise in the Philippines until 1937. In the early 1930's the Philippine Chinese KMT was led by Ong Chuan-sien, the principal of the Chinese National School; Tai Kui-sheng (Tai K'uei-sheng), later the vice-minister of the Department of Overseas Affairs; and Tai King-hwa (Te Kin Fue 89 or Te Kin Hua), Tai Kui-sheng's uncle and the manager of the KMT paper, Kong Li Po.127 Upon appointment to the KMT Executive Com\u00ad mittee, Ong relinquished his post in the KMT headquarters in Manila and returned to China. Subsequently, a young group took over. In 1940, Sy Yat-sien, a former insurance agent; Sai Kuo-ch'uan, proprietor of the Indianhead Textile Co.; and Tan Unliong, president of the Tan Family Association and owner of the Tien-tan Lard Manufacturing Co., were members of the Standing Executive Committee. Moreover, Sai held an office in the General Affairs Department; Sy, in the Or\u00ad ganization Department. Tseng T'ing-ehuan was listed as chief of Propaganda and Cua Chun-ti, a former teacher in Cebu, as secretary.128 Despite the KMT's secure position in the Chinese community, difficulties with local party members and business leaders arose soon after Ong left Manila. Sometime in 1939, the central KMT head\u00ad quarters in China sent Wang Cheng-t'ing, a member of the Central Executive Committee, to Manila to establish a San-Min-Chu-I Youth Corps chapter to conduct donation and bond campaigns.129 Apparently, Wang was not successful in establishing the Youth Corps; it was not founded until shortly before the outbreak of the Pacific War. Con\u00ad sequently, the central KMT headquarters found it necessary to return Ong Chuan-sien to Manila, where he arrived in late January, 1940. Ong, highly respected by his fellow Chinese in Manila, was able there to organize a Chung Shan Hsiieh She (Sun Yat-sen's Society), which he directed. The leaders of the Society were \"several prominent busi\u00ad nessmen and a handful of intellectuals, most of whom were teachers of Chiang Kai-shek High [School],\" and they were believed to have \"strong pro-CC clique leaning.\"130 Meanwhile, friction arose between the junior and senior factions of the Party, apparently over difference in anti-Japanese strategy, for it was in the spring of 1940 that assaults on Chinese merchants and fights between factions broke out in Manila. It was clear that the junior faction, including Sy Yat-sien, Cua Chun-ti, and Tseng T'ing-chuan, wanted a more aggressive and militant policy than did the elder party leaders like Sai Kuo-ch'uan and Tan Unliong. For some months, the younger leaders had their way, as Japanese were intimidated\u2014even assaulted. Not much is known about the junior faction's reasons for challenging the party elders and jeopardizing Chinese relations with 90 the Philippine authorities (which had been deteriorating for some time) by their militancy. The younger leaders appeared to be im\u00ad patient to get boycott results, but the older leaders had a stake in busi\u00ad ness, which would suffer should the boycott be intensified. That may be the reason for the factionalism that contributed to the disintegra\u00ad tion of discipline and to the rash of violence. The Japanese Consul General, Yoshida Tan'ichiro, was so deeply troubled by the turn of events that he asked Manila authorities to take stringent measures to suppress Chinese anti-Japanese activities and to apprehend persons re\u00ad sponsible for violence. At the same time he presented a list of or\u00ad ganizations that had been instigating illegal activities, including the Chinese Commercial News and the Foofyen Times.131 The in-fighting continued throughout summer and fall. In Oc\u00ad tober, Wu T'ieh-ch'eng arrived in Manila and offered to mediate between the two groups, whose struggle was contributing to the de\u00ad moralization of the Chinese National Salvation Movement by en\u00ad dangering party unity. His intercession, however, did not close the gulf that separated the two factions, and the rivalry remained.132 In 1941, the Party faced another factional struggle, which split it between local KMT leaders and San-Min-Chu-I Youth Corps leaders. According to Chen, the central KMT government had sent Lin Tso- mei to the Philippines \"shortly before the war\" to organize the Youth Corps, which immediately quarreled with the local KMT head\u00ad quarters about discipline. The Youth Corps refused to submit to the discipline of the local Party, claiming that it had been set up \"by the order of the central government.\" On the other hand, the local Party headquarters insisted that the Youth Corps submit since \"the Kuomin- tang headquarters in Manila was the supreme party organ in the Chi\u00ad nese colony, and it had power to put all other Kuomintang oganiza- tions under its administrative control.\"183 This struggle appears to have been a rivalry between the Chungking-KMT-oriented leaders such as Lin Tso-mei, Sy Yat-sien, Cua Chlin-ti, C. C. Fang, and Hsieh Teh-ch'ao, on the one hand, and the Manila KMT-business-oriented leaders such as Sai Kuo-ch'iian and Tan Unliong, on the other. Sy, Cua, Fang, and Hsieh were allies and had been close since 1940, when they spent several months in Chungking receiving political training. They were said to have had friendly relations with top government of- 91 facials.134 Therefore, the inference is that the four leaders and Lin Tso-mei were Chungking-oriented. On the other hand, Sai Kuo-ch'iian and Tan Unliong were businessmen and KMT members with strong ties in Manila. They had received no indoctrination in Party ideology and no military and political training in Chungking as their rivals had.135 Another tension was between the KMT and business circles, pos\u00ad sibly as a result of the boycott and of strained relations between Japan and the United States since the beginning of 1941, creating ill feelings between Ong Chuan-sien and Alfonso Sycip Hsueh Fen-shih. Alfonso Sycip, president of the Manila Chinese Chamber of Commerce and vice-president of the PREC, was one of the members in the Chamber of Commerce group who was aware of the difficulties involved in a boycott of Japanese products. It was reported that Alfonso Sycip tried to discourage the Chinese business group from the boycott in February, 1938, knowing well the economic consequences of such boycotting.136 Although he had supported the National Salvation Movement from the beginning, he did not approve of a boycott. As the boycott entered its second year, it began to hurt the Chinese economic position as much as it hurt Japanese trade. Aware of the difficulty, Alfonso Sycip spoke out on the subject to Chinese businessmen at the meeting of the Hua-ch'iao Business Recovery Committee. \"The Chinese must regain their primary mission [of being businessmen],\" he counseled, \"and must not be excessively indulged in military and political affairs.\"137 On another occasion, he accused Ong Chuan-sien of having exploited the Chinese in the interests of the KMT by \"politicizing\" the National Salvation Movement beyond its proper role. Alfonso Sycip, as presi\u00ad dent of the Chamber of Commerce and vice president of the PREC, seemed to be a frustrated man in February, 1941, when he decided to retire from the presidency of the Chamber of Commerce. He pleaded that he was no longer capable of carrying out the heavy burden of office and of protecting the welfare of the Chinese community in general and the business community in particular. Only after re\u00ad ceiving a flood of mail from various associations throughout the Philippine Islands, did he retract his resignation and agree to stay on for one more term.138 There was division not only within the KMT hierarchy, between 92 the Chungking-oriented KMT faction and the Manila-oriented faction, and between the KMT and the business circles, but also between the KMT and the Communists. As I pointed out in Chapter I, there was some evidence of Communist infiltration of the National Salvation Movement in the Philippines. A left-wing group grew rapidly, particu\u00ad larly after the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese hostilities.139 Parallel with the development of this left-wing organization was the Philippine Is\u00ad lands Communist Party's interest in the Chinese National Salvation Movement. By the beginning of 1938, the Kuomintang-Communist alli\u00ad ance against Japan was \"in full force\" in the Philippine Islands.140 The League for the Defense of Democracy, the Friends of the Soviet, and the Civil Liberties Union formed the Congress for Peace and Collec\u00ad tive Security. Its aim was to organize an anti-Japanese boycott, and it cooperated with the Chinese community to do so.141 This cooperation culminated in October, 1938, at the Third Congress of the Communist Party. The united front against Japan was quite in evidence. Besides an address by a Kuomintang representative and the reading of greet\u00ad ings from Mme. Chiang Kai-shek, there were repeated references to the \"gallant resistance of the Chinese against Japan.\"142 Following the Congress, the Party urged the Philippine government to boycott Japa\u00ad nese goods.143 Reporting the extent of Communist involvement in the Chinese anti-Japanese movement, acting Consul General Kihara in\u00ad formed his home office in May, 1939, that Communists and Chinese had been portraying Japan to the Filipinos as \"a nation attempting to invade the Islands and to destroy democracy.\" The purpose of this Communist-Chinese community campaign, Kihara concluded, was to create favorable public opinion for anti-Japanese groups in order to offset President Queson's rather friendly policy toward Japan.144 Kihara's assessment and McLane's opinions of the KMT-Com\u00ad munist-Chinese community collaboration against Japan are correct insofar as they describe the surface phenomenon of the united action. It is common knowledge that the KMT-Communist united front was not a happy marriage between the two antagonistic parties, and it created more discord than harmony in South Seas Chinese communi\u00ad ties. The Philippines were not spared the impact of the KMT-Com\u00ad munist struggle which existed beneath the cover of collaboration. The struggle between the KMT and the Communists erupted at the time 93 of the New Fourth Army incident in January, 1941. The Philippine- Chinese community felt its impact. For instance, the Davao Chinese Resist-the-Enemy Committee split into two factions. The chairman of the Committee supported the Communist New Fourth Army and sent a telegram to Chungking pleading for the release of the captured Communist General Yeh T'ing; the vice-chairman sent a cablegram to the Chinese wartime capital demanding his immediate execution. By adhering to their respective viewpoints, they unwittingly divided the Committee and the Davao Chinese community. The division weakened considerably the effectiveness of the organization's anti- Japanese operation. Signs of division were reported in Chinese associa\u00ad tions throughout the Philippine Islands.145 No doubt many of the Chinese who expressed opinions about the incident had no ideological commitment to either the KMT or the Communists, but they were compelled to speak out because of concern for China. From the preceding account, it is apparent that after the fall of 1938, the Chinese National Salvation Movement in the Philippines en\u00ad countered many difficulties. As the boycott continued, the initial enthusiasm naturally wore off, business circles felt the economic im\u00ad pact, and both Filipino and Chinese communities resented the incon\u00ad veniences. Business leaders no doubt felt pressure both from within and without their circles. On one hand, the Philippine authorities in\u00ad sisted that they maintain law and order; on the other, KMT members, intellectuals, and journalists, who had no particular economic stake in a boycott, insisted that they carry on anti-Japanese activities. Under these trying circumstances, tensions developed within the triangle of the KMT, the KMT government, and the Chamber of Commerce. Relations deteriorated, particularly when the KMT attempted to wrest the control of the boycott campaign from the Chamber of Commerce. Nevertheless the Chamber of Commerce, the main medium of propa\u00ad ganda from China, did not yield to the KMT's attempts to control it. The difficulty of the Filipino-Chinese movement was compounded by something beyond its control\u2014diplomatic tension between Japan and the United States. The Chinese in the Philippines were acutely aware of the precarious position of the Islands in the event of a Japanese-American war; they admitted their deep concern over the impending war between Japan and the United States.146 Conse- 94 quently, reports from Manila in March, 1941, described the uncertainty of the Chinese. Many of them were so obsessed by the fear of war that they scarcely had time for the boycott and other anti-Japanese activities. As a result, there was no anti-Japanese propaganda; the special contri\u00ad bution drive organized by the youths under the auspices of the PREC had ended, though the regular monthly giving campaign continued; and boycott inspectors and enforcement agents had disappeared from the streets.147 The worsening Japan-U.S. relations compelled local KMT agents to deliberate on measures to take should war come to the Islands. Their attention is believed to have been focused on what to do if Japanese troops should occupy the Islands, what to do with the enemy resistance committee, and how to dispose of the property and assets of the Chinese. It appears that KMT agents themselves did not agree on the course to take. One group advocated resisting Japan either by joining the American-Filipino troops or by fighting under the command of a Chinese leader to be sent from Chungking. The other group suggested limiting anti-Japanese activities in order not to provoke the Japanese, since the Japanese occupation of the colony would mean life or death to Chinese who had been active in the Na\u00ad tional Salvation Movement sponsored by enemy resistance commit\u00ad tees.148 Reflecting the growing anxiety of the Chinese community, in late February, the Chungking government sent instructions, together with a document, Ten Principles for the Protection of the Chinese in Emergency, to the consul general in Manila. For the next few days, Chinese leaders of the community, the Party, and the Consulate closeted themselves for a series of conferences. There is no report of what happened at the meetings. Statements issued after Consul-Gen- eral Yang met with the Philippine authorities and High Commissioner Sayre suggest that most of the Chinese leaders had agreed to give priority to safeguarding the lives of the Chinese, who would be evacuated to a safe area, and to cooperating with authorities to pro\u00ad tect non-combatants.149 Presumably, most government officials and community-business leaders thought it unwise to resist the Japanese. If those decisions reflected the state of mind of the Chinese leaders, we can understand why consulate officials and business-community lead\u00ad ers chose to remain in Manila after the Japanese invasion, allowing themselves to be arrested, while die-hard KMT leaders and Com- 95 munists went to the mountains in order to wage a guerrilla war against the invaders.150 It must be assumed, then, that Chinese anxiety over the possibility of war contributed to the slackening of the boycott in 1941. Strained relations among the community-business circles, the Consulate, and the Party curtailed the effectiveness of the National Salvation Move\u00ad ment. Nevertheless, it does not mean that all these groups were work\u00ad ing to protect only their own interests; they were still loyal to the objec\u00ad tives of the National Salvation Movement. Many community-business leaders, even after they were released by the Kempeitai in 1943, avoided, to the best of their ability, having anything to do with the Japanese military administration. As a result, the Japanese authorities were unable to find anyone with stature willing to collaborate.151 Thailand The history of the Chinese anti-Japanese drive in Thailand after 1938 is as much a story of KMT-Communist-directed terrorism as it is a chronicle of the government's repression of the Chinese. Through\u00ad out 1939 and 1940, the Thai police worked like bloodhounds to track down and expose illicit Chinese societies. The searches were some\u00ad times accompanied by discriminatory acts designed to undermine the Chinese position.152 From what can be deduced from available official and semi-official intelligence reports,153 the KMT and the Communists were more ac\u00ad tive in anti-Japanese activity in Thailand than in any other place ex\u00ad cept British Malaya. The KMT was believed to be operating through legal and semi-secret organizations such as the Office of Commercial Representative of the Chinese government; the Chinese Chamber of Commerce; the Thai-Chinese Relief Fund-Raising Association (TCRFRA), which had been created as a front within the Chamber of Commerce; and the Thailand Office of the KMT, which had power over the Resist-the-Enemy National Salvation Association. Ch'en Shou-ming, a KMT representative of commercial affairs, a member of the KMT Political Council (Ts'an-cheng-yuan), and former chair\u00ad man of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce in Bangkok, was an in\u00ad fluential anti-Japanese leader. He was also the principal stockholder in three dailies, one of which was the Hua-ch'iao ]ih Pao. This news- 96 paper had consistently supported Chiang Kai-shek; and its editor, Chang Ch'ih-feng, was a long-time protege of Ch'en Shou-ming, a member of the KMT, and the principal of the Huang Hun School, which was closed because of its anti-Japanese activity. After Hsiao Fo-Cheng's retirement, in 1938, Yi Kuang-yen became chairman of the Chamber of Commerce and served until he was assassinated in No\u00ad vember, 1939. Together with Ch'en Shou-ming, chairman of the TCRFRA, Yi Kuang-yen supported the National Salvation Move\u00ad ment, though some reservation about his true political coloration existed. The KMT, at the peak of its strength, had 200,000 members; but the number dwindled over the years, particularly after the military took over the reins of the Thai government. In 1939, membership was estimated at about 30,000. The strength of the Party had been sapped by a perennial split between the progressive wing and the orthodox wing and by a series of police raids in which its leaders were arrested for anti-Japanese activities. Although the central Party and its leaders suffered setbacks, its branch offices, chapters, and cells throughout the Kingdom were well-organized. The KMT not only had control over its branch offices of the Resist-the-Enemy National Salvation Association but also had jurisdictional authority over the Chinese schools. The list of organizations which the Chinese Communist Party con\u00ad trolled through its Hong Kong bureau, headed by Liao Ch'eng-chih, is long. Communist followers were found among intellectuals, stu\u00ad dents, the young, refugees, and hoodlums whose primary mission was to advocate boycotting and to intimidate recalcitrant Chinese mer\u00ad chants or to perform acts of terrorism including murder. Communists were known to be dominant in a number of organizations. The Thai\u00ad land Hua-ch'iao League for the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Movement was an association organized by school teachers and led by Kuo T'ien, a teacher at Chung-hua Middle School and the chief editorial writer of the Hua Sheng ]ih Pao. The Hot Blood Youth Corps for Resist-the-Enemy and National Salvation and the Eradica\u00ad tion of Traitors, the Thailand Youth League for Anti-Japanese National Salvation, and the Iron Blood Youth Anti-Japanese Association were all devoted to terrorism and assassination. Liu Pi-ch'uan, Yang Sung, Ch'en Ho-k'un, Wang Tso-sheng, Ts'ai Chih-fang, Hsu Ching, Yu 97 Shan-tung, and Lo Jung-kuang were officers of these groups. The Nanyang Hua-ch'iao Youth League was known to include more than one hundred assassins, who were credited with having murdered 35 persons and injured 117 by the end of 1939. The Hua-ch'iao Rescue- Squad-for-Bangkok Guerrilla Committee and the Thailand Hua-ch'iao League for Anti-Japanese Executive Committee were headed by Ch'en Jung-tzu, whom the Eighth Route Army had sent to Thailand. The Thailand Hua-ch'iao League for Anti-Japanese Executive Committee, an amalgamation of all anti-Japanese groups, had been organized at the request of Consul General Kao of Singapore when he visited Bang\u00ad kok. The Laborers' Resist-the-Enemy and National Salvation Corps and the Thailand Labor-Comrade National Salvation Association were largely proletarian. And finally, the Thailand Hua-ch'iao Women's Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association was made up of prosti\u00ad tutes, waitresses, and bar hostesses. Leftist intellectuals and youths provided leadership for each of these organizations, drawing financial support from the Chinese Chamber of Commerce, the Rice Mill As\u00ad sociation, and the Rice Merchants' Association. Contributions and fines these Communist groups collected were not channelled to the coffers of the Chiang Kai-shek government but siphoned through Ubon and Khu Khan in the northeast to the Ch'iian Min Jih Pao in Saigon and sent from there to the Eighth Route Army in Kwangtung province. To what extent the KMT and Communists united in the National Salvation Movement in Thailand can never be determined. The fact that the consul-general succeeded in uniting all associations is indica\u00ad tive of KMT-Communist unity, but how much they cooperated in policy execution is something else. For instance, Communist intel\u00ad lectual leaders proposed, from time to time, to combine their anti- Japanese campaign with that of the KMT-sponsored Resist-the-Enemy National Salvation Movement, but the Association repeatedly rejected the proposal for unspecified reasons. With or without the united front policy, the anti-Japanese organization was the strongest in the King\u00ad dom. With this background, let us look at the record of the Thailand Chinese National Salvation drive after July, 1938, till the outbreak of the Pacific War in December, 1941. The boycott to which the Thai-Chinese had resorted to manifest 98 their support of their fatherland had already proved, according to Skinner, \"extremely effective\" in 1937 and early 1938.154 It was per\u00ad haps this rising Chinese nationalist fervor that provided additional fuel to the prejudicial policy of the Thai government, despite its denial of anti-Sinicism. As already pointed out, the Thai government, in the wake of Chinese national consciousness during the Sino-Japanese war, had been deliberately curtailing Chinese economic strength under the program of economic Thai-ification; it is therefore difficult to dis\u00ad tinguish the Thai government's anti-Chinese policy on the grounds of Thai-ification from its anti-Chinese policy on the grounds of their anti- Japanese movement. From the Thai government's point of view, Chinese political action against Japan (to which Luang Phibun Songkhram had been drawn closer) was a convenient excuse to sup\u00ad press the Chinese, and the suppression served a dual purpose. It ac\u00ad cented a new Thai nationalism, and it placated the Japanese. In spite of numerous arrests of anti-Japanese leaders in the early months of 1938, the Chinese National Salvation Movement did not recoil but bounced back with fresh vigor. \"In October, 1938, the mili- tantly anti-Japanese cause was further strengthened by the establish\u00ad ment of the Chung-\\uo Jih-pao .. .,\" Skinner said, and strong men of various anti-Japanese groups took the law into their own hands. \"Bomb\u00ad ings, shootings, and kidnappings occurred with increasing frequency after the fall of 1938.\"155 Then in late January, 1939, news of police raids on the headquarters of illicit Chinese secret societies shattered the holiday mood of the Chinese, ready to greet their New Year. The raids exposed two centers of the Resist-the-Enemy National Salvation Association, and police seized bundles of anti-Japanese circulars. One of the arrested members was reported to have confessed that he had bombed a Chinese store selling Japanese merchandise.156 In 1939, the Bangkok government also curtailed both open and clandestine Chinese financial aid drives on the grounds that \"any relief for a country at war is ipso facto for war purposes.\" Scores of Chinese leaders and business\u00ad men in Bangkok and Chiengmai were arrested when police discovered that they were collecting contributions and selling bonds.157 Notwithstanding the blows the Chinese had sustained, in addition to the disheartening news of the fall of Ch'aochow and Swatow in June,158 the boycott showed no sign of faltering; in fact it gained 99 strength because of a rigorous press campaign which the Chungking government conducted in China and Thailand. The Chung Hua Min Pao, on July 14, 1939, urged the Chinese not to remit money to Japa\u00ad nese-occupied Ch'aochow and Swatow, because every penny sent to those cities would enable the enemy to acquire foreign capital. \"This is,\" the paper declared, \"an act supporting the enemy.\"159 For a week in early July, all local Chinese newspapers denounced rumors circulat\u00ad ing in Bangkok that the Chinese troops had \"retreated without ex\u00ad changing resistance\" when the Japanese troops landed at Swatow.160 In the third week of July, the government determined to contain the Chinese political action and murderous assaults and raided the San-min she, which served as the office of the KMT branch in Thai\u00ad land and of the KMT San-min Youth Club. Not only were the men in charge of the organization apprehended, but several wagonloads of documents, together with a party membership list, were confiscated. At the same time, Wu Pi-yen, a member of the Standing Committee of the KMT in Thailand, was arrested. The leaders were deported.161 That police raid was the beginning of the government's containment program, which extended through August. During these months, newspaper offices, schools, printing plants, banks, a remitting office, Chinese Association headquarters, and the Chamber of Commerce were searched. Evidence was gathered to show that these organiza\u00ad tions had been engaging in illegal activities. Sixteen schools, including three which were centers of Communist activities, were closed for violating the educational ordinance.162 All but one newspaper, the Chung Yuan Pao, were shut down permanently on grounds of \"insti\u00ad gating the anti-Japanese boycott and anti-Japanese movement as well as obstructing peace.\"163 The Overseas Chinese Bank and the Kwang- tung Bank were searched and found to be holding \"disguised deposits . . . presumably destined for China's war chest.\"164 The manager and the assistant manager of each bank were detained. In August, a re\u00ad mitting office suspected of having remitted money to China was in\u00ad vestigated. In the grand climax of this series of raids, the Chinese Chamber of Commerce and its leading members were searched and questioned on August 12, and its headquarters was temporarily closed.165 The revelation of the extent of both open and secret Chinese politi- 100 cal activities in conducting the anti-Japanese boycott, raising money for the war,166 and directing a number of terrorist acts drew quick, scathing criticism from the Thai public. Denouncing the terrorism and wanton murders which had become \"almost commonplace\" by late July, the Siam Chronicle stated that \"the gang operating in Bang\u00ad kok do not seem to follow the ideals and rituals associated with the ancient secret societies in China. They are mere racketeers and crimi\u00ad nals and though some of them claim to be 'patriotic,' we are afraid that their campaign in this country cannot be justified on that basis.\"167 The confusion that followed the sweeping arrests in July and Au\u00ad gust had hardly subsided when Yi Kuang-yen was assassinated on No\u00ad vember 21, shortly after his return from Chungking.168 Why he \u2014reputedly a supporter of the National Salvation Movement\u2014was murdered was never satisfactorily explained. Kenneth P. Landon says that one of the two assassins confessed to the police, saying that his father had been fatally wounded by a member of the Resist-the-Enemy National Salvation Association and that Yi was head of the organiza\u00ad tion.169 This account interprets the crime as merely the result of one man's attempt to avenge his father's death. One Japanese intelligence source reported that contrary to public opinion, Yi was not really anti- Japanese. This report, originating from the Mitsui's Siam Research Office, described him as having \"the closest business relations with Japan.\" He was, the report said, \"dragged into the anti-Japanese ac\u00ad tivity because of his position as president of the Chamber of Com\u00ad merce. . . . He should be marked as the most approachable person to Japan.\" Moreover, he was believed to have gone to Hanoi and met with a member of the Wang Ching-wei faction in the early months of 1939.170 There is little more to substantiate this report of Yi's politi\u00ad cal orientation toward the Wang faction.171 It must be remembered that the Mitsui was the largest Japanese trading corporation doing business with Thailand; that Chinese like Yi were important to its business; that the company's research office in Bangkok scrutinized the commercial and political activities of Chinese leaders with whom the Mitsui dealt; and that the research office worked hand-in-glove with the Japanese military intelligence establishment, as did similar Japanese organizations in Southeast Asia. If the Mitsui report can be trusted, the validity of the published version of the assassination motives 101 can be challenged. Significantly, few Japanese sources identified Yi as a leader of the anti-Japanese movement; most of them listed him merely as president of the Chamber of Commerce. The July-August calamity and the assassination of Yi Kuang-yen considerably weakened the Chinese National Salvation Movement and brought its most effective phase to an end.172 Some KMT members went into hiding up-country; others fled the capital and made their way overland to Annam, British Malaya, and Yunnan, China; and still others, including newspaper reporters and teachers and a few merchants, slipped out of the country to Kunming.173 It should be pointed out that most of those arrested in the summer police raids were KMT members; few were Communists. The decrease in ter\u00ad rorism and assassination following the summer arrests, however, was indicative of the disintegration, for the time being, of Communist- organized crime in Thailand.174 Nevertheless, the Thais publicly condemned self-styled \"patriotic\" Chinese when violence occurred.175 Thai authorities continued to maintain strict surveillance on Chinese political activities. When Chinese anti-Japanese activities disturbed the peace in January and February, 1940, there was another wave of arrests.176 Though nearly demoralized by the relentless police action since the summer of 1939, the Chinese \"were by no means completely cowed . . . , and activities to help the cause of China and resist the Japanese advance continued.\"177 When, after 1939, it became in\u00ad creasingly difficult to conduct any form of the campaign in the open, the Chinese National Salvation Movement went underground. The relief-fund-raising associations and other money-collecting agencies continued to receive contributions and send them secretly to China by way of Hong Kong, Malaya, and Hanoi. Chinese hospitals in Bang\u00ad kok secretly trained nurses to serve with the Nationalist army in China, but sometime in 1940, the Thai authorities discovered and banned the training program and deported two hospital officials.178 In the absence of normal diplomatic relations between Bangkok and Chungking, the suppression and the discriminatory policy of the Thai government created a very serious problem for the Chinese. To continue the National Salvation Movement would provide the Thai government a convenient excuse to destroy Chinese business in the 102 interests of the economic Thai-ification program. It seems certain that the Chinese community-business leaders pondered the question in January, 1940. There was a change of policy in respect to the Na\u00ad tional Salvation Movement and to the Thai government, prompted, perhaps, by the Phibun government's disregard of the Chiang govern\u00ad ment's plea to establish diplomatic relations. Chang Lan-ch'en, the new president of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce, appeared to be the leading figure in favor of the new policy. The first sign of the change was detected in February, 1940, when Chinese leaders de\u00ad clined to accept the NCRGA's invitation to participate in sending com\u00ad fort missions to China.179 They were the only Chinese to disassociate themselves from the NCRGA-sponsored program, apparently because they feared the response of the Phibun government. The second indi\u00ad cation of the shift in policy was a definite decline in violence. After February there occurred no serious incidents like those that had aroused indignation among the Thai public in the past year. The effort to prevent violence may be viewed as part of the policy of re\u00ad straint that followed the attack on Chinese schools, an attack which occurred because these schools were not teaching the Thai language. Further agitation in the politically oriented National Salvation Move\u00ad ment would increase Chinese vulnerability. Refraining from violence and political activities might not\u2014and did not\u2014stop Phibun's issuing discriminatory decrees, but the Chinese needed every bit of goodwill they could get from the government. The third unmistakable sign of the new policy adopted by Chinese business leaders was their attempt to establish friendly relations with Thai government officials. Beginning in July, led by Chang Lan-ch'en, they tried to cultivate the friendship of the Thai elite, hoping that the new approach would soothe the ruffled feelings of the high officials. On a number of occasions throughout the summer and fall, Chang urged his fellow businessmen to invest in Thai industries and to sup\u00ad port the Thai government's claim to the territory lost to French Indo\u00ad china.180 This accommodation policy was successful only as long as the Thai government found it convenient and expedient, because that government was ready to sacrifice the Chinese for a greater stake\u2014 Japan's friendship. Thailand's foreign policy was committed to the winning side of the Sino-Japanese war, and no money or verbal sup- 103 port of the Chinese could buy it back. Acting as mediator, Japan enabled Thailand to regain the lost territory from French Indochina in January, 1941. After the settlement of this territorial dispute, Thai\u00ad land was drawn even closer to Japan. The rekindling of the Thai government's discriminatory policy in May, 1941,181 was another ex\u00ad ample of the anti-Sinicism of the Phibun government. The Chinese leaders' policy toward the NCRGA was consistent with their decision to endure despite their helplessness and their suffer\u00ad ing. When they received the invitation to attend the second NCRGA assembly in Singapore in March, the TCRFRA decided not to reply.182 A Chinese source, however, noted that representatives of several Chi\u00ad nese associations in Thailand attended the conference. They joined other delegates, it says, to support Chiang Kai-shek and his policy of resistance and reconstruction, declaring that the Nanyang Hua-ch'iao would \"not compromise or change\" and would \"remain firm.\"183 It is inconceivable that these Thai-Chinese delegates represented the TCRFRA, which maintained the policy of restraint. It ignored the NCRGA invitation, it seems, to avoid unnecessary complications with the Thai government. The argument that the TCRFRA secretly sent these representatives to the conference without replying to the invitation is not plausible because the Chinese account just quoted was published on April 1, 1941, less than four weeks after the meeting. Thai officials would certainly have taken note of it and would have held Chinese leaders accountable. It is recalled that NCRGA officials took special measures to delete names of Thai delegates to the first meeting of the NCRGA in Singapore in October, 1938, obviously to protect the delegates and their sponsoring associations. In the absence of information about these representatives\u2014who they were and which organizations they represented\u2014the only explanation one can make for their presence at the second meeting is that they attended of their own accord, probably without consent of the TCRFRA and certainly without permission of the Thai government, for it is unlikely that the Bangkok government would have granted such a permit in the light of its policy toward the National Salvation Movement.184 By the time war came to Southeast Asia in December, 1941, the ranks of the Chinese leaders had been seriously depleted through ar\u00ad rest, deportation, and flight upcountry or to China. KMT- and Com- 104 munist-led illegal activities had been driven underground, and anti- Japanese activities had practically ceased to be an organized drive. The TCRFRA, the main body of the National Salvation Movement, was no longer an active organization capable of promoting the cam\u00ad paign to support China. Circumstances forced Chinese business-com\u00ad munity leaders, led by Chang Lan-ch'en, to weigh the situation, squeezed as they were by the Thai government's discriminatory policy and by Japan's southward march. In an article about the problems of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce filed in Bangkok, a correspondent of the respected newspaper Asahi reported that in early April, 1941, the Chamber had resolved to purge itself of anti-Japanese sentiments in the hope of hastening a peaceful settlement of the Sino-Japanese war.185 Admittedly the report was a bit too optimistic, but it seemed to convey the mood of leading Chinese within the business circles. On the other hand, die-hard KMT underground anti-Japanese activities persisted, as evidenced by the arrival of \"a large number of Chinese fifth columnists\" in Thailand in late March.186 Because war clouds hung heavily over Thailand, the country had become a center of intelligence gathering and espionage for Japan, the United States, Britain, China, and even Germany. The Japanese Army and Navy had mobilized their resources in order to collect information on which to base invasion plans and had stepped up their effort in order to acquire strategic materials. The Mitsui's office, at the direction of the military, bought embargoed Malayan tin and rubber through Chinese mer\u00ad chants in Bangkok. Chungking government agents likewise were busy collecting information on the movements of the Japanese.187 Some Chinese helped the Japanese military plan the invasion; others risked their lives in cloak-and-dagger operations or showed hostility toward the Japanese.188 But most of the Chinese, even some business leaders like Chang Lan-ch'en, were deeply concernd about the uncertain future. As one Japanese naval intelligence officer in charge of Chinese affairs, attached to the Japanese Embassy in Bangkok, observed, the average Chinese remained calm, holding his breath and maintaining circumspection on the eve of the Japanese invasion, and the Mitsui and the Mitsubishi were doing business with Chinese as usual.189 It is obvious that the Thai-Chinese struggled to support the anti- Japanese movement even when the odds were decisively against them, 105 enduring molestations which amounted to a systematic persecution. KMT influence and its organizational activity were substantial until the Thai government crushed them, and there was every reason to believe that the Communists were responsible for the militancy of the anti-Japanese campaign. Likewise, the National Salvation Movement of the Chinese business-community group and its affiliates was a strongly organized campaign until the end of 1939. Beginning in 1940, however, its effectiveness decreased considerably, and its leaders sought to make peace with the Thai authorities, repudiating what might be regarded as the political aspect of NCRGA activities and deemphasizing overt anti-Japanese activities. On the eve of the Pacific War, most of the Thai-Chinese, like the Philippine-Chinese, were frightened and just waited, hoping that the Japanese military would let them alone. One should not be too quick to assert that the be\u00ad havior of the Thai-Chinese proved that they were less patriotic than other South Seas Chinese. Rather, the price they paid for the National Salvation Movement should be emphasized. By the end of 1939, 10,000 Chinese suspected of illegal activity had been interrogated, and 3,000 had been arrested.190 By the time the war broke out, Thai au\u00ad thorities had deported several thousand as undesirable aliens on the grounds of anti-Japanese activities.191 Even excluding those who were bona-fide terrorists, the attrition was high, indicating in part the in\u00ad tensity of the National Salvation Movement. Furthermore, the efficacy of arrests and deportations in controlling the Chinese anti-Japanese drive refutes the Japanese charge that Thai policemen and high gov\u00ad ernment officials were sympathetic toward the Chinese because they themselves were of Chinese extraction;192 on the contrary, it was these high officials who were most anti-Chinese, just as Nazi-Jews were more anti-Semitic than their Aryan colleagues.193 French Indochina and Burma The KMT attached great importance to French Indochina and to the Chinese there because the country was contiguous to south China and was a supply base from which China acquired essential materiel. Aware of the importance of French Indochina and its Chinese resi\u00ad dents to the national defense system of the Chiang Kai-shek govern\u00ad ment, the KMT appointed Hsiao Chi-shan, a candidate member of 106 the KMT Central Executive Committee, to head the Hanoi Office of the KMT Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission. His principal func\u00ad tion was to coordinate and unify activities of the Cantonese and Fukie- nese in the best interests of the Chinese government.194 On the other hand, the Annam branch of the KMT established boycott headquar\u00ad ters at Hanoi and Saigon-Cholon, each directed by a consul re\u00ad sponsible for boycott and contribution drive policies and the sale of stocks for the industrial development project in southwest China. These national salvation groups, under the guidance of the local KMT apparatus, also formed voluntary youth corps for home front service. Youngsters were given a six-month training course in mechanics and sent to the Hanoi-Yunnan (Kunming) Road as auto repairmen and drivers. The KMT machinery likewise made an extraordinary effort to stir up the patriotism of the Chinese by establishing numerous mass communication groups.195 In Cholon, the Chinese quarter of Saigon, a Voluntary Association for National Salvation, an Association for the Promotion of Chinese Culture, and other Hua-ch'iao associations or\u00ad ganized schools and inculcated anti-Japanese ideology in the Chinese masses. Favorable and stirring news from Chungking was dissemi\u00ad nated through facilities of the KMT Consulate General at Hanoi and through wall newspapers provided by the Hua-ch'iao Middle School. Finally, branch offices of the Chinese Council for Foreign Relations in Hanoi and Saigon sponsored cultural activities designed to arouse patriotic passion. It is difficult to estimate the degree to which the KMT's anti-Japa\u00ad nese drive roused the national consciousness of the Chinese. Wang Ching-wei's defection from Chiang Kai-shek and his subsequent ar\u00ad rival in Hanoi in December, 1938, caused great consternation.196 To counteract the effect of Wang's dramatic escape from Chungking, KMT agents in Indochina mobilized their resources to generate anti- Wang and anti-Japanese feelings, culminating on March 21, 1939, in an assassination attempt on Wang Ching-wei in which his close asso\u00ad ciate, Tseng Chung-ming, was killed by KMT assassins' bullets. A sharp decline in Japanese exports to French Indochina in January and February was indicative of KMT propaganda and of the general senti\u00ad ment of the Chinese toward Wang Ching-wei and the Japanese. That boycotting continued throughout 1939 is evidenced by import figures 107 lower than those of 1938.197 Chinese interest in helping China was strong as late as February, 1940, when Chinese national salvation asso\u00ad ciations participated in the NCRGA-sponsored program to send com\u00ad fort missions to China. But in French Indochina, as elsewhere in Southeast Asia, there were recalcitrant Chinese merchants who tried to sell Japanese articles by changing their labels. Others complained that increasing demands for contributions were over-taxing their financial resources.198 For instance, in the winter of 1938-1939, many Chinese were reluctant to buy Fukienese government bonds during the subscription campaign headed by Chang Chen-fan, a leading rice merchant in Saigon-Cholon. As a result, Chinese in the French colony failed to meet their quota of 150,000 yuan. By early spring, 1941, en\u00ad thusiasm for contributions had sunk so low that the Chungking gov\u00ad ernment reportedly sent special agents to Saigon to open a campaign to register each person's donations.199 Furthermore, the Chinese had to gauge carefully the attitude and sentiment of the French colonial authorities and the Vietnamese to determine how far they could go without provoking an adverse response. There were causes for the Chinese concern; the French authorities were apprehensive of the economic crisis that the Chinese boycott was creating and of the effect of the anti-Japanese movement on Vietnamese nationalism, and the natives were unhappy about the soaring prices of commodities in the wake of the boycott and the influx of refugees from China.200 Too, Japan's southward penetration and her increasing pressure upon the French colonial government after the fall of France in June, 1940, were not without effect. The acquiescence of the French Vichy government to a Japanese demand for stationing a Japanese inspection team along the Indochina-China border (June), Japan's march into the North (September) and the consolidation of her position in the area through Thai-French Indochinese border mediation (January, 1941), and finally her invasion of the South (July) made the Chinese feel the presence of the Japanese military might. Shortly after the Japanese military had completed the deployment in September, 1940, Governor General Decoux, a Vichy appointee, was obliged to suppress the Chi\u00ad nese anti-Japanese campaign; consequently not only were Chinese unable to help transport strategic goods across the border to China, but the South Vietnam National Salvation Committee had to terminate 108 the KMT-sponsored program of sending technicians and mechanics to China. Some KMT anti-Japanese drive coordinators fled the country.201 The presence of the Japanese military, along with the pressure of the French government, made life difficult for Chinese who had been ac\u00ad tive in the National Salvation Movement. For instance, a Japanese businessman has told of inviting Chu Chi-hsing, an influential Cham\u00ad ber of Commerce member whom he had met in business, to his home for a secret talk. He hoped to dissuade Chu from collaboration with the Chinese Consul. Chu, however, did not appear. When the Japa\u00ad nese visited him to find out what had happened, Chu apologized for his discourtesy and explained: \"I was not able to visit because of close surveillance [maintained by anti-Japanese elements]. They will kill me if they find me visiting the Japanese. I do not wish to cooperate with Chungking or with Nanking since I have no particular liking or malice toward Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Ching-wei. I beg you not to get me involved in politics any further.\" At the conclusion of the conversation, Chu volunteered names of about a dozen persons who were prominent in the anti-Japanese campaign so that they could be persuaded to give up the campaign or could be arrested by the French authorities.202 From the preceding account, it is clear that the Chinese kept up a brisk campaign of anti-Japanese activities, except for monetary con\u00ad tributions until late 1940 or early 1941. A record shows a steady in\u00ad crease of trade with China and of transport on the Haiphong-Hanoi- Kunming railroad until late 1940. The Chinese were thus responsible for keeping the Indochina-Yunnan railroad open and supplying vital goods to Chungking. The stationing of the Japanese troops in the North and the South made the National Salvation Movement even more difficult to carry on; there was some disagreement within the ranks, and some Chinese were afraid to commit themselves to the movement. Nevertheless, boycotting and anti-Japanese propaganda continued throughout the spring and summer of 1941, as evidenced by an eye-witness account and a press report.203 There is almost no information about Communist involvement in the Chinese National Salvation Movement, but, as in other countries in Southeast Asia, the Communists are believed to have cooperated with the KMT's anti-Japanese movement. Nguyen Ai Quoc (Ho Chi 109 Minh) is known to have appeared in 1940 \"in the Tongking as part of the special Chinese Communist mission sent there to train Chinese Nationalist guerrillas\" against the Japanese.204 It is not surprising that Nguyen Ai Quoc joined KMT guerrillas who had been operating at Kunming in Yunnan province bordering French Indochina. Report\u00ad ing the guerrilla operation in Yunnan, a Japanese military intelligence agent based at Hanoi told the Japanese Army Headquarters in Taiwan in early summer that twenty-two guerrillas had arrived in Hanoi from Kunming to launch anti-Japanese activity.205 Very little information is available for an assessment of the anti- Japanese activities of the Chinese in Burma after October, 1938. Since the effect of the boycott upon Japanese trade in Burma was insignifi\u00ad cant, the Chinese concentrated upon a contribution drive, organized jointly by the Burma Hua-ch'iao General Association for Relief, the Special Committee for Relief, the Red Cross Association, the Relief Association of Guilds, the League of Kwangtung Chinese for Relief, the Burma Branch for the Promotion of Bond Subscriptions, and the China Association for the Construction of Airplanes.206 According to the Hsing Tao Jih Pao, the Chinese gave 13 million yuan in the first three years of the Sino-Japanese war, in addition to 1.5 million yuan for airplanes, and 3 million yuan for trucks, clothes, drugs, and con\u00ad dolence funds for bereaved families.207 Though financially limited, the Chinese in Rangoon raised a quarter of a million yuan at a recep\u00ad tion in honor of General Wu T'ieh-ch'eng when he arrived in the capital in early 1940, and spontaneously gave 16,800 rupees in October, 1940, when the Burma Road was re-opened.208 Another instrument through which the Chungking government cultivated the goodwill of the Burmese was the China-Burma Cultural Association. Local Chinese were very active in the Association for the exchange of cultural programs and visits by dignitaries of both govern\u00ad ments.209 Finally, KMT members were allegedly working with the British Criminal Intelligence Department in guiding the Chinese anti- Japanese movement.210 The record and achievements of the Chinese National Salvation Movement from October, 1938, to the outbreak of the Pacific War show the Nanyang Hua-ch'iao's remarkable tenacity in supporting China's war for survival. For four years, they maintained anti-Japanese activi- 110 ties, giving their moral and material support to the Chiang Kai-shek government at the crucial time, especially during the early phases of the Sino-Japanese war, when China had little help from outside. On the other hand, the boycott campaign, which had proved to be a rather effectual weapon until the end of 1939, became gradually weaker. By all indications, beginning in 1940, the boycott was not a threat to Japanese trade in Southeast Asia, more conspicuously in Thailand, the Dutch East Indies, and French Indochina than in Malaya and the Philippines. Internal factionalism between the KMT and the Com\u00ad munists and between the KMT and the business group was becoming noticeable. The factionalism was also indicative of the weariness of the Chinese in the National Salvation Movement, compounded by their fear of war. Furthermore, the presence of the Communists was dis\u00ad ruptive because they competed with the Nationalists for influence.211 The increasingly important role of the KMT and the Communists in the National Salvation Movement was evident, but the results were not all positive. Increased KMT influence in the campaign caused some unhappy relations among leaders in Malaya and the Philippines. Its excessive meddling disenchanted some leaders, alienating them from the ranks, as in Malaya. The infiltration of the Communists no doubt added militancy to the anti-Japanese drive but provoked security- conscious local authorities to repress the National Salvation Move\u00ad ment, as evident in Thailand and Malaya. Generally speaking, the Chinese National Salvation Movement faced more difficulties with local authorities after 1940, obviously as a result of pressure from Japan, whose military might made itself felt in Southeast Asian countries, especially Thailand, the Philippines, and French Indochina. Under such conditions, the protracted anti-Japanese National Salvation Movement produced strains. Some leaders began to vacillate, and their hard-pressed compatriots expressed, if not openly, their grievances against business disruption and the incessant demand for contributions. Notwithstanding, most of the Nanyang Chinese, whether KMTs, Communists, or non-partisans, were opposed to Japa\u00ad nese aggression in China and wanted to aid their fatherland. To achieve this immediate objective, the Hua-ch'iao, including the Com\u00ad munists (whose ultimate objective differed from that of the others), were ready to stand side by side with the KMT government, which had 111 its revolutionary tradition deep in South China, the home of the Nan\u00ad yang Hua-ch'iao. It is no exaggeration to conclude that in 1937-1938, under the weight of financial strains, the Chiang Kai-shek government could have suc\u00ad cumbed to a humiliating defeat without the monetary and material aid of the Chinese overseas. The material contribution of the Nanyang Chinese to sustaining the life of the gasping Chinese government was no small matter. This is the subject to be discussed in the next chapter. 112 Chapter III Achievements of the Nanyang Chinese National Salvation Movement and its Economic Effectiveness Return-Home Service Drive and Comfort Mission One of the major projects that the NCRGA sponsored for China's war effort was the dispatch of voluntary service corps of skilled laborers and technicians. They were sent to shuttle trucks carrying vital sup\u00ad plies on the Yunnan-Burma Road and the Yunnan-Hanoi-Haiphong Road and to serve in ambulance units and maintenance corps.1 The project was a response to resolutions adopted by the KMT Emergency Conference in Chungking shortly after the fall of Wuhan in 1938, and by the First Political Council in August of that year. These resolutions authorized the KMT to \"train, in accordance to skills, overseas Chinese\" who were \"willing to die on the battle field for the defense of the fatherland\" and to \"tap the manpower resources of the Chinese abroad.\" The importance of the project loomed larger as the development of the hinterland and the maintenance of vital supply routes in the Southwest became urgent for the Chungking govern\u00ad ment. Consequently, the government appealed to the NCRGA to recruit technicians and mechanics, and in August, 1939, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission asked Nanyang Chinese Chambers of Commerce to compile a list of overseas Chinese professional personnel available for emergency.2 The total of recruits and volunteers for the military service, guer\u00ad rilla corps, medical corps, civil engineering corps, and women's corps was small, and it is difficult to measure their contribution to China's war effort.3 The overseas volunteers, however, contributed significantly to the maintenance of the Yunnan-Burma Road and the Yunnan- Hanoi-Haiphong Road, over which vital supplies were transported to Chungking, until the former was temporarily closed in July, 1940, and the latter completely in June of that year. It is estimated that a little over 3,000 volunteers, mostly from Malaya, Burma, and French Indochina, served on these arteries as drivers, mechanics, and repair- 113 men during 1939.4 They enthusiastically volunteered for the service corps, and many patriotic tales illustrate their zeal. For example, a mechanic who earned two hundred yuan a month gave up his job to join the voluntary corps, which paid only thirty yuan. Another Chi\u00ad nese reportedly wrote to his mother that she should not pray for his safety but for the victory of his country and that he would not return home until the war was over.5 Nevertheless, by the end of 1939, the project had lost its appeal and glamour, and the enthusiasm with which it started had dissipated. The withdrawal of the Penang Chinese As\u00ad sociation from the program is evidence of the change. Reasons for the volunteers' loss of enthusiasm were their unfamili- arity with China's internal conditions, the differences in living stand\u00ad ards and customs, poor pay, and ill treatment. For instance, sixty-two mechanics deserted in July, 1939, because of ill treatment.6 Complaints and disturbing news of the state of the volunteers seeped out of China, prompting Tan Kah Kee to send an investigation team to Yunnan and Burma in August, 1939. The findings of the team, as reported to Tan, confirmed the legitimacy of the reported grievances. The report said in part: \"Facilities of depot stations [in Kunming] were extremely poor. . . . Every Chinese from the South Seas region had lost his healthy look and appeared very sick. It is painful to watch him [suffering].\"7 Tan sent a telegram to Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek and the KMT Military Council to call their attention to the deplorable state of the volunteers, of the Burma Road, and of its administrators, asking them to make immediate improvements. Nothing was done to remedy the situation, for more revolts and desertions were reported in the early months of 1940. In February, 1,800 volunteers working on a southwestern route fled from Yunnan because they could not endure the cruelty and poor pay; a volunteer corps organized by the Huichou Chinese Association mutinied in March.8 Causes for these incidents were, according to deserters, \"poor treatment, contrary to promises made by authorities; poor clothing, shelter, and medical care; and the low morale of administrators and too much red tape.\"9 As a result, in February, the Penang Chinese Relief Fund-Raising Association cancelled plans to send its fifth voluntary service corps and withdrew from the program. After these incidents, enthusiasm decreased con\u00ad siderably, and the number of volunteers from Malaya dropped, though 114 Chinese associations in French Indochina and Burma continued to send a small number of volunteers until the Yunnan-Hanoi-Haiphong Road and the Burma Road were forced to close in the summer of 1940.10 Chinese in Burma, however, resumed the program after the Burma Road reopened in October. A serious consequence of these incidents was Tan Kah Kee's en\u00ad tanglement with the KMT officials. Twice he visited the Burma Road and the volunteers working there\u2014on his inspection trip with the comfort mission and then on his way home. After his first visit, he advised KMT officials to correct the conditions that had caused some of the volunteers to have unhappy experiences. On his way back to Singapore in late 1940, he saw the conditions on the Burma Road unimproved: hundreds of the volunteers who had completed six months' training were sitting idle with no definite assignments.11 This was one of the causes of his disenchantment with KMT officials. It is difficult to assess the contribution of the volunteers to China's capability to resist the Japanese aggressors because of its limited nature. Clearly the responsibility for bringing the program to its unfortunate end lay entirely in the incompetency and insensitivity of KMT govern\u00ad ment high bureaucrats. The Nanyang Chinese had a legitimate right to demand that KMT officials correct their mistakes since the NCRGA had assumed full financial obligation for the project, including volun\u00ad teers' travel expenses to and from China. By its own inexcusable mis\u00ad takes, the KMT government discouraged the program, engendering ill feeling among Nanyang Chinese leaders. The symptoms of the malady that caused the demise of the KMT government in 1949 were already evident. Another major program the NCRGA undertook was sending com\u00ad fort missions to China to show \"the gratitude of the Nanyang Chinese to fighting men at front and at home, to manifest their determination to support the fatherland, and to see the real situation in China. . . ,\"12 As Tan Kah Kee recorded in his memoirs, the idea of sending the missions was conceived in the winter of 1939 for the purpose of in\u00ad specting conditions in agriculture, opium-smoking, industries, imports, transportation, telecommunications, education, secret societies, and the morale of the Chinese people, both civilians and soldiers.13 The pro\u00ad gram, however, did not have a propitious beginning; Tan met strong 115 dissent within the NCRGA, which pointed out the extravagance of the program. Even after participants had been selected, some leaders still objected to the project on the grounds that most of the members were Communists. Tan wrote in his memoirs that he pacified these unsym\u00ad pathetic colleagues because \"the Chungking government understood [his] sincerity.\"14 Candidates for the mission were carefully selected on the basis of personal integrity, past record in anti-Japanese activity, fluency in Chinese, and ability in delivering speeches. Of the fifty-four chosen, forty-three were from Malaya and the others from the Philippines, French Indochina, the Dutch Indies, Burma, and Hong Kong. As I have already pointed out, Thai-Chinese did not participate.15 Tan Kah Kee assumed the general directorship of the mission, and he flew to Chungking by way of Kunming. The mission, in two troupes, ar\u00ad rived in Chungking on April 16, after having visited Kunming and Kueiyang, where they were greeted by high government and military dignitaries; Lung Yun, chairman of Yunnan Province; and mayors of the cities. Responding to the red-carpet welcome at Kunming, repre\u00ad sentatives from Penang pledged one million yuan for building rubber factories at Chungking, Kueiyang, and Kunming. These plants re\u00ad portedly started operations as soon as the fall of 1940.16 Upon their arrival in the Chinese wartime capital, the Nanyang Chinese delegates received a warm welcome from high government leaders. For the next few days, members of the mission were enter\u00ad tained at a round of receptions given by President Lin Shen; Chairman Chiang Kai-shek; Finance Minister Kung Hsiang-hsi; General Ho Ying-ch'in, Chief of General Staff; Chang Chun, a member of the Central Executive Committee; Wang Shih-chieh, Education Minister; and Hsu Shih-ying, Chairman of the Fund-Raising Committee. At the reception given by Generalissimo and Mme. Chiang Kai-shek on April 20, P'an Kuo-ch'u, leader of the mission from Malaya, \"voiced strong support of overseas Chinese to the nation under Chiang Kai- shek,\" and \"assured his fellow countrymen that every Chinese abroad is backing [the] motherland to win the war.\" Referring to Wang Ching-wei's defection and its effect upon the Chinese, P'an asserted that he \"saw no result in ... the Chinese population in the tropical territories because the overseas Chinese are most patriotic and have 116 unwavering confidence in the ultimate triumph.\" He concluded by pledging the faithful upholding of San-Min-Chu-I, support for the Nationalist government of China, obedience to its leaders, and assist\u00ad ance to China's resistance war. Chairman and Mme. Chiang, in response, thanked him and \"lauded the patriotism of the overseas Chinese.\"17 At another welcome party, President Lin Shen urged the overseas Chinese representatives to support China's war effort because, he said: . . . only through wholehearted support of all overseas Chinese can we achieve this goal [real peace]. Every dollar that overseas Chinese save and send to the motherland counts for obtaining the final objective. . . . Peace at any price at this moment would mean a humiliation both to our descendants and ancestors.18 In response to the government's appeal for contributions, three repre\u00ad sentatives from Kuala Lumpur donated 300,000 yuan for relief funds in Kwangtung and 2,000,000 yuan for land development.19 Tan Kah Kee, who had arrived in China on March 24, had been meeting with government leaders. On every occasion, he denounced the Wang Ching-wei government and pledged his loyalty to the gov\u00ad ernment of Nationalist China, and by short-wave radio he spoke to the Nanyang Chinese of his personal impressions of China and of in\u00ad vestment opportunities there. To demonstrate the loyalty of the Nan\u00ad yang Chinese to the Nationalist government, Tan announced that they had underwritten the establishment of a pharmaceutical factory in Singapore and its administrative office in Chungking and that by early 1940 they had contributed to relief 220 million yuan.20 But privately Tan was reported to have told government officials that the \"Nanyang Chinese had given since the war on the monthly average of six to seven million yuan, and that this was the maximum limit of their capability.\" Sun Fo, president of the Legislative Yuan, explained that the government's need of money to finance the war was acute, urging Tan to exert more effort to give to China. Tan, however, was non\u00ad committal.21 Whatever was Tan's inner feeling, he did not express it on the eve of his departure on the observation trip. He probably kept it to himself, preferring to make a statement at the end of the journey. On May 1, the mission, divided into three groups, started on its inspection trip to the North and the Northwest, to the central region, and to the South 117 and the Southwest. Tan appears to have joined the first group and then travelled independently to see Fukien and the Southwest. For the next two months, the delegates combed the country, travelling through most of the unoccupied territories, and returned to their re\u00ad spective countries in late July. They were \"impressed by the great progress\" China had made and by the high morale of the Chinese people. \"I am very much moved,\" one of the group leaders told a reporter, \"by the improvement the fatherland has made and I will do my best, when I get home, to tell my people about it, so that they will give more to the fatherland.\" Another representative was elated to find abundant food and said that the \"spirit of the morale of the Chinese in Hunan is high, constituting the backbone of resistance and national reconstruction. The Nanyang Chinese should follow the example of Hunan to meet the national crisis and to recapture the territories lost to the enemy. We overseas Chinese prefer to endure poverty in a strong nation rather than to enjoy wealth in a weak nation.\"22 All was not as rosy in China as it appeared to these excited ob\u00ad servers, however. As I have discussed in previous pages, to an astute leader like Tan Kah Kee, China under the KMT rule was not what he had expected it to be. Except for a decline in opium-smoking in Communist-controlled Kansu, Tan was profoundly disappointed by the deterioration of the KMT-Communist coalition, by conditions in his native Fukien, by the maladministration of the Burma Road, and by the low morale of citizens and corrupt officials in Chungking. Many things did not add up to what he had been told by KMT officials at the beginning of the trip, and his inspection confirmed his doubts. According to Ichikawa, Tan, while still in Chungking, had already begun to suspect several aspects of government operations. His skep\u00ad ticism centered on several points. First, the government had received, Tan was told, more than 700 million yuan from Southeast Asia and over 300 million yuan from other parts of the globe, totalling ap\u00ad proximately 1.1 billion yuan. Subtracting 1 billion yuan, the total of the proceeds from bond subscriptions and remittances, the govern\u00ad ment would have only 100 million yuan in the treasury, but it had printed 2.2 billion yuan of paper money. Furthermore, the govern\u00ad ment had been negligent in preparing a statement of accounts for 118 contributions from abroad. Second, many patriotic overseas Chinese, who had invested their savings for the development of transportation in their native country, Tan has written, faced bankruptcy because the government had neglected to take steps to protect them, and bureau\u00ad crats had been unresponsive to the investors' request to remedy the condition. Third, the KMT government, Tan suspected, had not been sharing contributions from abroad with the Communists. Finally, Tan was certain that there was no clear-cut understanding between the KMT and the Communists about the private ownership rights of government bonds, with the consequence that the bonds might become scrap paper after the war.23 His journey across the country seemed to strengthen his doubts about these and many other matters. The result was his outburst of criticism of irresponsible government bureaucrats and officials that endangered his relations with them and accentuated the split between the NCRGA and the KMT in 1941. Paradoxically, the goodwill mission sowed the seeds of bitterness. Monetary Contribution The most tangible measurement of South Seas Chinese contribution to wartime China can be made from a study of their response to Chungking's request for cash contributions. The KMT government exhausted many means and devices under the campaign slogan\u2014 \"Give Money and Give Strength\"\u2014to attract monetary aid from the Chinese abroad. The Chinese in Southeast Asia responded gener\u00ad ously, although admittedly there were cases of coercion. They gave money; bought war and government bonds; donated airplanes, ambu\u00ad lances, trucks, drugs, and clothes; and invested in industries for the development of China's hinterland. Indies-Chinese footed the bill for the maintenance of the Chinese Red Cross at a cost of $500,000 monthly. They also collected 10,058 guilders and 1.2 million quinine tablets. Chinese in the Philippine Islands raised more than $15 million to buy one squadron of airplanes, and Malayan Chinese donated $345,743 for the purchase of winter clothes for Chinese soldiers.24 Shortly after the Japanese armies had overrun Southeast Asia in the Pacific War, Yu Hung-chiin, vice Minister of Finance, was quoted as saying that China's financial loss from the Japanese conquest of the South Seas would amount to \"a few billion yuan.\" \"In the past 119 several years,\" he said, \"we have sold 300 million yuan of war and government bonds, of which the Nanyang Chinese have subscribed more than one-fifth. Besides, they have donated approximately 1.5 billion yuan in various forms of contribution. The Allies lost their territories; we lost our vital source of financial revenue.\"25 The figure is exaggerated but still conveys the message of the importance of over\u00ad seas Chinese contributions as one of the principal sources of revenue to finance the war. The importance of the Nanyang Chinese to the Chungking government's war economy can be seen from a long list of distinguished KMT visitors; the regime sent a host of its high officials as soon as the Sino-Japanese war broke out and continued to send them almost up to the beginning of the Pacific War. They went to the tropical territories to solicit contributions, economic aid, and bond subscriptions and to cement good relations with the Nanyang Chinese communities, as shown in Table 2.26 TABLE 2 A LIST OF KMT OFFICIALS WHO VISITED SOUTHEAST ASIA, 1937-1941 Name Objective Destination Date Kung Hsiang-hsi Tiao Tso-ch'ien promote contributions Singapore, Oct., '37 Manila Malaya Philippines To promote bond sub\u00ad scriptions \" To raise funds for wounded soldiers and organize medical corps Singapore To promote the National Salvation Movement \" To raise funds for military expenditure Thailand Dec, '37 Jan., '38 Aug, '38 May, 38 120 TABLE 2 (concluded) Name Wang Cheng-t'ing Li Ssu-yuan and Tai Kui-sheng Kao Shih-heng Huang T'ien-chiieh Objective To organize San-Min- Chu-I Youth Corps To promote bond sub\u00ad scriptions To study means to sell national goods Destination Manila Southeast Asia // Malaya, Fr.

In addition, the Nationalist govern\u00ad ment sent a number of cultural missions such as the Chinese Buddhist Association for International Visits, the Wuhan Chorus Group, the New China Drama Team, the Chinese Moslem Association, the Chi\u00ad nese Cultural Association, and others, each of them succeeding in raising a considerable sum of cash donations.27 Before I proceed with the discussion, I must explain that the 121 figures in the following pages are by no means definite because they were published fragmentarily by Chinese sources or were estimated by various sources. Moreover, there is no uniformity in arriving at an estimate of contributions for a given period; as a result, figures over\u00ad lap and duplicate. Nor is there agreement in expressing the monetary unit; evaluation is extremely difficult. Furthermore, there is very little information about money siphoned to the Chinese Communists; therefore, I shall deal primarily with questions pertinent to contribu\u00ad tions destined for Chiang Kai-shek's war coffers. The most reliable figure for contributions and bond subscriptions for the period of fifteen months from July, 1937, to September, 1938, was in an oral report given at the first meeting of the NCRGA, held in October, 1938. A breakdown of the figure is shown in Table 3. TABLE 3 A BREAKDOWN OF NANYANG CHINESE CONTRIBUTIONS FROM JULY, 1937, TO OCTOBER, 193828 Country Contributions Bond Subscriptions Malaya 19,577,194 yuan 12,864,105 yuan Dutch East Indies * The figure is a total of contributions and subscriptions. According to this report, the Nanyang Chinese contributed to the treasury of the Nationalist government as much as 67,134,888 yuan, plus SS$219,568 and 1,414,961 guilders. Allowing for some \"statistical inaccuracy\" and \"unreported or unaccounted\" funds, because some delegates (Thai-Chinese representatives) were unable to give an ac\u00ad curate report to the meeting,29 the total figure was likely larger than it appeared. Further evidence for contributions that the KMT govern\u00ad ment received from the Nanyang Chinese between November, 1938, and December, 1940, is found in a report presented to the second NCRGA conference in March, 1941. It shows that the Nanyang Chinese poured into the war chest an estimated 147,748,000 yuan, plus 122 30 million yuan, during a twenty six-month period. Table 4 is a break\u00ad down of the figure.

Taken from Mantetsu SCJ, Kakyo chosa iho I, p. 83. #* A leftover that could not be remitted to China because of foreign exchange control. A few things need to be noted in Table 4. First, there is no men\u00ad tion of a 1940 figure reported from Thailand. The omission was attributed to the fact that Thai-Chinese officials did not attend the meeting; it confirms the assertion that \"representatives of several Chinese associaions in Thailand\" attending the conference were not official delegates. Second, the Chinese in all the countries except French Indochina did exceedingly well in fulfilling their quota. The poor showing in French Indochina also supports the evidence that there was widespread discontent over making contributions, which prompted the Chungking government to rush soliciting agents to Saigon to revitalize the campaign. Excepting those in French Indo\u00ad china, the Nanyang Chinese gave twice as much as the quota. How\u00ad ever, these figures must be read with reservations, not so much to dis\u00ad count Chinese response as to put them in a proper historical context. During 1940, the Chinese national currency was devaluated by 50 per cent compared with its value in 1939.31 Therefore, the foreign currency that Nanyang Chinese sent had a better exchange rate in China. The depreciation of the yuan seemed to have an adverse effect on the Chinese desire to contribute, since exchange rate of the foreign cur\u00ad rency they sent to China would inflate as value of Chinese currency decreased. This is probably why Tan Kah Kee complained of the 123 slackening of contribution zeal at the second NCRGA meeting. Tan told the audience that seventy-three million yuan had been contributed during 1940, but that the amount was three million yuan more than the 1939 contribution. This in effect represented a 50 per cent de\u00ad crease,32 he explained, since the 1940 total remained at the 1939 level although the yuan had depreciated 50 per cent. Although Tan ascribed the drop in part to decreased enthusiasm for contribution among the rich and the local-born Chinese,33 he must also have been aware of the increasing difficulty of collecting money from wage earners and low- and middle-class merchants, who had been taxed most heavily by the contribution campaign. Probably realizing that this group could no longer contribute heavily, Tan used the forum of the NCRGA to appeal to local-born and wealthy Chinese for contributions. He may have become aware of the inequity of the contribution system; the rich Chinese may not have given in the same proportion to their wealth as the poor workers and merchants, particularly in view of the fact that the economy of Malaya had been booming since the outbreak of the European war in September, 1939. The charge of increasing reluc\u00ad tance to contribute is difficult to prove. There is some evidence among the Indies-Chinese to substantiate the accusation, but it is too limited to allow the generalization that the local-born Chinese were not patriotic, as Tan's remark seemed to imply. It must be borne in mind, however, that the National Salvation Movement was largely a China-born Chi\u00ad nese movement in which few local-born Chinese leaders took active part. His statement, therefore, should be read with this fact in mind. An activist and a China-born Chinese, Tan was impatient with Chi\u00ad nese less patriotic than he, and he judged the patriotism of others by his own. No itemized figure for 1941 is available. What appears to be the most trustworthy estimate for the period was published by the Over\u00ad seas Chinese Affairs Commission of the Nationalist government, Tai\u00ad wan, in 1956. This agency reported that the Nanyang Chinese \"do\u00ad nated\" 106,540,574 yuan in 1941.34 There is no way of determining whether the figure includes proceeds from the sale of bonds. More\u00ad over, the figure is extraordinarily large for one year. It is probable that the 1941 figure was calculated at an inflated exchange rate since the yuan continued to lose value throughout the war years. Be that as 124 it may, the Chinese in the South Seas poured 355 million yuan into the coffers of the Chiang Kai-shek government from the beginning of the Sino-Japanese war until the outbreak of war in Southeast Asia. Let us now look at KMT government's records of receipts from contributions. According to a report published by the Overseas Chi\u00ad nese Affairs Commission, it received 294,396,358 yuan from Chinese all over the world between July, 1937, and October, 1940. Nanyang Chi\u00ad nese (including Chinese in India) were credited with 217,617,000 yuan, or about 74 per cent. Table 5 shows a breakdown. TABLE 5 KMT GOVERNMENT'S RECEIPT OF CONTRIBUTIONS FROM THE NANYANG CHINESE COVERING THE PERIOD FROM JULY, 1937, TO OCTOBER, 194035 Country Contributions Singapore* 125,768,000 yuan Dutch East Indies 37,569,755 Philippines 26,584,357 Thailand French Indochina 7,390,871 India and Burma 9,885,248 Total: 217,627,321 * The designation \"Singapore\" can be assumed to mean British Malaya. This figure, however, does not include contributions attributed to Na\u00ad tional Defense Bonds and Gold Bonds. General Wu T'ieh-ch'eng, chairman of the KMT Overseas Affairs Department, provided figures for bond subscriptions that help us approximate the total contribution of the Nanyang Chinese. He said that the overseas Chinese in Asia (i.e., Southeast Asia) had purchased National Salvation Bonds worth 32,103,329 yuan and National Defense Bonds valued at 4,797,234 yuan, in addition to $16,328 and ^4,805 in Gold Bonds, in twenty-nine months ending December, 1939.36 Adding the total of these figures to the 217,627,000 yuan in Table 5, we arrive at 227,324,000. This is an approximate estimate of money that had gone into the war chest by the end of 1940, and it corresponds roughly to a grand total of 244,882,888 yuan that the NCRGA said it had sent to the Nationalist government by the end of 1940. This is a conservative estimate since the Wu figure does not include funds collected by the Chinese Women's War Aid As\u00ad sociation in the Philippines, Chinese in Palembang and Surabaya, and Relief Associations of Singapore and Burma; nor does it include funds 125 for medical aid and drugs contributed by Chinese in the Dutch East Indies, the Philippines, French Indochina, and Singapore; nor does it include funds contributed by Filipino-Chinese for airplanes and by Malayan Chinese for the re-opening of the Burma Road; nor funds for rice, tanks, ambulances, raincoats, winter clothes, and rubber shoes; nor money directly sent to field armies and the Chinese Communists; nor a figure for October, 1938, from the Nanyang Chinese and a 1940 figure from Thailand. One will never know how much these contributions amounted to. It seems fair to assume that they represent about one- tenth of the total, 355 million, given by the end of 1941. In other words, a rough estimate of the money that the Chinese government received from the Nanyang Chinese can be computed at upwards of 390 million yuan. This compares well with 354,072,000 yuan, a post\u00ad war figure published by the KMT Overseas Chinese Commission, that was acknowledged by the agency for the period from July, 1937, to December, 1941.37 It means that the Nanyang Chinese gave an aver\u00ad age of 7.1 million per month during the same period, a feat rarely matched by any other minority group abroad. At the same time, the 7.1 million average is consistent with Tan Kah Kee's private remark to Sun Fo that 6 to 7 million yuan was \"the maximum limit of their capability.\" The Nanyang Chinese could have given more, if there had been no foreign currency restrictions on remittances, as Tan was quoted as having said,38 but he probably knew that the achievement was not entirely reached by voluntary contributions but by considerable \"persuasion.\" It is no wonder that the Chinese government regarded the Nanyang Chinese as an important source of revenue for wartime expenditures. The goal of Nanyang Chinese contribution, reiterated Kung Hsiang- hsi, was to share \"one-fourth of the military expenses\" of the KMT government.39 They achieved that goal in the first year of the war. Arthur Young, a former financial adviser to Chiang Kai-shek, gave China's first year (July, 1937 to July, 1938) of military expenditures as 1,388 million yuan;40 one-fourth of it was 347 million yuan. In the same period the Nanyang Chinese poured 67.1 million yuan into the treasury of the KMT government, plus regular yearly remittances esti\u00ad mated at 400 to 500 million yuan.41 The sum of these two figures is 126 somewhere between 467.1 and 567.1 million yuan, not counting other contributions. In conclusion, the monetary and material contributions of South Seas Chinese to China's war effort were tremendously impressive; they are more impressive in view of the fact that a real economic boom in the tropical region did not start until September, 1939, when war erupted in Europe, raising prices of rubber, tin, iron ore, palm oil, and rice, and that the Chinese achieved the remarkable record of con\u00ad sistency and generosity under various difficulties and handicaps, in\u00ad cluding discriminatory policies enforced by some Southeast Asian countries. Before leaving a discussion of contributions, a brief examination of Chinese contributions in each country in proportion to the size and composition of the population is in order. For this purpose, the period between November, 1938, and October, 1939, is selected because con\u00ad tribution fervor appears to have reached its highest point during that period. TABLE 6 NANYANG CHINESE CONTRIBUTION PER CAPITA NOVEMBER, 1938, TO OCTOBER, 193942 Unit\u20141,000 Country Population** Contribution Per Capita Philippines 250,000 Burma 300,000 4,035 13.45 British Malaya 2,390,000 30,459 12.74 Dutch East Indies 1,500,000 12,766 8.25 French Indochina 500,000 1,564 3.13 Thailand 2,500,000 3,200 1.28 ** Taken from Kabushiki Kaisha Chosabu, 1941), p. 4. It is plain, from Table 6, that the Filipino-Chinese showed the best contribution per capita, which was close to 2.6 times that of the Malayan Chinese. The highest individual donation\u2014by the Chinese in the Philippine Islands\u2014testifies to the well-organized, well-lubricated machinery of their fund-raising drive, their relative wealth, greater economic stability than that of the Dutch Indies, a more valuable cur\u00ad rency than the guilder and the baht, and the less prohibitive attitude of the Filipino and American authorities toward the Chinese fund-raising campaign than the one held by authorities in Malaya, the Dutch Indies, 127 and Thailand. It is, therefore, understandable that the Chungking government singled out the Philippines, along with British Malaya- Singapore, as the place to send a number of its VIPs, headed by Kung Hsiang-hsi and Wu T'ieh-ch'eng, to solicit contributions and to pro\u00ad mote the sale of bonds. The Chinese in British Malaya\u2014including Singapore\u2014gave far smaller sums of money per capita, but their total exceeded the totals of other Nanyang Chinese by a wide margin. The paradox is ex\u00ad plained by the facts that the territory had the second largest overseas Chinese population (second only to that of Thailand) and that their contributions came largely from the poor laborers and the small mer\u00ad chants, as Tan Kah Kee and the Nanyang Siang Poh pointed out.43 The record of the Dutch East Indies, with the third largest Chinese population, reflects the basic attitude of the Dutch authorities toward the Chinese money raising campaign; they did not permit public auctions or propaganda for the sale of war bonds. Moreover, the money- raising organization did not function as effectively there as it did in the Philippines and Malaya-Singapore. It is not difficult to explain the Thailand Chinese record of the lowest per capita contribution. Al\u00ad though Thailand had the largest overseas Chinese population, the Bangkok government's policy of repression toward the Chinese speaks for itself. From the beginning, the Chinese contribution campaign in Thailand was conducted underground and later any form of donation destined for China was prohibited. The contrasting attitudes of the Bangkok and the Manila governments toward the National Salvation Movement produced a sharp contrast in the results of the fund-raising drives. The lack of leadership in the Thai-Chinese community after the death of Hsiao Fo-ch'eng may also have had some bearing on the record. It is difficult to deduce from this table or from other sources the extent to which the composition of Sinkheh and Baba affected contri\u00ad butions. As I have shown, Tan Kah Kee complained of the apathy of the local-born Chinese to the contribution drive. One long-time stu\u00ad dent of the overseas Chinese labored to point out that the Baba were much less patriotic than the Sinkheh.44 On the other hand, there was a sizable group of local-born Chinese in Thailand and the Philippines. The Chinese in the Philippine Islands gave the highest amount per 128 capita and conducted an effective anti-Japanese operation. Though the Thai-Chinese contribution was the lowest, it must be remembered that nowhere was their poor record attributed to the composition of the China-born Chinese and the local-born Chinese, but rather to the political climate in which the Thai-Chinese had to operate their cam\u00ad paign. Therefore, on the basis of available evidence, it is hazardous to generalize that the Baba were less patriotic than the Sinkheh, per\u00ad haps with the exception of those in the Dutch Indies. In the Dutch Indies, where the local-born Chinese were close to 65 per cent of the population, the larger Baba population could have had some bearing on the poor record in contribution per capita, because they were loyal to Indonesia first. Remittances The second direct means by which millions of the Nanyang Hua- ch'iao shared China's wartime expenditure was remittance. Remit\u00ad tances were the money Chinese abroad sent to their families or rela\u00ad tives for their support. Most of the Chinese abroad were originally emigrants who sought to make a better way of life abroad, but tradi\u00ad tional ties with their families obliged them to remit money regularly to their parents and other relatives. The revenue from remittances had been not only one of the principal sources of income for those who were left behind in China, but also it had been invariably the largest foreign exchange receipt of the Chinese government before the Sino- Japanese war, serving as an important stabilizer for China's balance of payments. As I will show, remittances kept China's economy and finance solvent, and money remitted in foreign exchange could be ap\u00ad propriated directly for the payment of arms and munitions. For these reasons, it is essential to examine Chinese overseas remittances and the nature and the extent of their contribution to the capability of the Chungking government to wage the war. Before proceeding, it must be said that the figures which will ap\u00ad pear on the following pages are at best approximate estimates since the computation is extremely complicated. Of all sources used in this study, no two give identical figures partly because of \"differences in coverage, methods of computation, and years studied . . . ,\" as Chun- hsi Wu, the author of Dollars Dependents and Dogma, admits.45 129 There is no need to dwell upon the methods by which overseas Chinese remitted money to China and how much they sent before the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese war, since it is beyond the scope of this study.46 An average of total annual remittances between 1930 and 1936 has been estimated at 300 million yuan.47 The significance of such remittances is graphically demonstrated in a table of international balance of payments published by the Economic Research Section, the Bank of China. According to this table, China's deficit in the inter\u00ad national balance of payments for the four years from 1933 through 1936 was 2,172,800,000 yuan; she received 1,030,000,000 yuan from overseas Chinese during the same period.48 In other words, overseas Chinese remittances covered 47 per cent of China's trade deficits. As Remer said when he studied overseas Chinese remittances for pre-war years, each time he \"found it difficult to believe that the remittances could be as great as they seemed on examination to be,\" but each time he became \"convinced by the supporting evidence.\"49 It was a matter of vital concern, therefore, for the Chungking government and for the Nanking government to maintain the inflow of remittances and to keep them from being diverted to the area occupied by their opponents. In order to secure remittances from abroad through friendly chan\u00ad nels, the Chungking government passed the Exchange Transaction Act in March, 1938. The legislation stipulated that overseas Chinese be requested to remit money through Chungking government-controlled banks or friendly foreign banks and that banks lower the fee for handling remittances. Furthermore, the government authorized the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Bank of Canton to open branch offices at Hanoi, Singapore, Penang, Rangoon, Batavia, Surabaya, and Manila.50 After the Japanese troops occupied coastal cities (Amoy, Swatow, Foochow, Canton, Chuanchow, Ch'aochow, Macao, and Hainan Island) and after the Wang Ching-wei government reopened facilities for receiving remittances at these Japanese-controlled ports, the Chungking govern\u00ad ment stepped up its efforts to prevent remittances from being diverted or re-channelled to the Japanese-occupied area. It opened a new chan\u00ad nel in the Kunming area after Canton fell to the Japanese. In order to tighten control over remittances and insure their flow to Chungking, the KMT government passed two bills: the Act Regulating Overseas 130 Chinese Remittances to the Enemy-Controlled Areas (August, 1939) and the Act to Attract Overseas Chinese Remittances (January, 1940) .51 On the other hand, the Nanking government under Japanese guidance lost no time reactivating channels for overseas remittances in port cities that had fallen into the Japanese hands. As early as March, 1939, the Japanese government held a joint ministerial conference under the auspices of the Foreign Ministry to consider means of enticing overseas Chinese remittances and their investment capital to the Japanese-occupied area. By summer, decisions had been made to re\u00ad open agencies for accepting remittances and to establish an Overseas Chinese Affairs Office as well as a reception center at each port.52 The Japanese countermeasures were not very successful despite progress reports from Amoy, Swatow, Canton, and Haikow. For instance, a report from Swatow recorded that remittance agencies had received 82 million yuan from Thailand, Singapore, and other Nanyang centers during nine months (March through December) in 1940. The receipts were about equivalent to pre-war ones, but in the actual value of the Chinese currency in 1940, the report said, the 82 million yuan was worth much less than it had been in 1936. That the result was obtained only because Japanese policy permitted remittances to be sent to Chi\u00ad nese living outside the Japanese-occupied zone shows the difficulty the Japanese encountered.53 Not only did the receipts from remittances not reach the level of Japanese expectation but accommodations at recep\u00ad tion centers, which were administered by bureaucrats from the Taiwan Government-General, were so poor that they were insulting to the dignity of the Chinese people. The deplorable conditions drew sharp criticism from Chinese residents and from the Japanese Navy's Amoy Liaison Office. Commander Koshiba Naosada, who was assigned to the Amoy Liaison Office in May, 1941, to study the remittance prob\u00ad lem and measures to win overseas Chinese, was appalled by the way these centers were operated. These facilities, purported to be welcom\u00ad ing places for returnees, were no less than opium dens or whore houses, where returning Chinese were stripped of their life savings for a night's sensuous pleasures. These facilities were such an affront to local residents that they alienated the Chinese from the Japanese. With the 131 sympathetic understanding of his superior officers, Koshiba succeeded in getting rid of the undesirable features of the facilities.54 With this observation on the remittance policies of Chungking and Tokyo, let us turn to the record of overseas Chinese remittances to the government of Nationalist China and their contribution to China's international balance of payments. In the absence of the reliable an\u00ad nual business report published by the Bank of China, which was dis\u00ad continued after 1937, figures in Table 7 were selected from several sources. A few words of explanation for the following discussion are in order. Figures used in this section are sum totals of remittances sent by Chinese around the world. Approximately 90 per cent of the over\u00ad seas Chinese lived in Southeast Asia, and generally the Nanyang Hua- ch'iao accounted for 75 per cent of the total remittances. Table 7 shows remittance figures and their proportionate relation\u00ad ship to China's balance of payments deficits from 1936 and 1941. Re\u00ad mittances from the Chinese overseas increased each year during this period. The table reveals that the 1937 remittance figures, whichever one may accept, offset three to four times the deficit created by excess imports for that year\u2014115 million yuan.55 In 1938, remittances rose to a level ranging from 479 to 600 million yuan, an increase of 120 to 150 million yuan. Explaining the phenomenon, Kann, a student of foreign exchange based in Shanghai, ascribed the increase to overseas Chinese response to China's appeal for national salvation and to a favorable rate of foreign exchange.56 Remittances balanced the 1938 deficit (124 million yuan) by nearly four to five times. Moreover, the 1937 and 1938 remittance figures represented the second largest source of income in 1937, and the largest revenue item in 1938. Without re\u00ad mittance receipts, China would have had an unfavorable balance of international payments which would have seriously affected her war\u00ad time economy and her ability to resist the enemy in the first two years of the conflict. Acknowledging the importance of remittances in stabilizing China's wartime finance, the managing director of the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation cited overseas Chi\u00ad nese remittances as a key factor in the stability of China's wartime economy.57 The remittances for 1939 and 1940 need to be examined carefully. Kann estimated 1939 remittances at 2,000 million yuan. It appears that 132 TABLE 7 NANYANG CHINESE REMITTANCES AND CHINA'S BALANCE OF PAYMENTS, 1936-1941 (Unit\u2014Million Yuan) Year 1936 1937 1938 1939 1940 1941 Exports 706 838 763 1,027 2,133 46 26 Remittam {Per Cet (29) 1Matsusaki Yuichiro, Soron, Tokyo, 1960, cited in Wu, Dollars De\u00ad pendents and Dogma, p. 16. 2 Edward Kann's and Ch'en Shu-jen, chairman of the KMT Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, cited in Japan, Shanhai Nippon so\\in, p. 27.

Young, China and Helping Hand, p. 257. he included in his figure both contributions and intangible capital flow\u2014money, stocks, and bonds\u2014from Southeast Asia and other parts of the world to Shanghai, sent there because of the fear of a freeze on capital assets as a result of the outbreak of war in Europe. For the purpose of this discussion, I do not consider capital flow from abroad as the KMT government's revenue until the capital was invested in the area controlled by the government. An estimated 500 to 600 million yuan of capital assets was reportedly transferred to Shanghai in 1939. 133 Contributions, based on a monthly average of donations estimated at 7 million yuan in Southeast Asia, probably amounted to 100 million yuan or more in 1939, since we are computing contributions from Chinese all over the world. Contributions for 1939 could go even higher be\u00ad cause the economy of Malaya boomed after the outbreak of the Euro\u00ad pean War.58 A conservative estimate of the total of the capital flow and the contributions, then, is 700 million yuan. Subtracting 700 million yuan from Kann's calculation of 2,000 million yuan, the balance would be 1,300 million yuan, matching more or less the 1939 remittance figure in Table 7\u20141,200 million yuan. Even though 1,200 million yuan, compared with the 1938 figures, looks unusually high, the pre\u00ad ceding analysis would justify the 1939 remittance figure. Despite the large remittances of 1,200 million yuan, they helped balance only 49 per cent of the 1939 trade deficit because the KMT government's def\u00ad icit soared to 2,467 million yuan. It is also to be noted that 1,200 mil\u00ad lion yuan actually represented 480 million yuan at the 1936 value of the national currency because by 1939 the value of the yuan had dropped 60 per cent.59 Information for 1940 is scarce. The lower figure (1,800 million yuan) was supplied by Jen Yeh-yuan and the higher estimate (2,000 million yuan) by three Chinese sources, one of which drew the in\u00ad formation from an economic journal published in Singapore. The reliability of either of these figures cannot be verified by official Chi\u00ad nese sources, but they seem to corroborate each other. The problem here is to determine whether they include contributions and capital flow from abroad. Barnett added them to his calculation, but the other sources made no reference to their effect. Assuming that both figures, that is, 1,800 and 2,000 million yuan, include contributions and capital flow, the 1940 figures represent a decrease, compared with the 1939 remittance estimate, on two accounts. First, by 1940, the yuan had depreciated 72 per cent of the 1936 value, a drop of 12 per cent com\u00ad pared with the 1939 value,60 with the consequence that overseas Chinese remittances had a higher exchange rate in China. In other words, over\u00ad seas Chinese obtained the 1,800-2,000 million mark with a smaller amount of money than that of the previous year. Second, as was shown, contributions and capital inflow accounted for approximately 700 million yuan in 1939. On the assumption that about the same 134 amount of money accounted for these two categories in 1940, the 1940 remittance figure would be at a level ranging from 1,100 to 1,300 mil\u00ad lion yuan. It is not much higher than the 1939 level, and it is even lower than the level of 1939, if one chooses 1,100 million yuan for the 1940 remittance figure. Nevertheless, the 1940 remittances, subtracting contributions and capital flow, covered about one-third of the Chung\u00ad king government's international balance of payments. In 1941, China's trade deficit sky-rocketed to 8,116 million yuan, but overseas Chinese remittances did not increase as sharply as in the past few years. Because I was unable to ascertain whether the following two remittance figures include contributions and capital inflow, dis\u00ad cussion of them proceeds on the premise that they are parts of the total. One would expect that the flight of capital from abroad to Shanghai would have increased because of international crises\u2014the fall of France, Belgium, and Holland; Hitler's apparently impending in\u00ad vasion of the British Isles in 1940; and Japan's southward thrust in 1941. Contrary to such expectation, there was no significant increase in 1941. This phenomenon seems to mean either that the reserve of overseas Chinese capital had been exhausted or that wealthy overseas Chinese had ceased to transfer their capital to Shanghai and, instead, had invested it in the land and industrial development of China's Southwest. In view of a phenomenal increase in investment in China's industries in 1940 and 1941, which coincided with the economic boom in Malaya, the second explanation is more plausible. It is also possible to argue that the relatively slight increase in 1941 remittances over the previous year's indicates that overseas Chinese financial capability had reached its limit. As already shown in the discussion of contributions, their economic ability reached its limits by 1940 or soon thereafter. It is all the more true of remittances, since the bulk of remittances came from the savings of wage earners.61 From the foregoing discussion, a few conclusions can be drawn. First, it is plain that there was a very intimate relationship between overseas Chinese remittances and China's international balance of payments position in the war years as in the pre-war years. Second, remittances maintained the solvency of KMT China's wartime economy and kept the government from bankruptcy, especially in 1937 and 1938. Recognizing the role of overseas Chinese remittances 135 in China's wartime economy, Kung Hsiang-hsi, in a glowing tribute, attributed his government's financial stability to \"the enthusiastic con\u00ad tributions of overseas Chinese in the shape of cash remittances. . . .\"62 Endorsing Kung's statement, General of funds [aiding China's balance of payments] ... is partly responsible for the soundness of the nation's war finance.\"63 Finally, the KMT Central Executive Committee lavished its praise on the patriotic performance of their overseas compatriots, saying: . . . In the course of 18 months of stubborn resistance and determined struggle, we have reduced the strength of our enemy, defeated his crack divisions, placed his army in the most difficult position and demoralized his forces, thanks to the leadership of our High Command and bravery of our officers and soldiers at the front. But our overseas Chinese have also played a great part. They have shown their deep devotion to their motherland, and have been most generous in making financial contributions to the Government. They are responsible for the soundness of our nation's war finance. Furthermore, through their efforts, international justice is being vindicated. . . ,64 It was patent that China's wartime economy owed a great deal to over\u00ad seas Chinese remittances. Beginning in 1939, the rate of increase in remittances could not keep up with the inflation of the Chinese cur\u00ad rency. By that time, foreign countries, notably the United States, had come to China's rescue. Finally, in evaluating remittance returns, it should be mentioned that economic conditions in the South Seas im\u00ad proved in 1940, as the European war created increased demands for rubber and tin. Despite this favorable economic condition, the pre\u00ad ceding study shows that overseas Chinese remittances from Southeast Asia remained at the two billion level in 1939, 1940, and 1941. One may safely conclude that two billion yuan was the limit of the ability of the Chinese abroad to contribute to China's wartime finances. Yet the limited financial resources of the Chinese abroad could not be ex\u00ad pected to help perpetually to defray China's balance of payments deficits, especially when those deficits became astronomical after 1940. What they gave to the Chiang Kai-shek government was an eloquent testimony of Chinese loyalty and duty beyond call. One should not take as propaganda Tan Kah Kee's statement at the second NCRGA meeting in 1941 that the Nanyang Chinese \"had remitted more than three billion yuan to China in the past three years or more.\"65 It may represent a very conservative estimate, for another Chinese source cites five billion yuan as having been remitted to China by 1941.66 136 Investment The third way in which the Chungking government tapped revenue was to invite overseas Chinese investments into China in order to build industrial bases or to modernize obsolete industries. The fall of Wuhan and Canton to the Japanese made it all the more necessary for the Chinese government to develop a self-sustained economy in the Southwest to carry on the war of resistance.67 For this reason, great attention was devoted to the economic development of China's in\u00ad terior. As the initial step in building a new industrial complex in the hinterland, Chungking was able to draw floating capital from Shanghai and Hankow to the interior and remove industries from the coast to inland areas controlled by the KMT government. The immediate problem facing the Chiang Kai-shek government was to seek a new source of money to invest in the industrialization program. Two resources were tapped in order to achieve the objective: foreign loans and the capital of the overseas Chinese. As Barnett noted, a tremendous amount of overseas Chinese capital flooded Shanghai as a result of the general economic instability created by the tension in Europe and Asia.68 It was under these circumstances that the KMT government announced the establishment of the Overseas Chinese Investment Information Office in early 1939.69 The newly created Office was to provide information and services for prospective overseas Chinese investors, as stipulated in the Regulations Governing Encouragement for Overseas Chinese Investments in Domestic Eco\u00ad nomic Undertakings During the National Emergency Period, which was enacted in November, 1938.70 In spite of favorable terms the Overseas Compatriot Investment Encouragement Act71 offered prospective overseas Chinese investors, response was not at all encouraging until the end of 1939 ;72 from July, 1937, to that date, an estimated 400 million yuan was invested.73 Both Japanese and Chinese gave reasons for the relatively poor investment record. First, overseas Chinese investors were afraid of the loss of investment because of an inadequate guarantee against the risk in\u00ad volved and because of political instability in China. Second, the Chungking government did not provide sufficient information about investment opportunities. As a result, prospective investors abroad did 137 not know what investment possibilities were available in China. Third, most of the Nanyang Chinese were wage earners and small shop- owners; therefore, large capital investments were hardly to be ex\u00ad pected from them. Fourth, those who had invested earlier remembered the high taxes they had paid on profits or harbored the bitter memory of a heavy investment loss in the Changchow-Amoy railways in Fukien and the Canton-Hankow railways in Kwangtung. Finally, there were no adequate facilities to handle remittances for investment.74 The Chungking government remedied these shortcomings and doubled its effort to attract investment by Chinese abroad. For instance, it sent General Wu T'ieh-ch'eng to the South Seas in 1940, on an investment promotion campaign trip; it invited leading Chinese businessmen from Southeast Asia (Tan Kah Kee and Aw Boon Haw), the United States (K'uang Huan-shun), Canada (Huang Chi-sheng), and other over\u00ad seas Chinese groups for an inspection trip in the hinterland; it ap\u00ad pointed a number of overseas Chinese to its legislative body to flatter them and called a conference on national finance policy; it established a committee to assist overseas Chinese who wished to return to China to engage in business;75 and it raised investment interest rates in Chungking and Kunming to 7 per cent and 8 per cent, respectively, to attract idle capital in Shanghai, where the interest rate was 3 per cent.76 All these measures proved successful in enticing capital investment from abroad and from Shanghai, judging by an increase in investment in 1940 and 1941. According to the Chung Mei ]ih Pao (March 17, 1941), in 1940, 30 to 35 million yuan had been invested every month in the hinterland industrial program, making the total for the year 396.4 million yuan.77 In 1941, the investment figure soared even higher; a report, reputedly \"obtained from a Chinese state bank,\" claimed that in the first ten months as much as 800 million yuan had been invested in industries in Chungking, Chengtu, Kunming, Kueiyang, Kwangsi, Kwangtung, and Fukien and predicted that the figure would reach one billion yuan by the end of the year.78 A Japanese source calculated that nearly two and a half billion yuan of capital flow had arrived in China from abroad between July, 1937, and December, 1941, of which 1.6 billion yuan, or two-thirds, had been invested in the industrial projects in the area controlled by the Nationalist government.79 Information on the type and nature of the investments is hard to 138 find. Table 8 shows a list of principal enterprises in which Nanyang Chinese either invested or planned to invest.

From Table 8, it is clear that most of the factories were established after 1940, when the economy of Southeast Asia, particularly of Malaya, prospered and inflation was rampaging, and that the investment was concentrated on land development. Furthermore, several of these over\u00ad seas Chinese-financed companies (the Overseas Chinese Enterprise Co., the Hua Hsi Land Development Co., the Bank of Construction, and the Overseas Chinese Land Development) were joint operations with conservative financial tycoons, militarists, and bureaucrat-capitalists, who had a substantial financial interest in them.80 The situation was, however, as the Mantetsu study concludes, unique in that overseas Chinese capital had united with the technological resources of the Chinese people in the hinterland. In this respect, the overseas Chinese capital investment was the \"most promising venture and the backbone of China's hinterland economic development.\"81 On the other hand, not all of these companies were in full operation by December, 1941. From information available, only the Chung Nan Rubber Company, the Tzuchung Sugar Company, and the Hua Hsi Land Development Company, in addition to a few others, were known to have started their operation by the time the Pacific War broke out. With the opening of hostilities in Southeast Asia and the subsequent Japanese occupation of the South Seas region, it is assumed that most of those in the plan\u00ad ning stages were abandoned. In conclusion, the record of the invest\u00ad ment commitment and planning was impressive; in actuality, the campaign for overseas Chinese investment in China's hinterland in\u00ad dustries was not as rewarding as has been reported.82 The Economic Effectiveness of the Boycott Movement The object of this analysis is to measure the effectiveness of the boycott, whose purposes were to inflict damages upon Japan's economy by severing business relations with the Japanese and by shutting out 141 Japanese goods and to help develop China's industry through the pur\u00ad chase of its produce. To achieve these goals, as has been shown, the Nanyang Chinese stopped buying and using Japanese commodities, refused to load and unload goods going to or arriving from Japan, severed business relations with Japanese firms and banks, refused to patronize Japanese stores, and walked off their jobs in Japanese- operated companies. The present discussion, however, is concerned mainly with the effectiveness of the boycott upon Japan's trade posi\u00ad tion, as it appears in statistics. To follow the course of the boycott and analyze its effectiveness, it is useful to represent figures with relatives or indexes. These relatives and link relatives show the situation year to year, taking the earlier year as 100. Relatives and link relatives are shown for the total ex\u00ad ports of Japan to each country in Southeast Asia. In Table 9 the material is presented in such a way as to illustrate the method of the comparison.

In 1937, Japan's exports to the South Seas countries, measured in yen, increased 33 per cent over those of 1936, but in 1938, they de\u00ad clined sharply in every country. In 1939, the effectiveness of the boycott drive was still evident everywhere save the Dutch East Indies, where Japan's exports increased beyond the pre-boycott level of 1936. In 1939, her exports to Nanyang countries began to climb slightly and the trend continued until 1941. The protracted boycott appears to have had a telling effect on the Chinese, an effect which reflected the difficulties of enforcing it for such a long time. In 1940, Japanese ex- 143 ports increased by 19 per cent over the 1939 total, reaching very close to the 1936 level. But they were far short of the 1937 figure, the best record between 1936 and 1941. In view of the fact that the Chinese were still boycotting Japanese goods, this slow recovery could be attributed in part to the boycott drive. In 1941, exports increased only 1.6 per cent over the 1940 record, although Japan's exports had almost regained the level of 1936\u2014just 2 per cent below the 1936 figure. The slow recovery rate of 1941 appears to be owing not so much to the boycott as to such non-boycott factors as trade restrictions imposed by Japan and Southeast Asian countries; the rise in Japanese labor costs; and the competition for markets, for example, Japanese and American competition for Philippine markets. Let us look more closely at the statistics. In evaluating the increase in 1937, the year the Sino-Japanese war broke out, it is important to note that an organized boycott movement did not begin until October or even much later;84 therefore, the increase for 1937 had little relation to the boycott. A boycott that started in October or thereafter came too late for its effects to be visible in the 1937 statistics. Nonetheless, there is enough evidence to permit evaluation of its effects in every country in the last quarter of 1937.85 To look for the evidence of the boycott, we must turn to 1938, 1939, 1940, and 1941. A brief examination of Table 9 reveals a great relative decline in Japan's total exports to the Nanyang in 1938; her exports decreased 43.3 per cent from the 1937 total. In 1939, although her exports gained 7 per cent over the previous year, they were approximately 150 million yen less than those of 1937, the best trade year, or a 38 per cent reduction. In 1940 and 1941 the export figures show some gains, but they were about Y100 million under the 1937 record, or about 25 per cent less. An examination of the Japanese total export figures from 1937 to 1941 leads to the conclusion that the boycott resulted in a substantial reduction in Japanese export trade with Southeast Asia in 1938 and 1939. When one considers the non-boycott factors already discussed, the effect of the boycott on the 1940 and 1941 exports is, however, less than the figure 25 per cent seems to indicate. Let us examine the figures country by country. In Malaya, the boycott had a devastating effect on Japan's export business in 1938, when it fell by 67.9 per cent. This boycott remained effective through 144 1940, although in that year her exports increased 30 per cent over those of 1939. A sudden and sharp decrease in 1941 is a puzzle. From the present study, we know that there was no renewed and intensified boycotting in that year. The decrease (65.6 per cent compared with the 1940 figure) can be attributed largely to various trade restrictions that Britain and Japan imposed on their trade. However, the Chinese boycott and the \"Buy-Chinese-Products\" campaign cannot be ignored in considering the fluctuation. Generally speaking, never had so effec\u00ad tive a boycott been conducted for so long. Its effectiveness demonstrates the intensity of the boycott movement. Japanese trade with the Dutch East Indies in 1938 showed a sharp reduction\u2014about 50 per cent of the 1937 figure. This was remarkable because the Chinese worked under less favorable conditions in 1938. However, Japan's exports in 1939 and thereafter recovered the 1936 level, indicating that an organized boycott seems to have ended by the beginning of 1940. Although the 1940 and 1941 figures did not exceed the 1937 record, they must be considered a normal level of trade, con\u00ad sidering other non-boycott factors. In the Philippines, Japan's trade decrease was consistent from 1938 to 1940\u2014an annual average of 50 per cent. It is difficult to separate the effect of the boycott from that of non-boycott factors, but the Chinese boycott no doubt contributed to the decline. The 1941 trade figure needs explanation. From this study we have learned that by the be\u00ad ginning of 1941, the Japanese no longer considered the Chinese boycott a serious threat to her trade with the Philippines. But American goods posed a new threat to Japanese trade with the Islands. Because of the quality and the competitive prices of American goods, Chinese mer\u00ad chants and consumers, both Chinese and Filipinos, appear to have flocked to them, thus contributing to a further decline in Japanese exports. As will be shown, the United States benefited most from the Chinese boycott. In 1938, the boycott affected Thailand less than all the other South\u00ad east Asian countries\u2014a 10 per cent decline. Only in 1939, when the Communists added militancy, did the boycott show a contrasting effect. In that year, Japan's trade dropped 1.3 million yen, or a decline of 33.8 per cent. As we already know, in 1939, the Thai government crushed the Chinese National Salvation Movement with a series of police ac- 145 tions which almost caused the Movement to disintegrate. The demise of the campaign was reflected in the 1940 statistic figure; Japan's 1940 trade with Thailand reached the level of the best trade year\u20141937. Thailand was the only country in which Japan's export trade re\u00ad covered to the 1937 level. The 1940 and 1941 figures show that for all practical purposes the Chinese boycott drive had ceased, confirming the observation discussed in Chapter II. The sharp decline in Japan's exports to French Indochina in 1938 and 1939 may not be attributable entirely to the boycott, because France maintained a stringent protectionist trade policy in her Far Eastern colony. Furthermore, the outbreak of war in Europe and the fall of France were significant to the decrease recorded in 1939 and 1940. The spectacular rise in the 1941 export figure can be explained by the fact that beginning in 1941, Japanese troops were stationed in French Indo\u00ad china, requiring Japan to export to the colony goods and equipment for maintaining military logistics. The explanation seems to be sup\u00ad ported by further evidence that in 1942, Japan's exports to French Indo\u00ad china soared to 144 million yen because the colony had become the logistical base for Japanese military operations in Southeast Asia, and Saigon was the seat of the Japanese supreme command for the Southern area between November, 1941, and July, 1942.86 Economic conditions in Southeast Asia and Japan and the various countries' own trade policies were responsible for a decrease in Japanese export trade with the Nanyang countries. There was a steady decline in the prices of rubber, tin, sugar, and rice, the principal commodities of the region, until war started in Europe in September, 1939. Naturally the purchasing power of the natives dropped. Southeast Asian govern\u00ad ments' enactment of a quota system for Japanese textiles and their erection of a high tariff wall hurt Japan's exports to the South Seas region.87 In addition, the Japanese government passed a trade regu\u00ad latory act in September, 1937, under which the export of strategic materials and the import of non-strategic goods were prohibited. \"It would be an exaggeration,\" one western observer stated, \"to ascribe all of Japan's recent losses in Southeast Asia to the effect of the boycott campaign. Other factors have been at work, notably restrictions on raw material imports and rising costs of production in Japan, which have seriously hampered her export trade.\"88 Nevertheless, we are 146 bound to conclude that the Chinese boycott was generally effective in 1938 and 1939. So many other factors entered into the calculation of boycott effectiveness after 1940, that it is impossible to measure the effect of the boycott drive. It seems reasonable to argue that before 1940, the boycott was important in Japan's export trade with South\u00ad east Asia but after 1940, its importance decreased. A more precise method of studying the impact of the boycott is an examination of Japanese monthly export figures. The 1937-1939 period is selected for the purpose because the Chinese boycott was most in\u00ad tense in these years,89 and the Japanese government stopped the publi\u00ad cation of monthly trade returns after 1939 for security reasons. TABLE 10 VALUE IN JAPANESE YEN (MILLIONS) OF GOODS MOVING FROM JAPAN TO MALAYA, 1937-1939 1937 1938 1939 January February March April May , June July August September October November December Table 10 shows that Japan's exports started to fall in August, 1937, and continued to decline until they reached a low point in February, 1939. The effectiveness of the boycott drive in Malaya is shown by a comparison of the export average for the first six months in 1937, when there was no boycott, with those of 1938 and 1939. The overall monthly average for the first six months in 1937 was 7.2 million yen, and averages for the corresponding periods in 1938 and 1939 were 1.8 million yen and 1.6 million yen, respectively. In other words, Japan's exports in the first six months of 1938 and 1939 dropped to one-fourth of those in the corresponding period of 1937. Table 10 also reveals an interesting fact about the response of the Malayan Chinese to those events of the war in China of particular con-4.7 5.3 8.3 7.1 8.5 9.0 8.8 5.7 4.3 4.1 3.2 3.4 1.2 1.2 1.9 1.8 2.2 2.6 2.0 1.8 2.1 1.7 2.1 2.5 1.0 0.9 2.0 1.6 2.0 2.2 1.8 2.0 2.0 2.3 2.0 2.8 147 cern to them. For instance, following each major Japanese victory\u2014the fall of Nanking in December, 1937, the capitulation of Canton and Wuhan in October, 1938, and the defection of Wang Ching-wei in December, 1938\u2014there was a sharp decrease in Japanese monthly exports, suggesting that Chinese intensified their boycott in each instance. We turn to a brief examination of Japan's important export com\u00ad modities to the British colony. Of twenty-eight main export items, all but a few suffered. Merchandise easily identifiable as Japanese proved the best targets for boycotting. Aquatic produce, mainly fish and its products consumed exclusively by the Chinese, sustained such a heavy damage that its market in Malaya was all but wiped out; statistics show its decline from 1.0 million yen to 29,000 yen. Other vulnerable goods were gelatine (285,913 yen to 129,576 yen); and toys (631,132 yen to 214,489 yen). Since that merchandise was traditionally bought and sold by Chinese whole\u00ad salers and shopkeepers, it is safe to assume that the Chinese boycott drive was responsible for the cut. Finally, we look at the shift in trade from the Japanese to the British and Chinese as a result of the boycott. TABLE 11 A COMPARATIVE CHART SHOWING A SHIFT IN MALAYA'S IMPORTS IN RELATION TO JAPAN, BRITAIN, AND CHINA (Thousands) Yearbook, 1936, 1937, 1938, 1939, and 1940. 148 This table makes it plain that Malaya's imports from Japan dwindled steadily until the end of 1940. The decrease in 1940 as compared with the 1936 import figure was 56.1 per cent. On the other hand, Malaya's imports from China for 1940 increased 75 per cent over those in 1936. The steady increase in her imports from China since 1938 can be at\u00ad tributed partially to a \"Buy-Chinese-Products\" campaign which was conducted along with the boycott. Also noticeable in the table is that Britain shared some gains from the Chinese boycott of Japanese goods, particularly in 1939. Since Britain was the principal supplier for her colony and many of her exports, especially cotton and textile goods, were in competition with Japanese export goods, it can be in\u00ad ferred that the Chinese turned to British products as substitutes for Japanese goods. The Chinese boycott in the Dutch East Indies produced the mildest impact in Southeast Asia. Monthly export figures are in Table 12. From official quarterly trade statistics, we learn that the monthly aver\u00ad age of Japan's exports to the Dutch colony in the first half of 1937 was 19.2 yen.90 Averages for the comparable periods in 1938 and 1939, however, went down to 7.2 million yen and 9.2 million yen, respectively, or about a fifty per cent decrease. The recovery in Japanese exports TABLE 12 VALUE IN JAPANESE YEN (MILLIONS) OF GOODS MOVING FROM JAPAN TO THE DUTCH EAST INDIES, 1937-1939 1937 1938 1939 January 6.1 5.3 February 6.3 7.0 March 6.3 10.5 April 8.6 8.9 May 7.9 12.3 June 8.0 11.2 July 20.3 7.2 11.3 August 14.8 9.8 12.2 September 15.0 10.4 10.8 October 13.3 11.2 13.2 November 11.4 11.6 16.1 December 10.0 11.5 19.1 to the Dutch East Indies was quicker than it was in British Malaya, and, as a matter of fact, the Dutch East Indies was the only country wherein Japan's monthly export figure returned to the pre-boycott level 149 as early as December, 1939. As in British Malaya, the most effective period of the boycott was the first six months of 1938; thereafter, monthly figures inched back to normalcy. It shows that a protracted boycott had its own built-in limitation for endurance, particularly in such a country as the Dutch Indies, where authorities were less acquiescent and tolerant toward the politically motivated boycott and where the Chinese were a tiny minority depending upon an over\u00ad whelming number of native consumers for a livelihood. Despite the severity of the boycott, its overall effect was, as it was expected, the mildest in all Southeast Asian countries. The fall of Nanking came at a time when the boycott was about to reach its peak, producing a sharp change in the trade figure (a drop from 10.0 to 6.1). Wang Ching-wei's defection in December, 1938, caused a similarly sharp re\u00ad duction for the following two months. However, such events as the landing of the Japanese troops on Hainan Island (February, 1939) and at Amoy (May, 1939), and Wang Ching-wei's severance of relations with Chiang Kai-shek (July, 1939) produced no visible change in Japan's exports to the Dutch colony. The absence of response to these events reconfirms an earlier assertion that an organized Chinese boy\u00ad cott in the Netherland Indies was coming to an end in late 1939. It was also indicative of the attitude of the Indies-Chinese, most of whom were local-born and were oriented to Indonesia rather than to China. Grains, foodstuffs, leather and leather products, oils and fats, cot\u00ad ton tissues, metal and metal goods, and finished machinery proved sen\u00ad sitive to boycotting. Each one of these items showed a decrease of about one-half or more of the 1937 figures. Until 1937, Japan had been the principal trade partner of the Dutch East Indies, followed by the colony's mother country, as shown in Table 13. Japan's position was reversed in 1938, the year of the most severe boycott, when Holland became the principal supplier for her colony. In that year, Japan lost 52,652 Gd. in trade, a loss of 9.6 per cent in import percentage in the colony's total imports. Neither the Nether\u00ad lands nor China reaped the benefits from the Japanese loss because the East Indies' imports from the motherland increased only 12,280 Gd., or 3.1 per cent, and China did not even share the benefits from the trade shift, as the decrease in imports from China (476 Gd., or 0.1 per cent decline) proves. In 1939, imports from Holland dropped 6,899 150 TABLE 13 A COMPARATIVE CHART SHOWING A SHIFT IN THE DUTCH EAST INDIES' IMPORTS IN RELATION TO JAPAN, THE NETHERLANDS, AND CHINA (Thousands) Japan Netherlands China 1936 Gd. 75,208 (26.7) Gd. 47,116 brackets import per\u00ad centage in relation to total imports. Gd. under the 1938 total figure; the East Indies' percentage of imports from Holland in relation to the colony's total imports dropped also. On the other hand, Japan, still the second trade partner, increased her ex\u00ad ports, gaining 13,146 Gd. and 2.2 per cent in the East Indies' imports relative to the colony's total imports. Only in 1939 and 1940 did the imports from China increase, not so much the result of the \"Buy-China- Products\" campaign as of the outbreak of war in Europe and Hol\u00ad land's capitulation to Germany. The increase in imports from China, therefore, was at the expense of the Netherlands, not Japan. Yet, there was a boycott throughout the archipelagoes in 1939 and 1940, and it annoyed the Japanese, as has been observed. Some increase in imports from China may have been due to the \"Buy-China-Products\" cam\u00ad paign, but China and her compatriots in the Dutch colony were un\u00ad able to promote the \"Buy-Chinese-Products\" campaign as effectively as in British Malaya. An earlier examination of the Chinese boycott movement in the Philippines disclosed that it was one of the best disciplined and well- organized movements. Trade statistics support this observation, as shown in Table 14. No appreciable decrease was detected in 1937, mainly because the anti-Japanese movement, with its systematic boycott drive, did not start until late February, 1938. Another interesting fact is that the second half of each of the years in the study shows a steady increase in imports from Japan, followed by a decrease. This pattern may be ex\u00ad plained by the fact that the Philippines is the only Christian country in Southeast Asia that observes Christmas and then the Chinese New 151 TABLE 14 VALUE IN JAPANESE YEN (MILLIONS) OF GOODS MOVING FROM JAPAN TO THE PHILIPPINES, 1937-1939 1937 1938 1939 January 3.4 1.5 February 3.9 1.8 March 3.2 1.9 April 3.8 2.2 May 2.7 2.1 June 2.5 2.1 July 4.7 1.9 1.9 August 4.9 1.8 1.7 September 5.2 1.8 1.8 October 5.4 2.2 2.6 November 5.4 2.6 2.5 December 4.9 2.8 2.8 Year and a unique celebration of Semana Santa. Chinese merchants must have attempted to stock Japanese goods for these religious holi\u00ad days despite the boycott. The consistency of the pattern of statistical fluctuation tends to support the Japanese observation.91 A comparison of the second half of 1937, when there was no organized boycott, with the corresponding periods of 1938 and 1939 reveals that Japan's exports to the Islands in 1938 and 1939 were cut to one-half of the 1937 average. The fall of Nanking, before the boycott and in the midst of the buying for the holidays, and the fall of Canton and Wuhan, in late October, 1938, when Chinese merchants were beginning to stock goods for the year's end and the New Year holidays, did not produce a significant drop in Japanese exports, as they did in Malaya. In contrast, the land\u00ad ings of the Japanese troops at Amoy and the subsequent seizure of the city had some effect because about 80 per cent of the Filipino-Chinese emigrated from Fukien province, in which Amoy is located. The fluctuation following Wang Ching-wei's defection and his announce\u00ad ment of his severing of relations with the Chungking government sug\u00ad gests that these major events, in addition to the promulgation of Regu\u00ad lations Governing the Purge and Registration of Enemy Goods (May, 1939), may have had something to do with the decrease. Cotton was a commodity of first importance among Japanese ex\u00ad ports to the Philippines. The decline in the export of this product was extremely sharp, a drop of 4.4 million pesos in the three years from 152 1938 through 1940.92 The decrease can be partly attributed to the rising cost of cotton products in Japan, which made it harder for Japan to compete with finer American cotton goods.93 Other export articles which showed a drastic decline were silk and rayon (3,605 pesos to 723 pesos); iron pesos to 2,431,000 pesos). In the Philippines, but not in the Dutch East Indies, substitutes for boycotted Japanese goods were available at comparable prices from the United States; therefore, Philippine imports from the United States increased substantially from 1938 through 1940, as shown in Table 15. TABLE 15 A COMPARATIVE CHART SHOWING A SHIFT IN PHILIPPINES' IMPORTS IN RELATION TO JAPAN, THE UNITED STATES, AND CHINA (millions) Japan United States China 1936 P263 P123.7 P54 1937 32.2 127.3 6.6 1938 25.4 181.6 6.1 1939 15.2 167.4 5.2 1940 12.1 210.4 6.2 Sources: Year Boo\\ of Philippine Statistics 1940. Daitoa \\oe\\i \\ihon to\\ei. Japan lost a market of 20 million pesos, but the United States gained 83 million pesos between 1937 and 1940. Since China's gains in her exports to the Philippines in these years were almost nil, Chinese merchants turned to American goods as substitutes for boycotted Japanese goods. As a matter of fact, an official of the Japanese Chamber of Commerce in the Philippines suggested a 10-to-30 per cent price reduction across the board for principal Japanese export goods in order to cope with the competitive prices of American products.94 The im\u00ad plication is that by the early spring of 1941, according to this study, the Chinese boycott was no longer a serious threat to Japanese trade in the Philippines. Instead, it was U.S. products that were undermining Japan's market in the Islands. With reduced prices, Chinese merchants, it was hoped, would switch back to Japanese goods because of a larger margin of profit. In the Philippines, a combination of the Chinese boycott, reportedly operating in 1941, but at a much reduced efifective- 153 ness; the availability of comparable or superior American products; and the rising cost of Japanese manufactured goods produced an eco\u00ad nomic situation detrimental to the Japanese export position. These conditions tended to help make the Chinese boycott drive more effec\u00ad tive and durable than it had been. This peculiar situation was in con\u00ad trast to the situation in the Netherlands Indies, where Chinese business\u00ad men did not have such an option, since Holland and other European countries could not supply substitutes for Japanese articles. They were either involved in the European war or had been occupied by Germany. Thailand, whose attitude toward the Chinese boycott movement was unsympathetic, provides a contrast between the objectives and the achievements of boycotting. The KMT-instigated Chinese anti-Japa\u00ad nese movement, lacking able leadership after 1938, was one of the more violent movements. Consequently, the sinews of the KMT- organized work were almost destroyed by repeated police actions at the end of 1940. A glance at Table 16 shows that the boycott had a relatively mild effect in 1938. In Malaya and the Philippines, the boycott reduced Japanese exports by more than 50 per cent in the second half of 1938, compared with the corresponding period of 1937; in Thailand, the boycott cut Japanese exports by only 23 per cent in the second half of 1938. The inefficiency of the Thai-Chinese boycott is even clearer when the proportion of the Chinese population to the total population of Thailand and of the Philippines is compared. The total population of Thailand and of the Philippines was about the same in the late 1930's; the population of each was roughly 13 million. On the other hand, the Thai-Chinese population was 2.5 million, whereas the Filipino-Chinese population was only one-quarter of a million. The 250,000 Filipino- Chinese produced a much more effective boycott result than the 2.5 million Thai-Chinese because of the skillful leadership and discipline provided by the Filipino-Chinese. It seems that the terrorism and murders that accompanied the Thai-Chinese boycott movement were indicative of its failure. With this observation, let us look at monthly export figures. We do know that the Chinese started a systematic boycott in October, 1937, and that there was a well-established KMT organization until 1938. 154 3.6 2.8 6.3 2.8 2.7 4.9 2.5 1.9 2.5 2.7 4.9 7.2 1.4 6.2 1.4 2.2 3.0 3.6 1.9 2.7 3.2 1.8 1.9 1.6 2.1 2.0 1.9 1.8 1.7 3.4 Despite the boycott and the KMT organization, the result of the boy\u00ad cott was not impressive in 1937 and 1938, as evidenced by the rises and falls of import figures and by a monthly average of Japan's exports, which was 3.6 million yen for 1937 and 3.2 million yen for 1938. Only in 1939 was the boycott effective (the monthly average dropped to 2.2 TABLE 16 VALUE OF JAPANESE YEN (MILLIONS) OF GOODS MOVING FROM JAPAN TO THAILAND, 1937-1939 1937 1938 1939 January February March April May June July August September October November December million yen). We may attribute the decline to the Communists, who became active in the boycott movement, assuming increasingly the command of the anti-Japanese movement after late 1938. The militancy of the Communist-inspired boycott had a telling effect on Japanese exports in 1939, but, at the same time, it made the Thais indignant, and they retaliated with suppressive measures. In summary, most of the Chinese in the Kingdom, patriotic as they were, appeared to be unable to organize an effective boycott campaign until 1939, partly because of their fear that such a movement would certainly provoke a hostile response from the Thais. The boycott was effective in 1939, though. Therefore, Skinner's remark that the boycott in 1937 and 1938 was \"extremely effective,\" as quoted earlier,95 should be read with reservations. Cotton textiles and their products, which constituted two-thirds of Thailand's imports from Japan, suffered very little from the boycott; Thailand imported cotton products valued at 17.9 million yen in 1937, 16.1 million yen in 1938, and 16.0 million yen in 1939. This phenome\u00ad non, despite the fact that cotton goods was elsewhere the item most 155 vulnerable to the boycott, is attributable to Thailand's being a free market for cotton goods.96 Metal and allied products, however, vir\u00ad tually lost their market in Thailand in 1938\u2014their exports dropped by 88 per cent. Their decline was as much attributable to the Chinese boy\u00ad cott as it was to Japan's trade regulations on these strategic materials. The decline in food (including aquatic products), paper, and china and glassware exports is ascribed solely to the Chinese boycott. Food exports dropped from 1.6 million yen in 1937 to 502,000 yen in 1939; paper, from 1.2 million yen to 50,000 yen; and china and glassware, from 1 million yen to 51,000 yen. Table 17 shows a steady increase in imports from China and Britain and a decrease in imports from Japan. The rise in China's exports to Thailand attests to an effective campaign for Chinese to buy China's own products, such as metals and cotton cloth, which China could sell TABLE 17 A COMPARATIVE CHART SHOWING A SHIFT IN THAILAND'S IMPORTS IN RELATION TO JAPAN, BRITAIN, AND CHINA (millions) Japan Bt31.1 24.1 20.2 18.7 Britain Btl2.8 15.8 17.8 79.5 China Btll.9 9.4 16.2 17.2 Source: Annual Statement of the Foreign Trade and Navigation of the Kingdom of Thailand, 1936, 1937, 1938, 1939, and 1940. at a lower price.97 In no other country in Southeast Asia did China compete so closely with Japan as in Thailand in 1938 and 1939. Britain also reaped a lion's share during the boycotting years, particularly in 1939. This is positive proof that the Chinese bought British goods as substitutes for Japanese commodities. It is doubtful, however, that Britain continued to be the principal supplier of Chinese needs in 1940, because of the end of the \"phony\" war in Europe. Japan's trade with French Indochina had been insignificant be\u00ad cause French policy was mercantilistic. On the other hand, French Indochina's trade relations with China had been particularly strong; China was second only to France itself in the quantity of trade with the colony, and Japan ranked fifth. Japan found it difficult, for instance, to 156 398 328 419 295 167 445 223 254 400 241 279 372 152 159 211 279 265 318 150 131 281 168 174 199 161 161 114 185 186 269 export her cotton goods to French Indochina because of France's per\u00ad sistent protectionist policy.98 TABLE 18 VALUE IN JAPANESE YEN (THOUSANDS) OF GOODS MOVING FROM JAPAN TO FRENCH INDOCHINA, 1937-1939 1937 1938 1939 January February March April May June July August September October November December There was a slight decrease in Japan's exports to French Indochina in the second half of 1937. It is difficult to tell whether the boycott was responsible for the decline, but it is reasonable to assume that the anti- Japanese movement was responsible to some degree since the boycott started in late August. In 1938, the effect of the boycott began to show in the statistics in French Indochina as in other countries. A sharp de\u00ad crease in Japanese imports was recorded in July and August, coinciding with the Japanese bombings of Chinese cities in central and southern China. The defection of Wang Ching-wei and his arrival in Hanoi in December, 1938, might have had some effect on the low figures of January and February of 1939. Generally speaking, monthly figures for 1939 show some evidence of the boycott's effect, which was made even stronger by the acceleration of China's export trade with French Indochina and by a better exchange rate for the piaster as the Chinese yuan depreciated. The \"Buy-Chinese-Products\" drive was successful, as Table 19 shows. China's exports to French Indochina began to increase in 1937, and the 1940 total shows an increase of 55 per cent over the 1936 figure. Added to this increased trade were China's exports through Hong Kong. It is generally acknowledged that exports to French Indochina 157 TABLE 19 A COMPARATIVE CHART SHOWING A SHIFT IN FRENCH INDOCHINA'S IMPORTS IN RELATION TO JAPAN, FRANCE, CHINA, AND HONG KONG (thousands) Japan France China Hong Kong 1936 P 2,639 P 52,042 P 9,025 1937, 1940. from Hong Kong were of Chinese origin.\" China's exports through Hong Kong, beginning in 1937, sky-rocketed more than three and a half times over those of 1936; and in 1940, when France fell to Ger\u00ad many, China replaced France as the principal exporter. This rapid gain no doubt resulted in part from both a successful \"Buy-Chinese- Products\" campaign and the depreciation of the yuan. It is doubtful, however, whether China enjoyed favorable trade relations with French Indochina in 1941, because in late 1940, Japan's influence began to grow in the French colony. Japan's export decrease, beginning in 1939,100 was the result of boycotting, Chinese patronage of home products, high tariff, and her own self-imposed trade restrictions. Among principal import items from Japan, chinaware, silk tissue, and aquatic products\u2014all easily identifiable as Japanese\u2014were effec\u00ad tively boycotted. 158 Chapter IV Summary and Conclusions The anti-Japanese National Salvation Movement from 1937 to 1941 was the most persistent, extensive, and intensified campaign that the Nanyang Chinese had waged against Japan since 1908, when they organized the first movement. Like similar movements in the past, that of 1937-1941 was largely the expression of the national conscious\u00ad ness of the Nanyang Chinese. Needless to say, their nationalism did not burst forth in 1937; it had begun to grow after the turn of the century when Japan defeated Imperial China in the 1894-95 Sino- Japanese War and when the decadent Manchu government failed to transform China into a modern state through the 1898 Hundred Days of Reform. The successful Chinese Revolution in 1911 served the cause of Nanyang Chinese nationalism, but the subsequent history of Republican China disillusioned the Chinese abroad. Therefore, they responded with joy and pride when the reorganized KMT government unified China in 1927. After the KMT government had established its control over China, the regime, aware of a strong surge of national\u00ad ism among Nanyang Chinese, began to get seriously interested in them. On a practical level, the overseas Chinese, especially the Nan\u00ad yang Chinese, whose remittances traditionally balanced China's bud\u00ad getary deficits, were important to KMT China both as a principal source of revenue for her national treasury and as a vehicle for promot\u00ad ing her national interests. For the next several years, the KMT government cemented ties with the overseas Chinese by passing a series of bills that strengthened its overseas Chinese program. At the same time, particularly after 1928, the Chinese government, through its overseas machinery, de\u00ad liberately fostered the patriotism of the Nanyang Chinese with the San-Min-Chu-I. Also joined in this Tang-hua chiao-yu movement were Chinese Chambers of Commerce, various associations, newspapers, and schools. The program succeeded in sharpening the Nanyang Chinese awareness of their fatherland's great culture and history, instilling in the compatriots a strong sense of being Chinese and of solidarity with China. In this context, the KMT's San-Min-Chu-I ideology became 159 attractive to the Nanyang Chinese because it provided a set of ideas which expressed their nationalist views. This KMT overseas program paid off handsomely, if it is mea\u00ad sured by the support the KMT government received from the Nan\u00ad yang Chinese during the 1928 and the 1931-32 National Salvation Movements, despite the Depression, and during the protracted 1937- 41 movement. The Nanyang Chinese viewed the Sino-Japanese War of 1937-41 as a grave threat to China's existence. It is noted that the National Salvation Movement, particularly the relief contribution campaign, was a spontaneous movement that spread quickly throughout South\u00ad east Asia. Only after it was well underway did the KMT government provide advice and guidance. The initial responses of the Nanyang Chinese were similar; they pledged their loyalty to the Chinese govern\u00ad ment. Thereafter, various forms of the anti-Japanese and National Salvation Movement developed: contributions, bond subscriptions, boycotts, investment in China's industrial development, combat and non-combat service corps in China, and the \"Buy-Chinese-Products\" campaign. Nanyang Chinese resorted to every conceivable device, both legal and illegal, to help China's struggle for survival and impeded Japan's advance into Southeast Asia by disrupting her market there. Whether the National Salvation Movement of 1937-41 was a suc\u00ad cess is a subjective judgment. The Japanese tended to minimize the achievements of the Movement and the effect of the boycott, accentuat\u00ad ing, instead, difficulties of the Chinese in trying to carry out the cam\u00ad paign. On the other hand, the Chinese maximized their achievements, concealing internal factionalism and division that weakened their effectiveness. Obviously, the truth of the matter lies somewhere be\u00ad tween the two claims. The preceding study shows that the Nanyang Chinese achieved some remarkable and tangible results. The money they poured into the coffers of the KMT government was a significant contribution to China's wartime financing. Not counting investments, remittances, and the value of material donations, revenue from relief contributions and bond subscriptions was estimated as 355 to 390 mil\u00ad lion yuan during the four-year period\u2014a monthly average of seven million yuan. Besides, Nanyang Chinese remitted about five billion yuan to China during the same period. Contributions and remittances 160 financed one-fourth of China's military expenditures during the first year of the hostilities. The Nanyang Chinese also boycotted Japanese goods a large part of the four years, producing a telling effect on Japanese trade with all the Southeast Asian countries, particularly in 1938 and 1939. These are graphic records of the achievements that few peoples, particularly minority groups, can match in either material contributions or tenacity. The National Salvation Movement crystallized in the formation of the Nanyang Chinese Relief General Association, organized in Oc\u00ad tober, 1938, at the height of national sentiment. Never before had the Chinese National Salvation Movement had a central organization to direct and coordinate its diversified activities. Never before had the Nanyang Chinese spoken in a single voice and acted as a body against the Japanese. The solidarity of the Nanyang Chinese, under NCRGA leadership, was nowhere more evident than in their reaction to the Wang Ching-wei government. They saw in that regime a threat to what they were working for\u2014the emergence of a strong China. It is this persistence in supporting China under Chiang Kai-shek that concerned the Japanese government. In hearings of the Budget Committee of the National Diet on February 4, 1941, Representative Tsurumi Yusuke asked Foreign Minister Matsuoka Yosuke how the government was planning to deal with the Nanyang Chinese, specifi\u00ad cally to handle the problems of their monetary contributions to Chung\u00ad king and of the obstacles they might place in the way of the Japanese. The government, Matsuoka admitted, had no feasible plan for dealing with that group who held the key to Japan's diplomatic adjustment with China.1 Implicit in his reply was the admission that the Japanese government, despite many attempts, had failed to alienate the Nan\u00ad yang Chinese from the KMT government. United as they were in opposing Japan, the Nanyang Chinese were not immune to dissension. Creating that dissension were clannishness, the Communists, the KMT's excessive interference, and the inde\u00ad pendence, as well as the self-interest, of the Chinese association. The present study of the National Salvation Movement reveals the inherent clannishness within Chinese communities. This divisive force accentuated strains in the movement. As I have pointed out, the NCRGA and the National Salvation Movement were dominated by 161 China-oriented Chinese who were, not surprisingly, China-born and China-educated. Because leaders of the NCRGA and the National Salvation Movement were China-born and China-educated and be\u00ad cause they did not have political power under the local governments, they were strongly China-oriented.2 That West-oriented and educated local-born Chinese leaders were left out of the NCRGA leadership circles confirms the existence of a chasm between the China-oriented Chinese and the West-oriented Chinese. This division within Chinese communities was particularly marked in Singapore-Malaya, where there were both China-centered and British-centered loyalties. The existence of that divided loyalty was public knowledge; Tah Kah Kee complained that local-born Chinese did not contribute as much as China-born Chinese. A similar division existed in the Dutch Indies between the Sinkheh and the Baba. The clannishness characteristic of Chinese communities was also evident in the exclusion of Hakkas. Except for two Cantonese Hakkas, Fukienese controlled the NCRGA. Throughout the four-year cam\u00ad paign there appears to have been no attempt to unify the Fukienese and the Cantonese. The rivalry between the Fukienese leader Tan Kah Kee and the Hakka leader Aw Boon Haw did not help solve the unity problem. Not only clannishness but also the KMT-Communist power struggle undermined the united front. During the honeymoon period of the united front, the Communists succeeded in making inroads into the National Salvation Movement, and the non-Communists accepted them as patriots. After an armed clash\u2014the New Fourth Army in\u00ad cident in 1941\u2014the dissolution of the united front had serious reper\u00ad cussions on the National Salvation Movement. The renewed hostility was responsible for creating disunity among Filipino-Chinese leaders of the Resist-the-Enemy Committees. More seriously, Tan Kah Kee became disenchanted with the already graft-ridden KMT government because he was convinced that only through the united front could China hope to become a strong state. Finally, the KMT's excessive interference made some powerful Nanyang Chinese leaders unhappy and created ill feelings among them. Although Nanyang Chinese leaders had consistently supported the KMT government against Japanese encroachment, they asserted 162 their independence and resisted the KMT's attempts to control the National Salvation Movement. An example is the Manila Chamber of Commerce-KMT conflict. Chamber of Commerce leaders became irritated because KMT meddling forced them to start a boycott which they knew would be ineffective and would jeopardize their business position as well as the interests of the Chinese community. Though the boycott began, the Chamber of Commerce leaders did not like the way KMT activists had forced them to act. Consequently, they succeeded in ousting Tseng T'ing-chiian from the boycott committee. They did not wish to be controlled. The 1941 Tan Kah Kee affair Was another result of KMT interference. Too impetuous and anxious to achieve objectives, KMT officials tried to coerce Nanyang Chinese into replacing Tan Kah Kee with someone more amenable to the KMT view. Wu T'ieh-ch'eng's and Kao Ling-pai's smear campaign to pre\u00ad vent Tan's re-election failed because the Nanyang Chinese did not want KMT control. That these attempts were not successful proves that the Chamber of Commerce and Nanyang Chinese leaders were not stooges of the KMT government in spite of its elaborate control system. The KMT was not, however, the only organization that faced a control problem. The Chamber of Commerce had the same difficulty with its own affiliates. Traditionally, the power of the Chinese group rests upon the doctrine of responsibility; therefore, the group is ac\u00ad countable for the actions of its members. A corollary of this doctrine is the association's power to administer discipline and punishment to its members. The Chamber of Commerce, the most powerful organiza\u00ad tion, wields this power. As I have discussed, individual merchants and business associations did not always comply with directives of the Chamber of Commerce. The fact that the Chamber of Commerce had to apply pressure suggests that it did not have total control, contrary to a popularly accepted view that it controlled guild associations, and that Nanyang Chinese communities were a cohesive and unified society whose members were completely loyal to their associations which demanded such a commitment. Chinese merchants, like their parent organization, behaved in accordance with their self-interests. This statement points out an important relationship between the effectiveness of the National Salvation Movement and that of Nanyang Chinese nationalism. Naturally, when the long range self- or business- 163 interests of the Nanyang Chinese, particularly of the merchant class, coincided with the national interest of the KMT government, the Na\u00ad tional Salvation Movement became an effective vehicle of the Chamber of Commerce. The Nanyang Chinese generally believed that China under the KMT in the late 1930's was winning a place in the sun and serving their interests. They were aware of the benefits they could derive from a strong China. A powerful and united China would be able not only to supply Nanyang Chinese businessmen with goods to sell but also to protect the welfare of Chinese communities. The Nan\u00ad yang Chinese realized that a Japan-dominated China would not, in the long run, safeguard their interests but would pose a local threat to their interests. A China dominated by Japan, then, would be incom\u00ad patible with Nanyang Chinese self-interest. Taking the long view, the Nanyang Chinese cooperated with the KMT. They launched the Na\u00ad tional Salvation Movement because Japan was attempting to keep China divided and weak. In short, the Nanyang Chinese supported the KMT government not so much because the KMT and its ideology persuaded them as they expressed the nationalistic views of the Nan\u00ad yang Chinese; rather, they recognized the KMT government as a use\u00ad ful political power for their ultimate interests. In the National Salva\u00ad tion Movement the common interest of the KMT and the Nanyang Chinese met on the level of national aspirations\u2014the emergence of a strong China. This conclusion seems to reinforce the view that the Nanyang Chi\u00ad nese supported the Chinese government, not the government of the KMT or the Communist Party. As I have pointed out, Tan Kah Kee stood for Pu-p'ien-pu-tang\u2014the position Consul Kao denounced as anachronistic when he demanded that Tan and his followers com\u00ad mit themselves to absolute loyalty to the KMT government. Tan and many others supported the KMT because it would serve their future interests; for the same reason they supported the Communist regime in the postwar period. In this context, Tan Kah Kee's motives for sympathizing with the Chinese Communist Party become clearer. As he compared the discipline and frugality of the Communist regime with the corruption of the KMT government, Tan saw China's hope in a Chinese Communist government. His sympathy for the Com\u00ad munist Party, shown in 1940-1941, was therefore not ideological; it was 164 the practical consideration of a man who had spent his lifetime in the cause of the emergence of a China which could protect the interest of Nanyang Chinese communities and which he and his compatriots could be proud of. On the other hand, when the economic- or the self-interests of the Nanyang Chinese were not compatible with KMT political interests, the National Salvation Movement began to lose its effectiveness. The Nanyang Chinese had to keep their real and immediate problems in sight. Their realistic approach to these problems, arising from their dominant economic position among peoples generally hostile to them, appears to have motivated their actions. The behavior of the Thai- Chinese leaders illustrates this point. Because of the surge of Thai nationalism, after early 1941, the Thai-Chinese main concern was economic survival, not an effective campaign for the National Salva\u00ad tion Movement. Although remaining loyal to China, they could not support the movement at the expense of their economic position or at the risk of their survival. In Thailand and, to a certain extent, in the Philippines and the Dutch East Indies, carrying out an effective Na\u00ad tional Salvation Movement would have spelled economic disaster for the Chinese. They depended upon Japanese goods for business and ultimately for their livelihood. They lacked the capital to endure a protracted boycott, which would not endear them to the natives, who were the principal consumers of boycotted Japanese merchandise. Needless to say, the local governments, for economic and political rea\u00ad sons, would not long tolerate the politically motivated National Salva\u00ad tion Movement. As I have shown, the Thai and Filipino governments used the Chinese boycott as a pretext to curb Chinese economic ac\u00ad tivities. The colonial authorities also suppressed the National Salva\u00ad tion Movement to maintain law and order and to avoid diplomatic complications with Japan. The Chinese were usually in the uncomfortable position of being under pressure from both sides. The KMT and other groups urged them to boycott; local governments urged them not to boycott. They wanted to support China's cause, but they did not want to jeopardize their economic life and livelihood. It is therefore understandable that quite a few merchants defied boycott orders out of economic necessity and that they had to be coerced to continue anti-Japanese activities. 165 Even the powerful machinery of the KMT government, well known as an organization given to attempting to guide other bodies, could not obtain from the Nanyang Chinese a total commitment to patriotism. The realistic Nanyang Chinese could not afford to forget their goal\u2014 economic survival\u2014which they had to attain with or without the KMT government. Although some interests of the Nanyang Chinese coin\u00ad cided with the national interests of the KMT government, others did not. That conflict of interests explains the behavior of the Nanyang Chinese. The Nanyang Chinese National Salvation Movement was not an example of total patriotism; the Nanyang Chinese, like other groups, could not be expected to be completely altruistic. This self-interest, one suspects, explains both the decrease of en\u00ad thusiasm as a result of the prolonged drive and the noticeable slacken\u00ad ing of boycott and anti-Japanese activities when Japan emerged as a dominant Southeast Asian power in 1941. A general decline in the effectiveness of the National Salvation Movement may be attributed to Nanyang Chinese interest in protection and survival. The behavior of some business leaders indicated that they did not wish to get involved further in outright anti-Japanese activity when Japan's dominance was imminent in Southeast Asia. As I have discussed, the actions of Alfonso Sycip Hsueh Fen-shih of the Philippines, Chu Chi-hsing of Indochina, and Chang Lan-ch'en of Thailand are examples. Their conduct indi\u00ad cates that they realized that Japanese ascendency in Southeast Asia was inevitable. It would be, therefore, unwise and certainly suicidal, they seem to have concluded, to continue anti-Japanese activities and the boycott. Their survival instinct, developed by life as a minority group under adverse conditions, told them that further anti-Japanese re\u00ad sistance would only bring upon Chinese communities the wrath of the Japanese if the Japanese military should occupy Southeast Asian countries. By the early summer of 1941, some important segments of the Chinese community leadership appeared to share the view that Japanese occupation of the South Seas region was a probability. They knew that in a Japanese-occupied Southeast Asia, the Chinese would be the first target of a soo\\ ching (purification by elimination)\u2014ex\u00ad actly as did happen. The self-interest of the Nanyang Chinese com\u00ad pelled them to self-preservation, turning from their previous commit\u00ad ment to the KMT government, though many staunch Chinese took up 166 arms against the Japanese. One should not judge this behavior too harshly. A Pacific war might have been a welcome relief to the Chung\u00ad king government; it was a matter of life and death to the Nanyang Chinese. As one Chinese leader in Manila admitted, he would not be able to serve China if he died. As he said, Nanyang Chinese could serve China better by surviving a Japanese occupation. He believed that to survive, they should not provoke Japan but \"modify [their] anti-Japanese stance.\"3 Still others cooperated or appeared to co\u00ad operate with the Japanese military not only during the occupation years but even before. Yet the Nanyang Chinese carried on the National Salvation Move\u00ad ment for four years even though a prolonged anti-Japanese drive was foredoomed to failure. Nevertheless, they did so largely because they wished to see a strong China. Their anti-Japanese National Salvation Movement in its various forms was the only way the Nanyang Chi\u00ad nese knew in which the minority group could express its national feel\u00ad ings against Japan's injustice toward their fatherland. It was a combination of patriotism and self-interest that compelled the Nanyang Chinese to plunge into the National Salvation Move\u00ad ment; the path was neither popular nor easy. As I have shown, the Nanyang Chinese had a great interest in political matters; they did not sit on the fence on the China issue because they had a great stake in it. The stereotyped characterization of the Nanyang Chinese as in\u00ad terested only in money-making, not in politics, and as maintaining a policy of non-involvement is just that\u2014a stereotype with little truth in it. This study should dispel such accusations. Japanese policy-makers seriously underestimated the latent national consciousness and aspirations of the Nanyang Chinese. They dis\u00ad counted, even with contempt, the ability of the Chinese to endure hardship and to sacrifice for China. Instead, the Japanese had an exaggerated view of the Chinese matter-of-fact business sense. Their failure to understand the Nanyang Chinese mentality cost them dearly. The Japanese occupation forces began their military administration with the distorted notion that the Chinese in Southeast Asia would become subservient to the Japanese military overlords and would co\u00ad operate once they had been cowed by initial shock treatment. Such a warped concept was reinforced by the animosity of the Japanese soldiers 167 toward the Chinese, who harassed them in China and in the Southeast Asian military campaign, particularly in Malaya-Singapore and in the Philippines.4 At the beginning, Japanese administrators, military and civilian alike, had no policy for dealing with the Chinese other than vague, broad principles. For them, the Chinese were a milk cow to squeeze the milk from and were useful only for their \"commercial talents.\"5 Though the policy changed later, the damage had been done. Their myopic policy belied the Japanese slogan proclaiming the equality of all races and spelled doom for the Japanese occupation in Southeast Asia. The legacies of this short-sighted policy were not easily erased or forgotten for many years.6 168 Notes Introduction 1. H. F.

According to a Domei (Japanese official news agency) dispatch from Manila, as it ap\u00ad peared in the Boruneo Shimbun (Japanese newspaper published in Borneo), November 17, 1943, Tseng surrendered to the Japanese troops in November, 1943, after two years of hiding. He was quoted to have pledged to cooperate with the Japanese upon his release. Later he served as president of the Chinese association in November, 1944. Cf. Chen, Chinese and the War in the Philippines, p. 30. Chen said Justo Cabo Chan, that is, Tseng T'ing-Chiian, sur- 175 rendered himself to the Japanese, through Go Co-lai's good office. Go was president of the Japanese-sponsored Chinese Association until he was assassinated. \"He [Tseng] was reported to have given the Japanese authorities a list of Chinese guerrillas' names as the condition for saving his own neck. As a result, about 300 Chinese youths and suspects were thrown into prison, and many were executed.\" Tseng's own account differed considerably from Chen's. Tseng said he surrendered because his mother was gravely ill and lives of more than 120 of his relatives were in danger. His colleagues suggested he surrender to save his relatives and to scout the enemy. Ch'en Hsiao-yu, ed., Fei-lii-pin shih-chi ta kuan chu pien she, 1948), vol. I, sec. 6, pp. 10-12, vol.

A similar charge was leveled at the Chinese in 1914, by Asavabahu, allegedly the pen name of King Rama IV. The fact that Japanese sources played up the similarity between the Jews and the Chinese for a stereotyped business orientation could have been influenced by their in\u00ad terest in Nazi anti-Semitism. There had been a considerable Japanese interest in the study of the Jews since Japan allied with Germany. For instance, Toa Kenkyujo and Mantetsa made an extensive study of the Jews. Prince Wijit Wathakan's speech stirred up a hornet's nest and led to the dissolution of the Assembly and to the fall of the Phahon cabinet.

Wang Ching- wei was one of the early revolutionaries who helped found the Penang Library, a revolutionary center for the anti-Manchu group in Malaya. His wife was a daughter of a Hua-ch'iao family in Penang. 24. A group of six Chinese in Singapore sent a letter to Wang Ching-wei in the care of a Japanese agent. They expressed their support for his \"policy of peace,\" urging him to set up his machinery in order to enlighten the overseas Chinese. 135. 26.

Beside carrying out their own research including field trips, these organizations often translated foreign language material on the Nanyang Hua-ch'iao. The Government General of Taiwan had kept a complete list of bibliography on this important overseas minority group. See Taiwan Sotokufu, Gaijibu, Kakyo bunken mokuroku Seihatsu No. 108, Japan, Kaigun Gunreibu, kyu~Shina doko, n.d. Marked Secret.\" The Navy subsequently established intelligence offices at Amoy and Shanghai, each being headed by a Rear Admiral. The Office was divided into five geographical sections, each in charge of overseas Chinese affairs in French Indochina, Thailand, Malaya, the Dutch Indies, and the Philippines. The Army, under the command of the China Expeditionary Army (CEA), set up a new operation center in Shanghai for overseas Chinese affairs in order -to gather in\u00ad telligence on the situation in Singapore and to induce some influential KMT government officials to come to terms with the Japanese. The CEA, for instance, requested Li Shui-li, treasurer of the Overseas Chinese Bank at Shanghai, to ask Chou Chao-ch'un, assistant treasurer of the Amoy Hypothec Bank, to make an investigation about Tan Kah Kee's activities and overseas Chinese conditions in Singapore. The Army also planned to use Chou Chih-kang, former mayor of Swatow and a member of the Kwangtung Provincial government, to get in touch with Sung Tzu-wen, Chiang Kai-shek's confidant, through Chou's son, Chou Yen-sei, who was related to Sung Tzu-wen by marriage. The Army's other plan was to undermine the Chiang Kai-shek government by inducing some influential officials to defect from Chungking. For this end, the Army planned to persuade Li Tsung-jen, a leader of the Southwest clique known to be opposing Chiang Kai-shek, through the medium of Li T'ien-ho, a member of the KMT Examination Yuan and an influential political figure in the Southwest clique. \"Shanhai wo No. Marked \"Secret.\" Accord\u00ad ing to this report from Swatow, the Swatow-Ch'aochow area received eighty-two million yuan from overseas Chinese in the period from March to December, 1940. Of the eighty-two million 180 yuan, sixty per cent went to the area controlled by the KMT government. The Japanese per\u00ad mitted remittances to the KMT-controlled area in order to win the hearts of the Chinese. 29. For an optimistic view, see Shigeru Otsuki, \"Chinese in South Seas Turning to Co\u00ad operate with Japan,\" Nippon oyobi Nipponjin (February, 1940), trans, in Contemporary Opinion on Current Topics, Japan, Information Bureau (March 7, 1940); Ide Kiwata, \"O-seiken no seiritsu to kakyo (February 15, 1940), pp. said: \"We must recognize the fact that the number of Wang Ching-wei sup\u00ad porters is nowhere comparable to that of supporters.\" Fukuma observed: \". . Ching-wei has been insignificant.\" Completely turning around in his assessment, Ide said that nothing short of the \"fundamental solution\" of the whole China affair, that is, the subjugation of the Chungking government, would enable the Japanese to carry out the policy of [inducing overseas Chinese to be submissive to Japan]. Japanese sources tended to paint an exaggerated picture of the impact produced by the establishment of the Wang Ching-wei regime upon the Nanyang Chinese. For instance, a writer for Nampo Kyo\\ai reported after his field trip to Manila that Dee C. Chuan had expressed privately his approval of Wang's policy for peace. Ishida Hatsutoshi, \"Manira kakyo ni kansuru chosa,\" Nampo III, No. 3 (March, 1941), p. 54. Cf. Asahi Shimbun, April 11, 1940. Also Higashi Indo Nippo, July 18, 1940, and Osa\\a Mainichi, June 8, 1940, reported an in\u00ad crease in remittances to Japanese-occupied Canton as being indicative of \"growing trust in the new government's policy for peace.\" 30.

By this time, the military's policy for the Chinese had been somewhat modified from the initial one of repression to reconciliation in order to utilize their business talents and their wealth. See General Isoya Goro's speech to governors and mayors at the Conference of Gov\u00ad ernors and Mayors held on July 11, 1943.

For instance, the Sin Chew Jit Poh warned the Chinese against bribery attempts made upon Chinese merchants and against propaganda activity conducted by Taiwanese of Japanese nationality disguished as Fukienese. Consul General Kao reminded his compatriots of the importance of exterminating traitors. When a periodical, Hua-ch'iao Chi-I^'an, a quarterly pub\u00ad lished by the Wang Ching-wei regime, was discovered to have been smuggled into Malaya, Kao notified the NCRGA, Chinese chambers of commerce, and Fukienese associations to be alert against subversive activities. A similar warning was constantly issued. See Kanan Ginko 1940), pp. 100, 150; Higashi Indo Nippo, May 9, 1940. 35. In May, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission at Chungking notified overseas con\u00ad sulates to discourage Chinese to return home via Amoy and Conros Island because they would be searched or even robbed by enemy agents. It was a countermeasure to a new policy imple\u00ad mented by the Nanking government and Japan's Koain, China Development Board, to win the support of the overseas Chinese. They established reception centers to welcome Chinese from abroad and re-opened agencies to attract remittances from them. Bureaucrats from the Govern\u00ad ment General of Formosa officered the reception centers and the Bank of Taiwan, the Yokohama Species Bank, and the Hypothec Bank of Japan financed remittance agencies. The receipt of remittances, after the resumption of the service, was said to be on the rise. A study made by the Taiwan Government General in 1943, estimated 116 million yuan to Swatow (March, 1940- April, 1941), 27 million yuan to Canton (1940), 17.7 million yuan to Haikow (1940), and 40 million to Amoy (1940). Taking into consideration that the yuan depreciated thirty or more per cent during the period, the Tokyo-Nanking policy to entice the Chinese abroad to remit to these Japanese-occupied ports seems to have been unsuccessful.

Ch'en Yi became the Governor of Formosa in 1945, but he and his carpetbaggers mis\u00ad governed the island so badly that on February 27-28, 1947, many of the Formosans rose in revolt only to be massacred. Though Ch'en was relieved from the post, he was immediately appointed to the Governorship of Cheking. In February, 1949, Ch'en was arrested on the charge of having talked of a state socialism under the Communist regime. He was executed in June, 1950, in the midst of an anticipated Communist Chinese invasion of Formosa, for his crime in 1946-47. Presumably, Ch'en was sacrificed in order to win the loyalty of the For\u00ad mosans if a Communist invasion should take place. Chiang Kai-shek was reportedly reluctant to execute his old friend. 54.

He supported, it said, the liberation program of the Nineteenth Route Army, and in the fol\u00ad lowing year, Tan urged the Nineteenth Route Army and the Red Agrarian Army to establish a people's These early so-called sympathetic attitudes of Tan Kah Kee toward the Communists should not be taken too seriously in view of the fact that Tan was a man of action with a particular concern for the welfare of his native province, Fukien. He probably supported the Communist program out of his intense concern for the well-being of his native province, as he had sup\u00ad ported the KMT government earlier. 60.

Whether this allegation is true or not cannot be proved until the archives of the Nationalist government are opened. According to my interviews with former generals and staff officers of the Imperial Japanese Army, General Ho did maintain close contact with Japa\u00ad nese agents for peace to save Japan from a complete defeat so as to prevent the emergence of Russia and the United States as preponderant powers in East Asia\u2014the situation that the complete and unconditional surrender of Japan would create. It was a situation KMT China did not wish to see in postwar power relations in East Asia. 68. This charge was often made by critics including American military and civilian officers. 69.

No one knows how many died and who ordered the mass execution. I interviewed more than a score of former Japanese military 184 and civilian officers who participated in the Japanese Military Administration of Malaya. They maintained the number 5,000 an exaggerated figure; one of them even denied the execution had ever taken place. Loi Tek and Ching Kee Sun, secretary of the NCRGA, were arrested by the Kempeitai.

This suppression policy had been consistent with the Dutch since the early 1930's.

The Manila authorities began an investigation and summoned Yu Khe Thai, acting chair\u00ad man of the PREC, for questioning. During the interrogation, Yu Khe Thai denied the existence of the anti-Japanese organizations whose names had been presented by Consul Gen\u00ad eral Yoshida, insisting that their activities were of self-defense against the Japanese aggression. The investigation ended without producing the evidence of the complicity as charged by the Japanese Consul General. The outbreak of violence might also be attributed to the arrival of \"several thousand refugees\" from China who were driven out from China's southern coast, which the Japanese had occupied, as reported by American High Commissioner Francis B. Sayre to President Franklin D. Roosevelt in July, 1940. Sayre was afraid of the influx of the refugees who might intensify \"fifth column activities in the Philippines. . . .\" Francis B.

Ichikawa speculates that one of the reasons why landowners in Ch'aochow suffered so much during the period of the Communist Chinese land reform in 1951-1956 might be at\u00ad tributed to the fact that the Thai-Chinese, a majority of whom were Teochius, did not par\u00ad ticipate in Comfort Missions and were not receptive to the contribution drive. On the other hand, landowners in Amoy, from which Tan Kah Kee had emigrated, relatively fared well and even benefited from the land reform program and industrialization, because the Chinese from Amoy, under Tan Kah Kee's leadership, contributed more to China during the war. It seems likely that the presence of Tan Kah Kee as a high official of the government might have something to do with the different treatments between the two districts.

The price of tin dropped from $137 in March, 1937, to $93 in September of the same year. Rubber price also declined from 450 in April, 1937, to 220 in November, 1937. The decline in prices of these basic export commodities had direct relation upon the purchasing power of native peoples in Southeast Asia. Malayan State governments passed laws in January, 1938, and July, 1939, to limit the importation of Japanese textiles and other goods. The Netherlands East Indies government also imposed a quota system on import goods, and Thailand, the Philippines, and French Indochina raised tariffs in order to protect their own industries. 88.

According to findings of the Japanese Chamber of Commerce in Manila, unrefined U.S. cotton cost 5.80 pesos per 12 yards against 6.40 pesos for Japanese cotton.

Nanshi Chosa\\ai [hokoku] from Manila, March 6, 1941, p. 1234. 95. See footnote 154, Chap. II. 96. Since Thailand provided a free market for cotton goods, Japanese producers flooded the market with dumping. By a government policy, the Japanese cotton textile industry operated under the link system. Cotton manufacturers, in order to get a new quota for raw cotton from the government, had to export products within a limited period. 97. For instance, Japanese enamelled ironwares and nails were unable to compete with Chinese products imported from Shanghai, as the latter were about 20 per cent cheaper and the quality was comparable with the Japanese product. Chinese were able to sell at a cut rate because the devaluation of the yuan started in 1938. Nanyo Kyokai, Nanyo \\eizai \\ondan\\ai ho\\o\\usho, p. 85. In the cotton market, Japan had lost 15 per cent in exports by 1939, while China had gained 15 per cent by the same year. 98. The French government also raised the tariff wall against Japanese tea and Aji-no-moto, monosodium glutamate. 99. China used this export channel because import duties on goods from Hong Kong to French Indochinese ports were lower. 100. The French statistical figures contradict with the Japanese figures cited on p. 143, Chapter III. This discrepancy is owing to a difference in a matter of what the French and the Japanese considered imports and exports. For instance, the French regarded reeled cotton threads exported by the United States but carried in Japanese ships as imports from Japan. The Japanese did not consider them as her exports to French Indochina. 193 Chapter IV 1.
