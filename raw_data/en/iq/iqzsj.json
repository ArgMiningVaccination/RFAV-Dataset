A6.1.2 Land to which this Section applies This Section shall apply to all propos ed and existing developments, including subdivisions, relating to residential and tourist development within The Tweed Council area. A6.1.3 How does this Section relate to ot her Sections and Environmental Planning Instruments? Within Part A This Section is generally cons istent with the other Sections from Part A of this DCP. Where there is an inconsisten cy then the higher standard/requirement shall prevail. Between Part A and Part B In the event of any inconsistency between this Section and a Section from Part B of this DCP, the provisions of the Section from Part B shall prevail. This Section contains development objec tives, provisions and guidelines in respect of existing and proposed resident ial and tourist devel opments generally within the Tweed Coun cil coastal areas. Where any inconsistency arises between this plan and any environmental planning instrument applying to the same land the provision of the Environmental Planning instrument prevails. An Envi ronmental Planning In strument means a State Environmental Planni ng Policy, Regional Environmental Plan and Local Environmental Plan. A6.1.4 How to use this Section Where a development is proposed in respect of land to which this Section applies, Council shall take t he provisions of this plan into consideration in determining the application. Compliance with the provisions of this Section does not necessarily imply that Council will grant consent to an applic ation. Council must, in relation to SECTION A6 - BITING MIDGE AND MOSQUITO CONTROLS Page 2 development applications, also take into consideration those matters listed under Section 90(1) of the Envi ronmental Planning and Asse ssment Act, 1979 and any relevant planning instruments and other Sections of this Development Control Plan. In preparing an application for development there are a number of specific steps that should be followed: Step 1: Check the zoning of the site under Tweed LEP 2000 to ensure that the proposed development is permissible and to determine what related provisions apply. Step 2: Establish what other Sections or Policies apply to the site. Step 3: Familiarise yourself with the guide lines for control of Biting Midge and Mosquitoes in Tweed. A6.1.5 Consultation with Council Staff Applicants are strongly advised to consul t Council staff prior to preparing and submitting development applications. W here there is a possible likely problem with biting midge or mosquitoes, consul tation with Council's Entomological Control Officer within Council's Envir onmental and Health Services is recommended. A6.2 AN OUTLINE OF THE PROBLEM A6.2.1 Background Mosquitoes and biting midge belong to the insect order Diptera which include many common and familiar insects such as mosquitoes, midges and house flies. Some are important pests or vectors of disease while others are beneficial, and by virtue of their parasitic or predatory nat ure play an important role in regulating populations of many plants and animals t hat adversely affect human welfare. Mosquitoes (Culicidae) and biting midge (Ceratopogonidae) sometimes erroneously called sandflies are abundant in th is region of Australia. The female mosquito and biting midge adults generally require a blood meal to effectively develop their eggs. A meal of protein in the form of blood is required to complete the reproductive process. These inse cts are opportunists f eeders that will feed on many species of birds and mammals. Humans tend to be the most abundant source of food in many local areas clos e to wetland breeding areas favoured by these insects. Problems therefore arise wher e human activities or habitation, occur in proximity to these insect breeding areas. The extensive areas of wet low-land and intertidal areas along the Tweed coastal di stricts represent extensive breeding areas for both mosquitoes and biting midge. As a result of the proximity of these low-land areas and urban development in the Tweed Council area, biting insect nuisance is likely to occur in many areas within this district from time to time. As a general rule, the areas where bi ting midge and mosquito problems will regularly be a nuisance to our human populace will be within 1km of extensive biting insect breeding areas. Twelve ( 12) maps of mosquito and biting midge breeding areas have been produced for most of the Tweed coasta l districts. These are attached at the end of this Sect ion. This information can be used to estimate those areas where potential biting insect problems will most likely occur. It should be noted that the ar eas of the Tweed River ab ove Stotts Island, the SECTION A6- BITING MIDGE AND MOSQUITO CONTROLS Page 3 Clothiers Creek Valley and the upper r eaches of the Mo oball, Cudgen and Cudgera Creeks have not yet been mapped for breeding grounds for biting insects. As well, habitat changes caused by some forms of development, such as creation of canal estates, reduced wa ter quality through nutrient load or acidic runoff , altered drainage systems and siltation problems ma y expand biting insect problems. A direct impact on human health caused by biting midge is due to allergens in midge saliva reacting on people of varying degrees of sensitivity and immunity. Most people find the bites from biting midge uncomfortable and distressing with the irritation leading to scratching and so metimes infected sores (Alloway & Reye, 1990). Because of their small size (1-2 mm) these insects are hard to detect and enter households through conventional fly screens. Mosquitoes are an important group of bl ood sucking insects, not only because of the nuisance and annoyance of their bite but also because of the possibility of disease transmission to humans and other warm blooded animals. It is as vectors of disease that mosquitoes are o ften of most concern. An insect that transmits a disease-causing organism from one vertebrate host to another is called a disease vector. An example of a disease transmitted locally by mosquitoes is Ross River fever. A6.2.2 Biting Insect Species and Habitat in the Tweed Council Area Biting Midg e Culicoides molestus This species is most commonly found breed ing in clean flocculated sand, in the open or under light mangrove cover between mean tide level and mean high water springs. C. molestus has colo nised the beaches of artificial canal developments on the Tweed River. T hey can also be found breeding on most sandy river foreshores and suitable ri ver sand bars. Larval densities can be extremely high in suitable hab itat. The large sand bar o ff Tony's Island at Banora Point is high in trapped nutrient from roos ting birds. This has supplied midge with a very favourable habitat that may support over 30,000 midge larvae per square metre on parts of the sand bar . C. molestus also breeds on the lower reaches of Cudgen Creek, Cudgera Creek and Mooball Cree k. Adult C. molestus midge will travel at least 1km from their breeding areas. Residents living on hill tops overlooking these breeding areas are oft en affected more adversely by these midge than residents at lower elevations clos e to the breeding sites. C. molestus bites most actively during the week following full and new moon. Culicoides subimmaculatus This species, or more likely a complex of species yet to be determined, breeds in clean to muddy sand in the open or under light mangrove cover between mean high water neap and mean high springs. C. subimmaculatus breeds along much of the Tweed River, particularly near stormw ater outflows and along the fringe of mangrove growth on Tweed River islands. The species is also abundant along the middle reaches of Cudgen, Cudgera and Mooball Creeks. C. subimmaculatus adults are generally only a pest within 500m of their breeding areas. This range may double around extensive breeding areas such as the Ukerebagh passage area and the upper Te rranora passage islands. C. subimmaculatus bites most actively around the half moon period. SECTION A6 - BITING MIDGE AND MOSQUITO CONTROLS Page 4 Culicoides longior This species breeds under tree cover, usually amongst heavy fibrous muds, between mean high water neap and mean high water spring tide zone. The Tweed River islands are the major breeding s ource for this species, particularly on parts of Ukerabagh and Womg in islands. C. longior will travel in excess of 1km from its breeding areas. This specie s is the major midge pests around West Tweed Heads and parts of South Tweed Heads. C. longior bites most actively during the week leading up to the new and fu ll moon. A typical life cycle of biting midge is shown in Figure 1. Mosquitoes Ochlerotatus vigilax This common salt marsh mosquito breeds in temporary salt to brackish water pools left by the highest monthly tides. Eggs of this species are laid around the drying margins of these pools and may lie dormant for many months. Hatches may be triggered by tides or rainfall. E ggs may hatch in instalments as various environmental conditions in the breeding p ools such as salinity and specific dissolved oxygen levels are met. Br eeding areas are found amongst poorly flushed mangroves surrounding Cobaki and Terranora Lakes, open tidal salt marshes around Cobaki Lake and on low lying agricultural pastures that receive occasional tidal flooding along the length of the Tweed River and parts of Cudgen Creek. Oc. vigilax is a savage biter by day or night and an effective carrier of Ross River virus. Oc. vigilax is the s pecies causing most complaints throughout Tweed coastal areas. This mosquito di sperses widely from its breeding areas and appears attracted to the hill and ridgetops overlooking tidal flats, often many kilometres from its breeding source. Ar eas badly affected at times are Cobaki inlet, Piggabeen, Bilambil Heights, Terr anora and parts of West Tweed Heads. This species often reaches plague num bers late summer, particularly when a long dry spell or drought has recently been broken by rainfall. Abnormally high tides caused by storm surges may al so cause extensive vigilax hatches. Verrallina funerea This species breeds in shaded fresh to brackish ponds, often with emergent reed vegetation or under the cover of mangrove, casuarina, t ea tree or palm thickets. Like the previous species, it is a savage bi ter by day or night, often biting in large numbers, though it tends not to travel fa r from well shaded areas surrounding its breeding sites. V. funereal is often found breeding in areas slightly more elevated than Oc. vigilax breeding si tes, particularly where springs or creeks feed into brackish water habitats. Eggs are laid around the drying margins of pools and may remain dormant for many m onths awaiting hatching stimuli. Extensive breeding sites exists surroundi ng parts of Cobaki Lake, the western surrounds of Terranora Lake, Chinderah, Tumbulgum, Stotts Island and tea tree swamps surrounding Cudgen Lake and Pottsville. Residential areas in close proximity to these sites are often affected by these mosquitoes several weeks following heavy rain fall, particularly if corridors of thick vegetation are continuous between breeding sites and residential areas. Culex sitiens The third major salt marsh mosquito pest in the district is Cx. sitiens which breeds in fresh to brackish ponds in similar habi tat to Oc. vigilax, though it prefers a lower salinity to vigilax. This spec ies usually reaches po pulation peaks during SECTION A6- BITING MIDGE AND MOSQUITO CONTROLS Page 5 late summer when rainfall has diluted salinit y in tidal salt marsh pools and flooded lowland agricultural flats. Eggs of th is species are deposited in rafts on the surface of the water. Cx. sitiens is slower than the tw o (2) previous ochlerotatus species to build up population peaks, due to the fact that the ochlerotatus mosquitoes eggs are already awaiting hatch ing stimuli in their preferred larval habitat prior to the pool flooding. Breeding areas are well scattered th roughout the Tweed Council area with extensive breeding often found behind Cobaki and Terranora Lakes. Cx. sitiens is principally a night feeder and may disperse widely from its breeding areas. Residential areas around Cobak i inlet, Terranora and Tumbulgum are often affected by this mosquito. Typical lifecycle of mosquitoes shown in Figure 2. Insect borne diseases Ross River virus is endemic in this region. This virus may cause outbreaks of an epidemic polyarthritis in humans in so me years. While the disease has no associated mortality, the symptoms can be extremely debilitating resulting in substantial economic loss. The mosquito suspected of being the major vector of this disease in this area is Ochlerotatus vigilax . Ross River virus has also been isolated from V. funerea and Culex sitiens , however, they are not considered major vectors. In recent years, Barm ah Forest virus has become an increasing problem in the region. BFU sympt oms in humans are similar to RRU. Biting midge are not known to tran smit human disease in Australia. A6.3 GUIDELINES FOR CONT ROL OF BITING MIDGE AND MOSQUITOES IN TWEED Biting insect problems can be avoided if hum an activities are far enough removed from major midge and mosquito breeding area s. However, due to the extensive widespread breeding areas of these insect pests throughout the coastal Tweed area, as shown on maps attached, this ma y severely restrict development. The general amenity of much of the Council ar ea in close proximity to these breeding areas has created a high demand for resident ial and tourist development in biting insect zones. Avoidance measures against biting midge and mosquitos can be divided into:- 1. Developed areas of the Shire; 2. Proposed areas for development. A6.3.1 Presently Developed Areas Council control measures Tweed Shire Council carries out abatem ent measures against biting midge and mosquitoes throughout extensive areas within the Council boundaries. These practices include: i. The use of biological chemicals such as the soil bacteria Bacillus thuringiensis var israelensis and the in sect growth regulator Methoprene. Bacillus thuringiensis var israelensi s, commonly called Bti is mixed with water and sprayed onto mosquito breedi ng areas. Mosquito larvae ingest the bacteria and are killed within 24 hours due to an endotoxin causing swelling and bursting of their gut wall. SECTION A6 - BITING MIDGE AND MOSQUITO CONTROLS Page 6 Methoprene can be sprayed as a liquid or appli ed as a slow release granule or briquet to mosquito breeding areas. This chemical is an insect growth regulator that interferes with normal growth and developm ent of the mosquito larva. Mosquito larvae treated with this chemical will not emerge as adult mosquitoes. One application with slow release formulations of this chemical may control mosquitoes for up to six months. Both these biological larvicides are non-toxi c to other aquatic organisms such as fish, crustaceans, amphibians and most non-target insects. i. The use of conventional chemical larvic ides. The relatively low toxic chemicals Temephos and Maldison are used in certain areas for biting midge and mosquito control where use of these chemicals is appropriate. Both these chemicals kill the larval stages of the tartet insects quickly with high safety margins for non-target organisms when applied correctly. ii. The use of pyrethroid adulticides. Synthet ic pyrethroids are used at times in ultra low volume formulations and as thermal f ogs to control adult mosquito and biting midge populations in harbouring areas cl ose to residential areas and caravan parks. iii. Larvivorous fish stocking. Local mo squito feeding fish have been stocked by Council in new waterbodies and into se mi-permanent ponds that require re- stocking following long periods of drought. iv. Habitat modifications have been carried out to some of Council's biting insect breeding areas that lend themselves to these techniques. The following techniques are briefly outlined: Runnelling. This technique was pioneer ed by Tweed Council in the mid 1980s and has been applied in selected open saltmarsh areas that were prolific saltmarsh mosquito breeding areas. The technique interconnects open saltmarsh pools with shallow hand dug channels or \"runnels\", back to the estuary. This flushes mosquito larvae from the marsh, allows mosquito feeding fish access to mosquito larvae and reduces the sites attractiveness to egg laying mosquitoes. Improved backwater flushing. Several site s adjacent to natura lly bunded lower estuary creek overflows, that flooded following very high tides or heavy rain, had tidal channels dug to bring daily tidal flushing to the area. This has resulted improved water quality in these once stagnant areas that are now more favoured to fish life and less favourable to mosquitoes. Partial impoundment. A semi-permanent br ackish swamp that dried out during extended dry periods was once a prolific mos quito breeding area. This site had a low barrage placed towards its entrance with the estuary. The barrage maintains a more static water level in the wetland while still al lowing tidal flushing. This modification has lowered wetland salinity and allowed stable predator populat ions of fish and other organisms to build up that genera lly control mosquito breeding. Sandbar excavation. Several trials have been carried out to evaluate the effect of removing the top sand layer from tidal river sandbars breeding biting midge. These trials have shown long term reductions in midge breeding at these sites. These control techniques have been more fu lly explained, see references, Easton 1990, 1 and 2. Despite these control measures there will always be periods when the biting insect populations in suitable areas are above many residents' nuisance thresholds. In addition abatement measures impose an econom ic cost to Council which it does not wish to exacerbate if possible. SECTION A6- BITING MIDGE AND MOSQUITO CONTROLS Page 7 Guidelines for the Householder a nd others to reduce the problem Following are some suggestions for exis ting householders and ot her developments affected by biting midge and mosquito nuisa nce to help alleviate or minimise the problem:- 1. Keep vegetation surrounding the house to a minimum. This reduces insect harbouring areas and increases air flow surrounding the house. Also keep lawns well mowed as any activity that reduces sheltering sites and lowers humidity surrounding the house will help to deter mosquitoes and biting midges. 2. Keep insect screens well maintained. If biting midge are a problem entering through fly screens, smaller mesh sizes such as found in products like \"Solar Mesh\" may stop entry. Screens can also be sprayed with insecticide barriers to deter midges. The newer lo wer toxic surface sprays containing synthetic pyrethroids can be very effective. 3. It is most likely that biting midge wil l enter dwellings on the leeward side of the dwelling where lower air pressu res and wind speed are created by the wind blowing over the dwelling. It will al so be from this side of the dwelling that carbon dioxide respired by the inhabit ants (a strong attr actant to midge) will emanate. Close leeward windows or keep more window area on the windward side of the dwelling open as this will tend to pressurise the dwelling and increase dra ft from the leeward si de reducing the midges ability to enter. As midges do not like to seek blood meals when a moderate breeze is blowing, ceiling f ans or other air circulati on devices that increase air flow inside the dwelling may also decrease midge nuisance indoors. Mosquito coils burning in the house may be necessary during periods of severe midge nuisance. (See Figure 3). 4. Activities such as water hosing and di gging soil attracts biting midge. Avoid outdoor activities like car washing and gardening during the early morning and late afternoon when midge are most active. 5. Biting midge are biologically linke d with the lunar cycle and related tidal cycles. The three major pests species in the Tweed area have different emergence periods. One species is at its peak just following the new and full moon, another species around half m oon period and the other during the period leading up to the new and full moon. If residents take note of the major attack periods in the area, t hey may be able to better plan their outdoor activities. If fo r example you live around a canal estate, you will most likely be affected by the midge species Culicoides molestus . This species peaks just following the new and full moon, so planning an evening barbecue around this time would not be wise. Council's Health Department can assist residents to identif y their local midge species. 6. Wear light long sleeve clothing wh en outdoors during midge activity periods to minimise exposure to these insect s. Heavier clothing is required to protect from mosquito bites due to thei r much longer biting parts. Personal repellents such as \"rid\" applied as per directions usually gives satisfactory relief from biting insects. Care is necessary to cover all of exposed body parts. Sensitive individuals and young children can use liberal amounts of baby oil applied to exposed skin to stop biting midge attack. Oil does not repel the midge but causes them to become stuck in the oil. SECTION A6 - BITING MIDGE AND MOSQUITO CONTROLS Page 8 7. Insect trapping devices using ultra viol et light as the attr actant are generally useless for decreasing biting midge number s in suburban yards. It is also unlikely they do much to reduce mosquito numbers in the yard. These traps will attract a broad spectrum of night flying in sects to the light fr om some distances away. The problem, particularly with biti ng midge, is that the midge are too small to arc across the electrocuting grid so are brought into the area but not disposed of. Many beneficial insects ar e also killed by these devices. 8. Biting midge have a histamine like subs tance in their saliva which can cause intense itching in sensitive individuals. To prevent acute allergic reaction and allow the body to develop its own immunity to midge bites, Dr Eric Reye, who for many years has studied biting midge, sugge sts vitamin B1 (thiamine) can be used. This vitamin has an anti-histamine action. Dr Reye suggests an adult dose of 200mg twice a day with meals, pref erably starting two (2) weeks before exposure to midge. As i mmunity is developed this dose can be reduced. The development of personal immunity genera lly comes with a regular exposure to low numbers of midge bites, not occasional heavy expo sure. Persons who have a more acute reaction to midge bites will require a different medicine, (Reye, 1992). 9. The practice of carrying out maint enance dredging of canal beaches every few years to restore eroded beaches unfor tunately exacerbates biting midge problems around the canals. Nutrient rich sand when dredged back onto canal beaches provides the midge adult with a fa vourable egg laying site around the high spring tide level and provides the la rval midge with a nourishing substrate in which to complete their development. C anal residents could consider replacing their eroded sand beaches with course pebb les or other materials that are unsuitable for midge breeding and le ss likely to erode from the beach. A6.3.2 Areas of Proposed Development The first and most important action to ta ke to minimise futu re biting insect nuisance in the Tweed Council area is to allow as greater open buffer area around the known and mapped in sect breeding areas as is possible (see A6 Maps). As mosquitoes and midges prefer to travel al ong well vegetated routes, keeping an open, lightly treed buffer is pr eferable to heavily foliaged buffers. Developers are advised, however, that Council is guided by other statutory requirements regarding clearing of vegetation. This includes clearing restrictions in various land use zones under Tweed Local Environmental Plan 2000 and the provisions contained in State Environm ental Planning Polic ies and Regional Environmental Planning Policies. Ot her planning objectives contained within these planning instruments ma y be inconsistent with the guidelines for alleviating and minimising biting insect nuisance. Ex amples include clearing restrictions in environmental protection zones and in areas mapped by the Department of Planning under State Envir onmental Planning Policy No 14 - Wetlands. It is therefore important that landowners and/or developers contact Council prior to the clearing of vegetation. Following are some suggestions by Council 's Entomological Control Officer that may be incorporated into development propos als that will help minimise biting insect nuisance on and surr ounding the development site. Housing Subdivision To help minimise biting insect nuisanc e in housing subdivisions proposed near biting midge or mosquito breeding areas the following is suggested:- SECTION A6- BITING MIDGE AND MOSQUITO CONTROLS Page 9 1. Specified open buffer zones between insect breeding areas and dwelling houses. This zone will vary widely with circumstances, from as little as 50m to 1km. This zone can usually be det ermined by a field survey during the warmer months of the year and by cons ulting the attached biting insect breeding area distribution maps. Due to the difficulty in controlling biting midge populations from extensive breeding areas, buffer zones around these areas will usually need to be greater than for mosquitoes. 2. Biting insects, particularly biting mi dge, will follow vegetated corridors from breeding areas to residential areas. It is therefore s uggested that breaks are provided in any continuous vegetati on lines leading to residential areas. 3. Land fill operations to elevate subd ivisions above flood height should be carried out with due regard to mini mising impedance of surrounding drainage systems. 4. Roadway embankment construction should be designed to eliminate (if possible) any standing water impoundment or redirection of water flows into potential mosquito breeding areas. 5. Consideration of sto rmwater drainage design and r oute. Drains should be designed to avoid silt accumulation and be free draining. Exit points from drains into waterways or wetlands should be designed to avoid habitat changes at discharge points such as will occur if organically enriched drainage from urban areas is directed into mangrove areas or tea tree wetlands. Misdirected stormwater into these habitats can create new midge and mosquito breeding sites or increase existing breeding by favouring certain aquatic and semi aquatic vegetati on species that restrict drainage flow. Silt accumulation at stormw ater estuary discharge points, combined with regular low flow water discharge particularly suit the biting midge species C. sumimmaculatus . Care must be taken to avoid increasing tidal influence back up drains into freshwater wetlands as this increases saltmarsh mosquito favourability. Tourist Complexes and Integrated Residential Development The above considerations contained in Sub-Section 3.2.1 will apply equally to these developments. However due to the more planned nature of these developments some considerations can be taken further. These are as follows:- 1. Daytime recreation areas such as golf courses and parkland or car parking areas can be situated between insect breeding areas and accommodation areas. 2. On site habitat modification of lowlands may be possible to reduce biting insect breeding. Free dr aining wetland regeneration of degraded lowland cattle pasture is being pl anned for one current development. 3. Consideration of domi nant prevailing winds that may distribute biting insects, particularly biting mi dge, when siting accommodation and evening recreation areas. 4. Landscape layout and vegetation species should be selected to minimise insect harbourage and corridor s. Tall lightly foliaged species with a high canopy such as eucalypts and palms tend not to harbour biting insects and allow good air circul ation at ground level. Native shrubs such as grevillea, banksia and casuarinas planted not too densely are suitable for further landscape or screening use. Heavily SECTION A6 - BITING MIDGE AND MOSQUITO CONTROLS Page 10 foliaged plants, particularly those requiring frequent watering as used in \"Hawaiian style\" well shaded gardens should be avoided near accommodation areas or ev ening recreation areas. New Waterbodies Close to Residential Areas Many developments are now incorporating ei ther freshwater or tidal waterbodies as part of the overall development of t he site. These waterbodies may be created as part of the drainage system of the site , to obtain fill for development, for flood control and/or recreation purposes. The following guidelines are suggested to reduce the biting insect problem:- 1. Tidal waterbodies should have a high percentage of their foreshore revetted to a level belo w that suitable for biting midge breeding. This will exclude the inter-tidal zone fav oured by biting midge. Small areas may be left as sandy beach for recreation providing human recreational activities on these beaches is sufficient to keep the sand well trampled to deter midge breeding. Regular weekly raking of these beaches throughout the warmer months of the year may also deter midge colonisation of the beaches. Consult Council's Entomological Control Officer for further details of this technique. 2. Water quality of lakes and lagoon s should be suitable for mosquito eating larvivorous fish to breed. 3. Water to be stocked with suitable native larvivorous fish. Council will advise and assist with this. 4. Waterway design to avoid the pot ential for extensive emergent aquatic plant growth. Generally this will requi re the majority of the water body to be deeper than 2m, though sha llow ingress and egress points supporting aquatic growth to act as sediment and nutrient traps are favoured. If water-lillies colonise waterbodies extensively, regular removal may be necessary to reduce the breeding potential of several opportunistic mosquito species that spend their larval stages attached to the stems of these plants. Development Applications Upon receipt of a development applicati on by Tweed Council, where it has been identified as having a biting insect problem , the developer is required to outline in detail how the problem will be minimised. Where insect problems are considered severe, the development application must be accompanied by a report from a person qualified in addressing the bi ting insect probl em in detail.
