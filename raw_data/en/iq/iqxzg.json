Our CRIPT clinical team study samples from ongoing existing cohorts in Spain and South Africa of vaccinated or infected humans. In addition, we conduct longitudinal studies in vaccinated or infected humans in the US (New York University Hospital, Mount Sinai Hospital, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Washington University in St Louis and University of Maryland) and outside the US (UC-Christus Medical network in Chile). The samples collected from such a diversity of human populations in different environments but using similar disease criteria and collection procedures provide us with unique opportunities to determine how various host and environmental factors impact immunogenicity of influenza virus inactivated vaccines, severity of disease and transmission. These samples also allow us to identify potential biomarkers of responses to vaccine and natural infection.
