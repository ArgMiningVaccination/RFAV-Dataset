INTRODUCTION Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) are key issuesin the discussion on scientic evidence, clinical experience,medical judgment, and patient-focus in today's medicine. Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) methods usually transcend reductionist biophysical models, using a ho-listic approach to treat the patient. The goal is an extensive andsustainable cure or improvement, attained by the stimulation ofsalutogenetic self-healing processes. Treatment is highly individ-ualized according to the needs of the patient, using naturalmedicinal products (of zoological, herbal, techniques, biofeedback, chiropractic,meditation, massage, lifestyle changes), and counseling. Thephysician-patient relationship is particularly important. Thetreatments are used in addition to conventional medicine(\"complementary\") or, in some cases, instead of it. Another termused, especially for research-based CAM systems, is integrative medicine. The interest in CAM among patients is increasing worldwide, and physicians are also developing a favorable opinion towardmany types of CAM. 1-14In a state referendum in Switzerland in 2009, two-thirds of the population voted for the integration ofCAM into the healthcare system. Modern therapies should be effective, safe, and affordable within the healthcare system. Concerning CAM, the criticalquestion therefore is: How can this be assessed while doingjustice to scientic principles as well as to the complexity and thespecic properties of CAM? REVERSE RESEARCH STRATEGIES The evaluation of effectiveness, safety, and costs plays a differentrole in CAM and in conventional drug therapy, because the twohave developed in reverse directions: CAM consists of therapysystems with long traditions in patient care, evolved from dis-tinct concepts, and looking back on times of experience thatsometimes stretch over hundreds of years. Only secondary aftersuch development in and from clinical practice, laboratory in-vestigations, and clinical trials come in. Quite different is thesituation for conventional drug therapies: they are primarilydeveloped in the laboratory and then tested on animals and on1 Institute for Applied Epistemology and Medical Methodology, Freiburg, Germany2 Union of Associations of Swiss Physicians for Complementary Medi-cine, Luzern, Switzerland3 Regional Hospital Emmental, Department of Complementary Medi-cine, Switzerland4 Institute of Complementary Medicine (KIKOM), University of Bern,Switzerland5 Gerhard Kienle Chair for Theory of Medicine, Integrative and Anthro-posophic Medicine, Center of Integrative Medicine, University of Wit-ten/Herdecke, Germany6 Department of Methodological Plurality in Medicine, Center of Inte-grative Medicine, University of Witten/Herdecke, Germany7 Association of Swiss Medical Societies for Acupuncture and ChineseMedicine, Dietikon, SwitzerlandFinancial disclosure: We declare to have no conflict of interest. #Corresponding Author.

Only after this gatekeeping pro- cess they are introduced into clinical practice, which will then largely be guided by the study results. Coming from preclinicallaboratory development, the remedies' therapeutic potential andsafety in real-world practice are hardly calculable. This has leadto drug tragedies, for example, the severe birth defects caused bythe supposedly safe and popular sedative thalidomide, 15or poisoning known as the \"Sulfanilamide trag-edy.\" 16Therefore, clinical trials are the admission ticket to the clinical use of conventional drug therapy, and for this purposethe designs and guidelines of clinical research have been essen-tially delineated. As a consequence, for example, the membersof the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH), which issues the obligatory Good Clinical Practice (GCP)\u2014Guidelinesfor clinical studies, consist of representatives of the pharmaceu-tical industry and of drug regulatory agencies. Hence, for CAM and for conventional drug therapy, the ap- proaches to clinical research follow reverse strategies ( Figure 1). EVIDENCE-BASED MEDICINE (EBM)Clinical research evolved into EBM, its goal being to integratebest external evidence, individual clinical expertise, and patientperspective: 17patient treatment should be based on clinical re- search, and the jungle of research results published daily shouldbe systematically processed and made accessible to the practitio-ners who search for up-to-date knowledge. This sensible bot- tom-up concept was, however, soon transformed into a top-down approach: EBM principles were incorporated into legislationand used for the increasing regulation of the medical professionand in this way also for decisions regarding the availability andreimbursement of therapies, thus marginalizing the role of clin-ical expertise and patient perspective. 18,19For this regulatory assessment, external evidence is hierarchically ordered. On topof the hierarchy is the randomized controlled trial (RCT), whichis usually the only form of evidence accepted for regulatorydecision making. Other research methods play at best a minorrole, and clinical judgment has mostly been discredited, its po-tential power remaining unexplored and undeveloped.There is no question that good clinical research and particu- larly RCTs make essential contributions to medicine and patient care. To integrate scientic evidence is an indispensable featureof medical professionalism, in conventional as well as in com-plementary medicine. 20,21 However, the crucial questions about EBM regard the issue of whether the organization of healthcare should be based primar- ily on certain types of clinical studies (namely RCTs); whetherthis type of \" best evidence\" allows reliable conclusions concern-ing the \"best therapy\" for the and whether, for suchconclusions, EBM's evidence-hierarchy offers substantial sup-port or is potentially misleading. These EBM principles, despite their far-reaching conse- quences for the healthcare system and despite the strict empiri-cal self-conception of EBM, have not themselves been empiri-cally evaluated as to whether disease outcomes are better whentreatment follows hierarchical evidence (ie, comparing out-comes of patients treated primarily according to EBM guidelinesand patients treated according to the physician's discretion). 22 There are several hints that EBM is not necessarily advantageousfor patients and costs: three large German RCTs investigated theinfluence of acupuncture on knee osteoarthritis, migraine, andlow back pain compared to placebo acupuncture and to bestevidence-based conventional therapy according to guidelines.Amazingly, in the case of knee osteoarthritis and low back pain,the best evidence-based conventional treatment was substan-tially inferior not only to acupuncture but also to the placebotherapy; there was a large and statistically highly signicant ef-fect difference (and for migraine, evidence-based therapy andplacebo treatment were comparable). 23-25Even though these results are open to interpretation, they still show that the healthbenet experienced by patients is not necessarily the greatestwhen applying RCT-oriented EBM. In a British cluster RCT,when patients with hypertension and type 2 diabetes weretreated either according to guidelines or at the physicians' dis-cretion, there was no difference in blood pressure control be-tween the two groups after one year. However, the guidelinegroup was more likely to receive higher doses of antihyperten- Figure 1.

Further-more, they criticize the denigration of all other sources of knowl-edge such as the physicians' clinical experience, tacit knowledge,and the patients' observations, and also the failure to furtherinvestigate and assess the process of clinical learning and skillacquisition. They also regret that in the context of the overreach-ing RCT-alignment, diverse redenitions occur: patient \"primary outcome measure\"; physician to \"provider\";and patient to \"consumer.\" Besides all, the medically necessaryabilities of the art of treatment and of empathic engagementwould continue to whither away. 43-47 Critical attitude has grown also in EBM itself, with some of its representatives questioning the strict hierarchization of evi-dence: \"Our main wish, from which all others stem, is that RCTsbe taken off their pedestal, their exalted position at the top of anarticial evidence hierarchy; that all forms of evidence be appre-ciated for what they can offer . . . no single form of research isbest. . . . We wish to see a diversity of research approaches, ratherthan a hierarchy.\" 48 IS THE PRIORITIZATION that the \"best evi-dence\" reflects the \"best therapy available.\" This conclusion,however, is only valid if the conduction of RCTs is equally feasible for all potential therapies; if the RCTs are conductedunder conditions similar to real-world clinical practice; and ifRCT results are free from confounding factors\u2014but these threepreconditions are not generally met. When designing RCTs, considerable efforts are made in order to avoid systematic bias affecting the comparison between inter-vention and control groups, particularly in order to avoid false-positive results. However, this does not mean that RCTs neces- sarily give an objective picture of therapeutic reality: the use ofRCTs promotes some therapies and disadvantages others; theconduction of RCTs is fragile; and the results of RCTs have onlylimited applicability for clinical practice and leave importantquestions unanswered: The conduct of RCTs is only feasible for certain treatmentsbecause they require a number of preconditions: (1) powerful nancial backing 49(average costs per RCT with public health relevance are estimated at 12 million US dollars;50this is why RCTs are mostly sponsored by the nancially strong pharma-ceutical industry with the main goal of licensing and market-ing of protable therapies); (2) academic attractiveness (in order to increase the incentive to conduct and publish the trial); (3)large numbers of patients 51,52(because only a small fraction of available patients can be recruited, and various studies oftencompete for them); (4) no preference for either intervention or for control therapy 53(because otherwise patients will not par- ticipate, and this is why, for instance, RCTs evaluating homeversus hospital births cannot be conducted); (5) equipoise 54 (because a randomized assignment to the intervention or con-trol group is unethical if the prospect for health benet isunequal, and therefore, for instance, the efcacy of operativeremoval of a local malign gastrointestinal or gynecologicaltumor can generally not be investigated with RCTs); (6) simple study protocols (with simplied diagnostic and treatment pro- cedures avoiding study complexity 55). (7) These limitations in the feasibility of RCTs give occasion for structural biases suchas commercial bias, career bias, indifference bias and medioc-rity bias. As a consequence, many therapies are disadvantaged:inexpensive therapies, nonpharmacological therapies, thera-pies for nancially less promising patients, therapies with lessattractivity for those pursuing an academic career, therapieswith an a priori obvious efcacy or with strong preferences,and also highly complex therapies\u2014regardless of their actualtherapeutic value for patients. 56 The reliability of RCTs is not ensured by the design alone.Even in studies appearing to be methodologically perfect, re-sults can still depend on imponderables such as the source ofsponsoring. 57RCTs on the same interventions often show substantial variation in results, as do corresponding systematicreviews and meta-analyses. 56Moreover, RCT methodology is primarily devised (and sees its ethos in pursuing this goal) toavoid false-positive bias, but the protection against false-neg-ative results receives hardly any attention. False-negatives of-ten arise due to errors or to levelling out differences related tothe disease, the treatment or the outcome assessment (seeTable 1). They can be fostered but not avoided by randomiza-tion, blinding, and mega-trials. False-negative results lead to aTable 1. Factors That Can Lead to False-Negative Results in Ran- domized Controlled Trials 58-60 Therapy error, dosing error Adjunctive and compensatory treatment \"Placebo\" treatment with specic effects Dropouts/patient attrition and noncompliance Contamination and intention-to-treat analysis Informed consent Obsequiousness bias, social desirability bias Low discriminatory power of measurement instruments Tendency to give mediocre answers Group assimilation Low patient recruitment Conditioning effects Cognitive interactions Disturbance of physician-patient relationship Errors in attribution Simplied study design (mega studies) 177 Complementary Therapy Systems And Their Integrative Evaluation EXPLORE May/June 2011, Vol. 7, No. 3systematic underestimation of treatment effects in RCTs, and can often explain their small effect sizes.58-60 The gap between the conditions of RCTs and real-worldhealthcare is widely recognized. This gap often arises from aconsiderable patient selection (eg, regarding disease severity,comorbidity, risk factors, gender, age, race, social status, co-operation, and expected treatment response; usually less than1% of representative patients with the respective diagnosis areenrolled) or from differences in setting, diagnostic procedures,treatment, treatment goal, duration of treatment, follow-up,and adjunctive therapies. Therefore, RCT results have onlylimited applicability to routine clinical practice. 52,56,61-65 The benet of RCT-tested therapies \"number [of patients] needed in order for one patient to nally receivebenet from the therapy, ranges between 2 and 250 patients.This means, conversely, that 50% to 99.6% of patients aretreated needlessly (so-called \"number treated needlessly\" or\"index of therapeutic impotence\" 66) and cannot expect a ben- et from the treatment. It is therefore essential to nd ways toidentify the patients who need different or additional treat-ment\u2014a task left to the physician, who, for this purpose, needsto judge and to decide beyond the data from clinical studies. The prioritizing of healthcare treatments according to the existence of respective RCTs leads to biased therapy selectionand not necessarily to the selection of the best therapy for thepatient. Therefore, in order to ensure optimal patient care, thephysician himself must critically examine and evaluate the exist-ing evidence. He must complement and even correct the exter-nal evidence by his own experience, internal evidence, profes-sional knowledge, and by the patient perspective (Figure 2).Health authorities, as well, must appraise RCTs within theircontext. The authorities must also acknowledge that for thera-pies with long traditional use and large amounts of other evi-dence, RCTs are of limited informational value; and that, on theother hand, the physician's discretionary and therapeutic free-dom as well as his independent clinical judgment must be main-tained. Because the traditional use of RCTs does not reasonably ad- dress critical clinical questions faced by decision makers likephysicians and patients or policy makers and purchasers, there isa need for research alternatives with a practical orientation, suchaspragmatic trials 67,68orcomparative effectiveness research .69,70 These studies, however, are complex and expensive. The costs ofthe ALLHAT study (Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treat-ment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial 71), for instance, comparing four therapies, amounted to 120 million US$.70Such studies can only be conducted for selected clinical questions. CONVENTIONAL MEDICINE BETWEEN EVIDENCE BASE AND CLINICAL JUDGMENTConventional medicine today\u2014with its undeniable benecialtherapeutic innovations of the last century\u2014stands between ef-cacy proofs based on external evidence and, on the other hand,good clinical judgment and its backing by pathophysiologicalreflections and basic epidemiological principles. Thus, even in astronghold of clinical research such as the eld of cardiology,only 11% of the recommendations in current authoritativeguidelines (from the American College of Cardiology or the Amer- ican Heart Association) are based on level A external evidence(RCTs, meta-analyses), whereas 48% are based on case studies,expert opinions or standards of care. 72The situation is similar in oncology: For 14 neoplastic hematologic disorders studied, only24% of therapy recommendations were supported by level 1evidence (RCTs), 21% by single-arm prospective studies (level2), and 55% by retrospective or anecdotal evidence. 73In the case of lung cancer, guideline recommendations are 29% evidencebased and 71% consensus based. 74Evidence from RCTs (level 1) is available primarily for initial interventions in newly diagnoseddisease, hardly for relapsed or refractory disease. 73Concerning surveillance and aftercare of patients having completed primarycancer treatment, external evidence is completely lacking, 75and the effectiveness of surgical removal of local malignant tumorswill probably never be proven through RCT comparisons ofsurgery versus no surgical intervention. Furthermore, systematicreviews used to build treatment guidelines for breast and coloncancer do not meet the required quality standards. 76As an ex- ample for a common and often deadly infectious disease: thecurrent WHO recommendations for the treatment of isoniazid-resistent tuberculosis, which are implemented in 90 countries,are not supported by a single RCT. 77 In many complex medical elds, evidence-based practice is only marginal and often critically questioned. In paediatric sur-gery\u2014with its undeniable achievements\u2014publications consist al-most exclusively of case reports and case series, whereas RCTsare rare. 78In palliative care, physicians see their practice as clearly not evidence based; with patients near death, the conduc-tion of an RCT would bring about immense difculties. Here,the focus lies not on RCT-testable, standardized treatments forspecic diseases, but on the individualized care of the respectivepatient, addressing his particular needs, his suffering; therapy is Figure 2. Four sources of evidence relevant for patient-centered, evidence-based medicine (adapted from175). 178 EXPLORE May/June 2011, Vol. 7, No. 3 Complementary Therapy Systems And Their Integrative Evaluationoriented toward the whole person, providing a comfortable, ho- listic environment for him or her. Anecdotal evidence, clinicaljudgement, intuition, and adaption to the patient are central;EBM evidence is secondary 30,79(\"some people would say high- grade evidence is worse than what you see in front of you\"79). In the mental health eld, evidence-based practice is the subject ofvigorous controversy\u2014whether the results from the clinical trialscan be generally applied to individual patients, or can only beapplied to a few standard situations for which clinicians choosethe respective intervention anyway, with or without EBM algo-rithms. 34,80 Thus, in conventional medicine, RCTs only have a limited informational value, and other research methods as well as clin-ical judgment are equally important. Clinical judgment becomesessential whenever the treatment situation is complex; wheneverthe treatment outcome depends on the therapy provider's skills;and whenever the focus is on individual patients and individualdisease characteristics rather than on specic diagnoses\u2014whichare all frequent situations in medicine. CLINICAL JUDGMENT AND MEDICAL PROFESSIONALISMClinical judgment is a core element of medical professional-ism. 20,21,81In general, high expertise is characterized by excel- lent judgment, which develops from intelligence, knowledge,experience, and continuous critical reflection. Still\u2014although\"there is no substitute for excellent judgement\" 82\u2014in medicine the question arises: is judgment capable of reliably assessingtherapy situations, and substantiating internal evidence? Or is it, rather, notoriously mistaken and dependent on external instruc-tion? Can clinical judgment be a true adjunct to external evi-dence? What are the potentials of its development? These ques-tions have only been investigated very little so far. Today's implicit model for medical professionalism is technical rationality. 46,83: intelligent practice is the application of scientic knowledge: the practitioner hands his unresolved practical prob-lem over to the scientist, the scientist solves it and returns thenew scientic knowledge to the practitioner who can then applythis knowledge in his practice. In this process, there appears to beno necessity for clinical judgment apart from the identicationof the problems. The dominance of this model, conjunct withlimited resources and with liability issues, leads to increasingexternal regulation of medical practice, to the decline of medicalautonomy, to deprofessionalization, and to frustrated physi-cians. Researchers on expertise see this model as grossly oversimpli- ed. It fails to account for the heart of professionalism: for itscomplexity. At best the model suits the situation of novi-ces. 46,83-86Experts and masters in all disciplines are in command of abilities beyond external knowledge: Tacit knowledge. This is a feature of competence and mastery.Experts know more than they can say, and therefore they oftencannot sum up their outstanding decisions and actions intorules. If required to do so, they regress to novice level and todecreased expertise. Professional success is more strongly cor-related to tacit knowledge than to conventional academic in-telligence. 84,86-89Reflection in action. When the professional practitioner en- counters problems or unexpected events for which externaland tacit knowledge offer no immediate solution, he mayrespond by reflecting in action. The practitioner enters into areflective dialogue with the situation in order to nd newsolutions, observing new phenomena, gaining new insights,and generating new knowledge. Experts have the ability ofcreative thinking, which has been the source for importantdiscoveries, innovations and new medical insights. Today, thissource of progress\u2014this \"spirit of innovation\"\u2014and its correc-tive against unsuited routine, is increasingly suppressed byexcessive bureaucracy, formalization, and legal constraintsand is pilloried by a plethora of negative attitudes. 83,90-92 Gestalt recognition. Agestalt is the wholeness of a structure, recognizable independently from the characteristics of itsparts. 93,94Gestalt recognition plays a major role in the acqui- sition of experience, in the development of tacit knowledge,and in experts' judgments. 86,87,90,95In medicine, gestalt struc- tures can be discerned when analyzing reliable clinical judg-ment, for example, on therapy effects or on adverse reactions(Table 2). The certainty of this kind of judgment increases withthe complexity of the gestalt relations\u2014as opposed to statisti-cal conclusions from cohort comparisons. 58,96 In science itself, the epistemic virtues and the ideals of profes- sionalism have undergone transformations in the 20th century,particularly in regard to the objectivity of knowledge: in the 19thcentury, the ideal of scientic objectivity was of a mechanicalnature, with the guiding ideal of self-surveillance, self-denial,self-elimination, and the exclusion of any interpretation or otherforms of \"subjectivity,\" favoring standardized and mechanical\"blind sight\" procedures. All attempts to extirpate subjectivity,however, failed. The automation of knowledge acquisition andthe algorithmic judgment procedures ultimately got lost in inci-dental details, in an innite complexity of variation and a mul-titude of artefacts, and were useless for pedagogy; furthermore,these techniques could often not be stringently applied or wereunsuitable. Onward from the beginning of the 20th century,those ideals changed and were subordinated to the current lead-ing scientic paradigm of professionalism. Now, the roots forscientic accuracy are seen in trained judgment, based on the Table 2. Criteria of Gestalt-Based Therapy Judgement 58, 96 Strong criteria - Space pattern correspondence - Time pattern correspondence- Morphological correspondence- Dose-effect therapeutic gestalt process Weak criterion - High pre/post time ratio 179 Complementary Therapy Systems And Their Integrative Evaluation EXPLORE May/June 2011, Vol. 7, No. 3subjects' expertise, his trained instincts and intuition, self-con- dence, experience, and on pattern recognition.97 The competent, trained and critically reflected clinical judg- ment can, in principle, lead to reliable knowledge. It still has itsplace in the discovery of new therapeutic principles, as was re-cently demonstrated by the publication of a case study describ-ing the surprising remission of pediatric hemangioma after ap-plication of the beta blocker propranolol; an effect that could bereliably reproduced in other children. 98Discovery and explana- tion of therapies follow a distinct logic.99This is relevant also for CAM, because even though an abundance of scientic researchis available on CAM, the physicians' and patients' own experi-ence and judgment are often essential in the provision and fur-ther development of CAM therapies. CLINICAL RESEARCH AND CAM Complementary and alternative medicine is an area remarkablefor its research activity: already in 2006 more than 20,000 con-trolled clinical studies were found in the relevant data-bases. 100,101There are plenty of blinded or open-label RCTs, well-conducted nonrandomized comparative studies, largehealthcare studies, observational studies, safety studies, etc. Alarge body of preclinical research, Medline-indexed journals onCAM research, international congresses on CAM research, re-search organizations, academic centers, and a Cochrane Centerspecically dedicated to the investigation of CAM also exist.\"Evidence-based CAM\" is a well-established term, and there isan intensive methodological debate on CAM research. CAMstudies comply with the same methodological standards and gothrough the same scientic peer-review procedures as corre-sponding studies in conventional medicine. In direct compari-sons, the methodological quality of CAM studies does not seeminferior to that of studies on conventional therapies. 102,103 Even though numerous RCTs have been conducted on CAM, they only have a selective or exemplary informational value forthe assessment of CAM. One reason is the very large number oftherapy options, due to the existence of several thousand medic-inal products in different concentrations and dosage forms; ofdifferent nonpharmacological treatments; of extensive individ-ual counselling on the current life situation, behavioral patterns,disease coping, and lifestyle; and of multiple modes of combi-nation of these procedures for different patients and indications.Testing all would require hundreds of thousands or even mil-lions of RCTs. Furthermore, RCTs usually do not mirror thereal-world clinical practice and complexity of CAM: usually, inRCTs, the effect of a clearly dened and standardized interven-tion on predened outcome parameters is studied, which pro-vides information on the course of a likewise clearly deneddisease. This presupposes that the disease can be clearly de-scribed, appears uniformly, can be treated with the same stan-dardized intervention, and that its improvement can be mea-sured with the same parameter. Even though many CAMprocedures are being studied in this way, it is hardly consistentwith their practical application: CAM therapies do not focus on singular pathological pro- cesses but rather on the sick patient in his or her whole complex-ity, including physical, mental, spiritual, and social factors.These are interconnected and need to be addressed in total andon multiple levels. Moreover, CAM therapies aim to supportand stimulate autoprotective and (auto-)salutogenetic poten-tials, mostly with the active cooperation of the patient or ofhis/her organism (metaphorically speaking: \"enabling the pa-tient to swim\" 104), rather than directly eliminating the disease or disease symptoms or directly correcting the pathological devia-tion in a patient being treated passively (\"saving the drowningperson\" 104).105Salutogenetic approaches are more complex and need to be more individualized than the pathogenetic approach.Besides the patient's particular health situation, also his environ-ment, family, culture, and socioeconomic factors have to betaken into account, as well as his individual resources that can bemobilized for more autonomy and sense of coherence. 2,106In people with same diagnoses, the salutogenetic potential and ac-cording therapy goals can be very divergent. Accordingly, therepertoire of CAM treatment is complex, and its applicationhighly individualized. CAM treatments and counseling are provided as integrative systems with interacting components. Accordingly, the effect ofcomplex approaches often are larger than the sum of the com-ponents' effects. Therefore, testing isolated components oftenmakes little sense; likewise the focus on single diseases (whichoften are treated differently in different patients) or on singleoutcome parameters (which often have different meaning fordifferent people). Therefore, CAM needs more broadly designed and more comprehensive research methods that study the intact, whole,and complex systems 107,108in order to mirror their real-world practice. These methods have been labelled Whole System Re- search,109-111CAM Systems Research,112, 113Whole Medical Systems Research,114orComplex Intervention Research.115, 116For example, it is recommended (Figure 3) rst to assess the theoretical back-ground and practical experience of the long-standing tradition,followed by safety assessment and then by a pragmatic evalua-tion of the whole system (as intact as possible), and only after-ward to assess selectively isolated components and to elucidateexemplary mechanisms of action. 113This procedure is explicitly nonreductionist. It places less emphasis on the conduct of sin-gular studies than on suitable research programs and nonhierar-chical research networks that are cyclical, flexible, and adaptiveand that encompass qualitative as well as quantitative meth-ods. 110,114 Figure 3. Researching complex health systems (adapted from112,113). 180 EXPLORE May/June 2011, Vol. 7, No. 3 Complementary Therapy Systems And Their Integrative EvaluationDOUBLE STANDARDS? A BRITISH DEBATE Complementary and alternative medicine is often sweepinglycriticized for not being \"evidence-based,\" \"evident,\" or evenfor obstructing scientic evaluation. 117Apart from the fact that this critique overlooks the existence of scientic studies,the question arises whether scientic data are at all capable ofrefuting this type of criticism. British social scientists describea double standard in demanding evidence for CAM and con-ventional medicine: on one hand, British national cancerpolicy advocates, albeit implicitly, the integrative, patient-centered approach of CAM. On the other hand, the imple-mentation of this policy as well as a constructive debate onevidence and effectiveness have been prevented by medicalassociations (British Medical Association, Royal College ofPhysicians). Paradigmatic and ideological barriers stand in theway, and insurmountable obstacles are created by using theterm evidence very restrictively, despite the general acknowl- edgment that conventional medicine's evidence base is lim-ited as well and is often far below the required gold stan-dard. 79The considerable discrepancy between the ideal of EBM and the actual organizational practice easily leads toflexible and opportunistic adaptivity which is open to subjec-tivity, influence of medical stakeholders, political constella-tions, and the professional status and the persuasive powerof the specialist. Strict evidence is primarily demanded whentherapies are considered not appropriate and when the logicbehind the therapy is questioned. The logic behind the ther-apy and the argumentation skills and societal influence of theproponents can be decisive in determining whether the so-called gold standard of evidence is demanded, or not. This allleads to a \"black box\" of funding decision making. As a con-sequence for CAM\u2014which deviates from the mainstream ra-tionales and is seen as a competitor\u2014rigid evidence standardsare demanded, as opposed to conventional medicine wherethese high standards are not universally implemented. Thishas been characterized as a \"double standard,\" used instru-mentally to exclude CAM. 79,118,119 A rather interesting view of research evidence is presented by the patients: they see the research results as basically im-portant and as not necessarily flawed, but they are largelysceptical of them, particularly when conventional scientistsperform research on CAM. Quite generally they doubt thatstatistical results are of major relevance for their own case.They consider that average probabilities from clinical studieswould not allow conclusions about their personal course ofdisease and about how they would react to treatment. Patientsattribute large impact to lifestyle, emotion, and spirituality,and assume that this is not calculable by statistics. Comple-mentary and alternative medicine treatments are chosen in-dependently from the evidence base. More important are thepatients' own experiences of benet, recommendations by hisor her physicians, experiences by friends and family members,and the philosophical background of the therapy. 79,120,121 PLURALISTIC THERAPY APPROACH ANDINTEGRATION OF CAM METHODSPluralism and dialogue are key principles for open and tolerantsocieties, and for the necessity of modern individualization.Critical and constructive pluralistic discourse is the best protec- tion against stagnation, fallacy, and totalitarianism. A key insightin 20th century theory of science was to acknowledge the plu-ralist structure of science\u2014with its parallel systems both in math-ematical as well as in empirical disciplines; 122-125with its plural- istic concepts of explanation,126its complementary127and competing128models, multiple levels of understanding,129 and its plurality of thought-styles and thought-collectives.130-132 Accordingly, a pluralistic healthcare system105,133-136supported by an ongoing critical discourse and scientic research, is theappropriate answer to the pluralistic structures of society andscience, and the adequate response to the manifold diversitiesand complexities of disease. For what reasons should CAM be accessible to patients? 1. Patients want CAM therapies to be available and nd them helpful. 1-5,12-14Similarly, many physicians see the integra- tion of CAM therapies as meaningful and useful.6-11 2. Complementary and alternative medicine patients often suf- fer from chronic long-standing and severe illness121,137-149 and seek CAM when they do not or no longer respond(adequately) to conventional therapy; when a conventionaltherapy option is not available at all or is rejected out ofinner convictions or preferences; or when conventionaltreatment is only symptomatic and not causal or healing,and symptom relief could also be attained through CAMmethods. 23-25,149 3. Many patients and physicians want to avoid the side effects of conventional medical treatment. Drug side effects are thefourth to sixth leading cause of death in the United States, 150 also including drugs that often work only symptomatically(especially nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs 151) and could be replaced by CAM treatments. The almost routineadministration of paracetamol to reduce fever in childrenwith acute infections is associated with an increased risk forasthma, rhinoconjunctivitis, and eczema. 152and possibly reduces the development of immunity.153The treatment of such infections is one of the focuses of CAM. Similarly, theroutine use of antibiotics for acute, often viral infections haslong been criticized. 154,155Generally, our society is consid- ered to be overmedicalized,156,157which is a problem con- sidering the potential side effects. Patients seeking CAMprefer to cut down on unnecessary medication. 158,159Al- though these issues are not resolved yet, they can nonethe-less be a legitimate reason for patients to pursue their owndifferentiated decision regarding medical treatment. 4. Many patients do not understand their illness according to the biophysical model of conventional medicine but in acomplex and holistic way. 2,147,148,160Accordingly, patients seek medical approaches that account for this complex andholistic understanding. Swedish cancer patients, as an exam-ple, perceived cancer care that is only concerned with thephysical aspects of their disease and not with the mental andspiritual level as an additional injury (\"a biomedical para-digm\u2014viewing mind and body as separate\u2014was sometimesperceived as a violation by the patients. . . . The women'ssuffering was increased due to this inability of healthcare 181 Complementary Therapy Systems And Their Integrative Evaluation EXPLORE May/June 2011, Vol. 7, No. 3providers to see them as persons, whole persons with feelings and thoughts\"161). 5. Complementary and alternative medicine's emphasis on lifestyle, the overall situation, and patient activity can be anasset to healthcare in general: especially in chronic diseases,the patient's outcome, therapy response, well-being, andtreatment compliance depend on cofactors such as nutri-tion, exercise, comorbidity, biographical features, lifestyle,family, and socioeconomics. The influence of these factorson widespread diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, andcoronary disease is immense and in some areas considerablylarger than the effects of drug treatment. 106,162,163An esti- mated 40% of premature deaths in the Untied States are dueto an unhealthy lifestyle. 164According to the INTER- HEART study, the risk for myocardial infarction can bereduced by 90% to 94% by a healthier lifestyle, 165whereas high-cost interventional procedures do not show additionalbenet in RCTs. 166To induce sustainable motivation for lifestyle changes, it is not a sufcient perspective only toinform about risk factor reduction (which is boring) or therisk of death (which is frightening, and therefore quicklyblocked out). A key challenge is rather to develop individu-alized therapy concepts that have the capability to activatethe patient's own resources, individually considering his orher potentials, values, and environment. Strategies of life-style change must be tailored to the individual patient inorder to be feasible and to cause him to quickly feel muchbetter and satised. Long-term compliance can then bemaintained. 106 In this context ts the observation that CAM physicians have longer consultations with their patients than conventional phy-sicians. 140-144,167-169Longer consultations are typical for pa- tients with chronic disease, ill-dened problems, and social andpsychological issues. On the other hand, longer consultationsare associated with favorable outcomes, lifestyle, and preventionintervention, greater enablement and patient satisfaction, fewerprescriptions and referrals, less follow-up appointments and re-turn visits, and also decreased stress for the physician. 170 Hence, a pluralistic therapy approach with the integration of CAM treatments\u2014depending on the patients' situation and pref-erences\u2014can be a meaningful adjunct to conventional medicine. INTEGRATIVE EVALUATION OF CAM Evidence-based medicine denes itself as the integration of thebest external evidence, individual clinical expertise, and patientperspective. 17This broad denition must be taken into account also on the regulatory level; otherwise, it will remain an emptyphrase. Accordingly, therapy evaluation must be based on all of Epidemiological researchCritically reflected and edited medical judgment Prospective comparative study Patient perspective RCTs Simple cohort studies Elaborate cohort studies Therapy evaluation Economical aspects Safety aspects Ethical and legal aspects Consecutive case-series (e.g. TCR series) Professional single-case descriptions (e.g. TCR) Critical evaluation of the different types of evidence with specifi c criteria in respect to: \u007f Methodological quality \u007f Clinical meaningfulness \u007f Practice relevance Formation of quality levels for each evidence type (e.g. Level I, II, III, IV) Creation of a hierarchy according to quality levels, independent onevidence type Figure 4. Information synthesis from different kinds of evidence.56 182 EXPLORE May/June 2011, Vol. 7, No. 3 Complementary Therapy Systems And Their Integrative Evaluationit: external evidence, clinical expertise, and patient perspective. Furthermore, because CAM is not mainstream, additional ques-tions arise concerning the conceptual background and therapeu-tic professionalism. 20 In case of external evidence (which includes the scientic evaluation of other physicians' clinical expertise), the evaluation of a complex therapy system used for decades or centuries is adifferent challenge than the evaluation of a single, newly synthe-sized drug. For the assessment of a whole therapy system, it isneither feasible nor meaningful to do RCTs on each single oneof its medicinal products, and for every one of its potentialindications and every one of its combinations with other rele-vant therapies. Also questionable would be to identify best re-search evidence just by the EBM-hierarchy of study designs. Theevaluation of a CAM system should rather be based on thetotality of the respective research material that should be criti-cally examined regarding methodological quality, clinical mean-ingfulness, and practical relevance. These results can then beintegrated into an overall synthesis (Figure 4). Altogether, to adequately evaluate CAM systems, an integra- tive assessment system is needed. It should be able to answer thefollowing questions: 1.Therapeutic professionalism: Does the treatment approach ad- here to the criteria of professional treatment 20and medical professionalism?21 2.Patient perspective and public demand: Do patients and citizenssee the availability of the respective therapy system within thehealthcare system as important? Is there a particular need forthis kind of treatment? 3.Conceptual basis: What is the conceptual framework\u2014withinthe respective Denkstil (thought style), 132paradigm,130epis- teme,171construct172-174\u2014of the therapy system, including its conception of man and nature, and how do these conceptsrelate to those of other therapy systems? 4.Safety, effectiveness, costs: a.Evaluation of the whole system: Has the therapy system beenevaluated as a whole and in real-world conditions? Whatare the results of these evaluation studies? b.Survey of component evaluations : What are the results of studies of individual components, developed and usedin the context of this therapy system? Exemplary areasof the therapy system should be evaluated by high-quality research (RCTs and well-designed nonrandom-ized comparative studies, meticulously conducted co-hort studies, etc), whereas the bulk of other therapyoptions should be documented by the practitionersthrough transparent, high-quality case reports and caseseries, collected from routine patient care. This total procedure implies the development of research programs. There is a necessity for the developement of scien-tic expertise within the members of the respective CAMsystems, for the assessment of the nancial aspects of thenecessary research projects, and for maintaining a construc-tively critical dialogue between CAM and conventional med- icine.
