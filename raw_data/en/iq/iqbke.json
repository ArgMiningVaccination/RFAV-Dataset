Part of the comprehensive assessment work is to formally identify unmet health needs in the community. Community stakeholders helped to prioritize the unmet needs for further implementati on strategy development. We are grateful to all the community members who joined us in this important work. During 2015 members of the community were asked to complete a survey to help identify unmet health needs. Researchers at the Center for Social Rese arch at North Dakota State University analyzed the survey data. Sanford further analyzed the data, identified unmet needs, and partnered with key community stakeholders to develop a list of resources and assets that were available to address each need. A g ap analysis and prioritization exercise was also conducted to identify the most significant health needs and to further address these needs through the implementation strategies that are included in this document. Sanford Canby has set strategy to address the following community health needs: Mental Health Physical Health The report focuses on community assets as well as community health needs. The asset map/resource list is included in this document along with the actions that will be taken to address ea ch identified need. At Sanford Canby , patient care extends beyond our bricks and mortar. As a not -for-profit organization, ensuring that the benefits of health care reach the broad needs of our communities is at the core of who we are. Through our work, we can bring health and healing to the people who live and work in our communities. Together, we can fulfill this mission. Sincerely, Lori Sisk Chief Executive Officer Sanford Canby Medical Center 3 Sanford Canby Medical Center Community Health Needs Assessment 2016 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 4 Sanford Canby Medical Center Community Health Needs Assessment 2016 Purpose A community health needs assessment is critical to a vital community benefit program that builds on community assets, promotes collaboration, improves community health, and promotes innovation and research. A community health needs assessment helps the community build capacity to support policy, systems, environmental changes and community heal th improvement. A community health needs assessment also serves to validate progress made toward organizational strategies and provides further evidence for retaining not -for-profit status. The purpose of this community health needs assessment is to devel op a global view of the population's health and the prevalence of disease and health issues within our community. Findings from the assessment serve as a catalyst to align expertise and to develop a community benefit plan of action. There is great intrinsi c value in a community health needs assessment when it serves to validate, justify and defend not -for- profit status and create opportunity to identify and address public health issues from a broad perspective. Study Design and Methodology 1. Non -Generaliz able Survey A non -generalizable survey was conducted as an on -line survey through a partnership between Sanford and the Center for Social Research (CSR) at North Dakota State University. CSR developed and maintained links to the on -line survey tool. The w ebsite address for the survey instrument was distributed via e -mail to various community stakeholders and agencies, at times using a snowball approach . Data collection occurr ed throughout the month of March 2015 and a total of 59 respondents participated i n the on -line survey. The purpose of this non -generalizable survey of community leaders in the greater Canby area was to learn about the perceptions of area community leaders regarding community health, their personal health, preventive health, and the prevalence of disease. This group included community leaders, and agency leaders representing chronic disease a nd disparity. A Likert scale was developed to determine the respondent's highest concerns, with 1 as not at all and 5 meaning a great deal. Needs ranking 3.5 and above were included in the needs to be addressed and prioritized. Many of the identified need s that ranked below 3.5 are being addressed by Sanford and community partners. However, 3.5 and above was used as a focus for the purpose of the required prioritization. 2. Community Stakeholder Meeting Community stakeholders were invited to a meeting to review the finding s from assessment research and to discuss the top health issues facing the community. Community stakeholders discussed the findings and helped to determine key priorities for the community. Those priorities will be addressed in the implem entation strategies for 2017 -2019. 5 3. Community Asset Mapping Asset mapping was conducted by reviewing the data and identifying the unmet needs from the various surveys and data sets. Each unmet need was researched to determine what resources were availabl e in the community to address the needs. Once gaps were determined the group proceeded to the prioritization process. The multi -voting methodology was implemented to determine what top priorities would be further developed into implementation strategies. 4. Secondary Research The secondary data includes the 2015 County Health Rankings for Yellow Medicine County. Key Findings - Primary Research The key findings are based on the non -generalizable survey data and secondary research.

Non -Generalizable Survey An on -line non -generalizable survey was conducted of residents in Canby and Yellow Medicine County, Minnesota. The survey instrument was develope d in partnership with public health leaders from across the enterprise and researchers at the Center for Social Research (CSR) at North Dakota State University (NDSU). The CSR developed and maintained links to the on -line survey tool. The website address for the survey instrument was distributed via e -mail to various community stakeholders and community agencies, at times using a snowball approach . Data collection occurr ed throughout the month of March 2015 and a total of 59 respondents participated in the on -line survey. The purpose of the non -generalizable survey of residents in the greater Canby area was to learn about the perceptions of area community leaders regarding community health, their person al health, preventive health, and the prevalence of disease. This group included community leaders and agency leaders representing public health, city government, chronic disease and disparity. A Likert scale was developed to determine the respondent's h ighest concerns, with 1 as not at all and 5 meaning a great deal. Needs ranking 3.3 and above were included in the needs to be addressed and prioritized. Many of the identi fied needs that ranked below 3.3 are being addressed by Sanford and community partne rs. However, 3.3 and above was used as a focus for the purpose of the required prioritization. 2. Community Stakeholder Meeting Community stakeholders were invited to a meeting to review the early finding s from the generalizable survey and to discuss the top health issues or health -related issues facing the community. The community stakeholders helped to determine key priorities for the community. 3. Community Asset Mapping Asset mapping was conducted by reviewing the data and identifying the unmet needs from the various surveys and data sets. The process implemented in this work was based on the McKnight Foundation model - Mapping Community Capacity by John L. McKnight and John P. Kretzmann, Institute for Policy Research at Northwestern University. Each unmet need was researched to determine what resources were available in the community to address the needs. The community stakeholder group conducted an informal gap analysis to determine what needs remain ed after resources were thoroughly researched. Once gaps were determined the group proceeded to the prioritization process. The multi -voting methodology was implemented to determine what top priorities would be further developed into implementation strateg ies. 4. Secondary Research The secondary data includes County Health Rankings for Yellow Medicine County. 16 Limitations of the Study The findings in this study provide an overall snapshot of behaviors, attitudes, and perceptions of residents living in Yellow Medicine County, Minnesota. A good faith effort was made to secure input from a broad base of the community. The non- generalizabl e survey was sent electronically to county and community leaders, and to organizations and agencies representing diverse populations and disparities. Additional data was reviewed through secondary research. The data for the secondary research was secured from the County Health Rankings. The Internal Revenue Code 501 (r) statute requires that a broad base of key community stakeholders have input into the needs of the community. Those community members specified in the statute include: persons who represent the broad interests of the commun ity served by the hospital facility including those with special expertise in public health; Federal, tribal, regional, state and or local health or other departments or agencies with information relevant to the health needs of the community served; leader s, representatives, or members of medically underserved, low -income, and minority populations. Sanford extended a good faith effort to engage all of the aforementioned community representatives in the survey process. In some cases there were surveys tha t were submitted without names or without a specified area of expertise or affiliation. We worked closely with public health experts throughout the assessment process. Public comments and response to the community health needs assessment and the implement ations strategies are welcome on the Sanford website under \"About Sanford\" in the Community Health Needs Assessment section. 17 Key Findings 18 Primary Research Community Health Concerns The following concerns ranked highest of all the indic ators on the non -generalizable (community stakeholders) surveys.

For example, using the Body Mass Index (BMI) which calculates weight status using an individual's weight and height , the majorit y of respondents in the area (67.3 %) are overweight o r obese. How ever, the vast majority (100%) of community respondents rate their own health as excellent, very good or good. With good overall health habits in mind, it is important to note th at within the past year, over 76 % of respondents visited a doctor or health care provider fo r a routine physical and over 89 % visited a dentist or dental clinic.

Community results indicate that within the past year, the majority of respondents had a blood pressur e screening, pelvic exam, flu vaccine , and dental screening. There are many screenings and tests that a majority of respondents did not receive (i.e. , bone density test, cardio screening, hearing screening, immunizations, STD test, vascular screening, colorectal cancer screening, and skin cancer screening) in the past year. Many tests and screenings may be conditional upon guidelines, which can be age sensitive/appropriate.

Mammograms are the best way to find breast cancer early, when it is easier to treat and before it is big enough to feel or cause symptoms. Having regular mammograms can lower the risk of dying from breast cancer. The U . S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends that if you are 50 to 74 years old, be sure to have a screening mammogram ev ery two years. If you are 40 to 49 years old, talk to your doctor about when to start and how often to get a screening mammogram. Cervical cancer screening: Cervical cancer is the easiest gynecologic cancer to prevent, with regular screening tests and fol low-up. Two screening tests can help prevent cervical cancer or find it early: The Pap test (or Pap smear) looks for pre-cancers, cell changes on the cervix that might become cervical cancer if they are not treated appropriately. The HPV test looks for the virus ( human papillomavirus(http://www.cdc.gov/cancer/hpv/basic_info/) ) that can cause these cell changes. The Pap test is recommended for all women between the ages of 21 and 65 years old, and can be done in a doctor's office or clinic. Colorectal cancer screening: Colorectal cancer almost always develops from precancerous polyps (abnormal growths) in the colon or rectum. Screening tests can also find colorectal cancer early, when treatment works best. Regular screening, beginning at age 50, is the key to preventing colorectal cancer. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends screening for colorectal cancer using high -sensitivity fecal occult blood testing, sigmoidoscopy, or colonoscopy beginning at age 50 years and continuing until age 75 years. Prostate cancer screening: The American Cancer Society (ACS) recommends that men have a chance to make an informed decision with their health care provider about whether to be screened for pro state cancer. The decision should be made after getting information about the uncertainties, risks, and potential benefits of prostate cancer screening. Men should not be screened unless they have received this information. The discussion about screening s hould take place at: Age 50 for men who are at average risk of prostate cancer and are expected to live at least 10 more years. Age 45 for men at high risk of developing prostate cancer. This includes African Americans and men who have a first -degree rela tive (father, brother, or son) diagnosed with prostate cancer at an early age (younger than age 65). Age 40 for men at even higher risk (those with more than one first -degree relative who had prostate cancer at an early age). After this discussion, those men who want to be screened should be tested with the prostate -specific antigen (PSA) blood test. The digital rectal exam (DRE) may also be done as a part of screening. If, after this discussion, a man is unable to decide if testing is right for him, th e screening decision can be made by the health care provider, who should take into account the patient's general health preferences and values. Assuming no prostate cancer is found as a result of screening, the time between future screenings depends on the results of the PSA blood test: Men who choose to be tested who have a PSA of less than 2.5ng/mL may only need to be retested every 2 years. Screening should be done yearly for men whose PSA level is 2.5 ng/mL or higher. 29 Because prostate cancer often grows slowly, men without symptoms of prostate cancer who do not have a 10-year life expectancy should not be offered testing since they are not l ikely to benefit. Overall health status, and not age alone is important when making decisions about screening. Even after a decision about testing has been made, the discussion about the pros and cons of testing should be repeated as new information about the benefits and risks of testing becomes available. Further discussions are also needed to take into account c hanges in the patient's health, values and preferences. Skin cancer screening: The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) has concluded there is not enough evidence to recommend for or against routine screening (total body examination by a doctor) to find skin cancers early. The USPSTF recommends that doctors: Be aware that fair -skinned men and women aged 65 and older, and people with atypical moles or more than 50 moles, are at greater risk for melanoma. Look for skin abnormalities when performing physical ex aminations for other reasons. Flu Vaccines The Center for Disease Control's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends that everyone six months and older receive a flu vaccine annually. Findings from the generalizable survey indicate that 37% of respondents did not have a flu shot last year. The Center for Disease Control states that influenza is a serious disease that can lead to hospitalization and sometimes even death. Even healthy people can get sick from the flu and spread it to others. Flu vaccines cause antibodies to develop in the body about two weeks after vaccination. These antibodies provide protection against infection with the viruses that are in the vaccine. Sanford Health employees are required to have an annual flu va ccine as a protective measure for our patients as well as our staff. Sanford holds annual flu blitz events to increase the number of community members both pediatric and adult who receive the flu vaccine. Fruit and Vegetable Intake The study results suggest that the majority of respondents do not meet vegetable and fruit recomme nded dietary guidelines. Only 25.9 % of respondents reported having 3 or more servings of vegetables the prior day. Only 25.4 % reported having 3 or more servings of fruits the prior day. According to the U .S. Department of Health and Human Services, U .S. Department of Agriculture - Dietary Guidelines for Americans, it is recommended that individuals consume 3 to 5 servings of vegetables per day and 2 to 4 servings of fruit per day depending on age. A meal plan high in fruits and vegetables is associated with decreased risk for chronic diseases. In addition, because fruits and vegetables have low energy density (i.e., few calories relative to volume), eating them as part of a re duced -calorie meal plan can be beneficial for weight management. 30 Number of servings of vegetables, fruit, and fruit juice that respondents had yesterday Physical Activity Levels Study results suggest that 65% of respondents do meet ph ysical activity guidelines. 45.5 % of respondents have 3 or more days per week with moderate activity. Guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that individuals participate in 150 minutes of moderate physical activity per week or 75 minutes of vigorous physical activity per week to help sustain and improve health.

Mental health influences our physical health, how we handle stress, how we make choices, and how we relate to others . Among respondents, m ental health is a moderately high area of concern, particul arly depression, a nd stress. 22 % of respondents have been told or diagnosed by a doctor or health professional that th ey have anxiety or stress and 15.3 % have been told they ha ve depression. In addition, 59 % of respondents self -report that in the last month, there were days when their mental health was not good. Number of days in the last month that respondents' mental health was not good Substance Abuse Responses Substance abuse is also a mental health disorder, as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , 4th edition (DSM -IV), and can stem from mental health concerns. In Canby and Yellow Medicine C ounty, 77.8 % of the community stakeholder's respondents drank alcoholic beverages on at least one of the days in the las t month. On days they drank, 11.9 % of respondents drank an average of 3 or more drinks per day. In regards to binge drinking, 26 % of community stakeholder's respondents report binge drinking at least once per month, Secondary research through the 2015 Cou nty Health Ranking s found that 25 % of residents in Yellow Medicine County r eport excessive drinking, and 25 % of the driving deaths indicated alcohol involvement.

The unemployment rate in Yellow Medicine County, Minnesota is 4.9 %. Health Needs and Community Resources Identified One of the Internal Revenue Service requirements for a community health needs assessment is to identify the resources that are available in the community to address unmet needs. Sanford Health conducted asset mapping by reviewing the primary and secondary research and identifying the unmet needs from the various surveys and data sets. Each unmet need was researched to determine what resources are available in the community to address the needs. Sanford Health and commu nity partners developed the asset map. The group conducted an informal gap analysis to determine what needs remained after resources were thoroughly researched. Once gaps were determined the group proceeded to the prioritization process. The multi -voting m ethodology was implemented to determine what top priorities would be further developed into implementation strategies. The process implemented in this work was based on the McKnight Foundation model - Mapping Community Capacity by John L. McKnight and Jo hn P. Kretzmann, Institute for Policy Research at Northwestern University. The asset map process includes identified needs from the following: The non -generalizable survey Concerns expressed by the key stakeholder group Secondary research data Community r esources that are available to address the need(s) The Appendix displays the asset map. 35 Prioritization The following needs were brought forward for prioritization: Aging - cost of long term care, availability of memory care Children and Youth - bullying, availability , cost of activities for children and youth Safety - presence of street drugs and alcohol in the community Health Care Access - and access to affordable health insurance, cost of affordable vision and dental insurance , access to affordable prescription drugs Physical Health - cancer, poor nutrition, inactivity, obesity, chronic disease Mental Health - stress, depression, dementia, alcohol abuse Sanford is addressing all of the assessed needs that fall within our scope of work. I n some cases the need is one where we do not have the expertise to adequately address the need. However, Sanford leaders will communicate these findings to community leaders and experts who can best focus on a solution to the concern. A document that sh ares what Sanford is doing to address the need or defends why Sanford is not addressing the need can be found in the next section. Members of the collaborative determined that mental health and physical health are top unmet needs for further implementatio n strategy development. Sanford has determined the 2016 -2019 implementation strategies for the following needs: Physical Health Mental Health 36 Addressing the Needs Identified Concerns How Sanford Canby is Addressing the Needs Aging Cost of long term care Availability of memory care Providing an opportunity for long term care in our community where memory care training is completed annually with staff.

The following strategies were implemented. Implementation Strategy : Develop a formal program to address obesity issues Appoint overall planning committee to execute program goals. Increase physical activity in various settings within the community. Improve dietary behaviors of the community through the use of mu ltiple resources. Support the community obesity issues through the use of social and behavioral approaches. Implementation Strategy : Provide local oncology services through outreach Enhance current telemedicine capabilities/frequency in conjunction with on-site oncologist presence. Provide local additional chemotherapy services . The 2013 strategies have served as a base for reaching out and utilizing resources and implementing resources in the Canby community. The impact has been positive and the work wi ll continue into the future through new or continued programming and services on the strategies. Impact of the Strategy to Address Obesity The implementation strategy to address obesity in the community has had a broad impact. The fit kids on- line program focusing on nutrition, activity, behavioral health and adequate sleep has had 310 students and their families access the site. Jump ropes and pedometers were provided to increase physical activity. The medical center removed high fat options from the cafeteria to improve nutrition for employees , patients and visitors. The imp roved nutr ition will provide a long lasting effect and a will have a broad reach into the community and region. Monthly diabetes prevention classes are held and diabetes screening events are held regularly. A new diabetes weight loss program has started to help prevent complications and improve glucose control and overall health. The Sanford Canby Wellness Center has begun a Better Balance Cla ss to improve fitness and to prevent falls. Impact of the S trategy to Provide Local Oncology Services The implementation strategy to provide local oncology services has made an impact on those who require services close to home. Sanford Canby has added telemedicine capability for o ncology patients and has increased chemotherapy supportive services. 44 Community Feedback from the 2013 Community Health Needs Assessment Sanford Health is prepared to accept feedback on the 2013 Community Health Needs Assessment and has provided on -line comment fields for ease of access on our website.
