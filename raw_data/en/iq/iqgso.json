In Santeria, cascarilla is a well-known and respected source of protection. Its practitioners use it to create protective barriers around themselves or their homes, to purify themselves from negative energies, or to honor their respected deities in ceremonies. Cascarilla is made from ground-up eggshells that have been cleaned and sometimes mixed with other ingredients. The amazing properties of cascarilla have made an impression on some practitioners of other pagan religions as well. Although cascarilla is not typically used in traditional Wiccan practices, some Wiccans who incorporate elements of Santeria, Hoodoo, or other Afro-Caribbean religions into their practice may use cascarilla for its protective and cleansing properties. Many other pagan practitioners also recognize its power and use it in their own rituals and practices, adapting it to their own beliefs and traditions. The Transformation of Efun to Cascarilla Cascarilla can be traced back to the native traditions of West Africa, where people brought the concept of sacred white earth called \"efun\" to the New World. Efun, which is the Yoruba word for kaolin clay, was believed to provide someone with powerful protection against all evil. As efun was a very important substance within Santeria, it was often used to purify and cleanse people and many other ritual objects. It was also used as an offering to the Orishas. Efun is believed to have spiritual properties that can help to connect people with the divine and bring blessings and protection.When these people were pushed off of their ancestral lands, they looked for a substitution for this \"white earth\". They started to make a powder from a plant called Croton eluteria, also known as the cascarilla tree or the sweetwood bark tree. This powder was made from the bark of this tropical shrub and was already used by many Caribbean natives as medicine. It could help reduce fevers, loosen phlegm, and even get rid of gas. Cascarilla also happened to possess a nearly white color, which was important for its symbolism. Over time, Santeria practitioners transitioned from using this herbal powder to using crushed eggshells, which were easier to come by and had the added symbolism of the life-giving egg. The Symbolism of Crushed Eggshells Within Santeria In Santeria, crushed eggshells are a common symbol used in various rituals and ceremonies. They are often used to represent new life, rebirth, and regeneration since eggshells are potential containers of new life. When the shells are crushed, they represent the breaking of old patterns and the beginning of a new cycle. In Santeria practice, crushed eggshells can be used in different ways, depending on the specific ritual or ceremony. They may be sprinkled on the ground to create a boundary or protective circle or placed on an altar as an offering to a particular deity. Eggshells can also be used in divination, which is a method of gaining insight or information through spiritual means. In this case, the eggshells are often used in a process called \"egg divination,\" where they are cracked and interpreted based on the patterns and shapes that are formed. Needless to say, crushed eggshells in all forms, including cascarilla, hold deep symbolism in Santeria practice, representing new beginnings, protection, and spiritual insight. The Many Ritual Forms of Cascarilla There are different forms of cascarilla that are used for different purposes. The most common forms of cascarilla are pressed chalk, loose powder, and blended with other substances. Cascarilla Chalk Pressed chalk is the most common form of cascarilla. It is made by compressing the powdered eggshells into a solid block. Cascarilla in its pressed chalk form is often used for drawing symbols or designs on the skin or on objects for protection and purification. These symbols or designs may represent various Orishas, other deities, or energies, and the use of pressed chalk is believed to offer a layer of spiritual protection to the person or object being marked. Cascarilla Powder Loose powder is another common form of cascarilla. Unlike pressed chalk, loose cascarilla powder is simply powdered eggshells without any additional processing. Loose cascarilla powder can be used in a variety of ritual or ceremonial ways. For example, it may be sprinkled on the ground to create a protective circle around a person or object, to ward off negative energies, and create a barrier of spiritual protection. It may also be sprinkled in specific areas of a home or other space to purify the space and remove negative energy. In addition to its use in creating protective barriers and purifying spaces, loose cascarilla powder can also be used for the purification of the body. It can be rubbed onto the skin, particularly around the head and neck, to purify and protect the individual from negative energy. This is often done as part of a larger ritual or ceremony and may be accompanied by prayers or invocations to specific Orishas or energies. Cascarilla Oils and Other Herbal Mixtures In addition to its more common forms of pressed chalk and loose powder, cascarilla can also be blended with other substances to create specific mixtures for different ritual and spiritual purposes. Cascarilla powder can be mixed with many different magical herbs or conjure oils to create a protection or purification blend. These oil blends can be used in different ways, depending on the specific purpose. For example, the mixture can be added to bath water for a purifying spiritual bath, or it can be rubbed directly onto the skin to offer protection. Cascarilla blends can also be used as offerings to specific deities or [Orishas](https://originalbotanica.com/blog/which-orisha-do-you-identify-with). These offerings may be made to honor the deity or to seek their assistance in a specific matter. The cascarilla blend may be added to other offerings such as food, drink, or flowers, as part of a larger ritual or ceremony. Using Cascarilla for Cleansing and Protection Cascarilla has two main abilities. One is to get rid of bad energy in any shape or form. The second is to make a separation between the regular and supernatural worlds. Because of these traits, cascarilla can be used for many ritual and spiritual purposes. Since it's usually in pressed chalk form, it has some flexibility in how it can be used. It's even possible to use it in the form of a loose powder or incorporate it into candles or incense for even greater coverage. In Santeria, cascarilla is often used to draw crucifixes on objects, including one's own body, that require shielding from hostile energy. These symbols are often drawn around the entry points of a house, such as doors, windows, and vents. This helps protect against evil forces and prevent any immaterial creatures, even harmless ones, from getting inside. In addition to protection, [cascarilla is also used for internal cleansing](https://originalbotanica.com/blog/cascarilla-powder-santeria-purification). It can be incorporated into a bath to rid the body of negativity and purify oneself for other rituals. This practice not only rids the body of negativity but also purifies oneself so that other rituals have a better chance of success. Overall, cascarilla has a rich history and cultural significance in Santeria and other pagan religions and continues to be a valued [tool for protection and cleansing](https://originalbotanica.com/blog/cascarilla-powder-santeria-purification) in these communities.
