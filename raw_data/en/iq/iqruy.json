And for good reason. It can treat such a wide range of health conditions as it has a powerful restorative and nutritive effect to the mind and body. In Sanskrit, Ashwagandha means 'the smell of horses,' which is a reference to the vigor and strength of a stallion that this herb imparts, and also due to its unique smell. For the busy person who is constantly rushing about, not sleeping properly, using a lot of mental energy, or someone who's always falling sick, this herb is for you. It provides mental clarity, energy, stamina, endurance and inner strength. Ashwagandha is one of the strongest adaptogen herbs. Adaptogens are substances (a combination of amino acids, vitamins, and herbs) that modulate your response to stress or a changing environment. Adaptogens help the body cope with stresses on all levels - be it physical, mental or emotional. External stressors include toxins in the environment, and internal stressors such as anxiety and insomnia. Ashwagandha supports the health of the adrenal glands and the Thyroid via its apoptogenic effects. Ashwagandha is from the same family at the tomato, and is a plump shrub with oval leaves and yellow flowers which bears red fruit. It is commonly referred to as 'Indian Ginseng' even though these plants aren't related. Its due to their shared healing benefits of that it gets this reference. Why Use Ashwagandha?
