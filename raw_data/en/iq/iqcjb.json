Dr Renee Usdin MBChB Dr Usdin practices integrative medicine, combining the best of medical science with the best of complementary therapies. She looks holistically at her client's illness and helps them to see what their body is trying to tell them about what needs shifting in their life or psyche. Dr Usdin uses nutrition, lifestyle modification, herbs and homeopathy routinely and other modalities as necessary. At medical school, Renee had already realized that illness was treated in a reductionist manner as opposed to integrative which brings all the parts together. The person was broken up into the different organs and body parts that were treated individually and patients were sent to various specialists, all of whom never looked at the whole person or communicated with each other. She began searching for a better, kinder, and more holistic way of treating the person using food, herbal remedies and nutritional supplements. After medical school she travelled extensively in Asia and learnt about Chinese medicine and acupuncture and started to see the body not just as cells and organs but also as an energetic system inseparable from mind, emotion and spirit. She also learnt about Ayurveda, aromatherapy and homeopathy and treating the person as an integrated whole being.
