The Guiding Principles for APRN, PA and AA Student Preceptorships: All placement requests will come through the Emory Healthcare APP Student Placement Coordinator. This policy creates a tiered placement system to give priority to Emory students and employees. The policy uses the approved schools of the Georgia Preceptor Tax Incentive Program (GPTIP). Prioritization is as follows: First priority will be given to Emory Healthcare employees who are attending the Emory University School of Nursing (SON) or the Emory Physician Assistant (PA) Program. Emory Healthcare employees attending the Emory Physician Assistant (PA) or Anesthesia Assistant (AA) Programs through the Emory University School of Medicine (SOM) will also be identified as a first priority placement. Second priority will be given to non-employee APRN, PA or AA students who are attending programs in the Emory University SON or the SOM. Third priority will be given to Emory Healthcare employees who are enrolled in an approved Georgia school and attending an APRN, PA or AA programs. Fourth priority will be given to non-employees who are enrolled in an approved Georgia school, and attending an APRN, PA or AA program, if the preceptorship is available 45 days prior to the start date. Emory Healthcare employees attending an out of state APRN or PA not for profit program will be assessed on a case-by-case basis to determine feasibility of a requested preceptorship. Preceptors precepting students from these schools do not qualify for the GPTIP Incentive ***A updated list of GPTIP schools can be found at Georgia Preceptor Tax Incentive link : [http://www.gru.edu/ahec/ptip]www.gru.edu/ahec/ptip](http://www.gru.edu/ahec/ptip%5dwww.gru.edu/ahec/ptip) |Student Placement Request||Site/Practice Case Form Approver||Forms Required| | | Emory Healthcare requires a placement request to be submitted via ACEMAPP.

Please check back often. Amity Medical Group requires that all students be vaccinated for COVID-19 prior to clinical experience. Students will be required to take a rapid COVID test on the first day of clincial experience. Students can go to an urgent care of their choice and turn results into Amity Medical Group or you can do a rapid COVIE PCR at one of their offices for a $95 charge. Amity Medical Group does allow religious or medical exemption forms. For exemption forms or additional information, please contact Ms. April Imes at [aimes@amitymed.org](mailto:aimes@amitymed.org). 9.30.2021 Effective September 30, 2021, AnMed Health requires COVID vaccines for all staff and students. AnMed Health does allow exemptions. AnMed Health COVID Vaccination Exemption Form [Atrirum Health COVID Exemption Education](/study/colleges_schools/nursing/internal/current_students/clinical_agency_forms_library/atrium_health_covid_exemption_education.docx) Effective at 7 am on Tuesday, March 28, 2023, masking will be optional for most teammates, students, patients and visitors at Atrium Health sites. Please note that this policy may change at any time due to significant increases in respiratory viruses as identified by Infection Prevention and Employee Health. Masking will be optional for all teammates, patients, students and visitors who are in good health and have not been exposed to anyone with COVID-19 in the last 10 days. This applies to all locations across Atrium Health, with the exception of: - All emergency department lobby, waiting room and triage areas - All Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist adult and pediatric cancer care inpatient and outpatient locations - High risk patient areas (further defined in FAQs ) - Any area or unit with an identified cluster of respiratory illness as identified by Infection Prevention and/or Employee Health Please note: - Some of our teammates, students, patients and visitors may choose to continue wearing a mask. Please be respectful of those choices. - Additionally, if at any time, a patient requests that you wear a mask in their presence, please comply with this request by wearing a well-fitting mask that covers your nose and mouth. Masking Change Frequently Asked Questions Why are we making masks optional at most locations at this time? - Across Atrium Health, we have seen a steady decrease in COVID-19 hospitalizations, the number of teammates with COVID-19 and a percentage of tests positive for COVID-19. We expect these downward trends to continue. - Due to the increase in COVID-19 vaccinations, boosters and immunity from COVID-19 cases in the community, there is widespread recognition that we are at a different point in the pandemic with regards to the risk of severe illness from COVID-19. - Because community masking and gathering have largely returned to pre-pandemic levels, teammates and patients are equally if not more likely to be exposed in the community as inside our sites. - While masking is an important tool for infection prevention, universal masking has been noted to contribute to health care worker fatigue, discomfort and burnout, as well as challenges with patient communication. What are the exceptions to this change in policy? Teammates and patients may choose to wear a mask at any time. There are five main exceptions to the optional masking policy: 1) emergency department lobby, waiting room and triage areas; 2) cancer care inpatient and outpatient locations; 3) suspected/confirmed COVID-19 exposure or respiratory illness; 4) standard infection prevention practices such as patient isolation precautions; 5) as determined by infection prevention due to an outbreak or cluster. - Emergency Departments. Due to limited space as well as varying health conditions, all teammates, students, patients and visitors will still be required to wear masks in the lobby, waiting room and triage areas of all Atrium Health emergency departments. Beyond triage areas, masking will be optional for all teammates, students, patients and visitors who are not experiencing symptoms of respiratory illness and who have not been exposed to COVID-19 in the previous 10 days. - Certain Cancer Care Areas. Because some patients in some of our cancer care inpatient and outpatient areas have weakened immune systems, masking will continue to be required at: - All Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist inpatient and outpatient cancer care locations - Atrium Health Levine Cancer Institute inpatient and outpatient locations, pediatric hematology oncology clinic (6th floor Medical Center Plaza), Atrium Health Carolinas Medical Center inpatient hematology units (4B, 4T, 3T, Levine Children's Hospital 11) - Suspected/Confirmed COVID-19 or Respiratory Illness. Teammates who are caring for a patient who has suspected or confirmed COVID-19 or other respiratory infection should wear an N95 mask or PAPR per standard infection prevention procedures. Teammates or patients who have been in close contact with someone with a confirmed case of COVID-19 within the previous 10 days or teammates who are returning to work following a confirmed case of COVID-19 should wear a well-fitting surgical mask that covers their nose and mouth. - Standard Infection Prevention Practices. Per infection prevention policy, teammates and students should continue to wear a well-fitting mask that covers their nose and mouth as required as part of standard droplet, special/advanced droplet contact or airborne isolation based on suspected or confirmed illness. - Outbreak or Cluster. Teammates and students who work in an area experiencing a COVID-19 outbreak or cluster should continue to wear a well-fitting mask that covers their nose and mouth as directed by Infection Prevention and/or Employee Health. What is the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidance regarding masking and COVID-19? CDC guidelines allow health care facilities to choose to discontinue universal masking when community transmission levels in the primary service area are not high. Could universal masking be put into place again in the future at Atrium Health? Yes. The policy regarding masking requirements may change at any time due to an increase in COVID-19 cases or teammate clusters as identified by Infection Prevention and/or Employee Health. Will patients and visitors be required to wear masks in our facilities? Patient and visitors who are in good health (symptom free and no COVID-19 exposure within the past 10 days) will not be required to wear masks in our facilities, except in the areas previously noted as exceptions to optional masking. What happens if a patient requests teammates to wear a mask? It is important that patients and visitors to our facilities feel safe. If a patient requests that their direct care team wear a mask during their visit, you should comply with their request. Are teammates still required to report symptoms of COVID-19 or household exposure? - Teammates should not report to work if they are sick. Teammates who are experiencing symptoms of COVID-19, including coughing, sneezing, sore throat or fever should notify Employee Health and follow the return-to-work process as directed. - Teammates who have had close contact with someone with a confirmed case of COVID-19 should report their exposure to Employee Health and wear a well-fitted mask that covers their nose and mouth for 10 days following the exposure.

The mandate applies to any personnel, including all physicians with medical staff privileges, who may come in contact with patients or other staff members who have contact with patients regardless of the frequency of their contact or whether the contact occurs away from the facility (\"Covered Staff\"). The CMS regulation does not offer a testing alternative. Effective December 5, 2021, Covered Staff must have received either the first dose of a primary series (Moderna or Pfizer) or a single dose COVID-19 vaccine (Janssen) before they may render any care, treatment or other services for the facility and/or its residents. By January 4, 2022, Covered Staff must have received the second dose of a primary series vaccine. We do not take implementing the new regulation lightly. The facility is a CMS-certified provider and relies on Medicare funding. While we understand that some may have political objections to the new regulation, the facility must comply with it to maintain its CMS certification. Please understand this is in no way a mandate directed by RMC Senior Leadership, or the Board of Trustees. Should you disagree with the mandate you are welcome to contact your local representatives. If you believe that you have a valid medical or religious exemption, you may apply by completing the appropriate form attached. Please note that you will need a health care provider to complete any medical exemption request. Also please note that the facility will not accept any pre-printed religious exemption request. Instead, you must describe in your own words the religious objection you have. All completed medical exemption request forms and/or religious exemption request forms must be submitted to the Direct, Human Resources for review and approved prior to December 5, 2021. If you have special issues or circumstances you would like to discuss, please reach out to me.

As of 11.3.2021 Dear Clinical Partners, In response to a federal executive order, UF Health Jacksonville will require all nursing faculty and students requesting a clinical learning experience at UF Health Jacksonville to be fully vaccinated for COVID-19 by Dec. 8, 2021. Fully vaccinated is defined as two weeks after the last required vaccine dose; the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines require two doses and the Johnson & Johnson vaccine requires one. In other words, the vaccination has to be completed on or before Wednesday, November 24, 2021. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have focused our efforts on protecting others by promoting health and safety best practices. Over the last several months, a large percentage of our students, faculty and staff are now already fully vaccinated against COVID-19. Unvaccinated individuals should seek their first vaccine dose as soon as possible to meet the stated deadline. The COVID-I9 vaccine is readily available throughout the Jacksonville Community via retail pharmacy and food store chains. If the nursing school grants a school faculty or student a medical or religious exemption to the COVID-19 vaccination, we have provided a form (found under the Documents/Paperwork tab on mCE) that the school representative will use to document such an exemption. This will be uploaded into the My Clinical Exchange (mCE) LMS database under the COVID-19 vaccination requirement. NOTE: The UofSC College of Nursing does not grant medical or religious exemptions. UF Health will continue to monitor conversations at the state and federal levels, and will assess whether we need to evolve our approach on the basis of other decisions that may surface in the coming weeks and months. In the meantime, thank you for your prompt attention to this matter and for doing your part for the Greater Good as we follow the federal order. The employees/students should follow the same PPE requirements as the clinical staff of the unit. As we are currently at Level Orange at UMMS, all (regardless of vaccination status) are required to wear a KN-95 mask and eye protection when in clinical areas. Effective October 1, 2021, all partners with staff or students who are routinely physically present at any UMMS facility are required to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 or have an approved exemption. Importantly, this approach brings our COVID-19 vaccination policy in line with those already set for influenza, measles and many other common vaccines that have long been required in our System.

Communication will be provided as it becomes available. - All schools will be asked to sign an addendum that they will have an exposure plan. It will need to be maintained and updated as situations change in the region or nationally. They will need to produce their plan upon request. The addendum will be then incorporated into any new education agreement or for renewals.
