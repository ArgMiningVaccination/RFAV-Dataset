In supporting both the separation of Consumer Healthcare (CH) and creation of new GSK, there have been three stages in our oversight work. The first was to ensure that there was clarity between the Board and management on GSK's strategy, its execution and, therefore, our key priorities. Then we focused on articulating our ambitions for a transformed GSK. This was completed for the biopharma business at the Investor Update (IU) in June 2021 and for the CH business at the end of February 2022. These ambitions will provide the foundation for enhanced performance management and a highly transparent way to track progress. The final stage has been to ensure the company's compensation system reinforces the performance culture that we are seeking to embed and only rewards delivery at and beyond our IU ambitions. The compensation system for CH will be determined by its new Board. Our work has also been focused on creating the best platform for our CH business to be demerged to grow sustainably ahead of its categories in the years to come. The mechanism of separation of CH is a value-based process and at all times the Board has regard for what is in the best long-term interests of shareholders. It has never been more important for the Board to operate to the highest standards of corporate governance in supporting and overseeing the delivery of GSK's transformation and the separation of CH. The Board continues to focus its work on our key priorities and on taking the important decisions necessary to progress them, and be held accountable for doing so by our shareholders and other key stakeholders. Throughout 2021, the Board has significantly stepped up its engagement with shareholders. During 2021, I held over 40 meetings with a range of investors, who make up around nearly 40% of the company's share register. It is of prime importance for the Board to have a clear understanding of their views on the company's performance against our strategy and the Board's effectiveness in oversight of the transformation and separation processes. I share shareholders' perspectives with the Board, so we can continue to improve our alignment. In October, Vindi Banga, the SID, and I attended a meeting with members of the Investor Forum at which we shared progress in preparing for the creation of new GSK as a pure biopharma company and the separation of the CH business. Included in this discussion were the plans and timings to create two boards with continuing oversight of the biopharma and CH businesses. In December, at our annual Governance Meeting, my Board colleagues and I were pleased to share more specifics with investors about our priorities, focus and oversight, as well as the progress made in 2021. The presentation slides from both these meetings are available on our website for your information. Urs Rohner, Chair of the Remuneration Committee, has also consulted extensively on the new compensation proposals for the biopharma business. This statement seeks to summarise the governance work undertaken by the Board and our committees, in what was another exceptionally busy year. The Board has maintained and continues to build on our ESG leadership which benefits the company, shareholders and all our stakeholders. Current Board accountability: Priorities and focus At the start of the year, following its annual evaluation, the Board reconfirmed its priorities. Namely to: -remain objective and act in the best interests of the company and all shareholders -put sustained value creation at the heart of our agenda -align the Board agenda with our strategy, performance and pipeline priorities -ensure management performance and succession is assessed against delivery -use the IU targets to provide the foundation for enhanced performance management -ensure that the separation of CH is a value-based process Being explicit on the Board's priorities has meant that we have been able to maximise our time and focus at each meeting on further strengthening the fundamentals for GSK which will support value creation. We have concentrated our oversight on commercial execution, cost base, capital allocation, pipeline and culture to ensure delivery of the transformation of GSK. This clarity has also helped underpin an increased agility in the way the Board has operated. You will see on page 94 that the Board, in combination with the Chairs' Committee, met over 36 times in 2021. We sought to improve our ability to respond quickly and adapt to events as they occur, whilst continuing to deliver our plans. The Chairs' Committee (comprised of our SID and Committee Chairs) has been authorised, where necessary, to engage and take decisions on urgent matters that arise between scheduled Board meetings. Being agile has been important in improving and sustaining our competitiveness so that, despite the challenging environment, we can continue to compete and deliver for patients and shareholders. 90 GSK Annual Report 2021Having set our strategy, the Board challenged the proposed new ambitions and targets for the biopharma business which were then agreed and published at our IU. These new growth outlooks and ambitions seek to be clear on the step change in performance expected from new GSK from 2022. The Board will oversee and hold management to account for delivery against these public ambitions. The Board adopted the same process of maximising value for GSK shareholders when considering the creation of CH as an independent, listed company (Haleon). We have focused on ensuring the business is well-positioned to grow sustainably ahead of its categories in the years to come and has a highly skilled management team to lead it. Having completed this work, the Board was well-positioned to consider the unsolicited, conditional and non-binding proposals received to acquire the CH business. In exercising its fiduciary duties, all proposals were considered but rejected by the Board as they were not in the best interests of shareholders. This is because they fundamentally undervalued the business and its future prospects. The Board is confident that Haleon can deliver sustained organic annual sales growth in the range of 4-6% (CER) over the medium term. We carefully considered how best to present our world-leading CH business and its management team to shareholders, analysts and prospective investors at the CH Capital Markets Day on 28 February. Management continues to make good progress towards our target to separate the CH business in the middle of the year, creating a publicly listed world-leading consumer health company. The Board's attention has been directed at overseeing the smooth execution of the demerger. Chair's Governance statement continued Current Board accountability Priorities and focus -Remain objective and act in the best interests of company and all shareholders -Commitment to drive sustained value creation -Board agenda aligned with strategy and performance and pipeline priorities -Management performance and succession assessed against delivery -Investor Update and targets provides foundation for enhanced performance management -Separation of Consumer Healthcare, to create Haleon, is a value-based process -Continuous engagement with shareholdersBoard Transformation & Separation Mandate: How to separate to unlock and maximise long-term shareholder value (Devolved into committee architecture in December 2021) Nominations & Corporate Governance Mandate: GSK Board design and transition, and Haleon Board and management team formation Science Mandate: Pipeline progress, Board strategic collaborations, key priorities in science and innovation Corporate Responsibility Mandate: GSK Trust priority for a responsible and sustainable business Audit & Risk Mandate: Financial reporting, risk and controls plus public documents delivering separation Remuneration Mandate: Alignment of GSK remuneration to Investor Update targets, Haleon's remuneration policy and separation impactGSK Annual Report 2021 91 Strategic report Governance and remuneration Financial statements Investor informationChair's Governance statement continued Board committee mandates Our Board committees have never been more pivotal in supporting the Board. Their activities during 2021 are set out later in this report, but I would like to highlight below their key contributions in discharging the mandates allocated to them during the last year. Transformation & Separation Committee: has dealt with the fundamentals of separation, not just the technical requirements, but how to best release and maximise long-term shareholder value. It considered: how we should best separate the CH business and the principal value to be achieved from each option; the capital structures required for the two companies to be competitive; how we should distribute shares in Haleon to our shareholders, and on which exchanges Haleon should list and why. This was a very comprehensive programme of work which was supported by independent advisers. This process is now well into the execution phase. Given the remaining work plans are clear, oversight has been devolved to the relevant committees as appropriate. Having fulfilled its mandate, the Committee has been decommissioned. Audit & Risk Committee: has in particular been considering the financial implications of separation, including the progressive dividend policy adopted for 2022, and the preparation of the demerger documents for shareholders to consider before approving the separation of the CH business. It has also been overseeing the establishment of CH's financial controls. Nominations & Corporate Governance Committee: has been overseeing key Board appointments for the transition of the company to a pure biopharma business. This included succession planning especially for the CSO, the subsequent appointment of Dr Tony Wood as our CSO Designate, and the appointment of Dr Anne Beal and Dr Hal Dietz to the Board as independent Non-Executive Directors. The Board asked the Committee to take the opportunity to re-evaluate and determine the optimal biopharma Board composition, including skills, diversity, capabilities and experience. On separation from the middle of this year, it is expected that two of the members from the current GSK Board will join the Haleon Board. This will ensure that the new Haleon Board will have continuity of the history, knowledge and experiences of this Board as the Haleon Board establishes itself in its early years. The Committee recommended the appointment of Sir Dave Lewis as Haleon Chair Designate in December, after an extensive search process. This followed the appointment of Brian McNamara as Haleon CEO Designate in July. Sir Dave is now responsible for building his full Haleon Board. Mr McNamara was pleased to introduce his management team to investors at the CH Capital Markets Day on 28 February 2022. Science Committee: continued its focus on our pipeline progress strategic collaborations and the key priorities in science and innovation. Corporate Responsibility Committee: focused its oversight on key aspects of our Trust priorities. The main areas of focus were our safety culture, inclusion and diversity, our charitable giving and community involvement and ESG performance for new GSK and the development of the ESG framework for the independent CH company, Haleon. Remuneration Committee: has revisited our remuneration policy to focus on reinforcing a fundamental change in our performance culture and to support the delivery of our IU ambitions and ESG priorities for the biopharma company. The Committee Chair and I have consulted extensively with our shareholders on this policy and it will be subject to a binding vote at this year's AGM. Further details of the Board and its committees' work during 2021 are set out in the following pages. I look forward to connecting with you at our Annual General Meeting this year in May and updating you at that time on the transformation of GSK and progress on the CH demerger.

This requires alignment of pension rates for executive directors with those available to the local workforce. From 1 January 2023 any current Executive Directors still in role will have their pension rates aligned to the wider workforce local to them. This will then replicate the pension arrangements for any new Executive Directors appointed to GSK. This transition was set out in the 2019 and 2020 Annual Reports. In addition, provision 38 requires that only base salary should be pensionable; however, US pension arrangements for employees allow basic salary and bonus to be pensionable. Following Dr Barron's transition to a Non-Executive Director with effect from 1 August 2022 this requirement will be met. The Board is also pleased to report that it has consistently applied the principles of the FRC's Code as set out in the pages of this and the Remuneration reports.

Items of business considered critical to GSK's long-term success through the achievement of the key priorities are highlighted below.Board activity96 GSK Annual Report 2021The Board and its committees have been highly focused on their key priorities and ensuring GSK's fundamentals continue to be enhanced. Board members' decision making on these significant matters included the consideration of the interests of GSK's key stakeholders and how decisions could potentially affect them. The papers considered by the Board and its committees sought to highlight the relevant stakeholder impacts of and perspective on these matters - whether positive or negative. Selected examples of some of the principal decisions taken by the Board in 2021, and how the Board considered relevant stakeholders' perspectives are described below: Progress area Principal decision How Board/Committee regarded stakeholder interestsStakeholder groups, and other section 172 duties considered Commercial executionChina: The Audit & Risk Committee recommended incremental changes to the commercial model in China to the Board for approval Further details are available on page 111The Committee reviewed GSK China's implementation of the healthcare professionals (HCP) speaker engagements and sales force incentive (SFI) policy changes to date.

In consideration of its duties, the Directors examined the importance of predictable returns, particularly in uncertain times As part of its deliberations, the Board carefully balanced the impact of and trade-offs between reducing the dividend against the importance of setting up new GSK with the right capital structure and the resources to invest, grow and improve shareholder returns over the longer term Ultimately, the Board determined that setting a progressive dividend policy in this way would support the investment needed to deliver growth, unlock further shareholder value and develop an even stronger pipeline of innovative products capable of transforming the lives of our patientsStakeholders: Investors, patients and our people Other s172 duties: Our long-term results, workforce and business relationships and reputation and fairness between our shareholders Pipeline Business development, collaborations and deals: The Science Committee considered the scientific merits of these opportunities prior to the Board's review and approval Further details are available on page 106The Science Committee and Board reviewed many business development opportunities during the year.

How the Board considered the interests of our stakeholders in its discussions and decision making in 2021 is set out in the: -Section 172 statement on page 116, and the sections it references in this Annual Report -principal decisions the Board and its committees made, on pages 96 to 98 Our stakeholders rightly have high expectations of us. Our dynamic operating environment presents many challenges and opportunities. The Board aims to make sure that remaining commercially successful is balanced and aligned with meeting our stakeholders' expectations, upholding our reputation, maintaining our licence to operate and building trust. The Board engages with many stakeholders, to ensure it identifies and responds to their expectations effectively. The influence and importance of different stakeholder groups can vary, depending on the matter being considered. Certain stakeholders' interests can be in conflict, meaning the Board needs to make balanced judgements. Stakeholder engagement and feedback helps us identify emerging issues. It also enables the Board to make decisions in the context of what is relevant and important to each of them. Our principal Board committees, and the GLT, undertake engagement on the Board's behalf in accordance with their remit. This means that they can build a detailed understanding of how our actions or plans are/or may impact stakeholders. These insights are shared with the Board, as appropriate. In particular, the Board receives a substantial amount of information about stakeholders' perspectives from the work of the Corporate Responsibility Committee, which is discussed on pages 104 and 105. Board members regularly receive: -the CEO's Board report -a specific external stakeholders report. This provides strategic insights based on an analysis of key developments, achievements and risks impacting our reputation and the perceptions of external stakeholders -a monthly investor relations report which summarises investor perceptions -regular corporate governance and litigation and regulatory updatesThe Board also learns of stakeholder views through: Engagement and feedback events such as: the quarterly investor results calls, the annual general meeting, employee survey reports, and through the Workforce Engagement Director's reports and experts presenting at Board or committee meetings. In particular, during 2021, the Investor Update and the Chair and SID's meeting with Investor Forum members provided additional sources of investor feedback. Other opportunities: to gain wider stakeholder views are provided during the annual strategy meeting with the GLT, as part of the annual budget and planning process, and in reviewing specific aspects of the company's policies or strategy. In addition, Board members are encouraged to meet individually with employees, shareholders and other key stakeholders during their induction, and then on an ongoing basis. They are encouraged to report to the Board on such experiences where relevant and material. Our people We have well-established and strong engagement mechanisms with our colleagues, which are described on pages 11 and 45. Two key governance channels help communicate what our people are thinking to the boardroom: -feedback from our global, as well as smaller, more targeted PULSE employee surveys -the work of our Workforce Engagement Director, Dame Vivienne Cox, who regularly gathers and explains colleagues' views to the Board, as she outlines below The Chair and other Non-Executive Directors also regularly meet our people around the Group and report back to the Board. As COVID-19 restrictions permitted during the year, they were pleased to meet with our employees in person, individually and in small groups, as well as continuing to meet virtually. The Chair, Workforce Engagement Director and Corporate Responsibility Committee Chair designate met with leaders of our employee resource groups (ERGs), for example, as part of a continuing dialogue about progress on our inclusion and diversity agenda, as well as on other issues that mattered to ERG members and employees. 2021 has been a significant year of change for our people. The Future Ready transformation programme has intensified and increased anticipation around the demerger of Consumer Healthcare and the shape of GSK. Ahead of this, PULSE surveys with smaller groups of employees have meant that the Board and GLT could check sentiment more quickly and frequently, and could provide valuable insights on the impact of major initiatives, events or communications.100 GSK Annual Report 2021This year, the Board and GLT spent more time in listening sessions with leaders and small groups of employees who have front-line roles across the company. This has helped to better understand the future of and build people's confidence in GSK - as well as testing and listening to feedback on the new purpose, strategy and culture. In 2021 Emma held more than 25 small group sessions with the workforce. The GLT cumulatively held more than 40 sessions specifically focused on new GSK. This provided rich feedback, which has helped shape internal communications and achieve record engagement levels, with 37,000 employees joining two live events.Post-event surveys show good progress is being made in explaining new GSK and building confidence, with less positive sentiment around how employees have been feeling. The Board is acutely aware that the pandemic has increased fatigue and reduced resilience for many of our people. This has reinforced the importance of prioritising and caring for our people and providing the support they need to be successful. The Board monitors this not only through employee engagement, but also with quarterly monitoring of how many employees are taking up support, how many are absent, and how many are leaving the company. The Board was pleased that the GLT chose to recognise every employee with a week's thank you pay award in recognition of resilience and strong delivery in extraordinary circumstances.Board's approach to continuous engagement continued This is my third year as Workforce Engagement Director. In this time, I have appreciated the chance to meet with different people across the company and to listen carefully to their views and perspectives. During the year, the engagements I have attended have continued to be virtual; however, I am very pleased that this has not prevented people from being very open and transparent in their discussions with me. Purpose, strategy and culture As I established the programme of visits at the start of 2021, I was conscious that it would be a year of significant change. The transformation programme to restructure the Group in advance of separation was launched in 2020. It has continued throughout 2021 and, with it, there has naturally been some uncertainty for our people. Therefore, I was keen to use my role to understand the impact of these changes on the organisation. Additionally, as the separation has been getting closer, it has raised questions in the minds of our people about the future shape of new GSK and the Consumer Healthcare business as a new listed company. In particular, I wanted to understand how the work done by the Board and the GLT to define a new purpose, strategy and embed a new simplified culture, which is discussed elsewhere in the Annual Report, was being experienced. Probably the most consistent message I have heard this year is the value people attach to working for a company with a strong sense of purpose and a clear strategy. Additionally, the people I have met are supportive of the new culture. They appreciate the simplicity and the clarity that it brings. I have continued, with Jon, our Chair, to engage with our diversity Employee Resource Groups (ERGs), specifically on the impact of the announcement of the company's public aspirations for improving ethnicity and gender representation in the workforce and leadership positions. Overall, their responses were positive while continuing to encourage the Board and GLT to intensify their efforts to support and promote diverse talent.Other engagement programme highlights I joined a Site Directors' and Site Quality Leaders' meeting comprising a group of employees who had recently been appointed to these roles. My meeting with them was part of a longer induction programme they undertake. I took part in the session where they discussed the impact of the new culture on their roles. They stressed the importance of ensuring continuous improvement at their sites. In the mid-point of 2021, I met with HR leaders and I was impressed by their energy and commitment, through to and beyond separation. It was clear that their focus on People, Culture, Leadership and Capability would be key to supporting an environment where people can thrive, and additionally how important the new simplified HR systems and operating model would be to ensuring quality support for all our people. The 'Ahead Together' session was an ambitious and well- received two-day digital event which brought together 1,500 employees from around the world. The objective was to share thinking and progress on the launch of two new companies and exchange ideas about the opportunities that lie ahead. Finally, I spent time with a group of high potential Commercial employees from the Greater China and Intercontinental region who were completing a virtual development programme. We discussed their key learnings, which were the importance of developing resilience and building trust. After each meeting with an employee group, I share my thoughts and observations with the leaders and the Board on a non-attributable basis. Perhaps the most valuable aspect is that on an ongoing basis, those views and perspectives can be factored into the Board and GLT discussions and decision making. Dame Vivienne Cox Workforce Engagement Director 28 February 2022Workforce Engagement DirectorGSK Annual Report 2021 101 Strategic report Governance and remuneration Financial statements Investor informationOur shareholders The Board seeks to directly engage with private retail and institutional shareholders in several ways. These include regular communications, the Annual General Meeting and our annual Governance Meeting, and through the work of our Investor Relations team, the Chair, Sir Jonathan Symonds and our Company Secretary, Victoria Whyte. During the year, our CEO, Emma Walmsley, and CFO, Iain Mackay, gave quarterly results presentations to institutional investors, analysts and the media by webcast teleconference. They are also regularly joined by the CSO, the Chief Commercial Officer, CEO, ViiV Healthcare, President Global Vaccines and the CEO, GSK Consumer Healthcare. They are available to provide more detailed insights into their areas of responsibility. Through regular meetings, Emma and Iain have an ongoing and active dialogue with institutional shareholders about our performance, plans and objectives. In 2021 the CEO held 56 individual meetings with major shareholders and hosted 32 group meetings with actual and potential major shareholders. The CFO held 84 individual meetings and 46 group meetings. The Chair has always maintained an active dialogue with shareholders too - including fund and portfolio managers - as well as seeing governance professionals. During 2021 the Chair held 43 meetings with a range of investors, who make up nearly 40% of the company's share register. This enables him to have a current understanding of investor views, insights and perspectives about the company. He also covers with investors, Board succession planning arrangements in his capacity as Chair of the Nominations & Corporate Governance Committee. The Chair, CEO and the rest of the Board had a particular focus in 2021 on communicating our plans about the demerger to shareholders and the future ambitions for GSK as a biopharma business. As part of this extensive outreach, in June the CEO and other members of the GLT hosted a virtual Investor Update to provide a clear view of the strategy for GSK and its outlook for growth and ambitions. In October at an Investor Forum-hosted event, and in December at the annual Governance Meeting, the Chair provided an update on how the Board and its committees have aligned their work to drive the demerger and establish key governance workstreams to support delivering it and to focus GSK's future as a biopharma business. Investor materials for these events are available on gsk.com.Board's approach to continuous engagement continued Annual Governance Meeting This year's event was virtual with institutional shareholders, key investment industry bodies and proxy advisory firms. The Chair was joined by our Senior Independent Director, Workforce Engagement Director, Committee Chairs and GSK's external audit partner. We shared with investors the priorities and focus of the Board and its committees and progress made in 2021. This included a continued focus on strengthening the fundamentals of the business, maintaining ESG leadership, strong oversight of progress towards separation to create a world-leading Consumer Healthcare company and the new growth outlooks and ambitions set for GSK to deliver a step-change in performance from 2022. The Remuneration Committee Chair shared details of the Committee's review of executive remuneration arrangements for GSK ahead of separation. This included an updated GSK policy, focused on reinforcing the delivery of the public performance ambitions set out in the IU in June 2021 and delivery of our public ESG commitments. This will be submitted to a binding shareholder vote at the 2022 AGM. The Workforce Engagement Director discussed her programme of engagements to gather and help the Board further understand our people's perspectives on our new purpose, strategy and the new simplified culture and the CH demerger. The meeting was well received and shareholder feedback was shared subsequently with the rest of the Board. Annual General Meeting Due to restrictions on public gatherings in light of the COVID-19 situation at the time, shareholders were unable to physically attend the 2021 AGM held at our registered office in Brentford. Therefore, our priority was to seek to provide live electronic access to the AGM for as many shareholders as possible. Our aim was to promote a similar type of meaningful engagement with the Board as would occur at a conventional AGM. Pleasingly, 142 shareholders joined the meeting electronically to watch or listen to updates from our Chair and the CEO, to ask questions, and vote. All our proposed resolutions were approved by shareholders, with majorities ranging from 93% to 99%. It is intended that our AGM in May 2022 will be held at the Sofitel London Heathrow Hotel and will use a hybrid format to allow our shareholders the flexibility to attend, ask questions and vote either in person or electronically. See further details on page 291. 102 GSK Annual Report 2021Board-led purpose and culture The Board's role is to promote GSK's sustainable success, drive long-term growth for shareholders and value for stakeholders. Our strategic report on pages 1 to 81 demonstrates how we work to achieve these goals. Our Corporate Governance report on pages 83 to 118 explains how our governance arrangements support our oversight of the strategic transformation into two separate businesses, as well as our new ambitions for patients and shareholders. This work will be supported by our renewed company culture. The Board is responsible for setting the Group's overall purpose and culture. This is fundamental to conducting our business to the highest standards, promoting long-term success and unlocking, protecting and maximising value for shareholders. In the four years Emma Walmsley has been CEO, the Board has worked to change our culture. While always being guided by our purpose and values, our culture is moving to one that works more effectively towards our long-term strategic priorities: Innovation, Performance, Trust. The Board saw the momentum and ambition around the two new businesses in 2021 as a unique opportunity to unify our people behind one purpose, one strategy and one culture. Our new purpose is to unite science, talent and technology to get ahead of disease. We have a clear ambition to make an even more meaningful impact on human health and create better, more sustainable returns. We want to do this in an environment that allows outstanding people to thrive. For the Board, 'getting ahead' means preventing disease as well as treating it. It means innovating by combining ideas, capabilities and know-how inside and outside GSK. Our focus for R&D is to deliver new vaccines and medicines using the science of the immune system, human genetics and advanced technologies. And we do this making a deep commitment to our stakeholders to operate responsibly. Essential to these plans is embedding a new, simplified culture, one in which we: -are ambitious for patients, by delivering what matters better and faster -are accountable for impact, by having clear ownership and the support to succeed -do the right thing, by working with integrity and care and understanding that people count on us The Board's discussions during the year focused on the new purpose and culture centred on: -the rationale for this change -a review of employee engagement and feedback when trialling this change -the next steps the Board and GLT needed to take to make this change real for our peopleTo more clearly identify where we are making progress - and where we need to make changes - the Board and GLT have changed how we track and measure this culture change. We are now using more insights, measuring more frequently, being more responsive and making this information easier to access. This will help drive progress in the short-term and make significant change over the long-term. For further details see page 11. The Board was also briefed on the proposed new mission, strategy and culture for Haleon. Its culture will be focused on three behaviours: -Go beyond -Do what matters most -Keep it human These are described in more detail on page 43 and were launched formally by the Haleon Chair and CEO Designates at their Capital Markets Day on 28 February 2022. The Board will also support GSK's new culture by appointing and promoting the right people, upholding and incentivising the right behaviours with strong governance controls and thorough processes, and training and developing employees. The Board recognises that the 'tone from the top' drives a company's culture. The Board and GLT must be role models and lead by example, using their words, actions and behaviours to set the template for our people. Like all our people, members of the Board take the following key training and awareness modules: -Living our values and expectations, which explores our values, expectations and culture and how they apply to our operations and ways of working -Anti-bribery and corruption -Inclusion and diversity For more detail about our new, single definition of culture, and how we invest in and reward our people, see pages 11 and 37. The Board also remains committed to getting ahead of issues that matter for the sustainability of our company, be it pricing and access, the environment, or stronger diversity and inclusion. More progress in these areas is set out on pages 34 to 40 of our strategic report and in our ESG Performance Report, available on gsk.com. Our Code of Conduct embodies our values, so the Board reviews and refreshes it regularly. It is available on gsk.com. Our corporate standards and employee policies are aligned with our values. They include our long-standing Speak Up system, which enables our people to raise matters confidentially or anonymously without fear of reprisal. The Board, through the Audit & Risk Committee, reviews Speak Up reports provided by our Legal and Compliance team. Our Speak Up channels and reports are managed by an independent third party, with cases then investigated by Legal and Compliance.GSK Annual Report 2021 103 Strategic report Governance and remuneration Financial statements Investor informationBoard performance The Board evaluates its performance, and that of its committees, every year and is facilitated externally at least once every three years. External evaluations were facilitated in 2019 and 2020 by Jan Hall of No 4, a business advisory company. In 2021, the Board and Committee evaluation process was a composite of three key assessments. First, Korn Ferry conducted interviews with each Board Director to elicit their views on the ideal future composition of the Board. Directors were provided in advance with information on peer company Board composition and committees as an input to these discussions. The conversations with Board Directors covered a range of topics including: -The key challenges and opportunities for GSK over the next five years (eg science, M&A, China, areas of management strength and support) -The culture of GSK -Which skills and experience to prioritise in recruiting new Non-Executive Directors to the Board. The imperatives and desirable attributes were considered against the strategic opportunities that lie ahead and -The workings of Board committees and how they obtained external input The findings formed the basis for the transition plan and optimal composition of the new GSK Board. The Nominations & Corporate Governance Committee report on page 107 explains how the results of this work are being taken forward. The next step followed the annual Board and GLT strategy meeting, when Non-Executive Directors formed three groups to discuss their thoughts on the day's discussions. They agreed their key insights and priorities. These were then debated by the Board the next day. The conclusions reached were incorporated into the Board's priorities for action in 2022. Finally, Non-Executive Directors completed a short questionnaire on the performance of the Board and its committees during the year. The responses were collated and summarised before being considered by the Board. The Board then agreed updated priorities for the year ahead which encapsulated the actions identified at each stage of the evaluation process. In addition, it was agreed to use the annual Strategy meeting of the Board and GLT in the Autumn of 2022 to reset and recalibrate the Board for the future as new GSK. Board committees The review of the Board committees involved questionnaires being completed by committee members. Each committee was considered to operate effectively. To enhance their performance further, the following improvement points were agreed: -Corporate Responsibility: to continue to bring direct external stakeholder perspectives into the Committee's discussions to provoke quality debate in respect of the company's Trust priority -Audit & Risk: to continue to balance the Committee's work between current issues and longer term perspectives. The Committee would also continue to seek more focused materials to enhance its oversight further -Remuneration: to bring more external perspectives on changing remuneration practice and trends to the Committee's attention to ensure it remained contemporary in its thinking -Nominations & Corporate Governance: to focus on delivery of the transition plan to create the optimal composition for the new GSK Board -Science: to continue to support the CSO and his leadership team whilst providing its perspectives and opinions on R&D's work Chair The SID sought feedback from each of the Directors on the performance of the Board and Chair. The unanimous view was that the Board is functioning very effectively and has been continually strengthened; and the Chair has provided excellent leadership throughout an important and eventful year. Board culture was very inclusive and purposeful in focusing on the really important issues of strategy, performance and talent. Progress on 2020 Board evaluation Progress against the conclusions of the 2020 Board evaluation review is set out below. Areas of focus for 2021 Progress/achievements Consideration had and would continue to be given to stop any unnecessary tasks to free more time to focus on the priorities with the pre-condition that creating shareholder value was of prime importanceBoard priorities were agreed and adhered to in structuring Board discussions. Key priorities were the key driver in examining performance and transactions. This would remain a key focus. Consideration would also be given to making the best use of the Board's time during virtual meetings and incorporating opportunities for 'unstructured discussions' where possibleThere was increased use of break-out sessions to focus on and bring different perspectives to particular issues. In October, to facilitate greater in person interaction despite ongoing COVID-19 restrictions, the Board, committee and annual strategy meetings were held at dual sites in the UK and US. The Chair led the meeting in the UK for UK/European-based Directors and the CEO led the meeting for US-based Directors. In addition, specific time was set aside for GLT members to meet with Board members without a set objective or agenda. These discussions were greatly appreciated by all and a welcome opportunity to connect. The Science Committee would look to further deepen its understanding of how R&D's resources were allocatedThe Board and Science Committee meeting agendas were designed to facilitate these deeper dives in line with Board's agreed key priorities. See page 106 There was a desire to further enhance root cause analysis that was undertaken when incidents or issues occurred. This was to ensure they could be avoided in the future and as part of the Group's approach to further improving performanceThis enhanced approach was the foundation of the global safety review. 104 GSK Annual Report 2021Board committee reports Corporate Responsibility Committee report Lynn Elsenhans Corporate Responsibility Committee I am pleased to present this report, which will be my sixth and final one as Chair of the Corporate Responsibility Committee (the Committee). Role of the Committee The Committee oversees GSK's Trust priority and the company's progress against our Trust commitments, which reflect the most important areas for responsible and sustainable business growth. Our Trust priority covers management's work across ESG factors, and it is integral to GSK's overall strategy. The Committee has oversight of the views and interests of our internal and external stakeholders and reviews issues that could seriously impact GSK's business and reputation. In doing so, the Committee has continued to oversee: -progress on our Trust commitments through regular reports from GLT members and senior managers -GSK's approach to managing the risks and opportunities associated with ESG factors that help create value for shareholders and society -management understanding of key issues and stakeholder perspectives by listening directly to key independent expert voices and -the principal risks most relevant to its area of expertise and responsibility, namely: product quality, non-promotional engagement, supply continuity, environmental sustainability and health and safety Key activities in 2021 Safety culture: The Committee reviewed progress on the delivery of a global safety improvement plan across GSK's businesses developed after a comprehensive and far-reaching external evaluation of our safety culture. In reviewing the actions for embedding and sustaining the plan's safety improvements into the future, the Committee has encouraged a strong focus on: -education and training to further build capabilities; while -ensuring there is clear accountability from leaders for safety through heightened awareness and application of GSK's simplified culture to \"do the right thing with integrity and care because people count on us\"Inclusion & diversity (I&D): The Committee continued to assess the progress of GSK's I&D strategy and commitments. This has included in particular, implementation of changes to HR processes and monitoring arrangements needed to support the delivery of the aspirational diversity targets announced in last year's Annual Report. The Committee considered key requirements of strengthening succession planning arrangements for diverse talent and the application of the broad concept of 'equity' in the workplace to further evolve the I&D strategy. I&D is an incredibly important part of the culture at GSK and the Committee reviews and supports the comprehensive annual I&D training and awareness session undertaken by the Board and all our people. Charitable giving: GSK has had a tremendous and longstanding commitment to charitable giving and community involvement. The Committee reviewed this existing approach and how GSK compares to its peers. It considered how to leverage this approach to align to GSK's core purpose, strategy and culture and encouraged its impact to be measured in terms of its contribution to the commitment announced at the Investor Update in June, to positively impact the health of over 2.5 billion people over the next ten years. ESG performance for new GSK: The Committee reviewed management plans for the six areas of ESG focus for new GSK, outlined to investors by the company in June 2021. Working with the Audit & Risk and Remuneration Committees, the Committee reviewed management's proposals for specific metrics to measure progress on these six areas and the recommendation of the creation of a single ESG performance rating assessment as a KPI for GSK after the demerger. It also reviewed an approach for the risk management and governance oversight arrangements to measure and report ESG performance. The Committee was pleased to support these changes to help retain and develop further GSK's ESG leadership position. Consumer Healthcare (CH): In preparation for the demerger, the Committee has reviewed and discussed with CH management their progress in developing a distinctive and holistic responsible business and ESG framework that would support its purpose, strategy and culture on becoming a listed company with a focus on the key responsible business issues for the new company. In doing so, the Committee scrutinised this framework and the proposed targets, including environmental sustainability targets, which have incorporated key insights and expectations gathered from investors, analysts and other external stakeholders. Stakeholder insights and benchmarking The Committee pays close attention to the evolving views and expectations of the company's broad range of key stakeholders. It receives a regular report on stakeholder insights at each meeting to ensure it considers the issues that may have a bearing on GSK's reputation and the delivery of our responsible business agenda. Employee insights and feedback were discussed in relation to the progression of the company's modern employer agenda.GSK Annual Report 2021 105 Strategic report Governance and remuneration Financial statements Investor informationIn keeping with a desire to continually bring external perspectives into the Committee room, in 2021 the Committee benefited from direct engagement and insights about expectations of our sector and the company specifically in two areas. Firstly, was receiving an expert's insights on investor views on ESG trends and expectations, the outcomes of which are reported on page 98. Secondly, was gathering expert views on the rising expectations of governments and investors for businesses to understand Human Rights impacts and risks. The Committee monitors investor expectations on ESG reporting and disclosure on an ongoing basis. GSK continues to align to best practice in reporting, in accordance with the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (see 2021 ESG Performance Report) and the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (see page 49). In addition, the Committee monitors the company's ESG performance in various indices and in relation to our peers. In this respect, we were particularly pleased that GSK was ranked first in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index in the pharmaceutical industry group, had improved our Carbon CDP rating from B to A-, and was rated in the top 3% of Sustainalytics' pharmaceuticals sub group. These and other external benchmarks help to evidence GSK's acknowledged leadership in ESG, and this continues to be a key driver in the goal to deliver health impact and shareholder returns. Committee aims for 2022 The Committee will continue to scrutinise and monitor progress on GSK's material Trust topics and relevant enterprise risks. As the company demerges, it will focus on oversight for how GSK is embedding its new approach to ESG performance measurement. Corporate Responsibility Committee Chair succession I was delighted to welcome Dr Anne Beal, who has brought extensive healthcare experience to the Board and our Committee as a physician and public health expert, in May 2021. Since then, Anne and I have been working on a smooth transition and handover before she succeeds me as Committee Chair at the conclusion of the AGM in May. I will continue to serve as a Committee member to provide continuity and support, until I retire and step down from the Board at the conclusion of the demerger later this year. It has been my privilege to serve as a member of the Board, to chair this Committee and help shape and oversee, in particular, the development and embedding of a framework of a focused set of commitments to support the company's Trust priority and our approach as a responsible business. Listening carefully to all the views of our stakeholders has helped to inform the positive steps we have taken in reinforcing our position as a leader in ESG. Lynn Elsenhans Corporate Responsibility Committee Chair 28 February 2022Science Committee report Dr Jesse Goodman Science Committee I am pleased to present my fifth report of the Science Committee's (the Committee) activities. Key activities in 2021 Since the Committee's inception in 2017, we have continued to refine our focus to provide greater value to the Board's deliberations. In particular, the Committee has focused on ensuring the validity of the key scientific assumptions which drive the company's R&D strategy, as well as providing technical assurance, particularly in relation to potential transactions. Pipeline progress At the start of the year the Committee closely reviewed the 2021 objectives for the biopharma business, including those relating to pipeline progression. Delivering a pipeline to help patients is at the heart of what GSK does and the Committee monitors its progression closely, both in terms of strategy and performance. The Committee has held a number of discussions with Dr Hal Barron, our CSO, and with R&D leaders throughout the year and has been encouraged with the progress made as we approach separation. Since the separation was announced in 2018, R&D's strategy has delivered a strong pipeline of assets with the potential to bring transformational vaccines and medicines to patients. Some of the most notable approvals in the last year include: -Jemperli (dostarlimab) - for the treatment of endometrial cancer, the most common female reproductive cancer. This is another major milestone for GSK's oncology pipeline and has the potential to transform the lives of women who previously had limited treatment options. -Cabenuva (cabotegravir, rilpivirine) - the first long-acting injectable treatment for HIV. Cabenuva has the potential to transform HIV care for patients by reducing treatment dosing days from 365 to 12 per year. In addition, Apretude received FDA approval in December 2021 as the first long-acting injectable option for HIV prevention. In November 2021, the company announced positive phase III data for daprodustat, a potential new oral treatment for patients with anaemia of chronic kidney disease. COVID-19 Regarding our pipeline of COVID-19 solutions, Xevudy (sotrovimab), a monoclonal antibody developed in collaboration with Vir Biotechnology, was approved in Europe and received Emergency Use Authorisation in the US as a treatment for patients with COVID-19. Studies show that Xevudy also retains activity against the Omicron variant. In terms of vaccines, GSK has announced positive phase III results for the plant-based COVID-19 vaccine candidate being developed with Medicago. This vaccine, Covifenz, was approved in Canada in February 2022. In February 2022, we also announced the intention to seek regulatory authorisation for the COVID-19 vaccine being developed with Sanofi, based on data from both booster and phase III efficacy trials. Our Board committee reports continued106 GSK Annual Report 2021In February 2021, we also reported a collaboration with CureVac to jointly develop next generation mRNA vaccines for COVID-19 with the potential to address emerging variants. Scientific deep-dives Innovation remains a key priority for GSK. Therefore, the Committee has continued to meet with the CSO and our talented R&D leadership to undertake deep-dives into some of the exciting and complex areas of science that are of strategic importance to GSK, including: -Immunology -Oncology with a focus on Synthetic Lethality -Vaccines mRNA Strategy The science of the immune system is a key pillar of our R&D strategy. It will be leveraged to develop novel therapeutics as well as potentially revolutionise drug discovery and development. GSK's partnership with 23andMe provides the company with exclusive insights in this field which represents an enormous opportunity for R&D to build on a strong existing portfolio. The Committee was pleased to see how immunology has already been embedded across GSK R&D, including within oncology, vaccines, ViiV and infectious diseases. Business development In addition to oversight of the company's organic R&D innovation, the Committee has continued to review potential business development transactions. The Committee receives regular previews of potential business development opportunities being explored and undertakes in-depth technical reviews of transactions prior to their presentation to the Board. These transactions have added new programmes which aim to differentiate GSK's pipeline from competitors and support organic development within the company. Key transactions reviewed by the Committee during the year include: iTeos: The collaboration with iTeos to co-develop an anti-TIGIT monoclonal antibody. With this collaboration GSK is well- positioned to produce next-generation immuno-oncology therapies, especially those targeting the CD226 axis. Alector: The collaboration to develop two potential first-in-class monoclonal antibodies for a range of neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals: The exclusive licence agreement with Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals, under which GSK will develop and commercialise Arrowhead's investigational RNAi therapeutic being developed as a treatment for patients with chronic liver disease. Halozyme Therapeutics: The global collaboration and license agreement between ViiV Healthcare and Halozyme, granting exclusive access to Halozyme's ENHANZE drug delivery technology to enable development of ultra long-acting medicines for HIV. Shionogi: The exclusive license agreement between ViiV Healthcare and Shionogi to develop a third-generation HIV integrase inhibitor with potential for use in ultra long-acting HIV regimens. Enhanced R&D governance The Committee has been particularly impressed with developments in R&D governance since Dr Barron was appointed in 2018. During 2021, Vaccines and Pharma R&D were fully united into a single organisation. This has enabled R&D to be more effective, not just in terms of efficiencies but also in the sharing of technical and scientific expertise. The benefits of these governance enhancements have already become apparent with improvements made in both cycle times across clinical development and the probability of success from pivotal studies. Three and a half years ago, management set out a new approach to R&D. Under Dr Barron's leadership our pipeline in 2021 stands out as having advanced notably. During 2022, the Committee will emphasise the need to continue this momentum up to and beyond separation. Board and Committee changes We welcomed Dr Hal Dietz to the Committee on 1 January 2022. His experience in the field of human genetics will add significant value to the Committee's discussions. His appointment also means that the Committee is very well- rounded in the areas of expertise required to evaluate GSK's strategy, pipeline and potential business development targets. Judy Lewent left the Committee upon her retirement from the Board after the 2021 AGM. Charles Bancroft joined the Committee in May 2021 until February 2022 following the appointment of Dr Dietz. The Committee participated in the CSO succession planning and was fully supportive of Tony Wood's appointment. We are pleased that Dr Barron will join the Committee in August when he transitions to a Non-Executive Director. Dr Jesse Goodman Science Committee Chair 28 February 2022Our Board committee reports continuedGSK Annual Report 2021 107 Strategic report Governance and remuneration Financial statements Investor informationNominations & Corporate Governance Committee report Jonathan Symonds Nominations & Corporate Governance Committee I am pleased to present my third report as Chair of the Nominations & Corporate Governance Committee (the Committee). Key activities in 2021 The Committee played an important role in delivering our key priorities to transform GSK and separate the CH business. The Committee met 13 times during the year and this report sets out our work during 2021. Key priorities Status Succession planning for the CSO and his R&D Leadership TeamCSO succession candidate identified and subsequently appointed CSO Designate Appoint a Chair of the Corporate Responsibility Committee to succeed Lynn Elsenhans Dr Anne Beal joined the Board in May 2021 Appoint a third Scientific & Medical Expert (SME) Dr Hal Dietz joined the Board in January 2022 Design target GSK Board composition and recruit high calibre Non-Executives to complete the new GSK biopharma BoardTarget GSK Board composition agreed and search for new Non-Executive Directors for GSK in progress Appoint the Haleon CEO and assemble an appropriately seasoned management team Appoint a Chair for Haleon and support the composition of the Haleon Board Brian McNamara appointed as Haleon CEO Designate in July 2021. Haleon Management Team announced in December 2021 Sir Dave Lewis appointed Haleon Chair Designate in December 2021. Selection of the remaining Haleon Board in progress Shaping the GSK Board for the future Management succession planning The Committee, with all Non-Executive Directors present, continuously assess the succession plans for management and the other Executive Directors to ensure we have appropriate succession plans and a diverse pipeline of potential successors in place. During 2021, given the importance of the CSO and leadership of R&D, the Committee, in collaboration with the CEO, and as appropriate the CSO, intensified our planning to identify a potential CSO succession candidate. The Committee was supported by the Chief People Officer (CPO) and the Science Committee. The Committee followed a comprehensive process before making a recommendation as described below. This is replicated in assessing succession candidates. The Committee and the Science Committee reviewed a diverse long list of internal and external potential successor candidates from which a short list of candidates was compiled. These were interviewed by Science Committee members, the Chair, CEO, CPO and CSO. The Committee was joined by all the Non- Executive Directors to review the final candidates. Following this extensive process, the Non-Executive Directors agreed to identify Dr Tony Wood as the CSO's successor. The CPO, CEO, CSO and Dr Wood then established a transition plan which was approved by the Committee to ensure a smooth transition should it become necessary. In January 2022, the Board activated the succession plan following Dr Barron's decision to accept the position of CEO and Co-Chair of Altos Labs from August 2022. Since Dr Wood has been a key partner to Dr Barron in delivering GSK's R&D approach, and has wide experience and expertise across science data and new technologies, he is perfectly placed to build on Dr Barron's outstanding progress and to deliver value from the pipeline. The Board therefore agreed to appoint Dr Tony Wood as CSO Designate and he will succeed Dr Barron as CSO and become a member of the GLT on 1 August 2022. Further details of his background can be found on page 5 and in the company's announcement issued on 19 January 2022 which is available on gsk.com. The Committee also recommended as part of the CSO transition plan that Dr Barron be appointed a Non-Independent Non-Executive Director and member of the Science Committee with effect from 1 August 2022, initially for a three-year term. This would support the CSO transition process. Corporate Responsibility Committee Chair In my 2020 report, I described the search for Lynn's successor as Chair of the Corporate Responsibility Committee (CRC). This resulted in Dr Anne Beal's appointment to the Board on 6 May. Anne has brought extensive healthcare experience as a physician and entrepreneur, combined with a passion for patient advocacy. Further details of her experience and the rationale for her appointment are included in the company's announcement on 6 April 2021 which is available on gsk.com. A transition process is underway to enable Anne to succeed Lynn as CRC Chair at the close of the 2022 AGM. Despite serving for over nine years, Lynn's experience as a CEO and from sitting on other boards means that she continues to demonstrate all the characteristics of independence expected by the Board in carrying out her role on the Board. Third Scientific Medical Expert (SME) I am pleased to confirm that the search for a third SME was successfully concluded. We continued to fine-tune the selection criteria as the process evolved and considered the following: -An outlook on the future direction of R&D, innovation and the treatment and management of human health -Experience of people leadership and management at 'scale', either in an academic or industry setting -Interested in, and having a deep understanding of, a breadth of scientific and therapeutic areas, particularly in immunology as well as genomics and genetics.

Highly collaborative and a willingness to engage proactively on topics beyond their own immediate realm of expertiseOur Board committee reports continued108 GSK Annual Report 2021Our Board committee reports continued The Committee was pleased to recommend the appointment of Dr Hal Dietz to the Board with effect from 1 January 2022. Dr Dietz brings his extensive experience in the field of human genetics, which is central to GSK's approach to R&D and will add further strength to the Science Committee and Board discussions. Further details of Hal's experience and the rationale for his appointment are included in the company's announcement on 27 October 2021, which is available on gsk.com. Transition to a new GSK Board In planning the structure of the new GSK Board as an independent biopharma company, the Committee commissioned Korn Ferry to meet with each Board member to gather their views on the optimal Board design for the future. Further details on this process are given on page 103. A skills matrix was developed which mapped current Board members' skills and capabilities and the succession planning needs for the Board. This was discussed with all Non-Executive Directors and the key capabilities were further refined and a final target skills matrix was agreed. The Committee then agreed the briefs to initiate the search for three new Non-Executive Directors to be appointed to the Board in the next 12 to 18 months. The Committee is following its search process to recruit for these roles. Long lists of candidates for both roles have been considered. Haleon Board appointments The Committee appointed a sub-Committee comprising, the Chair, Vindi Banga, Dame Vivienne Cox, Dr Beal and Mr Rohner, to progress Haleon Board appointments. It then reported progress at each scheduled Committee meeting. Final decisions were reached by the Committee with all Non-Executive Directors invited to participate. Haleon CEO and CFO: The Committee conducted an extensive global search and selection process to appoint the Haleon CEO and CFO designates. This work followed the Committee's search process. In particular, the CEO role profile contained the key selection criteria and responsibilities the successful candidate would need to fulfil most especially after the demerger. These emphasised the importance of establishing the new Haleon Board to deliver the growth strategy and to drive significant shareholder value. This would require a relentless focus on innovation, promoting a high performance and inclusive culture whilst also operating to the exacting standards of corporate governance. Following interviews by Board members with internal and external candidates, the Board was pleased to endorse the Committee's recommendation to appoint Brian McNamara as Haleon CEO Designate. The Board noted in particular Brian's strong track record of success in building the CH business and his considerable experience of FMCG and consumer health. This meant that he was uniquely suited and the right choice to unlock the growth potential of Haleon as an independent listed company. Further details of Brian's experience and the rationale for his appointment are included in the company's announcement on 22 July 2021, which is available on gsk.com.The Committee reviewed Brian's proposed leadership team for Haleon (in particular the proposed CFO and Chief People Officer) which was announced in December 2021. Following extensive internal and external searches for each role, shortlisted candidates were interviewed by the relevant panel of Non-Executive Directors against the agreed role criteria. The Committee then approved the final appointees. The Haleon management team was then introduced to investors at the CH Capital Markets Day on 28 February 2022. Haleon Chair: The Committee followed its search process to select the Haleon Chair. This search focused on candidates with the following knowledge, experience and commitment: -Significant listed Board experience with an understanding of investors, analysts, banks, regulators and governments -A high degree of financial acumen and successful business track record in creating shareholder value and growing businesses -A strong emphasis on coaching skills and the ability to create a high-performance environment -Deep experience of consumer facing businesses, with a high degree of customer-centricity. International experience, preferably in the US and China -Strong strategic skills and a track record of innovative thinking, coaching and development -Be well respected and have high credibility with all stakeholders, including investors, capital market participants, regulators and governments -Have high integrity, strong values and be driven by a strong sense of purpose -Understand the role of a Chair of a FTSE 100 -Possession of humility and a subdued ego and a strong emotional commitment and passion for the CH business -Be committed to diversity in all its forms, resilient and open- minded with strong judgement as well as a natural team builder The Committee agreed that Sir Dave Lewis, a highly experienced and respected global business leader in consumer goods and retail, was the most suitable candidate to lead the Haleon Board. It was noted that at the time of his selection he was deemed to meet the independence requirements of the Code. The Committee's recommendation was subsequently endorsed by the full Board. Further details of Sir Dave's experience and the rationale for his appointment are included in the company's announcement on 20 December 2021, which is available on gsk.com. Sir Dave is now progressing the search for high calibre non- executive directors to build the Haleon Board. To ensure continuity, it is expected that two Non-Executive members of the GSK Board will transfer to the Haleon Board on completion of the demerger. The company's CH joint venture partner (Pfizer) has the right to appoint up to two Non-Executive Directors. The new Haleon Board will be announced publicly later in the year as part of demerger arrangements. GSK Annual Report 2021 109 Strategic report Governance and remuneration Financial statements Investor informationWays of working The Committee seeks to follow best practice in all the appointments it recommends, agreeing the criteria for each role, the most appropriate interview panel, before then considering a comprehensive and diverse long list of candidates. Shortlisted candidates are interviewed and assessed against the chosen criteria. Due diligence is then undertaken before the Committee makes its final recommendation. Executive search firms are appointed in accordance with the company's procurement policy based on their expertise relative to each role. The Committee has agreed that only search firms who were signatories to the Voluntary Code of Conduct of Executive Search Firms on gender diversity and best practice would be engaged. The Committee worked with a number of executive search firms in 2021 who provided additional consultancy services to the company as outlined below: -Korn Ferry: general recruitment, executive search and assessment services, coaching and other HR-related services -Egon Zehnder: executive search, assessment and coaching services to specific senior executives -Heidrick & Struggles: executive search services -Spencer Stuart: executive search and assessment services The Committee reviewed the potential for conflicts of interest and judged that there were appropriate safeguards against such conflicts.Our Board committee reports continued Board Committee Chair and GLT membership changes During the year and up to the date of this report, the Committee approved the following changes to the membership of our Board committees and GLT. Director Membership Appointment date Retirement date Charles Bancroft Chair of Audit & Risk Committee Chair Member of Nominations & Corporate Governance, and Science committees 9 March 2021 6 May 2021 8 February 2022 (stepped down from Science Committee after Dr Hal Dietz joined the Committee) Dr Anne Beal Member of Corporate Responsibility and Audit & Risk committees 6 May 2021 23 July 2021 Dr Hal Dietz Member of Science Committee 1 January 2022 Judy Lewent Chair of Audit & Risk Committee Chair Member of Audit & Risk, Nominations & Corporate Governance, Remuneration, Science and Transformation & Separation committees9 March 2021 5 May 2021 Lynn Elsenhans Chair of Corporate Responsibility Committee Member of Audit & Risk, Corporate Responsibility and Nominations & Corporate Governance committees4 May 2022 After CH Demerger Dr Anne Beal Chair of Corporate Responsibility Committee 4 May 2022 Shobie Ramakrishnan Chief Digital and Technology Officer and member of GLT 16 December 2021 Board composition, tenure and diversity The Board seeks to balance its composition and tenure and that of its Committees, and to refresh them over time. This enables the Board to benefit from the experience of longer- serving Directors and the fresh perspectives and insights from newer appointees. Our Non-Executive Directors are drawn from a wide range of industries and backgrounds, including the pharmaceuticals industry and R&D, vaccines, consumer products and healthcare, medical research and academia, insurance and financial services. Collectively they have a wealth of experience of complex organisations with global reach. Many of our Board members also have experience of longer-cycle industries, which is of great assistance in understanding our sector.We are committed to the diversity of our Boardroom, just as GSK is committed to equal opportunities for all employees at all levels of our organisation. The Board and management seek to encourage a diverse and inclusive culture throughout the company. An effective Board needs a range and balance of skills, experience, knowledge, ethnicity, gender, social- economic backgrounds and independence, with individuals who are prepared to challenge each other and work collaboratively. This mix needs to be complemented by a diversity of personal attributes, including character, intellect, judgement, honesty and courage.110 GSK Annual Report 2021Board and GLT diversity targets The Committee is responsible for developing measurable objectives and monitoring progress towards their achievement to assist the implementation of the Board's diversity policy, including gender and ethnic diversity. Our progress against these targets is set out below. For consistency, the diversity metrics as at 1 January 2022 are shown in line with our gender diversity submission to the FTSE Women Leaders Review (the Review). Progress achieved Diversity objectives Status Performance At least 33% of Board positions held by womenExceed objective 38.4% At least 33% of GLT positions held by womenMet objective 35.7% At least 33% of combined GLT and direct report positions held by womenExceed objective 42.5% At least one Board Director is ethnically diverseExceed objective Two Directors The Committee is particularly intent on increasing gender and, especially, ethnically diverse representation on the Board and GLT, and further developing the pipeline of direct reports to the GLT from ethnically diverse backgrounds. The Committee is supportive of the new gender diversity targets in the Review published in late February 2022, including 40% women on boards by 2025. It has been pleased that for many years the Board's gender representation target has been comfortably exceeded and normally over 40% of Board positions have been held by women. We are in a transitional period as the company separates and the CH business is demerged. The Committee is working to transition to the target Board profile for the new biopharma company. As a result, the composition and diversity of the Board during this transition will inevitably be subject to fluctuation. I look forward to confirming completion of this work in next year's report and reporting our progress against the Review's increased gender diversity targets. The representation of women and ethnically diverse leaders is covered on page 37, as part of the diversity of GSK's global workforce. Progress against our inclusion and diversity commitments, including gender and ethnicity, is illustrated in our ESG Performance Report on gsk.com. Sir Jonathan Symonds Nominations & Corporate Governance Committee Chair 28 February 2022Our Board committee reports continued Transformation & Separation Committee report Jonathan Symonds Transformation & Separation Committee I am pleased to present my second and final report as Chair of the Transformation & Separation Committee (the Committee) given that it has now fulfilled its purpose and mandate. The Committee was established in May 2020 charged with two principal functions: -Exercising oversight of the Future Ready transformation programme , particularly delivery of the targeted cost savings and separation of the company's infrastructure prior to the delivery team moving from project design into implementation and -Considering the optimal form of separation . This also included the implications of separation and the most appropriate listing location for Haleon The Committee was pleased that the Future Ready transformation programme was completed to schedule by the end of 2021 and exceeded the cost savings identified to be derived from this programme. During 2021, the Committee undertook a programme of work to understand and consider the key fundamentals of separation. This was not just the technical requirements. It considered how to best unlock, release and maximise long-term shareholder value. This work was supported by guidance and advice from external experts as appropriate. The Committee began by considering how we should separate and the principal value to be achieve from each option available. Discussions then progressed to the capital structures required for the resulting two companies to be competitive as independent entities. Following a decision to demerge the CH business it was important to determine how to distribute shares in Haleon to our shareholders, and on which exchanges Haleon should list and why. The Committee also considered whether to retain a stake in Haleon and how big a stake to retain. This was a very intensive and detailed programme of work as the Committee addressed these major questions and the impact for all our stakeholders. It then reported to the Board accordingly on its conclusions and recommendations. This process is now well into the execution phase. Oversight of the remaining work more appropriately rests with the other specialist Board committees and has been devolved to them as appropriate, or will be reviewed and overseen directly by the Board. Having fulfilled its mandate, it was agreed that the Committee be decommissioned. I would like to thank Board colleagues for their commitment and diligence in supporting the Committee's work in this respect. Sir Jonathan Symonds Transformation & Separation Committee Chair 28 February 2022GSK Annual Report 2021 111 Strategic report Governance and remuneration Financial statements Investor informationAudit & Risk Committee report Charles Bancroft Audit & Risk Committee I am pleased to present this report, which is my first as Chair of the Audit & Risk Committee (the Committee). I joined the Committee back in May 2020. I succeeded Judy Lewent as Chair in March 2021 after a comprehensive transition. I have been drawing on my business background, including the ten years I served as CFO of the major pharmaceutical company, Bristol Myers Squibb. In doing so, I have always viewed people, processes, systems and importantly, culture as the critical foundation for successfully managing financial reporting, audit and compliance risks. In my time serving on this Committee and through my observations more generally as a Board member, I am confident that GSK controls score highly in all these areas. I would therefore like to share my initial impressions of these key aspects. Our culture and people GSK has a strong compliance culture with a consistent tone and engagement from the top. This is regularly considered and emphasised in Committee discussions, and we have a zero- tolerance approach to any unethical behaviour. Our risk management and internal control framework is mature and well embedded in the organisation as demonstrated on pages 46 and 112 of the Annual Report. This enables the Committee to evaluate and oversee how GSK manages principal and emerging risks. The Committee also routinely exercises oversights of improvements to our compliance culture. Everything we do at GSK is underpinned by having great people with the right skill sets. Indeed, our corporate governance framework requires good people to make quality decisions and do the right thing. As Committee Chair, I have unfettered access to the senior leadership and key members of their teams. Regularly throughout the year, I met individually with key Committee attendees from management, including the CFO, General Counsel, Chief Compliance Officer, Head of Audit & Assurance, the Group Financial Controller, the Company Secretary, and external auditor. Additionally, the Committee members have an opportunity to speak at the end of each meeting with the external auditor without management being present. Crucially, we also have the ability to speak with key members of management in private sessions or alone as required.Our Board committee reports continued Our processes and systems These are fundamental for appropriate financial reporting, controls and managing risks. We are well positioned in this respect, as the company's main accounting and reporting systems are centralised into two global instances of SAP. We also have a well-established One Finance model with centralised transactional and controller activities embedded in GSK's four regional hubs. This frees up our in-market finance people to focus on the core business operations and decision making. The Committee continues to exercise regular oversight and monitoring activities over these critical financial systems. The integrity of our financial statements, including the Annual Report and quarterly results announcements, is an enduring key focus of the Committee. Since joining the Board and Committee, I have been impressed with the clarity and rigour around these processes. The Committee's position has always been to aim for clear and transparent financial disclosure in all of GSK's financial reporting. As the previous Committee Chair highlighted in her report last year, we have continued to ensure that the company's financial reporting and controls framework remains robust and did not require any fundamental changes. This has been important despite the ongoing impact of COVID-19 on the company's ways of working. In addition, the external auditor regularly tests our financial systems and controls and challenges management, and reports their results to the Committee. This includes any areas of deficiencies that the external auditor has identified and progress in remediation of issues, all of which are discussed and evaluated. Key activities in 2021 Key decisions: As usual, it has been a busy year for the Committee. Not only working through its regular programme of activities, but making important decisions in support of the Board's progression of its key priorities. These have included reviewing, in support of the Board: -further incremental changes to the company's commercial model in China -the company's new growth ambitions before they were shared at the Investor Update in June 2021 and -the move to a progressive dividend policy from 2022 The matters considered and their outcomes are reported on pages 96 and 97. Preparation for the demerger The Committee is also a key CH governance delivery workstream. We are now increasingly reviewing the technical aspects of delivery of the demerger. The Committee is specifically accountable for reviewing and recommending to the Board approval of key transaction documents and related matters. 112 GSK Annual Report 2021The Board is ultimately responsible for the decision to demerge, both in respect of the timing and final terms of the demerger. It will make the recommendation of the transaction to shareholders through the publication of the GSK Shareholder Circular. The Committee's role is to scrutinise these documents prior to the Board's review. This process for both the Committee and the Board will continue to intensify in the first half of this year as the formal point of separation approaches. The Committee has been assisting the CH management in establishing a robust internal control and risk management framework ready for separation. The overarching principle has been to replicate GSK's current internal governance controls and finance systems and, where necessary, adapt the existing framework and processes. The Committee is pleased that the CH business is currently well advanced in setting up the governance, processes and organisations to be managing all processes in a 'business as usual' environment in Q2 2022. Internal control framework Our Board recognises its obligation to present a fair, balanced and understandable assessment of GSK's current position and prospects. Reflecting this responsibility, it is accountable for evaluating and approving the effectiveness of GSK's internal controls, including financial, operational and compliance controls, and risk management processes. We ensure the reliability of our financial reporting, and compliance with laws and regulations, through our internal control framework. This is a comprehensive enterprise-wide risk management model which supports the Board's continuous identification, evaluation and management of the Group's principal risks, as required by the FRC's Code. The framework is designed to manage the risk of us not achieving our business objectives. A fit-for-purpose framework - complemented by our corporate values, culture, expectations and Speak Up processes - ensures that the risks associated with our business activities are actively and effectively controlled in line with our agreed risk appetite. We believe GSK's framework provides reasonable, but not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss. The Board mandates the Group's Risk Oversight & Compliance Council (ROCC) of senior leaders to assist the Committee in overseeing risk management and internal control activities. It also provides the business with a framework for risk management and upward escalation of significant risks. Risk Management and Compliance Boards (RMCBs) across the Group promote the 'tone from the top' and establish our risk culture, as well as ensuring effective oversight of internal controls and risk management processes. Each principal risk has an assigned risk owner, drawn from senior management, who is accountable for managing his/her principal risk with oversight by a GLT Member, including setting and implementing risk mitigation plans. Risk owners report quarterly on their respective risk management approach and progress at the ROCC and the appropriate Board Committee. Our Compliance function assists the ROCC and RMCBs. Compliance is responsible for advancing enterprise-wide risk management and for developing risk-based and ethically sound working practices. It also actively promotes ethical behaviours by enabling all employees to operate in line with our values and comply with applicable laws and regulations. Our Audit & Assurance (A&A) function provides independent assurance to senior management and the Board on the effectiveness of risk management Group-wide, in line with an agreed assurance plan. This helps senior management and the Board to meet their oversight and advisory responsibilities in fulfilling GSK's strategic objectives and building trust with patients and other stakeholders. A&A has a dual reporting line to our CFO and the Committee. The Committee receives regular reports from business units, principal risk owners, Compliance and A&A on areas of significant risk to the Group and on related internal controls. These reports assess the internal control environment within each principal risk area, including enhancements to strengthen controls. Following consideration of these reports, the Committee reports annually to the Board on the effectiveness of GSK's internal controls. In 2021, through the authority delegated to the Committee, the Board conducted a robust assessment of the Group's principal risks. This assessment, which was in line with the FRC's 2018 Code, included consideration of the nature and extent of risk the Board is willing to take in achieving GSK's strategic objectives. The Board, via the Committee, also oversaw the effectiveness of our internal control environment and risk management processes across the Group for the whole year, up to the approval date of this Annual Report. A review of the Group's risk management approach is further discussed in the 'Risk management' section of the strategic report on pages 46 to 54. Our management of each principal risk is explained in 'Principal risks and uncertainties' on pages 275 to 287. The Group's viability is discussed in the Group risk management section of the strategic report on page 53.Our Board committee reports continuedGSK Annual Report 2021 113 Strategic report Governance and remuneration Financial statements Investor informationSignificant issues relating to the financial statements In considering GSK's quarterly financial results announcements and the financial results in the 2021 Annual Report, the Committee reviewed the significant issues and management judgements in determining those results. It reviewed management papers setting out the key areas of risk, actions taken to quantify the effects of the relevant issues, and judgements made by management on the appropriate accounting required to address those issues in the financial statements. The significant issues considered in relation to the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2021 are set out in the following table, with a summary of the financial outcomes where appropriate. The Committee and the external auditor have discussed the significant issues addressed by the Committee during the year and the areas of particular audit focus, as described in the Independent Auditor's Report on pages 156 to 167. Significant issues considered by the Committee in relation to the financial statements How the issue was addressed by the Committee Going concern basis for the preparation of the financial statementsThe Committee considered the outcome of management's half-yearly and year end reviews of current and forecast net debt positions and the various financing facilities and options available to the Group. The Committee also considered management's review of the current and longer-term impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, at the outbreak of the pandemic and at the year end. Following consideration of these assessments, which included stress testing and viability scenarios, sources of liquidity and funding, forecasts and estimates, the Committee confirmed that the application of the going concern basis for the preparation of the financial statements continued to be appropriate. Revenue recognition, including returns and rebates (RAR) accrualsThe Committee reviewed management's approach to the timing of recognition of revenue and accruals for customer returns and rebates. The US Pharmaceuticals and Vaccines accrual for returns and rebates was \u00a35.0 billion at 31 December 2021 and the Committee reviewed the basis on which the accrual had been made and concurred with management's judgements on the amounts involved. A fuller description of the process operated in the US Pharmaceuticals and Vaccines business in determining the level of accrual necessary is set out in 'Critical accounting policies' on page 80. Provisions for legal matters, including investigations into the Group's commercial practicesThe Committee received detailed reports on actual and potential litigation from both internal and external legal counsel, together with a number of detailed updates on investigations into the Group's commercial practices. Management outlined the levels of provision and corresponding disclosure considered necessary in respect of potential adverse litigation outcomes and also those areas where it was not yet possible to determine if a provision was necessary, or its amount. At 31 December 2021, the provision for legal matters was \u00a30.2 billion, as set out in Note 31 to the financial statements, 'Other provisions'. Provisions for uncertain tax positions The Committee considered current tax disputes and areas of potential risk and concurred with management's judgement on the levels of tax contingencies required. At 31 December 2021, a tax payable liability of \u00a30.7 billion, including provisions for uncertain tax positions, was recognised on the Group's balance sheet. Impairments of intangible assets The Committee reviewed management's process for reviewing and testing goodwill and other intangible assets for potential impairment. The Committee accepted management's judgements on the intangible assets that required writing down and the resulting impairment of \u00a3455 million in 2021. See Note 20 to the financial statements, 'Other intangible assets' for more details. Valuation of contingent consideration in relation to ViiV HealthcareThe Committee considered management's judgement that it was necessary to increase the liability to pay contingent consideration as a result of increases in sales forecasts as well as the unwind of the discount and updated exchange rate assumptions. After cash payments of approximately \u00a30.8 billion in the year, at 31 December 2021, the Group's Balance sheet included a contingent consideration liability of \u00a35.6 billion in relation to ViiV Healthcare. The settlement with Gilead resulted in a re-measurement of the existing liabilities for the contingent consideration at the year end and is included in the closing balance. ViiV Healthcare put option The Committee reviewed and agreed the accounting for the Pfizer put option and concurred with management's judgement on the valuation of the put option of \u00a31.0 billion at 31 December 2021. The settlement with Gilead resulted in a re-measurement of the Pfizer put option at the year end and is included in the closing balance.Our Board committee reports continued114 GSK Annual Report 2021Our Board committee reports continued Auditor's reappointment External auditor External auditor appointment Last tender May - December 2016 Transition year 2017 First shareholder approval of current auditor May 2018 First audited Annual Report and 20-F Year ending 31 December 2018 Next audit tender required by regulations 2026 There were no contractual or similar obligations restricting the Group's choice of external auditor. The Committee considers that during 2020 the company complied with the mandatory audit processes and audit committee responsibility provisions of the Competition and Markets Authority Statutory Audit Services Order 2014. Effectiveness and quality of external audit process The Committee is committed to ensuring that GSK receives a high-quality and effective external audit. In evaluating Deloitte's performance during 2020, prior to making a recommendation on its reappointment in early 2021, the Committee reviewed the effectiveness of its performance against the criteria which it agreed with management at the beginning of 2020. The detailed criteria used for judging the effectiveness of Deloitte as external auditor (which are based on audit approach and strategy, high-quality independent audit, effective partnership and value for money) and its overriding responsibility to deliver a smooth, thorough and efficiently-executed audit for 2021 are available on gsk.com. In undertaking its review, the Committee considered: -the overall quality of the audit -the independence of Deloitte -whether Deloitte exhibited an appropriate level of challenge and scepticism in its work Deloitte's length of tenure was not taken into account when assessing its independence and objectivity, as it was only recently appointed as GSK's auditor. However, the Committee did consider how effectively it had assumed its role as auditor. The Committee also considered feedback on the 2021 external audit, through a survey of Committee members and the financial management team at corporate and business unit level. The survey covered the: -effectiveness of the auditor's challenge -integrity of Deloitte -transparency of its reporting to management and the Committee -clarity of the auditor's communication and ways of working -alignment of the 2021 audit to the Group's investment in Systems, Applications and Products (SAP) -quality of the audit team's leadership -skills and experience of the audit teamThe Committee Chair regularly meets independently with the audit partners. The Committee also meets the auditor at the end of each meeting to discuss progress, as appropriate. Having reviewed the above feedback, and noted any areas of improvement to be implemented by the audit team for 2022, the Committee was satisfied with the: -effectiveness of the auditor and the external audit process and -auditor's independence, qualifications, objectivity, expertise and resources The Committee therefore agreed to recommend the reappointment of Deloitte to the Board at the forthcoming AGM. In making its recommendation, the Committee was free from the influence of any third party. Non-audit services Our management operates on the presumption that other accountancy firms will provide non-audit services to GSK. However, where the external auditor's skills and experience make it the only suitable supplier of non-audit support - such as for audit-related matters, tax, and other services - it may be used, in the best interests of the company. In line with GSK's non-audit services policy, the Committee must ensure that auditor objectivity and independence is safeguarded by reviewing and pre-approving the external auditor's provision of such services. The company policy complies with the FRC's 2019 Revised Ethical Standard and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. It observes the following core policy features on engaging the external auditor for non-audit services: GSK non-audit services policy, key features: Process: All non-audit services over \u00a350,000 are put to competitive tender with other financial services providers, in line with the Group's procurement process, unless the skills and experience of the external auditor make it the only suitable supplier. Safeguards: Adequate safeguards are established so that the objectivity and independence of the Group audit are not threatened or compromised. Fee cap: The total fee payable for non-audit services should not exceed 50% of the annual audit fee, except in special circumstances where there would be a clear advantage in the auditor undertaking the additional work. Prohibitions: GSK's policy includes a 'whitelist' of permitted non-audit services in line with the relevant regulations. Any service not on this list is prohibited. Pre-approval: All non-audit services require pre-approval as set out in the table below to ensure services approved are consistent with GSK's non-audit policy for permissible services. This process ensures all services fall within the scope of services permitted and pre-approved by the Committee and does not represent a delegation of authority for pre-approval. Value More than \u00a350,000 Between \u00a325,000 and \u00a350,000 Under \u00a325,000Pre-approver Committee Chair and CFO Group Financial Controller Designate of the Group Financial Controller The fees paid to the company's auditor and its associates are set out overleaf. Further details are given in Note 8 to the financial statements, 'Operating profit' on page 184.GSK Annual Report 2021 115 Strategic report Governance and remuneration Financial statements Investor informationOur Board committee reports continued During the year, fees for audit related and other assurance services of \u00a34.0 million have increased by \u00a32.4 million compared to 2020. This increase is due to work associated with Deloitte's reporting accountant role in preparing for the demerger of the Consumer Healthcare business. Including audit fees in respect of the GSK pension schemes of \u00a30.2 million, fees for audit related and other assurance services represent 15.2% of the annual audit service fee (2020: 6.3%). Excluding the demerger work, fees for audit related and other assurance services would have represented 2.2% of the annual audit fee. The Committee considered that hiring Deloitte to undertake the reporting accountant role for the demerger was in the best interests of shareholders because: -Deloitte possessed the type of expertise, experience, size and international scope required to handle a major demerger of this scale and complexity -the company benefited specifically from Deloitte's in-depth knowledge and understanding of our CH business and their processes and compliance environment and -management time, that would otherwise have been devoted to educating another firm on the company's business and operations, could instead be spent on delivering the demerger and creation of Haleon. The Committee considered the level of non-audit services incurred as part of its annual review of Deloitte's independence set out on page 114 and was satisfied that the auditor continued to be independent and exercise objectivity throughout 2021.0 10 20 30 Audit and assurance services Other services, including tax, regulatory, compliance and treasury-related services Services relating to the Consumer Healthcare demerger preparation Note 8 to the Financial statements provides further details of fees payable to the company's auditor.Audit and other services comparison (\u00a3m) 26.2 26.6 2019 29.1 1.52021 30.3 1.4 27.7 2020 28.3 1.84.2Fair, balanced and understandable assessment The need for an annual report to be fair, balanced and understandable is one of the key compliance requirements for a company's financial statements. To ensure that GSK's Annual Report meets this requirement, we have a well-established and documented process governing the coordination and review of Group-wide contributions to the publication. This runs in parallel with the process followed by the external auditor. The Committee received a summary of management's approach to GSK's 2021 Annual Report to ensure it met the requirements of the FRC's Code. This enabled the Committee, and the Board, to confirm that GSK's 2021 Annual Report as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the necessary information for shareholders to assess the company's position and performance, business model and strategy. Code of Conduct and reporting lines We have a number of well-established policies (including a Code of Conduct), which are available on gsk.com, together with details of our confidential Speak Up lines for reporting and investigating unlawful conduct. Charles Bancroft Audit & Risk Committee Chair 28 February 2022116 GSK Annual Report 2021Section 172 statement Company directors are required by law to promote the success of their organisation for the benefit of both shareholders and their wider stakeholders, including employees, suppliers and the community. This statement aligns to such requirements, as set out in Section 172 and Section 414CZA of the Companies Act 2006 (the Act).

They provide that Directors may be appointed by an ordinary resolution of the members or by a resolution of the Board, provided that, if appointed by the Board, the Director retires at the next Annual General Meeting following their appointment. Our Articles also provide that all Directors are required to seek re-election annually at the Annual General Meeting in accordance with the FRC's Code. A Director will cease to be a Director if he or she: -becomes bankrupt -ceases to be a Director by virtue of the Companies Act or the Articles -suffers mental or physical ill health and the Board resolves that he or she shall cease to be a Director -has missed Directors' meetings for a continuous period of six months without permission and the Board resolves that he or she shall cease to be a Director -is prohibited from being a Director by law -resigns, or offers to resign and the Board accepts that offer -is required to resign by the Board Directors' conflicts of interest All Directors have a duty under the Companies Act 2006 to avoid a situation in which they have, or could have, a direct or indirect conflict of interest or possible conflict with the company. Our Articles provide a general power for the Board to authorise such conflicts. The Board reviews any new potential or actual conflict, which is recorded by the Company Secretary. Directors are not counted in the quorum for the authorisation of their own actual or potential conflicts. The Nominations & Corporate Governance Committee reviews the Register of Conflicts on an annual basis which the Board subsequently approves. On a continuing basis, the Directors are responsible for informing the Company Secretary of any such new actual or potential conflicts that may arise or if there are any changes in circumstances that may affect an authorisation previously given. Even when provided with authorisation, a Director is not absolved from his or her statutory duty to promote the success of the company. If an actual conflict arises post-authorisation, the Board may choose to exclude the Director from receipt of the relevant information and participation in the debate, or suspend the Director from the Board, or, as a last resort, require the Director to resign.The Nominations & Corporate Governance Committee reviewed the register of potential conflict authorisations (the Register of Conflicts) in January 2022. The Committee reported to the Board that the conflicts had been appropriately authorised and that the process for authorisation continued to operate effectively. The Committee then recommended the approval of the Register of Conflicts to the Board which it subsequently approved. Except as described in Note 39 to the financial statements, 'Related party transactions', during or at the end of the financial year no Director or Person Closely Associated had any material interest in any contract of significance with a Group company. Our Articles prohibit a Director from voting on any resolution concerning his or her appointment or the terms or termination of his or her appointment. Independent advice The company has an agreed procedure for Directors to take independent legal and/or financial advice at the company's expense where they deem it necessary. Indemnification of Directors Qualifying third party indemnity provisions (as defined in the Companies Act 2006) are in force for the benefit of Directors and former Directors who held office during 2021 and up to the approval and signature of the Annual Report. Change of control and essential contracts We do not have contracts or other arrangements which individually are fundamental to the ability of the business to operate effectively. Neither is the company party to any material agreements that would take effect, be altered, or terminate upon a change of control following a takeover bid. We do not have agreements with any Director that would provide compensation for loss of office or employment resulting from a takeover, except that provisions of the company's share plans may cause options and awards granted under such plans to vest on a takeover. Details of the termination provisions in the Executive Directors' service contracts are given in the full version of the company's 2020 Remuneration policy which is available at www.gsk.com in the Investors section.
