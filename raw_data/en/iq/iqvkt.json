Thank You! [NadjaLind.com](https://NadjaLind.com) Every single 'Turning In Ambient Drone' wave is designed to gently guide you into states of deep relaxation, emotional release and inner peace, achieved through underlying binaural frequencies [delta, theta, alpha]- frequencies designed to physically stimulate the human brain. This only works on headphones. Some tracks are combined with ASMR (aural stimulating meridian response) and EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing; also achieved through aural or touch impulses of the left and right side of the body) re-like aural impulse to actively stimulate both hemispheres which is being used to help releasing the stuck energy and the symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This helps your body to naturally release its own destressing hormones, allowing you to breathe deeper, help your physical and spiritual body to rebalance and to recover quickly from the rigours of everyday life. How to use the binaural tracks most effectively: 1. use headphones (the binaural frequencies are produced by your brain through aural stimulation of hemispheres; without headphones you won't participate in the frequency following response (FFR) effect. Best would be noise-cancelling headphones. 2. check towards the middle of the track if the volume is comfortable. In doubt decrease the volume 2 - 3 db (rather than increase). Note that after some minutes the perception of sound might get more intense since usually our brains adapt to the environmental noise pollution. 3. ideal is if you can lie down and cover yourself with a blanket. Note that after lying still for some minutes your heart-rate and body temperature lowers. 4. please make sure you will not get interrupted during your listening cycle. it is vital for the recovery & energy charge process to be completed. - enable e.g. flight mode on your phone - make sure nobody will knock on your door for the whole length of your meditation - if applicable use noise cancelling headphones to protect yourself from outside noises 5. put on a blindfold or darken the room. The listening experience will be much more effective the less distractions through other senses/sensations. 6. enjoy and relax the listening- and trance experience. 7. usually you will gently 'wake up' towards the end since the tracks are especially organised like this. I am very pleased if you'd like to share your feedback and experiences. Thank you very much. Nadja Lind. How does each binaural Turning In help do this?

I listened to the jungle experience when I felt really sad and depressed and afterwards I felt relieved and happy again and even caught myself laughing aloud. it calms me down and makes me happy! Christian K. Just listened to your jungle experience meditation this morning. An extremely soft and nice sound carpet. In the first third I even had the feeling i was floating.
