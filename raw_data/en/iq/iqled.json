This report also contains t he TEAP and TOC membership lists, as of 30 April 2022, includ ing each member and their term of appointment . TEAP would like to express its sincere gratitude for the voluntary service and contributions of members of its TOCs and Task Forces. TEAP's tasks have continued to be particularly chal lenging in view of the COVID -19 pandemic which imposed restrictions to global travel, and changes to scheduled meetings and typical modes of working. To meet these challenges in delivering its reports on time to parties and ensuring the safety of its membe rs, TEAP and its TOCs and Task Forces have held their meetings virtually. However, this year, 3 -6 May 2022, TEAP successfully held its first ever hybrid meeting with some members meeting physically in London. We are grateful to the UK for their support wit h the meeting venue. We want to express our sincere appreciation to the Ozone Secretariat for its support and assistance in providing the TEAP with access to its virtual meeting platform for TEAP meetings. 1.1 TEAP Decision XXXIII/5 Energy Efficiency Task Force Update Decision XXXIII/5 asks TEAP, ...\" to prepare a report on energy efficient and lower - global - warming - potential technologies and on measures to enhance and maintain energy efficiency during hydrofluorocarbon transition in equipment for consideration by the Open -ended - Working Group at its forty -fourth meeting, and in the report to: (a) Update information in the decision XXXI/7 report where relevant, and address additional subsectors not previously covered such as the heat -pump, lar ge commercial refrigeration and larger air -conditioning system sub -sectors; (b) Assess potential cost savings associated with adoption of lower global warming potential energy efficient technologies in each sector, including for manufacturers and consumers; (c) Identify sectors where actions could be taken in the short term to adopt energy efficient technologies while phasing down hydrofluorocarbons; (d) Identify options to enhance and maintain energy efficiency in equipment through deploying best practices during inst allation, servicing, maintenance, refurbishment or repair; (e) Provide detailed information on how the benefits of integrating energy efficiency enhancements with the hydrofluorocarbon phase -down measures can be assessed. \" In order to prepare its report, TEAP established a new 2022 Energy Efficiency Task Force (EETF). Previous Task Forces had mainly restricted their scope to the domestic air conditioning (AC) and self- contained commercial refrigeration equipment (SCCRE) sect ors. When establishing the new expertise required to respond to Decision XXXIII/5, TEAP took into account the request to cover additional sectors (heat -pump, large commercial refrigeration, larger air -conditioning systems), installation and servicing, and the assessment of the integration of energy enhancements with HFC phasedown. The EETF Report was assembled in chapters, updating previous information, and addressing the additional subsectors not previously covered. The 2022 Task Force has 24 members (5 fe male, 19 2022 TEAP Progress Report - Volume 1 2 male) and two consulting experts. There are 13 members from A rticle 5 (A5) p arties and 11 members from non -A5 parties. 1.2 TEAP Modelling Update TEAP is providing an update on its ongoing wor k, through a small wor king group, to build a database model of regional emissions and banks estimates to better respond to parties' requests and to support its work and that of the Assessment Panels. The model ling technique uses a wide range of information including production and consumption data reported to the Ozone Secretariat and the Alternative Fluorocarbons Environmental Acceptability Study (AFEAS )1, estimates of the lifetime of equipment and foams, emissions rates throughout the product lifecycle, and market and economic influences to estimate banks and expected annual emissions from the historic, current, and projected usage of controlled substances. These expected annual emission estimates for specific ozone -depleting substances (ODS) can then be compared to estimated emissions from available atmospheric chemical concentrations, when available. The same methodology was used by the TEAP Task Force on the Unexpected Emissions of CFC -11and the latest TEAP Replenishment Task Force Reports . TEAP is working to wards a database t hat will address all controlled substances, with initial work prioritising a smaller group of substances for the 2022 Assessment Reports. The benefits of developing a TEAP model are the consensus conclusions that can be drawn from the combined knowledge of its exp erts, e.g., in determining model assumptions, such as lifetime of equipment and foams, emission rates, historic and predicted market and economic impacts. The model can also be refined over time as this knowledge expands or changes. A consistent and transp arent , published methodology ensures that the best available assumptions and method are incorporated . The outputs for each chemical can be integrated to allow an evaluation of total ozone depletion potential (ODP) or carbon dioxide equivalent (CO 2e) units providing a state -of-the-art understanding to support the work of the Montreal Protocol. Any additional product data that parties wish to convey to TEAP c ould be used to further refine models. An example of the results of this modelling was the estimated expected emissions and banks of CFC - 11 from the work of the TEAP Task Force on Unexpected Emissions of CFC -11. The newest example of modelling results is included in this 2022 TEAP Progress Report, showing the estimated expected emissions and banks of HCFC -141b. More information on TEAP's modelling work will be provided in the 2022 TEAP and TOC s Assessment Reports . 1.2.1 Background for HCFC -141b: A Brief History of Ozone Depleting Substance (ODS) Use in Foams Polyurethanes were invented in the 1930s and are used in a wide variety of products. In 1948, closed - cell foams were initially introduced as an insulation in very small quantities and the market slowly increased. Use of steel sandwich building panels and integral skin began in the 1960s. In the late 1970s and 1980s closed -cell polyurethane insulation expanded to include spray foam and sandwich panels. Separately, open cell foams such as flexible and cushioning foams (e.g., shoe soles and cushions) were commercialized in the 1950s. CFC-11 was initially u sed as a foam blowing agent in all of these types of foams. The closed -cell foam market developed gradually as confirmed AFEAS CFC -11 sales values showing that CFC -11 sales into closed -cell foams were relatively small until the 1970s with continuous growth throughout the 1980s. 1The A lternative Fluorocarbons Environmental Acceptability Study (AFEAS) collected data on a number of CFCs as reported by the producers. Data included market uses as well as estimated emissions. The data could be found here. https://agage.mit.edu/data/afeas -data 2022 TEAP Progress Report - Volume 1 3 HCFC -141b was introduced as a replacement for CFC -11 for use as a closed -cell foam blowing agent during the CFC -11 phase -out. HCFC -141b is also undergoing a phase -out as agreed by the parties to the Montreal Protocol. By 2006, non-A5 parties were already transitioning from ozone depleting blowing agents the phase -out of CFC -11 for non -A5 parties completed by 1996. G iven its higher ozone depletion potential , many parties regulated HCFC -141b early using a \"worst -first\" strategy, and so reductions were already well under way for HCFC -141b prior to the phase -out schedule, to be completed by 2020. For example, the United States banned the use of HCFC -141b for use in foam for appliances in 2003, and then in imported products containing HCFC -141b in 2015. Each transition in non-A5 parties resulted in much lower use of halocarbons as foam blowing agents as foam manufacturers shifted to other alternatives including water and hydrocarbons. 1.2.2 Estimated regional use of HCFC -141b The FTOC completed a detailed analysis of the use of foam blowing agents by foam sector by region in the 2006 FTOC Assessment Report2. The FTOC described large, mature foam markets in North America (NA) and Europe (EU) for the types of foams that historically used CFC-11 and HCFC - 141b. Other regions all using less than one -third of the quantities used by either North America or Europe. Closed -cell foam markets in Article 5 parties had slowly been growing prior to 2006 as shown in Fig.1 .1. Fig. 1.1. Non-A5 and A5 parties consumption of CFC -11 and HCFC -141b 2 The 2006 FTOC Assessment Report can at https://ozo ne.unep.org/sites/default/files/2019 - 05/ftoc_assessment_report06.pdf . 2022 TEAP Progress Report - Volume 1 4 Non-A5 parties completed their phase -out of CFC -11 use as a blowing agent in 1996 and had already completed their phase -outs of HCFC -141b. A5 party baselines were determined in 1995 -97 for CFCs and in 2009 -10 for HCFCs. A5 party freeze and phaseout started in 1999 for CFCs and in 2013 for HCFCs. Many parties again regulated HCFC -141b using the same \"worst -first\" approach based on ODP that non -A5 parties used. 1.2.3 Estimated global use of HCFC -141b by foam type The 2006 FTOC Assessment Report sectoral and regional analysis was used to create an estimate of foam use of blowing agents , to estimate banks and emissions based on the estimated losses of blowing agents during different foamin g processes and foam lifetimes. In this analysis, HCFC -141b consumption peaked around 2000 in non -A5 parties and in 2011 in A5 parties with the majority used to manufacture foams in North America (NA) and in Northeast Asia (NEA). However, much of the 2022 TEAP Progress Report - Volume 1 5 produ ction of foams in NEA was used in domestic appliances that were exported to other regions of the world. Fig. 1.2 HCFC -141b Regional Consumption and Market Use 1.2.4 Global consumption and estimated emissions of HCFC -141b There are two distinct peaks in the production and consumption of HCFC -141b, as policies initially allowed for its use and then mandated its phase -out in non -A5 followed by A5 parties. Policies have also generally mandated bans in the use of HCFC -141b in d omestic refrigeration manufacture by 2015 in much of the world. Active banks refer to fluorocarbon, such as used as a foam blowing agent in insulating foams, still in active use (in buildings and refrigerators or refrigeration equipment etc.) Inactive banks refer to chemicals no longer in use and are largely represented by fluorocarbons in landfills. The inactive bank of HCFC -141b is believed to have been largely from foams in refrigerators, while the active bank is now shifting to be largely r elated to construction foams globally. The global active 2022 TEAP Progress Report - Volume 1 6 bank peak is now estimated to have occurred, with continued decommissioning of appliances and buildings that contain HCFC -141b being greater than new HCFC -141b usage to create new foams. The timing o f the global peak for decommissioning of foams containing HCFC -141b is estimated to occur over the next 5 years. Fig. 1.3 Global Model Results for HCFC -141b : Total Reported Production and Estimated Banks, Timing of Decommissioning, and Emissions Global Co nsumption Global Emissions Global Banks and Normalized Consumption Decommissioning of foams 1.2.5 Consumption, Banks, and Estimated Emissions and Banks of HCFC -141b Peak reported production and consumption of HCFC -141b in non -A5 parties occurred by 2000 and was largely used in domestic refrigeration foams. The current inactive bank of HCFC -141b is believed to have been used largely from foams in refrigerators . The active bank of foams manufactured in non -A5 parties is also largely in refrigerants . 2022 TEAP Progress Report - Volume 1 7 Peak reported production and consumption of HCFC -141b in A5 parties occurred by 2012 and was largely used in domestic refrigeration foams until 2015, when mandated bans in the use of HCFC - 141b in domestic refrigeration occurred in much o f the world. The inactive bank of HCFC -141b is believed to have been largely from foams in refrigerators. The active bank of foams manufactured in A5 parties is also largely in refrigerators. The peak of the active bank in A5 parties is estimated to have o ccurred between 2015 and 2020, with continued decommissioning of appliances and buildings that contain HCFC -141b being greater than new HCFC -141b usage to create new foams. Regional variations in emissions and decommissioning as well as other details regar ding the modelling process will be included in the TEAP 2022 Assessment Report . 1.3 Response to Decision XXVIII/2: Decision related to the amendment phasing down HFCs At their Twenty -eighth Meeting in October 2016 in Kigali, Rwanda, parties agreed on Decis ion XXVIII/2 and the Kigali Amendment to phase down HFCs. Paragraph 4 of that decision requested the TEAP \"to conduct periodic reviews of alternatives, using the criteria set out in paragraph 1 (a) of decision XXVI/9, in 2022 and every five years thereafte r, and to provide technological and economic assessments of the latest available and emerging alternatives to hydrofluorocarbons.\" The criteria referenced in paragraph 1(a) of Decision XXVI/9, \"Response to the report of the Technology and Economic Assessme nt Panel on information on alternatives to ozone -depleting substances,\" is as follows (emphasis added): Noting with appreciation volume 2 of the 2012 Technology and Economic Assessment Panel report on the task force progress report which responded to decision XXIII/9, volume 2 of the 2013 progress report of the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel which responded to decision XXIV/7 and volume 4 of the 2014 progress report which responded to decision XXV/5, 1. To request the Technology and Economic As sessment Panel, if necessary in consultation with external experts, to prepare a report identifying the full range of alternatives, including not -in-kind technologies, and identifying applications where alternatives fulfilling the criteria identified in pa ragraph 1 (a) of the present decision are not available, and to make that report available for consideration by the Open - ended Working Group at its thirty -sixth meeting and an updated report to be submitted to the Twenty -Seventh Meeting of the Parties that would: a. Update information on alternatives to ozone -depleting substances in various sectors and subsectors and differentiating between parties operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 and parties not so operating, considering energy efficiency, regional differences and high ambient temperature conditions in particular, and assessing whether they are: i. Commercially available; ii. Technically proven; iii. Environmentally sound; iv. Economically viable and cost effective; v. Safe to use in areas with high urban dens ities considering flammability and toxicity issues, including, where possible, risk characterization; vi. Easy to service and maintain; and describe the potential limitations of their use and their implications for the different sectors, in terms of, but not l imited to, servicing and maintenance requirements, and international design and safety standards; 2022 TEAP Progress Report - Volume 1 8 Decision XXVIII/2 requests TEAP to conduct periodic reviews of alternatives to HFCs in 2022 and every five years thereafter. The first requested periodic revi ew in 2022 aligns with the preparation of TEAP's and its TOCs quadrennial assessment reports under Decision XXXI/2, and those reports are planned to be completed at the end of 2022. Paragraph 6 of Decision XXXI/2 provides the terms of reference for the TEA P quadrennial assessment reports as follows (emphasis added): 6. That, in its 2022 report, the [TEAP] should include an assessment and evaluation of the following topics: a) Technical progress in the production and consumption sectors in the transition to technically and economically feasible and sustainable alternatives and practices that minimize or eliminate the use of controlled substances in all sectors; b) The status of banks and stocks of controlled substances and the options available for managing them so as to avoid emissions to the atmosphere; c) Challenges facing all parties to the Montreal Protocol in implementing Montreal Protocol obligations and maintaining the phase -outs already achieved, especially those on substitutes and substituti on technologies, including challenges for parties related to feedstock uses and by -production to prevent emissions, and potential technically and economically feasible options to face those challenges; d) The impact of the phase -out of controlled ozone -deple ting substances and the phase -down of HFCs on sustainable development; e) Technical advancements in developing alternatives to HFCs suitable for usage in countries with high ambient temperatures, particularly with regard to energy efficiency and safety. Give n that the requests to review alternatives to HFCs overlaps in 2022 with the two decisions, TEAP is planning to convene a TEAP Decision XXVIII/2 Working Group with each TOC represented. The Working Group will prepare a report responding to this decision fo r submission to the Thirty -fourth Meeting of the Parties, 31 October to 4 November 2022. This report will draw from the information in the TOCs assessment reports which will be submitted by the end of 2022. TEAP notes that the Decision XXVIII/2 subsequent requests for periodic reviews of HFC alternatives every five years after 2022 no longer coincides with the quadrennial assessments of the TEAP. To manage its workload and minimize duplicative efforts, TEAP requests that parties may wish to consider alignin g future periodic reviews as requested in Decision XXVIII/2 with the already planned TEAP and TOCs quadrennial assessment reports. 1.4 Key Messages from the Technical Options Committees TEAP presents below the main findings of the 202 2 Progress Report, as key messages from each of the TOC s. 1.4.1 FTOC Low-global warming potential (GWP) blowing agent shortages continue in both Article 5 (A5) and non-Article 5 (on-A5) parties which may be due to pandemic -related supply chain issues, raw m aterial and supply chain shortages, manufacturing issues, and severe weather. Undisclosed manufacturing issues from at least one supplier have led to force majeure declarations , according to a number of foam manufacturers. As a result, there has been a significant increase in the use of parties and a reversion to 2022 TEAP Progress Report - Volume 1 9 HFC -365mfc blends and HFC -245fa in some non -A5 parties. Prices of HFCs have also increased during the pandemic. There have also been reported shortages of hydrocarbons, such as cyclopentane. The transition away from ODS foam blowing agents in some regions and market segments (e.g., spray f oam and extruded polystyrene [XPS]) may be delayed because of cost, especially where local codes require higher thermal performance3. It should be noted that the price of HFC blowing agents is nearly as high as hydrofluoroolefin/hydrochlorofluoroolefin (H FO/HCFO) prices were prior to the pandemic in some A5 parties. Hydrocarbon (HC), methylal, methyl formate, and methylene chloride are reportedly being used in blowing agent blends to reduce costs in some parties. FTOC is seeking additional details on the safety measures being taken to address exposure and safety risks. For example, a number of spray foam (SPF) formulators use 1,2 dichloroethylene as a co -additive for ostensibly improving solubility of HFC and now HFO blowing agents as a means of exten ding their value. With a boiling range of 48 - 60 \u00baC for both isomers, it can support blowing and may be used further as HFO and HFC supplies are tight4. As the transition proceeds and there are continued challenges in supply and costs, foam manufacturers and chemical producers are introducing new options and potential challenges. 1.4.2 HTOC In the 2018 Assessment Report, the HTOC anticipated that the initial 10% reduction in HFC production within non-A5 parties would not have a significant impact on the availability of HFCs for fire protection. It was reasoned that the use of HFCs in fire protection is extremely small in comparison to other uses, the emissions are low, and sales of HFCs in most non -A 5 parties were either declining or flat. Instead, t he experience in the EU and Japan has shown a movement away from the use of HFCs in new fire protection systems (although use of HFCs in Japan has never been widespread). HFCs have been replaced in large part by low -GWP and no -GWP alternatives such as FK-5-1-12 and inert gases. The US HFC phase -down began on January 1, 2022, and it has already had an impact on the cost and availability of newly produced HFCs for fire protection. The US allocation system is GWP -weighted and the HFCs used for fire protection have very high GWPs, so the impact has been greater than initially expected. It is the HTOC's experience that HFCs contained in fire protection equipment historically have been recycled and reused to a relatively high extent . As the supply of newly produce d HFCs for fire protection decreases in response to phase -down regulations, recycling becomes even more important as an alternative source of supply and is likely to increase in the future. Parties may wish to consider re -emphasizing the need to foster international trade of used in legacy fire protection applications, which include those in civil aviation lavatory fire protection systems. The HTOC has identified several issu es affecting the availability and quality of recovered halons from all fire protection sectors, but especially from the civil aviation sector. The HTOC also believes that shipbreaking could represent a significant source of halon 1301 which could support o n-going 3 Although the cost of hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) was approximately 20 -30% of the cost of high -GWP HFCs, HCFC price is increasing as they are phased out globally. T he low price of some high-GWP HFCs, particularly HFC -365mfc which is banned in some non-A5 parties, is leading to an increase in market share, which is slowing the conversion to low- GWP blowing agents 4 Toxicity of 1,2 dichloroethylene is currently being review ed by at least one party. Field studies related to Indoor Air Quality in SPF installations often shows some concentration of 1,2 -dichloroethane up to months or years af ter installation due to its higher boiling point and high solubility in foam matrixes. 2022 TEAP Progress Report - Volume 1 10 activities. It is therefore important to conserve this supply to the greatest extent possible. To address these issues parties may wish to consider: Requesting the Ozone Secretariat to disseminate the recently developed halon management guidance d ocument available from the HTOC, to all National Ozone Units (NOUs) and sponsoring presentations during all upcoming Ozone Regional Manager Network and other applicable meetings, Liaising with their civil aviation authorities to disseminate th is halon mana gement guidance document to all applicable entities within their country such as airlines, maintenance, repair , and overhaul (MRO) companies , and associated non -governmental organi sations (NGOs), Requesting that the International Civil Aviation Organisatio n (ICAO) formally disseminate through a State letter, the halon management guidance document to all civil aviation authorities requesting that the halon management guidance document receive the widest possible dissemination within their State and/or region, Emphasising the importance of effective and complete recovery of halons to minimize halon losses by all parties, particularly those with shipbreaking activities, and Re-emphasising the need to allow for appropriate, open trade of recovered, recycle d and/or reclaimed halons in bulk containers and in prefilled fire protection components to support enduring halons uses, including civil aviation components that are required to allow aircraft to operate under international airworthiness requirements. The EU proposal to define perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS ) as any substance that contains at least one fully fluorinated carbon CF 2 or CF 3 group (without any hydrogen, chlorine, bromine , or iodine ( H/Cl/Br/I ) atom (s) attached) would includ e virtually all of the halogenated , clean, agent alternatives to halons, HCFCs and high -GWP HFC fire extinguishing agents could all be included in the proposed regulations . This could leave halons, or in some cases also HFC -23, as the only viable non -PFAS options in some appli cations . R&D for civil aviation cargo compartment fire protection systems continues. However, the development and certification timescales remain long and can be uncertain. As such, it will still be at least several more years before any of the fire extinguishing agents being evaluated could be in service on aircraft. If these are not successful , the chances of finding an as -yet undiscovered alternative that is safe and effective are, after so many years of research, are extremely low. While civil av iation flight hours dropped by 60% during the pandemic, global halon 1301 emissions did not decline. Therefore, emissions do not seem to be dependent on the number or duration of civil aviation flights (i.e., do not occur during flight operation). This doe s not necessarily mean that civil aviation is not the cause of some of or even a significant amount of the emissions but rather that a different part of the aviation lifecycle such as fire extinguisher maintenance could be responsible for much of these emi ssions. Parties may wish to consider requesting that ICAO continue to sponsor activities related to halon regulation and management, include the HTOC in these activities, and work with the HTOC to provide annual updates on changes to their halon regulation s, the status of development and implementation of aviation alternatives, and other halon management issues important for the long -term use and management of halons. The HTOC is concerned that many personnel who are now responsible for managing fire prote ction agents controlled by the Montreal Protocol do not have the necessary experience with the issues surrounding the use, recovery, recycling, reclamation, and banking of these agents. To address these issues, parties may wish to consider: 2022 TEAP Progress Report - Volume 1 11 Supporting programmes to mitigate the loss in institutional memory of fire protection agents controlled by the Montreal Protocol; and Supporting awareness programmes to address recovery, recycling, reclamation, and banking of halons as well as HCFC and HF C fire protection agents. 1.4.3 MBTOC In 2020, reported methyl bromide ( MB) consumption for controlled uses was only 69 tonnes , although stocks substantially higher than this may be used in some sectors in various countries. After 20 years of applications for MB critical use during which substantial R&D has taken place on alternatives, some non -A5 parties continue to make critical use nominations without adoption of alternatives. Quarantine and pre -shipment ( QPS) uses of MB (approx imately 10,00 0 tonnes per year), which are exempted from the Montreal Protocol controls, far exceed the use of MB for controlled uses and continue to be the major anthropogenic contributor of MB to the stratosphere. Over the last decade, some parties have succeeded in completely phasing out QPS use of MB , however, the overall global consumption of MB for QPS has not changed markedly since some A5 parties have increased QPS consumption substantially. Despite this, research programs globally are continuing to find success ful alternatives to replace MB. The successful application of alternatives to QPS would accelerate the decline in stratospheric MB levels with a near -term impact on ozone. Since 1999, the reduction in MB production and use from controlled uses has led to a reduction greater than 30% in the concentration of MB in the atmosphere and this has been responsible for more than 35% of the present fall in Effective Equivalent Stratospheric Chlorine and a key driver for the recovery of the ozone layer . Recent data , however, shows that a decline in the atmospheric levels of MB has stalled as emissions of MB from QPS uses and from any unreported uses continue unabated. MBTOC notes that near-term reduction of atmospheric concentrations of MB in the future will overwhelmi ngly rely on reduction in emissions from QPS or any unknown /unreported uses. A significant proportion of e missions of MB from QPS can be reduced by recapture, recycling and/or reuse. Recapture of MB from QPS uses have recently been reviewed in New Zealand (NZ), with stepwise increases in use of recapture required by regulations implemented to phase out methyl bromide emisions. In addition, fumigation of the holds of ships with MB will be banned from 2023. Some specific bilateral agreements are reducing MB use. For instance, India and Canada have agreed to lift the MB fumigation requirement for Canadian pulse s export ed to India while a systems approach is being established . This measure will potentially reduce QPS MB treatments of pulses on arrival substanti ally. It appears that some parties still have difficulties in identifying and reporting MB use for QPS purposes . MBTOC considers Q and PS to have different priority for use of MB with PS uses having greater potential for adoption of alternatives. PS uses could potentially be phased out because there are technically alternatives which are widely available and suitable worldwide. MBTOC considers that these readily available alternatives for PS could result in replacing 30 -40% (i.e ., 3000-4000 tonnes) of the total QPS MB use by alternatives. Parties could consider requesting TEAP/MBTOC to update information on QPS uses and their alternatives, specifically allocating the uses under Q versus PS. Sulfuryl fluoride (SF) is widely registered and adopted around the world as an alternative to MB for disinfestation of dried fruit, tree nuts, grain flour, and timber , and is a key alternative to MB for treatment of empty structures such as flour mills and food and feed processing premises. In recen t 2022 TEAP Progress Report - Volume 1 12 years, however, there is growing concern about the high 20-year GWP value of SF currently set at 7510 and MBTOC considers it prudent to ensure that other alternatives are considered. 1.4.4 MCTOC Medical and Chemicals Technical Options Committee provides information on the production and use of controlled substances, including for chemical feedstock, HFC -23 by -production and emissions, and new developments for metered dose inhalers (MDIs). It also includes background to, and an update on, TEAP's assessmen t of destruction technologies under decision XXX/6, to be included in MCTOC's 2022 Assessment Report. The status of aerosols (other than MDI s), laboratory and analytical uses, process agent uses, and n -propyl bromide were reviewed, however, no compelling new information is reported this report. Production issues As reported by FTOC, t here have been reported challenges relating to production and chemical supply in the transition to low -GWP HCFO and HFO foam blowing agents . These challenges relate to several factors , including production constraints, restrictive manufacturing and application patents, high prices of HCFO/HFOs relative to HCFC -141b and HFC blowing agents, and regional shortages of CTC used as starting raw material in the process to manuf acture HCFO/HFOs. New production capacity for HCFO/HFOs is expected to become available in 2023. Feedstock use of controlled substances The proportions of the largest controlled ODS feedstocks in 2020 are HCFC -22 (48% of the and HCFC -142b used to produce tetrafluoroethylene , which is then used to make fluoropolymers such as polytetrafluoroethylene . HCFC -142b is used to make polyvinylidene fluoride. The feedstock use of CTC has increased in recent ye ars, due to growing demand for lower GWP HCFO/ HFOs and perchloroethylene (PCE). Accurate and consistent Article 7 reporting of production of co ntrolled substa nces, including for feedstock uses, contributes to the better understanding and assessment of atm ospheric burdens of controlled substances. Reported production can be correlated with related emissions of controlled substances. There are some products that are not reported because they are intermediates not isolated in a chemical manufacturing process. These i ntermediates may also be emitted in low quantities and detected by atmospheric monitoring. In chemical production, a non -isolated intermediate in a chemical process is not considered as a finished product while it remains within the chemical proces s. As such, a non -isolated intermediate is not commonly reported. However, a substance that is isolated, most likely purified to a specification, and then used in a distinct, separate process, would be considered as a finished product and subject to report ing as production for feedstock use. Destruction technologies Decision XXX/6 on destruction technologies for controlled substances requests TEAP to assess destruction technologies listed (in annex II to the MOP -30 report) as not approved or not determined, as well as any other technologies, and to report to the Open -ended Working Group prior to MOP -33. In consultation with the Ozone Secretariat, TEAP and its MCTOC reported in 2021 that an assessment in response to decision XXX/6 will be included in MCTOC's 2022 Assessment Report based on available information. MCTOC outlined preparations for its assessment of destruction technologies under this decision in the 2020 and 2021 TEAP Progress Reports, including suggested guidance on the type of relevant informati on needed for assessment, which is included again in this report. The 2020 and 2021 TEAP Progress Reports invited parties to submit this type of information in response to decision XXX/6 paragraph 3. Information from parties was requested to be submitted n o later than January 2022 to allow time for assessment. No information has been submitted. The opportunity has now passed for MCTOC to assess new data in time for its 2022 Assessment Report. MCTOC is not currently aware of new information, such as test dat a, relating to already approved destruction technologies or new 2022 TEAP Progress Report - Volume 1 13 technologies that would allow an assessment. MCTOC is aware of some developments in existing approved destruction technologies and emerging trends that are noteworthy to report in the Assessme nt Report. In future, parties may wish to consider providing any new information for TEAP assessment of destruction technologies in January of the same year in which its assessment would be reported either as part of annual TEAP Progress Reports or future quadrennial assessments. Metered inhalers (SMIs), and other delivery systems all play an important role in the treatment of asthma and COPD . New alternative propellant technologies to high-GWP HFC MDIs are under development. DPIs, soft mist inhalers and nebulisers are already available for most molecules and combinations as alternatives to high -GWP MDIs, offering a lower carbon footprint. 1.4.5 RTOC Since the publicati on of the RTOC 2018 Assessment Report, one new single component refrigerant and eighteen refrigerant blends have received a designation/classification from the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air -Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) Standard 34 and/or from the International Standards Organisation (ISO) 817. These eighteen refrigerants are listed in tables 6.1, 6.2 and 6.3. Their GWP and ODP values are calculated in the same way as the ones given in the RTOC 2018 Assessment Report. The importance of reducing direct and indirect CO 2 emissions from the RACHP sector is gaining increasing attention, especially the sustainable design and operation of equipment taking into account the strong growth of the equipment base. Improving the equipmen t energy efficiency during the HFC phase -down is one major opportunity to reduce energy demand, alongside the phasing down of equipment containing high GWP HFCs. Training in the servicing and maintenance of RACHP equipment to reduce leaks will also reduce emissions of high GWP HFCs. There has been significant progress with the development of safety standards to support the transition towards lower GWP alternative refrigerants, that are mostly flammable. IEC 60335 -2-89 (applicable to commercial refrigeration ) was revised to include larger charges of flammable refrigerants (up to 500 g - 1200 g given certain boundary conditions) and is currently being transferred to national standards. The new edition of the standard IEC 60335 -2-405 was approved in April 20 22 by the International Electrotechnical Commission. The approved revised version will allow HC -290 (propane), and other flammable refrigerants, to be used in many air conditioning systems and heat pumps that were previously prohibited by the previous vers ion of the standard from using these refrigerants. The revised safety standard allows for the use of a larger charge of flammable refrigerants (up to 988g of HC -290 in a standard split air conditioning system). This will be possible on new equipment that must have additional safety requirements to ensure the same high level of safety as equipment that does not use flammable refrigerants. 5 Household and similar electrical appliances - Safety - Part 2 -40: Particular requirements for electrical heat pumps, air - conditioners and dehumidifiers 2022 TEAP Progress Report - Volume 1 14 The use of flammable refrigerants in air conditioning equipment will lead to a reduction in direct climate emissions comp ared to systems using R410A. 2022 TEAP Progress Report - Volume 1 15 2 Flexible and Rigid Foams TOC (FTOC) Progress Report 2.1 Introduction In non -A5 parties, regulations are driving transitions away from high GWP HFCs, whereas in A5 parties, HPMPs continue to drive transitions. Low - GWP blowing agent shortages continue in both A5 and non -A5 parties which may be due to pandemic -related supply chain issues, raw material and supply chain shortages, manufacturing issues, and severe weather. Undisclosed manufacturin g issues from at least one supplier have led to force majeure declaration , according to a number of foam manufacturers. As a result, there has been a significant increase in the use of hydrofluorocarbon HFC blend in A5 parties and a reversion to HFC - 365mfc blends and HFC -245fa in some non -A5 parties. Prices of HFCs have also increased during the pandemic. There have also been reported shortages of hydrocarbons, such as cyclopentane. The transition away from ODS foam blowing agents in some regions and market segments (e.g. , spray foam and extruded polystyrene [XPS]) may be delayed because of cost, especially where local codes require higher thermal performance 6. It should be noted that the price of HFC blowin g agents is nearly as high as HFO/HCFO prices were prior to the pandemic in some A5 parties. The importation of ozone -depleting foam blowing agents is controlled or under license, and more parties are controlling the import of polyols containing HCFC -141b or other ODS. More action is pending with import restrictions and potential requirements to add a label stating \"containing HCFC 141b in formulated polyols\". It is possible that consolidation among foam manufacturing companies may occur during the phaseo ut of HCFC blowing agents in A5 parties, as it did in non -A5 parties7. o There is new manufacturing capacity of HCFO -1224yd(Z) in Japan and significant quantities of HCFO -1233zd(E) in China. HFO -1336mzz(E), with a boiling point of approximately 9\u00b0C, is also reportedly available in small quantities in some regions o Non-A5 and A5 parties are facing challenges with the supply of HFO/HCFOs. This has led to market growth of HFC -365mfc in some A5 parties and reversion to HFC -245fa in some non-A5 parties. 2.2 Globa l Foams Market The annual growth in production of polymer foam was projected to be an estimated 3.8% from 2020 to 20278 to 4.8%9 led by growth in emerging markets. However, the effect of the pandemic and its economic after -effects introduces significant uncertainty to growth projections. It is now assumed that global production may not recover to 2019 levels until 2024 or later. Overall, the global production of XPS remained stable prior to the pandemic. This material is typically used for its low -moisture permeability and high -compression strength in applications including refrigerated transport, perimeter insulation and cold store s. Polyurethane, polyisocyanurate, and phenolic rigid foam are not used as widely as other thermal insulation materials in building 6 Although the cost of hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) was approximately 20 -30% of the cost of high -GWP HFCs, HCFC price is increasing as they are phased out globally. T he low price of some high-GWP HFCs, particularly HFC -365mfc which is banned in some non-A5 parties, is leading to an increase in market share, which is slowing the conversion to low- GWP blowing agents 7 There may be some extra capacity that will be resolved at this time especially where local demand has changed due to building codes or other changes in construction design and overall demand. 8 Polymer Foam Market Size, Share & Trends Analysis Report, 2020 - 2027 - Grand View Researxh as viewed 4/3/22 9 The Future of High Perfoemance to 2021 - Smithers as viewed 4/3/22 2022 TEAP Progress Report - Volume 1 16 insulation due to relatively high cost. However, the low thermal conductivity of all three types of foam at wide operating t emperatures dominates the insulation demand from the cold chain and district cooling and heating systems, including internal building services usage. Polymer foams encasing vacuum -insulated panels in appliances and aerogels in industrial pipe insulation offer ultra -high insulation performance and are used in specialized applications in refrigeration and construction. 2.2.1 Major Issues Influencing the Global Foams Market Continued focus on reducing heating and cooling load in buildings and appl iances will likely include the increased use of polymeric foams as thermal insulation. Global growth in population influences the demand for polymeric foams used in the main end -use industries, including building & construction, the cold chain, furniture & bedding, packaging and transportation industries (e.g. , automotive industries (cars, buses, motorcycles), trains, ships etc.) . Polyurethane, polyisocyanurates, polystyrene and phenolic foams contribute to the energy efficiency of heating and cooling syste ms in buildings, while flexible polyurethane foams provide acoustic insulation, energy absorption for packaging , and comfort in applications such as mattresses and furniture. The main factors influencing thermal insulation requirements are legislati ve, regula tory, and building standard mandate s to reduce heating and cooling loads in commercial and residential buildings. The EU and NA are currently the leading proponents of building codes to improve energy efficiency in the construction industry, while th e global appliance industry continues to develop new more energy - efficient models. Investment in infrastructure in China includes several end -uses for polymeric foams. The investment programme includes a range of opportunities for polymeric foams in the c old chain, district cooling and heating, high speed rail and the construction of temperature -controlled data server centres. Simplification of building codes may also allow greater use of polymeric foams for insulation materials in residential and commerci al buildings. According to Markets and Markets10, the global cold chain market size is estimated to be valued at USD 233.8 billion in 2020 and is projected to reach USD 340.3 billion by 2025, recording a compound annual growth rate ( CAGR ) of 7.8%. There is significant increasing demand f rom the retail sector and to mitigate food waste and degradation . The Asia Pacific region is expected to grow the fastest due to the presence of major food and healthcare providers. In Europe, the volume of XPS foam insulation is increasing in line with gross domestic product (GDP ) growth with variation in individual countries. There is some increased demand for thick (>200mm) XPS panels to meet certain construction requirements11. 10 Cold Chain Market by Application (Fruits & Vegetables, Dairy & Frozen Desserts, Fish, Meat & Seafood, Bakery & Confectionery), Temperature Type (Frozen, Chilled), Type (Refrigerated Transport, Refrigerated Warehous ing), Region - Global Forecast to 2025 - Markets and Markets as viewed 4/3/22 11 Thicker XPS is used decoratively and for roofs where they can be cut around protruding features. Thicker foams also do not allow for moisture intrusion between layers which red uces thermal performance and provide more weight for ballast to prevent wind uplift and may have implications for building structure. Multiple layer XPS foam manufacturing techniques usually require the use of bonding chemicals which may increase thermal conductivity or water transfer. Additionally, those chemicals are likely to make the recycling process of XPS either much more complica ted or impossible which is economically undesirable. There are very few manufacturers that can produce this as a monolithic board, leading to the use of multiple layers, which has some disadvantages, or the need by producers to invest in new thermal bondin g technology. 2022 TEAP Progress Report - Volume 1 17 In NA, use of all insulation continues to recover from the pandemic, however the use of XPS appears to be growing at a lower rate especially where other products (e.g. , EPS for construction below ground) may be replacing XPS a s building insulation requireme nts change and builders seek the most cost-effective insulation. There is likely to be some recovery of all markets negatively impacted by the pandemic, including construction projects halted due to lack of funds, quarantine mandates, and resulting labour shortages In Japan, \"The Act on Rational Use and Proper Managemen t of Fluorocarbon\", was amended effective April 1, 2020, to require companies to submit a voluntary action plan for the HFC phase down /phase out. In 2020, the average GWP of blowing agents used by the residential spray foam industry was limited to less th an 100, with a target HFC consumption of less than 620MT in 2020 and 450MT by 2024. The average GWP of the system houses that met the goal by 2020 was 17.3 with the remainder achieving the goal by Se ptember 2021. There were challenges with the cold chain transition and the total HFC consumption was 821MT over the action plan. 2.3 Factors Impacting Blowing Agent Choice It has been estimated that 80 -84% of HCFC -141b in A5 parties will be replaced with non - fluorocarbon alternatives including water -blown foams . Evolving HCFC and HFC phase -out plans will have a large impact on the choices of non - ODP options. In A5 parties , a growing number of foam producers are required by regulation to transition to zero ODP blowing agents. In some parties, use of HCFCs is now limited to applications where HCs are nearly universally considered to be unsuitable, such as PU spray foam. Many parties are limiting the import of CFC -11 and HCFC -141b pre -blended polyols to prevent manufacture of foa m using ODS. There is a growing trend for small - and medium -sized enterprises (SMEs) consuming 1000 tonnes or more to self -formulate blends for their own systems especially in Asia. As designed, as the phasedown progresses, the limited availability and inc reasing price of HCFCs will drive the selection of foam blowing agents. The availability of high-GWP HFCs, particularly HFC - 365mfc/HFC -227ea (which is banned in many non-A5 parties), is preventing the transition to low GWP substances. However, due to the pandemic, its price has reportedly risen to the pre-pandemic price of HFC -245fa. China's Ministry of Housing, Urban, and Rural Development is streamlining the existing 3,000 standards into 300. It is likely to modify GB50016 \"Code of Design on Building Fir e Protection and Prevention\" allowing for additional use of spray foam, which presents a significant challenge to small and medium -sized enterprises ( SMEs ) on choice of blowing agents. In Latin America, some parties may ban imports of HCFC -141b and HCFC -141b containing polyols in the largest PU foam markets in the near term. Some parties are also considering labelling requirements stating \"containing HCFC 141b\" on drums and containers of formulated polyol using HCFC -141b and its blends. These measure s could improve control on HCFC -141b commercialised in the region. During the last decade, major enterprises, mainly in the domestic/commercial refrigeration and continuous panel sectors have been successfully converted to HCs. HCFC Phaseout Management Plan (HPMP) projects continue to focus on implementation at SMEs, examining a wide range of non- HC pure and blended blowing agents (e.g. low volumes of HFOs, CO 2 (water), methyl formate, methylal (dimethoxymethane), and blends). The use of hydrocarbons pre-blended in foams continues to be of concern, as their use requires safety measures and plant modifications for blending facilities and for SMEs. 2022 TEAP Progress Report - Volume 1 18 In India, approximately 70% of companies are using non -ODS/low -GWP technologies. The remainder are using HFCs. No companies are using HCFCs. In some A5 parties, there has been an increase in the use of methylal, methylene chloride12 and hydrocarbons, spe cifically pentanes, with HFCs to reduce cost. There are some limits to availability and allowance of use because of safety (flammability) and health (human exposure) concerns. In non-A5 parties , in the EU, high -GWP fluorinated gases are being phased down under F -Gas Regulations. In 2015 in the EU, all HFCs with GWP greater than 150 were banned for foam manufacturing for use in domestic appliances. By January 2023, all HFCs with GWP greater than 150 will cease being used in all foam manufacturin g. Foams and polyol -blends containing HFC must be labelled, and the presence of any HFC has to be mentioned in the technical documentation and marketing brochures. The F -Gas Regulation operates on the supply -side through a quota system, which means that su pply of HFC blowing agents to the foam sector is being constrained well before the phase -out dates and sees a major shift from HFC systems towards HFO. Product standards are being reviewed to incorporate the new blowing agents to support CE marking and the Declaration of Performance required when placing construction products on the EU market. The regulation of HFOs and HCFOs are different between parties. In some EU countries, unsaturated HCFCs and HFCs are defined as volatile organic compounds (VOC) and require environmental permits for use. Other EU countries exempt them from VOC regulations based on their Maximum Incremental Reactivity (MIR) in comparison to ethane. Denmark, which previously regulated unsaturated HCFCs and HFCs by the same laws as high -GWP HFCs, has lifted the restriction when the GWP value is below 5 through a dedicated ordinance. In Switzerland, under the Swiss ODS Ordinance, HCFO -1233zd which has an ODP of 0.00034 is considered an ODS. However, the law provides a mechanism for obtaini ng exemption based on the low -GWP value and its energy efficiency. Some governments are developing regulations related to per - and poly -fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), the definition of which may or may not include Montreal Protocol controlled substances a nd their substitutes. This is creating uncertainty for industry regarding long -term availability of some alternatives. Some companies and other stakeholders have reported that they are delaying decisions regarding selection of alternatives with concerns ab out how those fluorinated alternatives might be limited as a result of regulations. 2.3.1 Low-Pressure Spray Foam Two-component polyurethane spray foam products processed by low-pressure mixing is often used to seal gaps in the building envelope and insula te cavities in the building. Polyol blends are stored in pre-pressurized tanks at low pressure and often contain a liquid and a gaseous blowing agent (to propel the blend into the cavity) . The pressurized foam system can create challenges in maintaining stability of low-GWP blowing agents and catalysts.13 However, recent research shows improved stability of polyol blends14 2.4 HFOs and HCFOs in Current Use HFOs /HCFOs provide an alternative to HCs that can eliminate or reduce the flammability or use of flame retardant for polyurethane, polyisocyanurate, and extruded thermoplastic foam production, 12 Methylene chloride is a controlled substance in some parties due to its use in processing cocaine. 13Recent papers focus on catalysts for the trimerization reaction. 14 Koh et al, Novel Concept to Improve Shelf Life of LP 2K SPF with HFO 1234ze 2021 Center for Thomas et al' Low GWP Two -Component Low Pressure Spray Foam Using CO2 as a Blowing Agent ; 2021 Center for Polyurethane Institute Conference 2022 TEAP Progress Report - Volume 1 19 eliminating the capital investment required to address safety when using HCs as a blowing agent. In addition, HFOs/HCFOs can result in improved foam insulating values compared to HC blown foams. There have been significant improvements in the development and availability of additives, co -blowing agents, equipment , and formulat ions enabling the successful commercialization of foams containing low GWP blowing agents. The transition by SMEs to HFOs/HCFOs is currently slowed by both their greater expense, and limited but improving, supply in A5 parties. HFO/HCFOs are sometimes ble nded with other blowing agents to reduce costs in both A5 and non -A5 parties. Manufacturers of HFO/HCFOs have increased capacity of some of the HFOs/HCFOs to meet the demand for low GWP blowing agents that is expected to result from the implementation of l ow GWP regulations. Continued coordination could be helpful to ensure that there is adequate supply as regulations are implemented. In Japan, shortages of HFOs/HCFOs slowed HFC conversions in rigid polyurethane foams in volumes of HFOs/HCFOs reac hing 3700MT in 2021. Markets also contracted in particularly in spray foam . In 2020 HCFO -1224yd(Z) was commercialized in Japan15. The boiling point of HCFO - 1224yd(Z) is the same a s that of HFC -245fa. HCFO -1224yd(Z) is also used as a refrigerant and solvent in addition to blowing agent . The Multilateral Fund published outcomes from a demonstration project at foam system houses16 to formulate pre -blended polyols for spray polyurethane foam applications using new catalyst package s that resulted in foam properties comparable to those blown with HCFC -141b . The cost of the foam was 22-46% greater than the cost prior to the pandemic. Methyl formate used as a sole blowing agent continues to increase around the world in rigid foam applications and integral skin foam applications. It is also being used in A5 parties as a co -blowing agent with HFCs for various rigid foam applications. Methyl formate blends with HFCs are also being used in the United States for manufacturing XPS boards and in some cases blends with HFCs and HCFOs for ri gid polyurethane foams. 2.4.1 Extruded Polystyrene (XPS) Foam Blowing Agents Some XPS manufacturers note that there continue to be challenges for the conversion of XPS foam blowing agents for some foams and regions depending on specific product needs noti ng that new foam blowing agents cannot directly replace current products and that the need to maintain density does not necessarily allow for reduced loading of higher cost blowing agents. They further note that preparation for conversion to flammable17 blowing agents requires approximately18 to 36 months for capital investment and product qualification based on the specific end use (e.g. , walls, roofs, structural support, transportation, cold storage. It was also noted that at least one non -flammable. mid -range (750 GWP) blend, containing HFC -134a, is currently under consideration for use. 15 Its boiling point is 15oC and its molecular weight i s 149 16 http://www.multilateralfund.org/Our%20Work/DemonProject/Document%20Library/8311ax5_Thailand.pdf 17 A new paper on flammability hazards of HFO -1234ze during processing. Comprehensive Evaluation of of HFO -1234ze ; R.J. Bellair, L.S. Hood, Process Protection, In Press (2019). https://www.sciencedirect.com/user/error/ATP -2?pii=S0957582019313734 2022 TEAP Progress Report - Volume 1 20 In China there are Chinese equipment vendors offering both CO 2 based and HFC solutions for medium to large enterprises. It is expected that CO 2 based systems will predom inate for the phase out of HCFCs. Other blowing agents and co -blowing agents continue to be used in small quantities. Isopropyl chloride (2 -Chloropropane) is blended with isopentane generally for phenolic foam. Foam additives FA188 and PF are highly fluorinated, C5 or greater olefins whose GWPs are close to 100 and have been viewed technically as nucleating agents. However, based on the European Norm standard (EN13165), this material can be found in the cell gas after 6 months at 70\u00b0C in polyis ocyanurate (PIR) foam, so then it is also classified as a blowing agent. A patented chemical blowing agent (trade named CFA818) is being promoted, as a foam blowing agent, to the polyurethane market by China's Butian New Materials and Technology Company. It is expected that other innovative chemical and physical blowing . The technology involves carbonic acid salts of polymeric amines which liberate CO 2 upon heating above a certain temperature, typical of polyurethane processing conditions. Hence, it is a la tent source of CO 2 blowing gas but has limitations due to relatively high residual water content and low molar mass of bound CO 2. It is expected that other innovative chemical and physical blowing agent technologies may be introduced over the coming years . 18 PCT/CN2017/083948 (WO2017206692 A1) 201610393108.0 (CN107089927A) 2022 1 21 3. Halons TOC (HTOC) Progress Report 3.1 Introduction Owing to the COVID -19 travel restrictions, the HTOC has been holding monthly virtual meetings and plans to continue to do so. As such, the HTOC did not meet in person in Q1 of 2022. Instead, a series of virtual meetings was held during the week of 21 March 2022, each one focused on a specific chapter of the 2022 Assessment Report. In addition, with travel restrictions now easing, the HTOC is planning an in -person meeting in June 2022 to finali se the Peer -Review Draft of the 2022 Assessment Report. 3.2 Effect of the HFC Production Phase -down In the 2018 Assessment Report, the HTOC anticipated that the initial 10% reduction in HFC production within non-Article 5 parties would not have a significant impact on the availability of HFCs for fire protection. It was reasoned that the use of HFCs in f ire protection is extremely small in comparison to other uses, the emissions are low, and sales of HFCs in most non -Article 5 parties were either declining or flat. Instead, the experience in the EU and Japan has shown a movement away from the use of HFCs in new fire protection systems (although use of HFCs in Japan has never been widespread). HFCs have been replaced in large part by low -GWP and no -GWP alternatives such as FK -5-1-12 and inert gases. The US HFC phase -down began on January 1, 2022, and it has already had an impact on the cost and availability of newly produced HFCs for fire protection. The US allocation system is GWP -weighted and the HFCs used for fire protection have very high GWPs, so the impact has been greater than initially expected. It i s the HTOC's experience that HFCs contained in fire protection equipment historically have been recycled and reused to a relatively high extent. As the supply of newly produced HFCs for fire protection decreases in response to phase -down regulations, recyc ling becomes even more important as an alternative source of supply and is likely to increase in the future. Parties may wish to consider re -emphasizing the need to foster international trade of -236fa used in legacy fire protection applications, which include those in civil aviation lavatory fire protection systems. 3.3 Availability and Quality of Recycled Halon 1301 The HTOC has identified several issues affecting the availability and quali ty of recovered halon 1301 from the civil aviation sector. The issues concerning contaminated halon recovered from the aviation sector are at best continuing but possibly getting worse based on input provided to the HTOC by recycling companies. The Halon Recycling Corporation (HRC), as part of their outreach progr am on proper halon management, has recently developed a guidance document for airlines and maintenance, repair , and overhaul (MRO) companies that outlines best practices for eliminating contamination during servicing. This free guidance document is availab le via the HTOC for wide -spread dissemination. Likewise, t he previously reported issue with some countries placing regulatory barriers that restrict the import of fire extinguishing components containing halons that are required for emergency replenishmen t after a halon discharge is continuing. The previously reported difficulties in shipping bulk recovered halon 1301 across national boundaries as some authorities appear to be classifying recovered halon as hazardous waste under the Basel Convention, thus preventing shipment also continu es. 2022 TEAP Progress Report - Volume 1 22 The world's first pilot halon destruction and carbon offset project occurred in February 2021 in the US, where approximately 1.2 2 tonnes of halon 1301 were destroyed under the American Carbon Registry, a private voluntar y US greenhouse gas registry. This methodology incentivizes destruction of Halon 1211 and Halon 1301 from fire equipment or systems . The HTOC does not know whether the Halon 1301 used in the pilot destruction project was not reclaimable (due to contaminati on), and therefore destruction was the best option, or whether regardless of the halon quality, the project proceeded purely on the basis of wanting to dispose of the halon to meet \"sustainability \" commitments of the entities involved to creat e carbon offset credits for transactional / commercial purposes. Owing to the continued global halon demand in enduring fire protection applications such as aviation, the HTOC has previously recommended that destruction as a final disposition option shou ld be considered only if the halons are contaminated and cannot be reclaimed to an acceptable purity. The HTOC continues to maintain this position . Furthermore , the HTOC recommends extending this position to all halogenated gaseous fire extinguishants and recommends destruction only as a final resort when any fire extinguishant cannot be reclaimed to industry specifications. The HTOC believes that shipbreaking could represent a significant source of halon 1301 which could support on -going activities. Bearing that in mind the entire fleet of ships with halon on -board are reaching their end of life and this supply of halon will then be exhausted, it is imperative that recovery of halons from this source be prioritized and conserve d to the greatest extent possible. Parties may wish to consider: Requesting the Ozone Secretariat to disseminate the halon management guidance documen t recently developed by HRC available from the HTOC, to all National Ozone Units (NOUs) and sponsoring presentations during all upcoming Ozone Regional Manager Network and other applicable meetings, Liaising with their civil aviation authorities to dissemi nate the halon management guidance document to all applicable entities within their country such as airlines, maintenance, repair , and overhaul (MRO) companies , and associated non -governmental organisations (NGOs), Requesting that the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) formally disseminate through a State letter, th is halon management guidance document to all civil aviation authorities requesting that the halon management guidance document receive the widest possible disse mination within their State and/or region, Emphasising the importance of effective and complete recovery of halons to minimize halon losses by all parties, particularly those with shipbreaking activities, and Re-emphasising the need to allow for appropriat e, open trade of recovered, recycled and/or reclaimed halons in bulk containers and in prefilled fire protection components to support enduring halons uses, including civil aviation components that are required to allow aircraft to operate under internatio nal airworthiness requirements. 3.4 Proposed EU Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) Regulations Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) refers to a class of chemicals that contains fluorine atoms bonded to carbon atoms. Histor ically, PFAS was used to describe longer chain compounds that were used in products such as paper, textiles, leather, carpets, and firefighting foam. The regulation of PFAS chemicals initially focused on perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooc tanoic acid (PFOA) both used in firefighting foams. In June 2020, five European countries - Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Denmark - officially declared their intention to submit to the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) a proposal for a Registrat ion, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) restriction covering all PFAS chemicals. This proposed, expanded definition in the EU would define PFAS as any substance that contains at least one fully 2022 TEAP Progress Report - Volume 1 23 fluorinated carbon CF 2 or CF 3 group (without any H/Cl/Br/I atom attached). This definition of PFAS would encompass virtually all of the halogenated, clean agent alternatives to halons, HCFCs and high-GWP HFC fire extinguishing agents (HFC -23 and CF hydro chlorofluorocarbon (HCFC) -124, HCFC and Halocarbon Blend 55 could all be included in the proposed regulations . The proposed restriction would prohibit the manufacture, import, sale and use of PFAS and products containing PFAS at some future date. The expected date of submission of the PFAS restriction proposal to ECHA is January 2023. Based on the current schedule if a PFAS REACH restriction is adopted it would likely be completed in 2025 and become effective sometime after that. REACH restrictions usually include exemptions (derogations) for uses that have no alternatives that are considered essential. Regardless of w hether derogations are granted or not, these uses represent only a very small market. This, in turn, would have a direct bearing on commercial viability of these agents, potentially influencing decisions to continue use of non -PFAS agents (i.e., halons or HFC -23). Restricting or prohibiting the sale or use of these gaseous agents would have significant impacts on the ability of users to effectively protect a range of special hazards from fire and explosion (as described in existing HTOC Assessment Reports a nd Technical Notes available on the Ozone Secretariat website). Further, derogations are typically limited to only allow sufficient time for industry to develop alternatives. Fire protection timescales for development and deployment are long, with timescal es for some applications such as civil aviation being extremely long and often uncertain. As an example, 2-BTP is the result of a 20 -year search for an alternative to Halon 1211 in aviation hand -held extinguishers. It is currently replacing Halon 1211 on m ost new production aircraft, and all existing aircraft in the EU are expected to be retrofit under existing regulation to 2 -BTP by 2026. It took 15 years once identified as a potential candidate to replace Halon 1211 to develop and gain approval. There are now no other candidate agents for this use that do not fall under this broad PFAS definition. CF 3I is removed from consideration owing to toxicity, and all of the not -in-kind alternatives that have been tested for this use failed the minimum performance s tandards. In other words, the only alternative to 2 -BTP would be to revert back to (or keep using ) Halon 1211. This is similar to many uses of halon 1301 where the only agents that will work are the original halon or high -GWP HFCs, e.g., extremely low temp erature applications, aviation lavatories, and some military applications. 3.5 New Developments in Aviation Fire Protection Handheld fire extinguishers containing halon 1211 on aircraft registered in the EU will be banned after 2025 according to EU legisl ation. They will most likely be replaced on civil passenger aircraft with 2 -BTP extinguishers although pending regulation of 2 -BTP as a PFAS is a concern. Additionally, the announced withdrawal of the Underwriters Laboratories (UL) standard for halon extinguishers should lead to cessation of UL -marked extinguisher production after January 2025, regardless of whether the aircraft is registered in the EU or not. This may drive replacement of halon 1211 extinguishers outside of the EU for logistics/standa rdization reasons, thus increasing the amount of halon 1211 extinguishers being removed from service. As civil aviation represents a significant fraction of the halon 1211 market, as it transitions to alternatives there may be implications on the overall m arket for recycled halon 1211, which could affect availability for other users. Alternatives to halon 1211 have yet to be developed for the different sizes of handheld extinguishers that are installed onboard military aircraft and helicopters, and on small er civil aircraft. The process of replacing an extinguisher is costly and is delaying the development of the smaller unit used in cockpits and the larger one used in baggage compartments in these aircraft. The HTOC anticipates difficulties in replacing the se other extinguishers as there are currently no standardized test methods, classifications , or certification procedures for these other -sized extinguishers. Pending regulation on 2-BTP as a PFAS in the EU also adds uncertainty to resolving this issue. 2022 TEAP Progress Report - Volume 1 24 R&D for cargo compartment fire protection systems continues. However, the development and certification timescales remain long and can be uncertain. As such, it will still be at least several more years before any of the fire extinguishing agent s being evalua ted could be in service on aircraft. If these are not successful. t he chances of finding an as -yet undiscovered alternative that is safe and effective are, after so many years of research, extremely low. Parties may wish to consider requesting that ICAO c ontinue to sponsor activities related to halon regulation and management, include the HTOC in these activities, and work with the HTOC to provide annual updates on changes to their halon regulations, the status of development and implementation of aviation alternatives and other halon management issues important for the long - term use and management of halons. 3.6 New Fire Extinguishing Agents 3.6.1 HCFO/Fluoroketone blend A new total flooding agent to potentially 1301 HFC -125, has been introduced to the US National Fire Protection Association and International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) fire protection commi ttees. It is a 50 -50% blend by mass of the hydrochlorofluoroolefin HCFO -1233zd (E) and the fluoroketone FK 5 -1-12. Both components have low GWPs and negligible or zero ODPs. However, both of the components fall under the proposed definition of PFAS by the E U. It is too early to determine whether this blend will be a viable alternative to halons, HCFCs and high -GWP HFCs. The HTOC will continue to monitor and report progress on this agent. 3.6.2 Update from India Owing to the COVID -19 pandemic, little progress has been made recently on development of new extinguishing agents. Toxicity studies are planned, but the timescale for completing these is not known at this time. Some intermediate -scale fire tests are planned for the near future. 3.6.3 Market Considerations Halons have been replaced with a range of firefighting alternatives meaning that any one agent has less of a market share than the agent it is replacing. Additionally, the experience with recycling of halons has shown that proper agent manag ement will greatly reduce the need for newly produced agent. Therefore, the potential market for any new, single fire suppressant diminishes thereby making the business decision to develop new alternatives less attractive than in the past. Thus, fewer comp anies are willing to invest the significant resources necessary to develop chemicals that do not have wider application than fire suppression. For example, one major chemical manufacturer with a long history of providing firefighting agents has indicated t o at least one potentially interested party that they do not plan to further the commercialization of a promising candidate solely as a potential total flooding alternative for halon 1301, HFC -227ea or HFC -125 due to its relatively small projected market ( already competing with other existing alternatives such as FK -5-1-12, inert gases, water, etc.) unless and until it were to find broader use in non -fire application(s). The HTOC is concerned that after many years of ongoing research, the chances of finding an as -yet undiscovered alternative that is safe and effective are now extremely low. Although initially reported as an issue for portable extinguishers in civil aviation, the loss of UL listing for fire extinguishing parts for halon 1301 systems is being reported to affect enduring users of halons outside of civil aviation as well. This can affect the ability to continue to use halon in these fire protection systems thereby changing market demand. It is not clear at this point how much of an effect this w ill have on the availability or price of recycled halons. The HTOC will continue to monitor this issue. 2022 TEAP Progress Report - Volume 1 25 3.7 Other Updates 3.7.1 Effects of Alternative Refrigerants Selection The HTOC continues to express concern , as raised in the 2021 HTOC Progress Report, with expanded use of alternative refrigerants due to their potential flammability and yet to be determined effects on firefighting systems (e.g. , agent effectiveness, by -products generated, etc.). In addition t o industry standard tests for measuring flame propagation (ASHRAE -34/ISO -817), new methods are being developed , but not yet available, to address these concerns . Additional information will be included in the HTOC 2022 Assessment Report 3.7.2 Knowledge and training The HTOC has a continuing concern regarding the historical knowledge that has been lost due to the length of time over which the Montreal Protocol activities have been conducted . Many personnel who are currently responsible for managing fire protection agents covered by the Montreal Protocol are not experienced with the issues surrounding the use, recovery, recycling, reclamation , and banking of these agents. The HTOC is finding that this is becoming an increasing challenge as it works with various parties and organi sations on issues related to acquiring halons or identifying alternatives to meet their continuing needs. For example, m any NOU staff members indicated to the HTOC that they are looking for information that is already available from HTOC reports, but they seem unaware that the information is available and/or where to find it on the Ozone Secretariat website . Parties may wish to consider: Supporting programmes to mitigate the loss in institutional memory of fire protection issue s under the Montreal Protocol; for example, including HTOC reports and technical notes, presentations, etc. in Ozone Regional Manager Network or other applicable meetings, and Supporting training and awareness programmes to address recovery, recycling, reclamat ion, and banking of HCFC and HFC fire protection agents. 2022 TEAP Progress Report - Volume 1 27 4 Updated response to Decision XXX/7: Future availability of halons and their alternatives In the early stages of the COVID -19 pandemic in 2020, the HTOC raised concern that the econo mic downturn caused by the global response to the pandemic would have a lasting impact on the Halon 1301 sector. This remains the case. Airframe manufacturers have lowered their production rates and lowered their forecasts for aircraft sales for the next several years. Their internal predictions are that growth rates will not return to pre -COVID -19 levels for at least five years. Additionally, airlines have accelerated decommissioning their older, less efficient aircraft and are replacing them with ne w, smaller aircraft that use less halon (i.e., wide body, twin aisle aircraft are being replaced by narrow body, single aisle aircraft). Figure 4.1 below shows the large decline in the number of commercial aviation flights in March -April 2020, and the gra dual recovery in 2020 and 2021. In April 2022 flights were approximately 20% below the corresponding period in 2019. Fig. 4.1. Effect of the COVID -19 Pandemic on Global Aviation. Source: Flightradar2419 A major question that was raised by the HTOC was if the economic impacts caused by the COVID -19 pandemic would present a new opportunity to understand the installed amounts and emissions (i.e., needs) of halon 1301 from the enduring uses that was never possible before. For example, did emissions change b y region or did emissions change in relation to civil aviation flights or flight hours that could be directly attributed to changes in operations owing to the pandemic? The data for the latest estimates of global emissions based on atmospheric abundances t hough 2020 do not show any significant decrease in halon 1301 emissions during 2020. Since we know that civil aviation flight hours dropped by 60% during the pandemic, this suggested that global emissions for at least 2020 did not correlate well with civil aviation flight operations. In other words, total global emissions do not seem to be dependent on the number or duration of civil aviation flights. This does not necessarily mean that civil aviation is not the cause of some of or even a significant amount of the emissions but rather that a different part of the aviation lifecycle such as fire extinguisher maintenance could be responsible for much of these emissions. The HTOC is awaiting the 2021 data on the estimates of global emissions based on atmospheri c abundances and is also working with ICAO, relevant 19 \"Flightradar24 website ; https://www.flightradar24.com/data/statistics Retrieved 28th April, 2022 2022 TEAP Progress Report - Volume 1 28 companies, and civil aviation NGOs and working groups to better understand not only the magnitude of the emissions but also potentially where in the life cycle these emissions are occurring. Additionall y, the HTOC continues to work cooperatively with the International Maritime Organization (IMO), maritime / merchant shipping NGOs, and other halon 1301 sector experts to understand the implications of these data to update the modelling and estimates for cu rrent and projected halon 1301 market in terms of uses, installed base and annual emissions. This remains a significant task for the HTOC and will be reported to the parties as part of its upcoming 2022 Quadrennial Assessment. 4.1 Global Halon 1301 Emissions There are two approaches that are provided in the HTOC Assessment reports on estimating halon 1301 emissions: (1) the HTOC model (in grey in Fig ure 4.2), and (2) estimates derived from measured atmospheric abundances combined with its atmospheric lifetime (the blue data in Fig ure 4.2). Fig. 4.2. Comparison of halon 1301 emissions from the HTOC model versus the latest estimates derived from atmospheric abundances In general, the agreement between the two approaches is remarkably good. However, there have been two recent periods where the emissions estimated from atmospheric measurements are higher than the HTOC modelled emissions, indicated by the blue and orange circles. The first is from about 2010 to 2016, and the second from about 2 018 to 2020. The HTOC is concerned about these discrepancies because any \"additional\" halon 1301 emissions over those estimated by the HTOC model would decrease the size of the global halon bank estimated by the HTOC and therefore would reduce the estimate d amount of halon that will be available to support enduring uses. The HTOC is continuing to 2022 TEAP Progress Report - Volume 1 29 work with atmospheric scientists from the Advanced Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment (AGAGE) network to determine if additional data analysis can provide any ins ight into these \"additional\" emissions. 2022 TEAP Progress Report - Volume 1 31 5 Methyl Bromide TOC (MBTOC) Progress Report The May 202 2 MBTOC Progress Report provides an overview on the production and consumption of MB for both controlled and exempted (QPS) uses and a summary o f MB alternatives developed for sectors for which critical uses have been nominated this year for use in 202 3 or 202 4. Recent research on alternatives to QPS uses of MB and the trend in atmospheric emissions of MB is also presented. MBTOC considers that accurate reporting and determination of the correct categories of use s of MB for Q and PS are critically important to assist the parties understanding of these uses and for the future development and adoption of alternatives around the world for these uses . A brief overview of the situation with the use and adoption of re-capture/ recycl ing of MB for QPS uses in different sectors and regions is also presented. In the absence of phase out of MB, this technology is considered essential to adopt in order to reduce emissions from MB use without damaging the ozone layer. An update on the collaboration between the International Plant Protection Convention ( IPPC ) and MBTO C, plus some r emaining challenges associated with MB use and phase -out are discussed. 5.1 Global MB production and consumption 5.1.1 Controlled uses Production In the past decade, four parties have reported p roduction of MB for controlled uses: China, Israel , Japan , and the United States. Japan has not reported production since 2014 and China has not reported since 2018. In 20 20, Israel reported a negative amount of -68.8 tonnes (i.e., zero production; exports taken fr om stockpiles) and the US reported production of MB for controlled uses of 6.83 tonnes that same year (2020) . Consumption In 2020, reported MB consumption for controlled uses was 69 tonnes. This matches with amounts granted under the Critical Use Exemption (CUE) by the MOP (A5 parties 35.7 tonnes; non -A5 parties 33.3 tonnes) and is a significant reduction from the116 tonnes consumed in 2019. In addition, MB amounts drawn from stockpiles and exported to A5 parties in 2020 were reported by EU of - 6.2 tonnes, by Israel - 68.8 tonnes and the United States - 19.2 tonnes . (Negative values result from such amounts being exported, i.e. , not consumed domestically) Phase -out of the remaining controlled uses of MB has continued under the CUE process; in 2022 only three parties requested CUNs. This reflects successful adoption of alternatives in the vast majority of sectors where MB was once used, both as a soil fumigant and as a postharvest or structural treatment (or re -categorisation to QPS by one party). In some A 5 parties, it is possible that continuing controlled critical uses may be being supplied from an estimated 1, 200 tonnes of stocks (presumably pre -2015 stocks ), instead of making a CUE application. 5.1.2 Methyl bromide production and consumption for QPS (exempted uses) Production of MB for QPS Reported world production of MB for QPS amounted to 10,143 metric tonnes in 2020. Five parties, two A5s (China and India) and three non -A5 parties (United States, Israel , and Japan) currently produce MB for QPS. 2022 TEAP Progress Report - Volume 1 32 Consumption of MB for QPS QPS use s continue to far exceed the use of MB for controlled uses and are now the major anthropogenic contributor of MB to the stratosphere. QPS treatments are highly emissive of MB, although some countries are implementing emission reduction technologies. In particular, r ecapture of MB to reduce emissions associated with QPS use is increasing in some countries where regul ations are driving its adoption (e.g. , New Zealand). Over the last decade, the average global consumption of MB for QPS has remained stable at around 10,000 tonnes/year in spite of some parties completely phasing out QPS use of MB (e.g. , EU). Consumption varies, sometimes widely, from year to year: e.g. , between 2017 and 2018, there was a n increase in global consumption for QPS (10,700 tonnes ), followed by a decline in 2019 (8,970 tonnes) and once again an increase in 2020 to about 9,500 tonnes (Fig 5.1). Fig. 5.1 Consumption of MB for QPS (exempted) uses from 2000 to 2020 Source: Ozone Secretariat Data Access Centre, accessed April 2022. NA 5: Non -Article 5 par ties. A5: Article 5 parties. Non-A5 parties have shown a downward trend in consumption since 1999, whilst consumption has been increasing in A5 parties since 2015. Increased use in some regions (Fig ure 5.2) is offsetting the benefits ga ined by phasing out MB for controlled uses globally. Fig. 5.2.

However, there is no real incentive to do so , and various factors take priority : economic constraints, market acces s restrictions due to lack of internationally accepted alternatives or the very slow and tedious process to obtain regulated alternatives for quarantine use bilaterally and within the IPPC. Nevertheless, initiatives are being proposed to use alternatives a nd include QPS uses being considered under the CUE process (Nothomb, 2021). Increasing registration of ethanedinitrile for wood products, which are a major user of MB, may reduce MB use substantially in the near future. MBTOC suggests that parties may wish to revisit the current QPS definition for pre -shipment applications with a view of establishing whether it is possible to remove the \"preshipment\" option or control the use of methyl bromide for that purpose, given that alternatives are readily available and an estimated 30 -40% of the QPS consumption falls into this category. This would require parties to make a clear distinction between \"Q\" and \"PS\" categories of use and report them separately. MBTOC stands ready to assist parties in achieving this. As a first step, parties may wish to ask MBTOC to update information collected for its 2010 and 2011 reports in response to Decision XX/6 and other relevant decisions of the Protocol. Pre-shipment treatments are generally aimed at a lower standard of pest con trol than quarantine uses and are normally targeted against pests that are not quarantine pests. Whilst quarantine treatments should lead to a commodity that is at least 99.9% free of regulated quarantine pests, pre -shipment only requires the consignment t o be \" practically free \" of pests. This lower level of security gives greater opportunity to use a wider choice of alternatives, which in a large number of cases are well - proven and immediately available in both A5 and non -A5 parties. In general, these alte rnatives also have, a reduced requirement for efficacy testing. 5.2 Update on alternatives for remaining critical uses Technically and economically feasible chemical and non -chemical alternatives to MB have been found for virtually all soils, structure and commodity applications for which MB was used in the past including nearly all critical uses applied for since 2005. Comprehensive information is available on the adoption of key alternatives in the MBTOC 2018 Assessment Report (MBTOC, 2019) p ast MBTOC CUN reports (MBTOC, 2003 - 2021) and the MBTOC Progress Report (TEAP, 2003 -2021). This May 2022 progress report provides updated information on recent research related to alternatives for controlled uses of MB for which critical uses are still b eing requested, namely strawberry runners (soil-borne pathogens and weeds) and houses (wood pests). 5.2.1 Strawberry runner production - Australia Australia continues to prioritize the registration of Methyl Iodide (MI) as the most efficient alternative to MB for treating soil grown with strawberry nurseries in the State of Victoria. Extensive R& D in the runner industry at Toolangi, Victoria, proved that soil disinfestation with MI/Pic controls soil -borne pathogens and weeds as effectively as MB/Pic, and p roduces equivalent runner yields to MB/Pic in commercial trials. Although in 2012 Arysta Life Sciences withdrew its application to register MI in Australia and other countries around the world , Saluterra Pty Ltd has applied for registration of MI/PIC 980 S oil Fumigant in strawberry runner production. The product has been shown of some weed species . The Australian research program continues to look at other alternatives with encouraging results : ethane dinitrile (EDN), TF -80\u00ae, microwave treatment s, and different rates and formulations of MI/Pic. DMDS and DMDS/Pic are being trialed in Australia since and Arkema is proce eding with registration. 2022 TEAP Progress Report - Volume 1 34 5.2.2 Strawberry runner production - Canada Many countries producing strawberry runners find soilless culture systems technically and economically feasible, at least for a portion of certified nursery production operations, as wel l as for stock plants . Such systems allow for producing pest and disease -free nursery material that meets the required plant health standards (L\u00f3pez -Galarza et al., 2010; Rodr\u00edguez et. al . 2020; ). Canada continues to conduct research aimed at perfecting a soilless production system that will avert the need for soil fumigants, as no chemical alternatives to MB are allowed on Prince Edward Island, where the need for a CUE arises. Other Canadian Mariti me provinces do not need MB to produce healthy strawberry runners in similar circumstances. 5.2.3 Structures - disinfestation of houses in South Africa The Republic of South Africa (RSA) has continually reduced their nomination for treating structures (houses) with MB but still finds challenges. Disinfestation of wooden structures in dwellings is achieved with either heat (Hofmeier, 1996; Reichmuth et al., 2002; 2007) or SF (Reichmuth et al., 2003, Ducom et al., 2003) in many countries around the world. Wil liams and Sprenkel (1990) have demonstrated the efficacy of these treatments against eggs of key pests of wood like anobiid and lyctid beetles. La Fage et al. (1982) showed that SF was effective against the Formosan termite Cryptotermes formosanus (Isopte ra: Rhinotermitidae). There are significant differences in tolerance between adult insects and especially eggs to SF (eggs versus adults; see also MBTOC's review on SF -use in previous reports). Both the literature and trained fumigators do not recommend us ing SF at temperatures below 20\u00b0C, due to pronounced increase of tolerance of the eggs of target pests. Other alternatives include ethane -dinitrile (EDN) , with good penetration characteristics, high efficacy and short application time (Ryan et al., 2006). EDN\u00ae applications limit the risks of pests and diseases spreading within the agricultural and timber industry. BLUEFUME (HCN) is also a promising treatment fo r controlling wood infesting pests in packages and structures and was registered in the EU in 2017. Pest resistance is currently not an issue with EDN or HCN and their wide range of action for controlling timber pests (insects, mites, rodents, nematodes, f ungi, etc.) makes them good potential alternatives to MB for treating wooden structures (Hnatek et al., 2018). 5.3 QPS uses of methyl bromide MBTOC keeps track of research on alternatives to MB for QPS purposes, as well as on the status of registration a nd availability of alternatives to MB around the world. 5.3.1 Chemical alternatives 5.3.1.1 Hydrogen cyanide (HCN) HCN continues to show promise as an alternative to MB South Korea for treatment of stem and bulb nematodes infesting garlic cloves ( Zouhar et al., 2016) and New Zealand for some fruit . Malaysia also reported registration of HCN in 2019/2020 as an alternative to EF and MB were compared for disinfestation of the citrus mealybug Planococcus citri (Hemiptera: Pseudococcidae) on banana s import ed into South Korea (Park et al., 2020) . Results showed that EF fumigation 2022 TEAP Progress Report - Volume 1 35 sorption to bananas and packaging materials lowered the realized EF concentrations around banana and reduced the mortality of P. citri eggs despite similar efficacy of MB and EF for controlling P. citri. Cho et al., (2020) evaluated the combined effect of EF (20 g/m3) plus PH 3 (1 g/m3) on mealy bug s nursery plants and despite good control there was some phytotoixicty of the treatments. EF was evaluated as a potential MB alternative for controlling exotic ants and termites from stone and lumber imported into Korea with encouraging results. C ommercia l scale trials suggest that EF fumigation may be applicable for disinfestation of invasive worker ants and female alates of Soleopsis invicta on imported lumber (Kim, D. et al. , 2021). New Zealand has adopted EF (with CO2) to control both ants and the brown marmorated stick bug (Approved biosecurity treatments ). Spotted wing drosophila, Drosophila suzukii (Diptera: Drosophilidae) in the U.S. and Europe has become a major phytosanitary trade barrier. Kwon et al. (2021a) explored the potential of using stand - alone EF treatment and a combined treatment of EF and cold temperature for D. suzukii in imported blueberries. In small scale pilot studies, 9 -day stand -alone cold treatment at 5\u00b0C was sufficient for complete control of D. suzukii eggs and larvae tested, but not pu pae. The efficacy of this cold treatment appeared to improve when D. suzukii eggs were first treated with low -dose EF (LCt50% level) prior to the cold treatment. stink bug (BMSB) , Halyomorpha halys (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) is a sap sucking insect native to China, Japan and Korea that has become invasive in North America, Europe and Chile. It causes significant damage to a wide array of economically important crop species. Ethyl formate (with CO 2) has been successfully tested agai nst overwintering BMSB by Kawagoe et al., schedule using 15 g/m3 EF and 3% CO 2. Kim, et al. (2021) attempted to shorten phosphine treatment time and avoid resistance to this fumigant with a combined treatment with EF for cont rol of Planococcus citri. The efficacy of PH3 decreased after reducing the treatment time, but synergistic effects were observed at all stages of development of P. citri when both fumigants were used simultaneously for 4 h. Kwon et al, (2021b) evaluated t he efficacy of EF, Phosphine (PH3) and EF + PH3 on the mushroom fly, Lycoriella mali (Diptera: Sciaridae), the primary pest in imported mushrooms in South Korea. The combination treatment had a synergistic effect, with no phytotoxic damage. 5.3.1.3 Phosphi ne (PH 3) Recent research continue s to support use of phosphine as an alternative to MB fumigation of stored grain. One small scale project (Arora et al., 2021) showed effectiveness of phosphine in well -sealed systems under Indian conditions against three common beetle pests of wheat with 7 and 10 -day exposures. Sri Lanka and Pakistan are increasing the acceptance of PH3 to replace MB for imported grains (Mirage News, 2022). In Japan, a newly developed method for applying aluminum phosphide that preve nts residual powder remaining on treated grain layer, substantially saving labor is now registered . Sachets of dose formulation are hung above the grain layer; phosphine gas is generated from the formulation and evenly distributed throughout the grain laye r with air circulation. Once the fumigation is finished sachets are removed from the silo and disposed safely (Soma et al., 2018). Bean thrips (BT), Caliothrips fasciatus (Thysanoptera: Thripidae), are a pest of concern to certain countries that import fre sh citrus fruit from California, USA. Walse and Jimenez (2021) conducted a series of laboratory -scale exploratory fumigations with different phosphine formulations to evaluate the postharvest control of adults. Results provided evidence to support the cont rol of BT following fumigation with an applied dose of 1.5 g m -3 phosphine, showing good potential for this treatment. 2022 TEAP Progress Report - Volume 1 36 The khapra beetle, Trogoderma granarium (Coleoptera: Dermestidae) is one of the most important quarantine pests of stored grains. Most studies with phosphine gas highlight eggs as the most tolerant stage. Lampiri and Athanassiou (2021) recently suggest delayed effects of phosphine fumigation on larval growth and faster hatching in eggs exposed to phosphine for 2 d ays. Gourgouta et al. (2021) conducted mortality test s on different life stages of the k hapra beetle (including diapause larva), with phosphine at dosages of 50, 100, 200, 300, 500 and 1,000 ppm for 3 days and found that although eggs are the most tolerant to phosphine , 100% were killed with 1,000 3-day exposure . Lampiri (2021) found that 2 -day-old eggs of T. granarium are more susceptible than 1 -day-old eggs. Faster hatching was observed in eggs exposed to phosphine for 2 d ays compared to controls and the result was more pronounced for 1 -day-old than 2 -days-old eggs. In contrast to the 2 -d exposure, hatching rates of eggs exposed to 4 and 6 d ays were notably reduced, while there was a delay in egg hatching compared to controls. These dissimilar patters in larval growth may suggest certain delayed effects of phosphine fumigation. The results of the work can be further utilized for the development of phosphine -based quarantine and pre -shipment treatments for the control of T. gran arium . Lampiri et al (2021) Rhyzopertha dominica (F.) with populations that had different levels of phosphine resistance. The majority of susceptible populations of all species were instantly immobilized even in the shortest exposure period (15 min), in contrast with resistant populations that were active even after 300 min. After exposure to phosphine, populations and exposure t ime affected mortality of susceptible populations, whereas resistant populations recovered regardless of species and exposure time. Additional bioassays showed the presence of the \"sweet spot\", i.e., decrease of mortality with the increase of concentration . For most of the tested species, the \"sweet spot\" appeared in 1000 and 2000 ppm at a 5 -h exposure time, regardless of the level of resistance to phosphine. Temperature was also observed as being important. The results are particularly relevant in terms of the assessment of resistance and in the context of non - linear recovery at elevated concentrations, indicating the occurrence of strong hormetic reversals in phosphine efficacy. Resistant and tolerant red flour beetles Tribolium castaneum (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) and dominica (Coleoptera: Bostrichidae) were exoposed to 0 (control), 1000, and 3000 ppm of phosphine for 15 or 90 minutes to estimate behavioral and mobility responses (Agrafioti, et al., 2020). For both species, the highest percentage of dead adults was noted at 3000 ppm for both exposure times. Changes in movement parameters can be further exploited in assessing the efficacy of different management tactics, such as trapping and sampling. Co-fumigation of reduced rates of phosphine and sulfuryl fluoride control highly resistant rusty (Stephens) (Coleoptera: Laemophloeidae) (Jagadeesena et al, 2021). MBTOC notes as in previous reports that resistance to phosphine (PH 3) has been recorded in storage pests around the world (Opit et al., 2012; Jagadeesan et al. , 2012). Recent surve ys in major grain - growing countries confirms this ongoing concern for PH 3 resistance, as grain is stored every where and resistant insects survive poor fumigations (Collins et al., 2017: Nayak et al., 2020). 5.3.1.4 Nitric oxide (NO) NO is considered as an alternative to MB for postharvest pest control on lettuce, particularly the currat - lettuce aphid Nasonovia Thripi dae) (Yang and Liu, 2019). 2022 TEAP Progress Report - Volume 1 37 Liu and Simmons (2021) demonstrated that NO fumigation was effective against all life stages of the light brown apple moth , Epiphyas postvittana (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) . NO navel orangeworm, Amyelois transitella (Lepidoptera:Pyralidae ) although timing and application rates were variable depending upon the life stage to be treated (Yang et al., 2021). Eggs were more tolerant to NO than larvae and pupae . 5.3.1.5 Ethanedinitrile (EDN) Research on EDN as an alternative to MB for QPS uses, particularly for timber and logs is very active for example in New Zealand, the Czech Republic and Korea with encouraging results (Armstrong and Najar -Rodriguez, 2019; Na Uzunovic et al. , 2019). Phosphine, SF and ED were tested against the pinewood nematode, in a range of artificially infested wood samples with high moisture content and, in some cases, the bark layer intac t on the surface exposed to the fumigant. Phosphine and SF successfully eliminated pinewood nematodes on pine wood chips but neither was completely effective on pine blocks with intact bark. E DN was effective on pine chips, blocks and logs at all the doses tested: 40 -100 mgL -1 for 24 h at 20C. Ethanedinitrile appears to be a promising alternative to MB for the fumigation of pine logs. Further testing at lower temperatures and doses, and with commercial -scale log loads is recommended (Seabright et al. , 2020) . The New Zealand EPA has recently approved EDN for use on export logs and timber but not imported logs and timber. This has the potential of reducing about 600 tonnes of MB however some requirements still need to be met particularly in relation to safe ap plication methods and acceptance by trade partners. Malaysia, which reported usage of 170 tonnes of MB for QPS in 2019, has registered EDN in 2019/2020 as an alternative to MB for postharvest treatments (Glassey, pers comm, 2021). Consumption in 2020 was r eported at 136 tonnes . South Korea has also registered EDN for logs and timber (Draslovka MBAO 2020). 5.3.1.6 Sulfuryl fluoride (SF) SF has long been shown to penetrate wood as effectively as MB and is also known to have a great potential for controlling forest pest insects ; it is considered suitable for fumigation of exported logs. As such it has been implemented into the recommendatio ns for a range of phytosanitary treatments in quarantine (ISPM 15, 2018; ISPM 28, 2017) . Cottrell et al. , (2020) recently published research on the control of the native to North Americ a and is a quarantine pest , with SF. SF is also being used in the USA and Europe as a quarantine treatment on cargo at risk of carrying the Brown Marmorated Stink bug Halyomorpha haly s to Australia and New Zealand. It is approved for export logs to China f rom Australia and being used on European logs to China (Reichmuth pers comm , 2022 ). Myers et a treatment for khapra beetle Trogoderma granarium using a combination SF and propylene oxide (PPO). 5.3.2 Non-chemical alternatives 5.3.2.1 Irradiation Use of irradiation for postharvest treatment of fresh commodities to free them from insect pests of quarantine concern continues to increase. However, many commodities are stored in controlled or 2022 TEAP Progress Report - Volume 1 38 modified atmospheres to preserve commodity quality and extend shelf life and low -oxygen environments have been shown to affect radiotoleran ce in some insects, e.g. (H\u00fcbner) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) (Lopez -Martinez et the case of Drosophila suzukii Matsumura (Diptera: Drosophilidae) where low oxygen enhan ce survival of D. suzukii pupae irradiated at 60 Gy in sweet cherry (Follett et al. , 2018). In South Korea , Cho et al. (2019) examined the effects of gamma -ray irradiation on the development and reproductive sterility of tabaci and Trialeurodes vaporariorum (Hemiptera : Aleyrodidae ) export ed strawberry fruit. They found that 100 Gy suppressed the development and reproduction of eggs and adults in both species . Zhao et al., (2021) reported that the combination of modified atmos phere (MA) and ionizing radiation led to synergistic effects successfully controlling oriental fruit flies in irradiated fruit held in a 1% O 2 atmosphere for 14 - or 15 -days. This resulted in the required efficacy of 99.99 68% mortality at 95% confidence lev el. 5.3.2.2 Radio frequency New methods to utilize radiofrequency (RF) power have been investigated by Lagunas -Solar et. al, (2006 ) as a physical thermal method for disinfecting and disinfesting various foods and non -food materials, including agricultural soils. Control of fungi and nematodes was effectively achieved. RF applications are currently limited to frozen foods, fruit juices, pos t-baking drying, and some pasteurization processes due to high cost s and uncertainty regarding the RF properties of foods and other materials. At U niversity of California at Davis, new bands of the RF spectrum (few kHz to < 10 MHz) have been studied and te sted successfully allowing significant cost reduction s and capable of operating high energy efficienc y. A project developing radio frequency (RF) technology has generated the data required to have this treatment method approved by the IPPC in compliance w ith ISPM -15 for wood packaging, but cost effectiveness need ed to be improved for adoption to occur. In 2016, it was found that by adding pressure to the RF chamber during treatment dramatically reduced the time required to treat, improved heating uniformity, and reduced energy and labor costs significantly. A commer cial application is close to realization. 5.3.2.3 Controlled atmospheres (CA) and temperature treatments Controlled atmospheres (with low content of oxygen and increased CO 2 and/or nitrogen content) combined with low temperature are increasingly used and a ccepted as quarantine treatments, often with good potential to replace MB. The use of low oxygen by increasing nitrogen is an effective management strategy for the control of T. granarium on different commodities (figs, plums and sultanas) following a cer tain action plan based on specific combinations of temperature and exposure (28\u00b0C for 9 days or 40\u00b0C for 2.5 days of exposure) (Sakka et al. , 2022). When comparing a high carbon dioxide concentr ation modified atmosphere of 70% or a low oxygen concentration of 0.1%, the latter was more effective in controlling this pest. An exposure period of 4 days at 28\u00baC was effective, as no progeny production was recorded (Vassilakos et al., 2019 ). The schedule for import treatment (e.g. rice) from khapra countries to Au stralia using CA is now published and can de download ed at https://www.awe.gov.au/biosecurity -trade/import/arrival/treatments/treatment s-fumigant s#controlled -atmo sphere -treatment. 2022 TEAP Progress Report - Volume 1 39 In Vietnam, a continuous in -line CA treatment process, which takes only 40 minutes kills insects attacking dry commodities in all stages of development. The treatment is conducted within a compartment at 55 -70 C (depending on the product) and a very low ox ygen environment, where the product is dropped in and any insects present are eliminated within 30 min. A conveyor belt then takes the product to a second compartment at 15 - 25 C where it is cooled down to ambient temperatures by mechanical means. The coo ling process also enables moisture control of the product. The system works with a heat pump and cooling system, with high energy efficiency and is currently commercially operated for treating nuts and trialed for dried fruit products and fresh fruit (Berg werff, pers comm). Patil et al. (2019) reported a novel cold -quarantine treatment for mango quarantine pests combining cold storage at 2\u00baC with artificial ripening with 150 ppm ethylene and modified atmosphere (fruit enclosed in perforated bags), resulting in significantly reduced chilling injury and ensuring consumer acceptance (taste, aroma and texture). The tomato leafminer Tuta absoluta, (Lepidoptera, Gelechiidae) , an invasive and increasingly troublesome pest species affecting tomatoes, other solanaceo us species and many other crops including cut flowers, can limit exports in various countries, is effectively controlled with modified atmospheres and cold treatments (Tarusikirwa et. al, 2021; Riudavets et. al. , 2016) . Hot water treatment combined with hi gh-pressure controls taro mite, Rhixoglyphus sp. , and root Meloidogyne spp. 2018). 5.4. Methyl bromide emissions and recapture 5.4.1 Emissions of MB Since 1999, the reduction in MB production and use has led to a more than 30% reduction in the concentration of MB in the atmosphere and this has been responsible for more than 35% of the present fall in Effective Equivalent Stratospheric Chlorine and a key driver for the recovery of the ozone layer (Porter and Fraser, 2020 ). Figure 3 provides an update of the atmospheric concentration of MB up until 2021 and shows that after a period of increase in MB concentration in the atmosphere from 2015 -2017, the MB concentration appear ed to continue to declin e until the last few year s (Fig ure 5.3.) The slight rise in 2020 /2021 suggests that there is still a measurable level of unidentified source of MB within the fluctuations of change of atmospheric concentrations, which could be due to natural fluctuations or from changes in consum ption, presumably for QPS or possibly from unknown uses (Choi et al, 202 2). As indicated earlier in this report, future gains in reduction of atmospheric concentrations will rely on reduction in emissions from QPS use of MB, by either reducing use of MB f or QPS or by reducing emissions of MB from QPS applications by recapture, recycling and/or reuse. 2022 TEAP Progress Report - Volume 1 40 Fig. 5.3. Trend in Atmospheric concentration of methyl bromide (ppt) from 1930 - 2020. Source: Fraser, Porter, Derek (Australia, pers. comm. 2022) 5.4.2 Copper based chemicals contribute to unaccounted atmospheric MB levels A current study by Jiao et al., (2022) indicates that application of copper (II)-based chemicals may increase atmospheric concentrations of methyl halides, especially for CH 3Br (~10% of the missing sources), contribute to stratospheric halogen load, and thereby affect ozone levels. A simplified estimation suggests this process may be responsible for 4,100\u00b11,900 t CH 3Bryr1 and 2,500\u00b1700t CH 3Clyr1, respectively. Of note is that copper production has gone up 65% in the last 10 years. Nicewonger et al., (2022) found that interannual variations in the atmospheric MB are related to El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events, and the increased burning during the warm phase of ENSO is determined to be the most likely cause of these interannual changes. 5.4.3 Recapture of MB As noted in previous MBTOC reports, in 2010 the New Zealand Environmental Prot ection Agency (NZ EPA) ruled that all QPS MB emissions were to be recaptured as of October 2020, although this had been extended through to February 2022. In response, a range of new technologies for recycling and recapture systems have been developed that are able to recapture up to 90% of MB in the headspace within hours, in commercial conditions ( MPI, 2021 ). However, due to the lack of available technology to achieve the required targets the NZ EPA reassess ed this ruling. The majority of current emission s from container and undercover log QPS fumigations at four major ports are being controlled with available recapture equipment, but emissions arising from fumigation of ship holds remain ed a challenge. The NZ EPA in 2021 completed a reassessment of MB. The reassessment focused on recapture requirements, and a comprehensive suite of controls to mitigate the risks of MB use including banning the fumigation of ships holds from 1 January 2023. In general terms, recapture of MB refers to the use of technology to remove methyl bromide from the fumigated enclosure, so that it cannot be released into the air. From 1 January 2023, 80 % of the MB 2022 TEAP Progress Report - Volume 1 41 used will need to be recaptured from every container fumigation, increasing to 99 % recapture from 1 January 2031. From 1 January 2022, recapture technology must be used on half of all undercover fumigations , and all must use recapture technology from 1 January 2025. New carbon -based equipment has been developed to recapture MB from large log stacks and is proving to be aroun d 90% effective. Assessment of Methyl Bromide Fumigation Recapture Regimes (mpi.govt.nz) A requirement to use \"dosing to concentration\" technology will be required from 1 January 2024 ; at least 50 % of all fumigations must be dosed to concentration, increasing to 100 % of all fumigations from 1 January 2027. This is intended to reduce the amount of MB being used while maintaining efficacy with monitoring of concentration during the fumigation. The reassessment decision encourages parties to continue negotiations with international trade partners to reduce and, where possible, eliminate the use of MB, and to explore alternative processes. In Australia, a specific regulation on damage of emissions of MB to the ozone layer in addition to concerns on MB emissions on public health have led to adoption of recapture systems into several major fresh vegetable and fruit markets. Regulations also exist in other sectors of the world (e.g. , US timber exports) to implement systems to reduce emissions. Limitations to date have been the added cost for the user of equipment required to recapture and destroy or landfill compared to venting directly to the atmosphere. In addition, in most areas lo cal policies are generally not in place to encourage or mandate their use or are difficult to implement. 5.5 International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC) As per the Memorandum of Understanding signed between the Montreal Protocol and the IPPC, MBTOC co ntinues to collaborate with the IPPC. A short contribution featuring MBTOC's recent activities which are of relevance to IPPC was submitted to the IPPC for inclusion under the agenda item \"Written reports from international organizations\" of the IPPC's 16th meeting of the Commission on Phytosanitary Measures (CPM). This virtual meeting took place in April 2022, and MBTOC co - chairs and some members attended some sessions. MBTOC also monitored developments arising from the work conducted by the convention wi th potential to impact MB use and replacement. There are now 32 approved treatments available shown in the IPPC Phytosanitary Treatments draft phytosanitary treatments, s ome with potential to replace MB were presented for consultation (IPPC, 2021a) and adopted duri ng CPM grape for Drosophila suzukii (Haworth) D.R. (2017 - 2029) Revision of ISPM 18 (Guidelines for the use of irradiation as a phytosanitary measure) Irradiation treatm ent for Pseudococcus jackbeardsleyi Additionally, the following International Standards for Phytosanitary Measures (ISPM) that will contribute to reducing the need to treat with MB were approved in 2021 (IPPC, 2021b): ISPM 28 Phytosanitary treatments for regulated pests ISPM 44 Requirements for the use of modified atmosphere treatments as phytosanitary measures (adopted in 2021) In addition, MBTOC continues to support IPPC's \"Recommendation on replacement or reduction of the use of methyl b romide as a phytosanitary measure\" (IPPC 2008, published 2017). 2022 TEAP Progress Report - Volume 1 42 5.6 Other issues 5.6.1 International trade treated with MB MBTOC is aware that the Ministry of Food Security and Research of Pakistan is initiat ing an inquiry on the single importer of MB whi ch is also the sole distributor and fumigator. The ministry has constituted a committee, which was mandated to in vestigate the controversy over MB import s and the monopoly exist ing in this s ector and fix responsibility for any wrongdoing that may have occurred in the past. MBTOC hopes that this enquiry results in better awareness and reporting of MB use (Pakistan Today, 2022). India and Canada have agreed to lift the MB fumigation requirement for the Canadian pulse export to India while a systems approach is being worked out. This measure will potentially reduce MB treatments of pulses on arrival substantially. MBTOC further notes that some parties do not report MB consumption and yet have certifi ed MB fumigators to enable the import of grain exports. For example, Lao PDR exporting to Australia: lao-pdr_1.pdf (awe.gov.au) . Tonga on its part, fumigates watermelons des tined for New Zealand with MB, but does not report any consumption. 5.6.2 Post-harvest use for cured hams Methyl bromide is still used on stored ham in the United States, although no CUE has been applied for or granted since 2016; the use is small (less than 2 tonnes) and drawn from limited stock. An alternative method is to use protective netting treated with polypropylene glycol (Zettler et al., 2001), which is awaiting approval from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). The industry cannot use SF because control of mite eggs is only achieved by increasing the exposure amount to levels which affect ham quality and which leave unsafe residues (Zhang et al., 2017). Research on alternatives for this use continues and includes phosphine (with resistanc e management ), establishing efficacy and experimental criteri a for quarantine applications, and the development of models to quantitatively understand the underpinnings of fumigations and related phytosanitary treatments (Walse et al. , 2018). Very recent s tudies (Yang et al. 2022) , show that nitric oxide is effective against all mite stages and 100 % control was achieved on ham. 5.6.3 Sulfuryl fluoride and its GWP SF is widely adopted around the world as an alternative to MB for disinfestation of structures. Its registration and commercial adoption occurred in the 1990s and continued for many years until it was made available in many countries. SF is a key alternative to MB for treatment of empty structures such as flour mills and food and feed pro cessing premises, particularly buildings larger than 40,000 m\u00b3, where heat treatment is not an option due to logistic reasons. Its use around the world is extensive. For example, Germany alone uses about 200 t of SF which replaces controlled as well as QPS uses of MB. There is growing concern about SF use due to its high global warming potential (GWP), which puts the continuity of its registration at risk (Gressent et al., 2021; Miller et al., 2017; Reimann et al., 2015, Dillon et al., 2008). The 20year GWP value of SF is reported at 7510 (IPCC, 2021). The IPPC states that, although the contribution of SF to ERF (Effective Radiative Forcing) is small, the atmospheric abundance of SF reached 2.5 ppt in 2019, which is a 46% increase from the value recorded in 2011. 2022 TEAP Progress Report - Volume 1 43 Gressent et al (2021) have used atmospheric observations from the Advanced Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment (AGAGE) to show that global emissions of SF increased from close to zero in the early 1980s to 2.4 Gg yr1 in 2019. They report that the primary source of these global emissions in 2019 was structural fumigation in North America, but that the increase over the last two decades has also been driven by the growing use of SF in postharvest treatment of crops in many countries around the world . In the EU, there are preliminary indications SF registration and use may be come complicated due to GWP issues. Due to its wide adoption as an alternative to MB for disinfestation of structures, deregistration of SF would create significant disruption in pest control strategies. Recapture and other technologies to reduce emissions could be considered to reduce its negative effects as correlated to its high GWP. The Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Stanford University , USA is working on capturing SF on activated carbon and destruction by electrochemical treatment (M itch, 2020). 5.6.4 Reporting of methyl bromide stocks and their uses MBTOC is concerned that confusion can exist over how stocks of methyl bromide are reported by countries fo r production and consumption for controlled non -QPS uses and exempted QPS uses. Although only three countries report MB production , recent reporting information received under Article 7 data has been difficult to interpret against known uses. Information reported under Article 7 for MB consumption is even more confusing for sorting out how stockpiles are being used. 5.7 References Agrafioti, P., Brabec, D., L., Morrison III, W., R., Campbell, J.

It also includes background to, and an update on, TEAP's assessment of destruction technologies under decision XXX/6, to be included in MCTOC's 2022 Assessment Report. The status of aerosols (other than MDI s), laboratory and analytical uses, process agent uses, and n -propyl bromide were reviewed, however, no compelling new information is reported this report. 6.1 Production issues and use of controlled substances for chemical feedstock 6.1.1 Production and chemical supply issues in the transition to low -GWP HCFOs and HFOs As reported by FTOC, t here have been reported challenges relating to production and chemical supply in the transition to low -GWP HCFO and HFO foam blowing - 1234ze, and HFO -1336mzz. Similar challenges have not been reported for the production of alternatives for other sectors. The challenges relating to foam blowing agents are related to several factors. Firstly , there are currently production constraints for these HCFO /HFO s worldwide , partly resulting from the global economic environment, making it difficult to meet demand . Global development and manufacturing of HCFO /HFO blowing agents is also limited due to the restrict ion of patents , especially application patents ; at present , only a few compan ies have established production capacity. New production capacity for HCFO/HFOs foam blowing agents is being built in China and the United States, which is expected to become avai lable in 2023. Secondly , the high price of HCFO /HFO s has had a major impact on global use . For instance, t he price of HCFO s/HFO s is currently much higher than HCFC -141b even higher than HFC -245fa and HFC -365mfc . This is another reason markets are use HCFC -141b, HFC -245fa and HFC -365mfc. HCFO/HFO s still in the early stages of commerciali sation and high price s are to be expected, just as they were for HFCs in their early commercialisation . The complexity of manufacturing process es for some HCFO /HFOs may also be contribut ing to their higher price because the production process es are relatively more complicate d than for HFCs. Another challenge is regional shortage s of CTC for feedstock use in HCFO/HFO production . 20 CTC is the main starting raw material in the process to manufacture While it is likely there is adequate global production capacity of chloromethanes -CTC and perchloroethylene (PCE)/CTC to meet global CTC demand, CTC production, supply, use, and export are subject to factors that could inadvertently impact global supply an d availability. These factors include national licensing controls; rights to place on market; and regional imbalances in supply and demand . With the increas ing demand for CTC as a raw material for a range of chemicals, regional shortage s of CTC for feedsto ck use have become a challenge for both producers and users. 6.1.2 Use of controlled substances for chemical feedstock Feedstocks are chemical building blocks that allow the cost -effective commercial synthesis of other chemicals. Controlled substances (OD S and HFCs) can be produced and/or imported or exported for 20 HFO -1336mzz production does not use CTC. 2022 TEAP Progress Report - Volume 1 50 use as feedstocks. As raw materials, feedstocks are converted to other products, except for de minimis residues and emissions of unconverted raw material. Emissions from the use of feedstock consi st of residual levels in the ultimate products, and fugitive leaks in the production, storage and/or transport processes. Significant investments and effort are spent to handle ODS and HFC feedstocks in a responsible, environmentally sensitive manner and, in most countries, are regulated through national pollution control measures. The definition of production under the Montreal Protocol excludes the amounts of controlled substances entirely used as feedstock in the manufacture of other chemicals. Notwiths tanding, parties are required to report the production of controlled substances for feedstock uses annually.21 Similarly, the definition of consumption excludes controlled substances entirely used as feedstock, nevertheless, imports and exports of controll ed substances to be used entirely as feedstock must be reported by parties. 6.1.3 How Article 7 reporting of production for feedstock uses contributes to understanding atmospheric burdens Article 7 of the Montreal Protocol prescribes requirements for each party for the annual reporting of statistical data on production, imports , and exports of each of the controlled substances . Reporting is further described in various decisions of the meet ings of parties. Some decisions introduce additional data requests that parties may report voluntarily. Article 7, paragraph 3, Each Party shall provide to the Secretariat statistical data on its annual production (as defined in paragraph 5 of Article 1) o f each of the controlled substances listed in Annexes A, B, C, E and F and, separately, for each substance, - Amounts used for feedstocks, ... The Montreal Protocol defines that some quantities of controlled substances are not considered controlled substance s under the Protocol owing to the insignificant emissions from their uses. Decision IV/12, clarifies the definition of controlled substances, \"That insignificant quantities of controlled substances originating from inadvertent or coincidental production du ring a manufacturing process, from unreacted feedstock, or from their use as process agents which are present in chemical substances as trace impurities, or that are emitted during product manufacture or handling, shall be considered not to be covered by t he definition of a controlled substance contained in paragraph 4 of Article 1 of the Montreal Protocol \". Decision IV/12 further urges \"... parties to take steps to minimize emissions of such substances, including such steps as avoidance of the creation of such emissions, reduction of emissions using practicable control technologies or process changes, containment or destruction \". As noted, parties are required to report the production, import and export of controlled substances for feedstock uses annually. Reported feedstock is a valuable data set that can be correlated with related emissions of controlled substances, either from their production, use or with the expected impact of emission abatement measures. Two recent examples are (i) the trend in HFC -23 by-product emissions22 from the feedstock and non -feedstock production of HCFC -2223, and (ii) the correlation 24of of octafluorocyclobutane (PFC-318), a by -product from tetrafluoroethylene (TFE) and 21 Montreal Protocol Article 7 para 3. 22 K.

Expected emissions can be calculated based on reported productio n data and can be compared to atmospheric burden and emission trends of controlled substances. A recent important example is the unexpected CFC -11 emissions.27 However, there are some products that are not reported because they are intermediates not isolat ed in a chemical manufacturing process.28 These intermediates may also be emitted in low quantities and detected by atmospheric monitoring.29 6.1.4 Reporting of controlled substances for feedstock uses As revised in decision XXX/10 and Annex III to MOP -30, Article 7 d ata reporting instructions and guidelines require the reporting of feedstock uses for all controlled substances and, w hen calculating production, the Montreal Protocol allows countries to deduct amounts of controlled substances used for feedstock and amounts destroyed . When reporting production data, parties are not expected to deduct these figures from their data . The Secretariat make s the necessary deductions. All feedstock produced during a calendar year is reportable for that year , even if it has not been used. The 1999 Handbook on Data Reporting under the Montreal Protocol provides guidance on data collection for production for use as feedstock. \"For collecting data on production (including data on production for use as feedstoc k and process agents, for essential uses, QPS and increased production), you can rely on the sources mentioned in Section 2.4. Section 2.4 extract: The relevant data on all categories of production are to be provided by the manufacturers based on voluntary or mandatory reporting. The manufacturers of ODS are usually large chemical companies and are, therefore, in most cases identified relatively easily. Note, however, that halons and carbon tetrachloride may also be manufactured on a smaller scale. For thes e, you might need to spend some effort to identify relevant companies. To ensure high data quality, the information provided by industry can be audited by an independent consultant and verified with the help of on -site inspections and inspection of the com pany's documentation. \" The Montreal Protocol includes the term \"used as feedstock \", e.g., Article 1, paragraph 5, \"\"Production\" means the amount of controlled substances produced, minus the amount destroyed by production. TFE and HFP are used in fluoropolymer production. A lmost all HCFC -22 that is produced and used as feedstock is pyr olysed to produce TFE and HFP, a process in which PFC-318 is a known by -product . This process, using HCFC -22 as feedstock, results in a significant proportion of the global PFC-318 emissions . 25 Global emissions of perfluorocyclobutane (PFC -318, c -C4F8) re sulting from the use hydrochlorofluorocarbon -22 (HCFC -22) feedstock to produce polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and related fluorochemicals, J. M\u00fchle -2022, 2022. 26 re port further on this in its 2022 Assessment Report. 27 Decision XXXI/3 TEAP Task Force Report on Unexpected Emissions of Trichlorofluoromethane (CFC -11) 28 See 2021 TEAP Progress Report - Volume 1, section 5.3.5. 29 Martin K. Vollmer, Tae Harth, Matthias Hill, Paul M. Schlauri, Ove Hermansen, Wang, Paul B. Krummel, Stefan Reimann, Simo n Peter G. Simmonds, Paul J. Fraser, Ronald G. Prinn, Ray F. Weiss, and L.

However, there is the definition of \"controlled substances produced\" in Article 1, par agraph 5 , \"Controlled substances produced\" as used in Article 1, paragraph 5 is the calculated level of controlled substances manufactured by a party. This excludes the calculated level of controlled substances entirely used as a feedstock in the manufactu re of other chemicals ...\" The term \"m anufactured \" is not defined ; although a common -sense definition is \"to make or process (a raw material) into a finished product \". In chemical production, a non -isolated intermediate in a chemical process is not considered as a finished product while it remains within the chemical process. As such, a non -isolated intermediate is not commonly reported. For example, the formation of the intermediate HCFC -21 is not commonly reported as a feedstock in the process of m anufacturing HCFC -22. However, a substance that is isolated, most likely purified to a specification, and then used in a distinct, separate process, would be considered as a finished product and subject to reporting as production for feedstock use. For example, when HCFC -21 is isolated and then used in the production of HCFC -225, its production is reported as feedstock. Examples of the use of controlled substances as intermediates and feedstocks and associated reporting, based on the available reported data : A controlled substance that is generated and used on the same integrated chemical plant complex, as part of a multistep process, is not a finished product and has not been reported as feedstock production . o E.g., HCFC -132b ntermediates for HFC -134a production. A controlled substance that is used by the same or a different company on the same or nearby chemical site in a distinct separate chemical process, which may transport the substance by pipeline, rail , or road transfer . The substance is a finished product and has been reported as feedstock production . o HCFC -22 used to produce TFE/HFP o Quantities of HCFC -133a that are isolated and then used in a separate process have been reported as feedstock . Further examples of high -volume chemical products that may be produced via non -isolated intermediates that are controlled substances are presented in Table 5.1. 2022 TEAP Progress Report - Volume 1 53 Table 6.1 High -volume chemical products that may be produced by non -isolated controlled substance intermediates (non -exhaustive list) Product Feedstock Non-isolated CFC -12 and CFC -115 are not, or not typically, used as feedstock. Small quantities of CFC -12 may be reported in some years. Previously they were high volume chemicals. As the production of CFC -113 for emissive use s in no longer permitted, the conversion of CFC -113 to CFC -113a is assumed to be a feedstock use (as noted in UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom , 88/78 Annex) and in the 2021 TEAP Progress Report ). The reporting of production fo r feedstock use has recently been discussed at the Multilateral Fund Executive Committee ( ExCom ) meetings and by the Volume 1 54 6.1.5 Common feedstock applications of controlled substances Table 6.2 shows common feedstock applications for controlled substances, although the list is not exhaustive. Parties report amounts of controlled substances used as feedstock to the Ozone Secretariat, but they do not report how they are used. Processes are proprietary and there is no off icial source to define the manufacturing routes followed and their efficacy. The table provides some examples and is the product of the collective experience and knowledge of MCTOC members. Products included are both intermediates as well as final products , including fluoropolymers. 2022 TEAP Progress Report - Volume 1 55 Table 6.2: Common feedstock applications of controlled substances (this list is not exhaustive) Feedstock Products Further conversion products Comments CFC -113 Chlorotrifluoroethylene Chlorotrifluoroethylene based polymers CFC -113 CFC -113a CFC -113a may be an intermediate and may be transported off -site for use as a feedstock. CFC -113a Trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and pesticides (including cyhalothrin) Starting with CFC -113, CFC -113a is as an intermediate for TFA. Alternatively, CFC -113a may be directly produced as the starting feedstock. TFA is a pesticide and medical intermedia te. -113a, CFC -114a, of HFC -134a begins with CFC -113, which is converted to CFC -113a, then to CFC -114a and HCFC - -123. CTC CFC -11 and CFC -12 Production and consumption of these CFCs has fallen to zero based on reported data. However, a small quantity of CFC -12 (<100 tonnes) is intermittently reported for feedstock use. It is not known for what the CFC -12 was used.

Bromotrifluoromethane is used as feedstock in the preparation of chemicals including fipronil (insecticide), mefloquine (antimalarial), and DPP -IV inhibitor (antidiabetic). CF 3 generated from bromotrifluoromethane can be introduced into a wide range of organic molecules by elastomers and thiobenzothiazole (TCMTB) TCMTB HCFC -142b fluoride, 142b). Photochlorination to of as a feedstock HFC -23 is converted to bromotrifluoromethane by bromination. Bromotrifluoromethane is then used as feedstock in the preparation of chemicals including fipronil (insecticide), mefloquine (antimalarial), and DPP -IV inhibitor (antidiabetic). CF 3 generated from bromotrifluoromethane can be introduced into a wide range of organic molecules by nucleophilic substitution. * A more comprehensive list of HFC feedstock uses will be provided in the MCTOC 2022 Assessment Report. 2022 TEAP Progress Report - Volume 1 58 6.1.6 Recent and historical trends in the production and use of controlled ODS as feedstock Data reported by parties to the Ozone Secretariat on production and import of controlled ODS used as feedstock for the year 2020 was provided to the MCTOC. These also in clude quantities used as process agents because parties are required to report such consumption in a manner consistent to that for feedstock. In 2020, a total of 15 parties 31F31 reported feedstock use of ODS, while 12 of these parties also produced ODS for feedstock uses. In 2019, a total of 16 parties had reported use of ODS as feedstock. Two of these parties had reported imports of less than 0.1 metric tonne. In 2020, total ODS production and import for feedstock uses was 1,475,007 tonnes, a small decrease compared to 2019 (2019 : 1,486,288 tonnes 32F32). Figure 6.1 shows that, comparing 2020 with 2019, only small changes have occurred for individual substances resulting in an overall small decrease. The 2020 reported total production and import of OD S for feedstock use in metric tonnes represents 554,116 ODP tonnes. 33F33 The overall increase in ODS feedstock uses through the last decade has been mostly due to the increase in feedstock uses of Annex C1 HCFCs, particularly HCFC -22, while uptake of HFOs is driving a more recent increase in CTC feedstock use. It is highly likely that the COVID pandemic had an impact on feedstock production and consumption in 2020. Fig. 6.1. Annual reported production of ODS for feedstock and process agent uses, categorised by Montreal Protocol Group, for the years 2002 -2020 (metric tonnes) 34F34 31 This total also includes the EU as an importer, EU Member States report their own production for feedstock use. 32 The 2018 feedstock production was stated as 1,364,998 tonnes in the MCTOC 2019 progress report. Any data changes result from data revisions that can occur for historical years. 33 While ODP tonnes are included, it should be noted that presenting production for feedstock use in ODP tonnes does not equate to emissions. From the total amount of ODS produced for feedstock use, only a relatively minor to insignificant quantity will be emitted depending on the abatement technologies and containment measures utilised. 34 Annex AI CFCs -11, -12, -113, -114, -115; Annex BII carbon tetrachloride; Annex HCFCs.

For those substances used in relatively small quantities, a quantity range is indicated. *Whi le the corresponding ODP tonnes are shown, it should be noted that this does not equate to emissions. From the total amount of ODS used as feedstock, a relatively minor to insignificant quantity will be emitted depending on the abatement technologies and containment measures utilised. The ODP tonnes is calculated from the reported data but for some reports it is not certain that the correct isomer is identified. The proportions of the largest ODS feedstocks in 2020 are very similar to 2019 HCFC -22 (48% of the total mass quantity), CTC (20%), and HCFC -142b (11%). HCFC -22 is mainly used to produce tetrafluoroethylene (TFE), which can be both homo - and co -polymerized to make stable, chemically resistant fluoropolymers with many applications , such as polytetraf luorotheylene . TFE may also be used to produce HFC -125, although alternative processes may be lower cost. Polyvinylidene fluoride is made from HCFC -142b. The feedstock use of CTC35 has increased in recent years, due to growing demand for lower GWP HCFO/ HFOs and perchloroethylene (PCE). 35 More information on CTC production and its uses as feedstock can be found in the TEAP Task Force Report on Unexpected Emissions of Trichlorofluorom ethane (CFC -11) September 2019. 2022 TEAP Progress Report - Volume 1 60 Fig. 6.2. Trends in annual production of the current main ODS feedstocks for the years 2002 -2020 (metric tonnes) 6.1.7 Production of HFCs used as feedstock Following the entry into force of the Kigali Amendment, reporting of HFCs, including production and import for feedstock uses, is required for all parties that have ratified the amendment. In addition to feedstock data reported as part of HFC baseline subm issions, obligatory annual HFC data reporting starts with data for 2019 for countries that became party to the Kigali Amendment before the end of 2019, and that 2019 Article 7 data was reported during 2020. Data submissions for 2020 for countries that beca me parties in 2020 are required before the end of 2021. The feedstock data reported for 2020 is incomplete due to the timing of reporting obligations, for example, depending on when some parties ratified. The available HFC feedstock data for 2021 is about 5000 tonnes. 36 The two largest feedstocks are HFC -23 and HFC -152a, with five other feedstocks also reported. Historically, some of the HFC -23 generated as a by -product during the manufacture of HCFC -22 was recovered and used as a feedstock to produce halon 1301 (bromotrifluoromethane). When production of halon 1301 ceased in non -Article 5 parties in 1994, in accordance with the Montreal Protocol, this demand for HFC -23 also largely ceased. However, HFC -23 is still used as a feedstock to produce halon 1301, which is still used as a feedstock for the manufacture of the pesticide fipronil and other chemicals. 47F37, 48F38 According to a 49F39, the dehydrofluorination of 1,1 -difluoroethane (HFC -152a) is the most broadly used chemical process for the production of vinyl fluoride (used to produce polyvinylfluoride, 36 The total metric tonnes of ODS reported for feedstock use in 2020 is over 1.4 million tonnes (see table 5.2). The feedstock uses of HFCs have much more limited application than ODS. 37 TEAP Report, September 2019, Volume 1 Decision XXX/3 TEAP Task Force Report on Unexpected Emissions of CFC - 11 page 69. 38 CF3 generated from Halon 1301 can be introduced into a wide range of organic molecules by nucleophilic substitution to produce chemica ls, Yuzhen Li, Li, Wenfeng Han, Zongjian Liu, Ying Li and Xiaonian Li, Rational design of MgF 2 catalysts with long -term stability for TEAP Progress Report - Volume 1 61 a polymer used mainly in low flammability coatings). HFC -152a can also be used as a feedstock to produce vinylidene fluoride (CH 2CF 2), via HFC a by -product from the production of HCFC -22. Destruction technologies for HFC -23 have been evaluated by TEAP 51F40 and approved by parties under decision XXX/6, and the ExCom have published several reports 52F41 on aspects of HFC -23 by -product control technologies. According to a recent paper 53F42, global HFC -23 emissions derived from atmospheric measurements were hist orically at their highest level in 2018, in contrast to expected emissions of HFC -23 by -product, primarily from reported HCFC -22 production, that were much lower. The paper concludes that the discrepancy between expected emissions and observation -inferred emissions makes it possible that planned reductions in HFC -23 emissions may not have been fully realised or there may be substantial unreported production of HCFC -22, both or either of which would result in unaccounted for HFC -23 by-product emissions. MCT OC reported further of HFC -23 in the 2021 TEAP Progress Report and will report further in MCTOC's 2022 Assessment Report. 6.2 Destruction technologies Decision XXX/6 on destruction technologies for controlled substances requests TEAP t o assess destruction technologies listed (in annex II to the report of the Thirtieth Meeting of the Parties) as not approved or not determined, as well as any other technologies, and to report to the Open -ended Working Group prior to the Thirty -Third Meeti ng of the Parties. Decision XXX/15 paragraph 5 further requests TEAP, following submission of its response to Decision XXX/6, to provide a review of destruction technologies if new compelling information becomes available. In consultation with the Ozone Se cretariat, TEAP and its MCTOC reported in the 2021 TEAP Progress Report that an assessment in response to decision XXX/6 will be included in MCTOC's 2022 Assessment Report based on available information. MCTOC outlined preparations for its assessment of d estruction technologies under this decision in the 2020 and 2021 TEAP Progress Reports, including suggested guidance on the type of relevant information needed for assessment. The 2020 and 2021 TEAP Progress Reports invited parties to submit this type of i nformation in response to decision XXX/6 paragraph 3. Information from parties was requested to be submitted no later than January 2022 to allow time for assessment. No information has been submitted by parties. The opportunity has now passed for MCTOC to assess any emerging new data in time for its 2022 Assessment Report, based on its report drafting schedule. MCTOC is not currently aware of new information, such as test data, relating to already approved destruction technologies (Table 5.4, based on Annex II, MOP -30 list of technologies subject to review that are either not approved, not determined), or new technologies that would allow an assessment. 40 2018 TEAP Report, Supplement to the April 2018 Decision XXIX /4 TEAP Task Force Report on Destruction Technologies for Controlled Substances . 41 See for example UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/83/44, 11 May 2019, Key aspects related to HFC -23 by -product control technologies (Decision 82/85). 42 K.

MCTOC is aware of some developments in the scale and application of existing approved destruction technologies and emerging interest in chemical conversion that are noteworthy to report in the 2022 Assessment Report in response to this decision , for example, portable nitrogen plasma arc. MCTOC is taking this opportunity to outline again its approach to the assessment of destruction technologies (presented in 2021, updated from 2020) and to provide suggested guidance for parties o n the type of relevant information they are invited to submit in future for TEAP assessment. In future, parties may wish to consider providing any new information for TEAP assessment of destruction technologies in January of the same year in which its asse ssment would be reported either as part of the annual TEAP Progress Report or the quadrennial Assessment Report. MCTOC will report further on destruction technologies and end -of-life management of controlled substances in its 2022 Assessment Report. 2022 TEAP Progress Report - Volume 1 63 Table 6.4.

Approved destruction technologies are those that are proven to result in the permanent transformation or decomposition of all or a significant portion of the substance being destroyed. As a general category, conversion (or non -incineration) technologies are those that primarily rely on chemical transformation to convert halocarbons , sometimes to potentially useful chemicals (e.g., acids, vinyl monomers etc.) . Conversion (tran sformation) as a destruction process differs from the conversion processes involving feedstock uses because, generally , a feedstock is specifically produced to manufacture a desired chemical and is not considered a waste . A waste by -product o r substance at end-of-life may be destroyed by thermal oxidation or plasma technologies, without producing useful chemicals . 57F43 6.2.2 Destruction technologies approved by parties Environmentally sound destruction of surplus or contaminated ODS and HFCs at end -of-life is encouraged by the Montreal Protocol because it avoids unnecessary emissions and helps protect the stratospheric ozone layer and/or the climate. The Montreal Protoc ol does not mandate the destruction of ODS or Annex F Group I HFCs. The exception is HFC -23 (Annex F, Group II) generated in manufacturing facilities, from which emissions must be destroyed to the extent practicable using technologies approved by parties. The Protocol's definition of 'production' of controlled substances subtracts the amounts destroyed from the amounts produced. The use of destruction technologies approved by parties applies to the amounts of controlled substances destroyed and accounted f or within the Protocol's definition of 'production'. Article 7 data reporting requires production data to be reported by parties, including the amounts of controlled substances destroyed by technologies approved by parties. The Protocol also allows Parties to manufacture an amount of controlled substance almost equivalent to the quantity destroyed with technology listed as approved, within the same year as destruction, and within the same group of substances. Parties have taken several decisions to approve destruction technologies for the purposes of Montreal Protocol production data reporting requirements. Over time, the list of destruction technologies approved by parties has been updated, with the most recent list of approved destruction processes contai ned in Annex II to the 30th MOP under decision XXX/6, reproduced in Table 5.4 above. 43 The definition of c onversion applies to non -incineration technologies , and these might not always produce useful products. Incineration technologies can also produce useful products, for example reactor cracking produces technical -grade quality HF and HCl. 2022 TEAP Progress Report - Volume 1 66 6.2.3 Background to TEAP assessment of destruction technologies In the preamble to decision XXX/6, parties: Noted that Destruction and Removal Efficiency (DRE) is the cri terion considered in their approval of destruction technologies, and Suggested that parties also consider TEAP's other technical advice on emissions of substances other than controlled substances in the development and implementation of their domestic reg ulations. For its assessment under decision XXX/6 or future assessments, TEAP will assess destruction technologies for their destruction and removal efficiency and make recommendations to parties for potential approval for inclusion on the list of approve d technologies. TEAP will also provide technical advice about emissions of other pollutants and the technical capability of destruction technologies as part of its assessment. In addition to providing parties with technical guidance, this will also ensure internal consistency with previous assessments. The TEAP assessment will consider the following parameters: 1. Destruction and Removal Efficiency (DRE) 58F44, which is a minimum of 99.99% for concentrated sources and 95% for dilute sources (e.g., foams) 2. Emissions of halogenated dioxins and furans 59F45 3. Emissions of other pollutants: acid gases (HCl, HF, HBr/Br 2), particulate matter (total suspended particles, TSP), and carbon monoxide (CO) 4. Technical capability, where the technology has demonstrated destruction on at least a pilot scale or demonstration scale, and for which the processing capacity is no less than 1.0 kg/hr of the substance to be destroyed, wheth er ODS or a suitable surrogate. The DRE is a measure of the efficiency of destruction and is the basis of TEAP's recommendations to parties. The 99.99% DRE minimum for concentrated sources of controlled substances is considered protective for minimising oz one depletion and climate impact. In the case of controlled substances contained in products such as closed cell foams and considered dilute sources, a DRE of 95% minimum is adopted for assessment purposes. The technical performance advisory criteria for other pollutant emissions are measures of potential impacts of the technology on human health and the environment. The destruction technologies will be assessed against advisory criteria, which are consistent with previous assessments, and technical advice provided in relation to destruction technologies recommended on the basis of DRE. 44 Destruction and Removal Efficiency (DRE) is determined by subtracting from the mass of a chemical fed into a destruction system during a specific period of time the mass of that chemical alone that is released in stack gases and expressing that difference as a percentage of the mass of that chemical fed into the system. If interconversion to other controlled species is possible, it is recommended that analysis is used to measure emissions and that any controlled species is taken into account when determini ng DRE. 45 Depending on the halogenated dioxins and furans can be formed. 2022 TEAP Progress Report - Volume 1 67 The technical capability advisory criterion considers the extent to which the technology has been demonstrated to destroy OD S/HFCs (or a comparable recalcitrant halogenated organic substance such as polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)) effectively and is technically capable of commercial -scale destruction. To undertake its assessment and provide its technical advice, and in order t o provide advice that the technology has the minimum level of technical capability to destroy ODS/HFCs efficiently and safely, TEAP will seek information for all of these parameters. The following technical performance assessment and advisory criteria wil l be used for TEAP assessments of destruction technologies. These represent a minimum DRE for destroying ODS/HFCs and maximum advisory levels of emissions of pollutants to the atmosphere that would be considered as an acceptable minimum level of technical capability. Table 6.5: Technical Performance Assessment and Advisory Criteria Performance Qualification Units Concentrated Sources Diluted Sources (e.g., foams) DRE % 99.99 95 Dioxins/furans ng-ITEQ/Nm3 0.2 0.5 5 Particulates (TSP) mg/Nm3 50 50 CO mg/Nm3 100 100 Notes to the table: All concentrations of pollutants in stack gases and stack gas flow rates are expressed on the basis of dry gas at normal conditions of 0oC and 101.3 kPa, and with the stack gas corrected to 11% O 2 (as referred to by normal cubic metre, Nm3).NB. Different stack gas conditions may apply in different countries for differen t technologies. ITEQ: International Toxic Equivalents 60F46. Acid gases will be assessed based on the specific halogen species present in the waste stream. TSP - total suspended particles The technical performance assessment (DRE) and advisory criteria ( for pollutants other than controlled substances) serve as a benchmark used by TEAP for comparison purposes. They do not constitute standards, nor do they necessarily meet internationally accepted emissions guidance for pollutants, such as those adopted by the Basel Convention. 61F47 They were developed only for the purposes of the Montreal Protocol for screening and recommending generic technologies that might be considered technically capable of meeting basic acceptable limits of pollutant emissions. Operators of destruction techno logies are required to meet local DRE requirements and pollutant emissions controls. In addition, the performance of technologies are plant and operation specific. Emissions management is a matter for operators and government agencies 46 The International Toxic Equivalents (ITEQ) scheme was established by NATO in 1988. More recently the TEFs were re -evaluated by the World Health Organ isation and the revised TEQ scheme is generally universally accepted, with the updated TEFs used in the TEQ calculation. Some of the data reviewed by the 2018 TFDT quotes TEQ values. A detailed discussion of ITEQ and TEQ is on page 13 of 2018 TEAP Report, Volume 2: Decision XXIX/4 TEAP Task Force Report on Destruction Technologies for Controlled Substances 47 General technical guidelines on the environmentally sound management of wastes consisting of, containing or contaminated with persistent organic pollut ants, UNEP/CHW.14/7/Add.1/Rev.1, Para 161, May 2019, http://www.basel.int/Implementation/TechnicalMatters/Deve lopmentofTechnicalGuidelines/TechnicalGuidelines/t abid/8025/Default.aspx (accessed April 2020). 2022 TEAP Progress Report - Volume 1 68 within national regul atory frameworks. A recommendation by TEAP or an approval by parties of a destruction technology under the Montreal Protocol does not guarantee that local emissions requirements can or will be met on a specific facility employing an approved technology. Th ere may be other concerns or emissions of interest to governments at their national or local levels. Waste ODS/HFCs may be classified as hazardous wastes, with additional requirements imposed through relevant legislation, nationally, or regionally (Europe an Union). Waste ODS/HFCs may also be subject to international reference guidance (such as adopted by the Basel Convention) in terms of emissions performance, including more comprehensive measures of destruction efficiency, other potential emissions, and s ources of emissions and monitoring. 6.2.4 Suggested information requirements for TEAP assessment Below is a suggested list of information requirements for TEAP assessment of destruction technologies. In future, parties may wish to consider providing any new information as outlined below for TEAP assessment of destruction technologies in January of the same year in which its assessment would be reported either as part of the annual TEAP Progress Report or the quadrennial Assessment Report. 1. Please provide a description of the process, including whether the destruction technology would be considered therm al oxidation, plasma arc, or chemical conversion 62F48 technology, and associated scrubbing systems. Please include a schematic of the process, with information on the analysis points. 2. At the current stage of development, would you describe the technology a s being a demonstration system with all of the characteristics of a commercial system, or a commercially ready system? Note that a demonstration system should achieve >1kg/hour throughput to qualify for assessment. 63F49 3. Which ODS or HFC (CFC, CTC, halon, H CFC, methyl bromide, HFC, and specify Annex and Group relevant to controlled substance) wastes are being destroyed by the technology? Does destruction include mixed waste streams and, if so, is the DRE measured for individual substances or mixtures (either is acceptable)? 4. What other non -ODS or non -HFC waste streams have been destroyed using the technology? If these are a comparable recalcitrant halogenated organic substance such as polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB), what is the DRE for these waste streams? 5. For the destruction technology, provide the operating conditions and associated results of analyses of pollutant emissions in the table below, specifying to which controlled substance the data is relevant. Unless advised otherwise, data may be published in a TEAP report; please let us know if this is acceptable or not. 48 Conversion technologies transform halocarbons under a range of operating conditions, often at lower temperature than incineration, using specific reactants to achieve the conversion of ODS or HFCs (including conversion to saleable products like acids, vinyl monomer etc.). 49 The technology must demonstrate destruction on at least a pilot scale or demonstration scale, where the processing capacity is no less than 1.0 kg/hr of the substance to be destroyed, whether ODS/HFC or a suitable surrogate. 2022 TEAP Progress Report - Volume 1 69 Table 6.6: Results of analyses of emissions and associated operating conditions for each controlled substance destroyed Operating Conditions and Destruction Efficiency Atmospheric Emissions ODS/HFC Feed in Exhaust Gas % Particulates mg/Nm3 CO mg/Nm3 Stack gas flow rate 68F58 Nm3 6. Describe how the DRE has been measured and calculated. 7. For a high temperature destruction technolog y, provide details of the quench conditions and flue gas treatment facilities as these are important in controlling dioxin/furan formation and emissions. 8. For a conversion technology, provide a mass balance 69F59, also called a material balance, of the process. 50 A range is acceptable. 51 The specific dioxins/furans to be tested should be relevant to the halogenated species in the waste feed, e.g., chlorinated PCDD/PCDF and methyl bromide; mixed halogenated species for mixed waste feeds. The analytical methods for chlorinated dioxins and furans are well established and widely available. Analytical capability for brominated species is also available. If brominated species analysis is not available, it is recommended that a chlorinated ODS or chlorinated recalcitrant organic substance is used to measure the dioxin/furan emissions. Under the same conditions, fluorinated dioxins/furans are less readily formed, allowing a chlorinated species to be used to establish dioxin/furan emissions if fluorinated species analysis is not available. 52 A range is acceptable. 53 The specific acid gases to be tested should be relev ant to the halogenated species in the waste feed (e.g., HCl/Cl 2 and HF for CFCs), and mixed halogenated species tested for mixed waste streams. 54 A range is acceptable. 55 The specific acid gases to be tested should be relevant to the halogenated species in the waste feed (e.g., HCl/Cl 2 and HF for CFCs), and mixed halogenated species tested for mixed waste streams. 56 The 2002 Task Force on Destruction Technologies Report Ap pendix F: Sampling and Analytical Methods states 'Note that in determining DREs, it is necessary to test both the input to a destruction technology and the exhaust gas stream.' 57 The specific acid gases to be tested should be relevant to the halogenated sp ecies in the waste feed (e.g., HCl/Cl 2 and HF for CFCs), and mixed halogenated species tested for mixed waste streams. 58 All concentrations of pollutants in stack gases and stack gas flow rates are expressed based on dry gas at normal conditions of 0oC and 101.3 kPa, and with the stack gas corrected to 11% O 2 (as referred to by normal cubic metre, Nm3).Different stack gas conditions may apply in different countries for different technologies and so stack gas may need to be corrected to 11% O 2. 59 A mass balance is an application of the conservation of mass to the analysis of physical systems associated with the process, by accounting for material entering and leaving the system and by which mass flows can be identified. 2022 TEAP Progress Report - Volume 1 70 9. Describe what methods have been used for sampling and analysis, including details on the number/sam pling rate of analyses carried out and whether this is automated, and limits of detection. 10. Describe any procedures during start up or shut down to avoid emissions of the controlled substances. 11. Provide information about other environmental pollutant emissi ons of concern resulting from the process (e.g., fluorocarbons with high GWP, such as CF 4, corrosive salts in effluent, Persistent Organic Pollutants controlled under Annex C (Unintentional Production) of the Stockholm Convention, etc.) and measures in pla ce to control those pollutant emissions. 6.3 Process agents MCTOC has reviewed the information reported to the Ozone Secretariat under decisions X/14(4) and XXI/3(1) by China, EU, Israel, and the USA. Considering decision XXXI/6(3), MCTOC has not identified compelling new information to report to parties in this progress report. MCTOC will report further on process agents in its 2022 Assessment Report. 6.4 Laboratory and analytical uses MCTOC has reviewed the information reported to the Ozone Secre tariat on production and import of controlled substances used for laboratory and analytical uses. Considering decision XXXI/5(7), MCTOC has not identified compelling new information to report to parties in this progress report. MCTOC will report further on laboratory and analytical uses in its 2022 Assessment Report. 6.5 n-Propyl bromide MCTOC has considered available information on n-propyl bromide. Considering decision XXX/15 (6), MCTOC has not identified compelling new information to report to parties in this progress report. MCTOC will report further on n-propyl bromide in its 2022 inhalers (SMIs), and other delivery systems all play a n important role in the treatment of asthma and COPD . New alternative propellant technologies to high-GWP HFC MDIs are under development . Several pharmaceutical companies have now publicly committed to develop ing inhalers that contain alternative propella nts (HFC-152a and HFO -1234ze) significant -134a and HFC -227ea). 60,61,62 These new alternatives will This will also help identif y if there are any leakages or losses in the system. 60 AstraZeneca - Volume 1 71 support the introduction of MDI products with carbon footprint s reduced by 85% or more63. Contract development and manufacturing organi sation s are now also offering development and manufacturing capabilities for MDIs with alternative propellants.64 Progress in development is demonstrated by steps forward in the completion of the toxicology package for these alternative propellants, with long -term toxicology testing and the Drug Master File (DMF) for HF C-152a expected to be completed by mid -2022.65 The pharmaceutical industry has also achieved important progress with the commencement of the first clinical studies of MDI products containing one of the new propellants .66 Considerable work has also been performed to establish or adapt manufacturing facilities, both at the pharma ceutical product and propellant supply level, to safely handle the two new propellants. One chemical company recently announced the opening of a new facility to produce pharma ceutical -grade HF C-152a that will be available at commercial scale by mid - 2022 . 67 Pharmaceutical companies are planning first launches from as early as 2025. However, as with any new drug product development, there are risks and challenges still to be overcome. A detailed launch schedule has not yet been announced by the companies involved. DPIs, soft mist inhalers and nebulisers are already available for most molecules and combinations as alternatives to high -GWP MDIs, offering a lower carbon footprint. One company has launched a new range of single capsule DPIs d elivered from a re -usable inhaler, making it lowest GWP of all inhalers yet tested.68 Nebuli sers may offer an alternative to MDIs in some uses. MCTOC will report further in its A, Nudo E, Nicolini G, Environmental impact of inhalers for respiratory diseases: decreasing the carbon footprint while preserving patient -tailored treatment , BMJ UK, HFA -152a as a Sustainable pMDI Propellant, Respiratory production facility , Accessed April KM, Sagara Aum E, Khan J, Vestbo J, Tope H , The environmental impact of inhaled therapy: making informed treatment choices , TEAP Progress Report - Volume 1 73 7 Refrigeration, Air Condit ioning and Heat Pumps TOC (RTOC) Progress Report 7.1 Introduction In 2021, RTOC reached consensus regarding the structure of the 2022 RTOC Assessment Report (AR2022) and will maintain the Chapter Lead Authors and Chapters Authors organi sation. RTOC members devoted time in developing the Second Order Draft (SOD) of the report which will be followed by a Third Order Draft (TOD), to be completed in the course of June 2022. 7.2 Refrigerant s Since the publication of the RTOC 2018 Assessment Report, one new single component refrigerant and eighteen refrigerant blends have received a designation and/or classification from the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air -Conditioning Eng ineers (ASHRAE) Standard 34 and/or from the International Standards Organisation (ISO) 817. These eighteen refrigerants are listed in tables 7.1, 7.2 and 7.3 below. Their GWP and ODP values are calculated in the same way as the ones given in the RTOC 2018 Assessment Report. One of the refrigerants is a single -component refrigerant, trifluoroiodomethane - IFC-13I1. Although this fluid had not yet received a designation from one of the refrigerant standards, it had already been mentioned in the RTOC 2018 Ass essment Report. IFC -13I1 is now classified as non -flammable and with low chronic toxicity (safety class A1) in ASHRAE 34, while it is not listed in ISO 817. The boiling point is -21.9\u00b0C, and IFC -13I1 has the potential, when used as a component in refrigera nt blends (such as R -466A), to produce low flammability refrigerant blends with a lower GWP. There are concerns about the stability of IFC-13I1 and there is therefore ongoing research on this topic. The ODP of IFC -13I1 is less than 0.09, but the impact on the ozone layer varies significantly with the geographical location of the release, due to its short atmospheric lifetime. More details on the ODP of IFC - 13I1 were already given in the RTOC 2018 Assessment Report. The remaining refrigerants are blends: R-427B, 427C, and R -467A GWP fluids. R-448B, R -457B, and HFO HFO R -472B, and 473A all contain CO 2, which composition lowers the GWP, lowers the boiling point and results in relatively large temperature glides. R-515B is very similar to the existing R -515A and is also an azeotropic blend of HFO - 1234ze(E) and HFC -227ea. It is worth noting from the tabl es below, that most of the new refrigerants are non - flammable and of low toxicity, furthermore they have boiling points similar to traditional refrigerants such as HFC -23, TEAP Progress Report - Volume 1 74 Table 7.1: Data summary for new single componen t refrigerants Refrigerant Designation Chemical Formula Chemical Name Molecular Weight Boiling Point (\u00b0C) Safety Class Atmospheric Lifetime (Years) Radiative Efficiency (W/m/ ppm) 7.2: Data summary for new zeotropic refrigerant blends Refrigerant Designation Refrigerant Composition (Mass %) Molecular Weight Bubble Point/ Dew Point (\u00b0C) Safety Class GWP Progress Report - Volume 1 75 Table 7.3: Data summary for new azeotropic refrigerant blends Refrigerant Designation Refrigerant Composition (Mass %) Molecular Weight Bubble Point/ Dew Point (\u00b0C) Safety Class GWP A1 280 470 7.3 Factory sealed domestic and commercial refrigeration appliances Currently, the entire global new production of domestic refrigerators is based on non -ODS refrigerants, predominantly HC -600a and to from HFC -134a to HC -600a is expected to continue, driven by Kigali Amendment phase -down schedules or local regulations on HFCs. I t is estimated that by 2020 about 75% of new refrigerator production were using HC -600a and the rest was still applying HFC -134a. Commercial systems are predominantly produced with HFCs, particularly HFC -134a. Migrations are taking place to HC -290 and HC -600a in several European and US companies. The application of R -744 has gained a lot of interest in some niche markets. This trend is spreading to some of the Article 5 countries too. The most commonly used refrigerants in HPTDs are HFC -134a, R -407C, and R-410A. Large European manufacturers, motivated by the reduction of refrigerant quotas under the EU F -Gas regulation, have already switched to HC -290 for better efficiency while complying with safety standards. For most appliances and components used in a ppliances, particular safety standards are available within the IEC 60335 framework. Applicable standards include: 60335 -2-11 Household and similar electrical appliances - Safety for tumble dryers 60335 -2-24 Household and similar electrical appliances - Safety for refrigerating appliances, ice -cream appliances and ice makers 60335 -2-75 Household and similar electrical appliances - Safety for commercial dispensing appliances and vending machines 60335 -2-89 Household and similar electrical appliances - Safety for commercial refrigerating appliances and icemakers with an incorporated or remote refrigerant unit or motor -compressor 60335 -2-118 Household and similar electrical appliances - Safety for professional ice-cream makers The regulatory schemes and standards on energy efficiency seem to drive manufacturers to innovate products for better energy efficiency at lower costs. 7.4 Food retail and food service refrigeration The trend of adopting some form of a GWP limit on the use of high GWP HFC gases in food retail and food service applications continues across the world. The F -gas regulation 517/2014 in Europe is in the process o f being updated and in the U.S., the American Innovation and Manufacturing Act of 2020 (AIM Act) signed into law on 27 December 2020, is being 2022 TEAP Progress Report - Volume 1 76 implemented. According to ICAP (India Cooling Action Plan), in India and around the world, a combined energy and refrigerant use metric may be considered for the labelling of equipment The commonly used HFCs in existing food retail and food service are R -404A (GWP 3922) (GWP 1810) is still being used. Much lower GWP alternatives for these refrigerants are now widely available in the European Union and North American markets. In non -A5 parties, R -448A and R -449A are being used widely to replace R -404A and HCFC -22 in both existing systems and new systems wherever pe rmitted by regulations. Lower GWP refrigerants, which are mostly A2L, are also gaining acceptance. Commercial stand -alone systems, which are commonly used in food retail and food service establishments, have for the most part transitioned to R -290, with so me exceptions where the properties of the halocarbon blends are needed for achieving performance. Non-halocarbon refrigerants such as R -744 continue to make gains in many regions, particularly in Europe and North America. Regardless of the refrigerant, the awareness of the need for leak detection and leak prevention is growing worldwide. 7.5 Transport refrigeration In the past year, a progressive conversion from HFC -404A to R -452A continued, together with an exploration of alternatives. It was supported by a progress in relevant safety standards, in particular ISO 20854 (2019) for marine containers and a parallel activity on trucks and trailers. The industry is experiencing inflation and disruptions in the supply chain after the global pandemic. 7. 6 Air-to-air air conditioners and heat pumps Air conditioners, including reversible air heating heat pumps (generally defined as \"reversible heat pumps\"), range in size from 1 kW to 750 kW although the majority are less than 70 kW. The most populous are non -ducted single splits, which are produced in excess of 80 million units per year (in 2020). All products sold within non -A5 parties use non -ODS refrigerants. There is an increasing proportion of production of air conditioners in A5 countries that do not use HCFCs. Globally more than four -fifths all units produced globally use non -ODP refrigerants. Conversion of the HCFC -22 production of equipment is continuing and in most non -A5 parties the use of HCFC -22 has been prohibited in new systems. For A5 parties less than a third of ACs are produced with HCFC -22. In addition to the wid espread use of R -410A, the extensive introduction of HFC -32 in residential split air conditioners continues in many countries around the world, accounting for nearly half of the tota l production of split room air conditioners in 2021. Enterprises in A5 parties and also mainly those in non -A5 regions, are continuing to evaluate and develop products with various HFC/unsaturated HFC blends, such -454B and R - 452B.Further conversion of production lines to HC -290 in China, South East Asia and South America is underway, and (except for small and portable units) there is limited market introduction, which is due to restrictive requirements of safety standards. In China, more models are now being offered , and i n India , the production of HC-290 split air conditioners 2022 TEAP Progress Report - Volume 1 77 continues . At least one company has introduced a range of products with R -463A and models with R -454A are anticipated elsewhere . Some enterprises in the Middle East still see R -407C and HFC -134a --and in some applications R410A -- as the most favourable alternatives to HCFC -22. The new edition of the standard IEC 60335 -2-4069 was approved in April 2022 by the International Electrotechnical Commission. The approved revised version will allow HC -290 (propane), and other flammable refrigerants, to be used in many air conditioning systems and heat pumps that were previously prohibit ed by the previous version of the standard from using these refrigerants. The revised safety standard allows for the use of a larger charge of flammable refrigerants (up to 988g of HC -290 in a standard split air conditioning system). This will be possible on new equipment that must have additional safety requirements to ensure the same high level of safety as equipment that does not use flammable refrigerants. The use of flammable refrigerants in air conditioning equipment will lead to a reduction in direct climate emissions compared to systems using R410A. 7.7 Commercial comfort air conditioning There are now complete lines of all chiller types in all major markets that use refrigerants having lower GWP than their predecessors ; see the Table 7.4 below. Additionally , non- fluorinated refrigerants, such as ammonia, are available in some chiller types, albeit in select sizes and not in (from) complete product lines. Existing products using high GWP refrigerants have not been discontinued, and in fact are still the dominant products being sold in most markets. Normal market forces will cause this to slowly change. The Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol is provid ing some regulation to cause a more rapid change. However, there is little else in terms of regulation or incentives that are accelerating change. Products using the existing refrigerants will continue to be sold and the installed base of these products wi ll remain in service for years to come. Despite the new refrigerant choices including that are now available for new and existing equipment, they may not be the final choices. There is continued pressure from regulators to move to yet another generation o f zero ODP and near zero GWP refrigerants , if technically possible and economically reasonable. 69 Household and simi lar electrical appliances - Safety - Part 2 -40: Particular requirements for electrical heat pumps, air -conditioners and dehumidifiers 2022 TEAP Progress Report - Volume 1 78 Table 7.4 Refrigerants used within chillers New refrigerant choices, notably replacements for HFC -134a (medium pressure) and R -410A (high pressure), include flammable refrigerants, safety class A2L. Safety regulations that allow use of A2L refrigerants, supported by recent research, are being written, but are not uniform nor adopted in all regions. This is not a trivial matter, since health, safety and propert y issues are involved. Adoption and enforcement of revised codes and standards may slow the adoption new flammable refrigerants. In the face of ever -increasing energy demand from the use of comfort air conditioning, customers and regulators alike are inte rested in less energy consumption. Global warming effects from chillers are dominated by their energy use, rather than the direct emissions from refrigerants. Regardless of any future refrigerant change, new products must improve full and part load or seas onal energy consumption. 7.8 Mobile AC/HP At present, more than one refrigerant is used for new cars and light trucks air conditioning and heavy -duty off -road vehicles: HFC -134a will remain to be used world -wide while, as a consequence of current regulations, HFO -1234yf replaced it in Europe, US , and Japan. The progressive electrification of road transport in Europe, China and North America is leading to the implementation of a heat pump function and for this R -744 is taken as the (most promising) alternative. In Europe there is a movement led by several countries asking for limiting the use of PFAS -related substances. Several countries developed a new, broader definition for PFAS -related substances. With this new definition many HFCs, HFOs and polymeric materials (such as hoses) would now be included in this revised definition. Even if the study is at an early stage, new scenarios considering alternative refrigerants are re - evaluated. In A5 parties, the availability and cost of low GWP refrigerant s (e.g., HFO -1234yf) is still a barrier and options based on the use of dual loop system combined with HFC -152a or hydrocarbons remains under evaluation (e.g. , in India). The mobile air conditioning system increases the annual average vehicle energy demand of about the 20% leading to an estimated GHG indirect emissions of about 280 Mt CO 2-eq. per year. Road transport electrification could reduce this amount from 0% to 40% dependent on the electrification rate and on the average energy mix of electric energy production ( the current worldwide ratio is 475 g CO 2/kWh). 2022 TEAP Progress Report - Volume 1 79 7.9 Industrial refrigeration, heat pumps and heat engines Since the 2018 Assessment Report there is more focus on energy efficiency and heat recovery in industrial refrigeration. Regarding heat recovery, the industrial sector, including industrial refrigeration, accounts for approximately 30% of the global total energy consumption and up to 50% of it is lost as waste heat (Thorsson, 2020). The waste heat can be recovered in various ways. For the industrial producer it means that what was regarded as waste heat in the past, has become an asset that has a value for other purposes. This heat can be the natural heat source for a heat pump producing 90\u00b0C ho t water for chemical free cleaning or may serve as source for a heat pump that produces even higher temperature water or steam. It is expected that innovative solutions for heat recovery will contin ue to emerge. Industrial companies are focused on improving the efficiency of their process, and thereby reducing energy consumption. This is accomplished by improving the efficiency of individual pieces of equipment and the total process or system, but al so by employing non -traditional approaches. As the transition from fossil fuel based electrical production to sustainable electrical production advances, electrically driven heat pumps are more widely used. The Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol has stimulated the broader use of lower GWP refrigerants. Industrial systems with ammonia are seeing more competition from CO 2 rather than from HFC s and HCFC s, especially HCFC -22. 7.10 Heating -only heat pumps In general, heating -only heat pumps represent a fa st-growing equipment type in several regions in the world. The growth is driven by decarbonisation and pollution targets. Currently, Europe, Japan and China are leading the way. In Europe and US there are recently several strong initiatives to replace foss il fuel combustion heating by heat pumps. Energy efficiency and product cost are the most important characteristics, as heat pumps compete mainly with combusting type water heating equipment. Regulation is driving the adoption of lower GWP refrigerants, an d noise level is becoming an important characteristic. The need to achieve high efficiency, low cost, low GWP and low noise represents a major challenge for equipment manufacturers. As the heating -only heat pumps subsector does not represent a mature mark et yet, the availability of components at competitive price is critical. Specifically, compressor s must be able to operate at specific heating operation conditions, and refrigerant s must be chosen accordingly. For very high -pressure refrigerants, such as R-744, there is a need for specific components and control features that are able to operate at very high pressure. Sometimes the other applications in which the same compressor is used (such as commercial refrigeration and air conditioners) drives the refr igerant selection. In recent years, some new refrigerant trends have emerged. For new developments, there is a general tendency to move away from high -GWP refrigerants. For water heating appliances there is a growing usage of R -744, R -290 and HFC -32 as a refrigerant. Where safety restrictions allow to use it, R-290 is growing in monobloc equipment. R -744 is applied for heating water for storage at high temperature, since R-744 shows good performance for this application . However, cost and performance for br oader heating application s are limiting adoption of R -744, particularly in Europe. There is an extensive introduction of refrigerant HFC -32 for heat pumps as they use several common components with the air -to-air air - conditioners and heat pumps. Also , for larger water heating heat pumps , as well as for combined space - plus hot water heating heat pumps, HFC -32 is seeing a very high growth in consumption due to the broad availability of refrigerant and components already qualified for these applications. For those areas in the world where there are restrictions on the use of 2022 TEAP Progress Report - Volume 1 80 flammable refrigerants, HFCs with higher GWPs are used. Based on upcoming regulations for the phase -down of HFCs, continued transition to low and medium GWP refrigerants is expected in the next few years. As reported in the 2020 progress report, R -454C had been introduced for water heating heat - pumps by one manufacturer. Recently, R -454B has also been introduced for the use in water heating heat -pumps. Besides the adaptations for using an A2L flammable refrigerant, design changes and production process impa cts for using R -454B are limited when converting from R-410A. 2022 TEAP Progress Report - Volume 1 81 8 Decision XXXI/8 and TEAP matters 8.1 Nomination and appointment process This section includes information previously provided in the 2020 and 2021 TEAP Progress Reports as these processes are relevant to TEAP's recommendations in this section of the report. At the 31st MOP, decision XXXI/8, \"Terms of reference of the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel and its technical options committees and tempora ry subsidiary bodies - procedures relevant to nominations,\" states the following: \"...To request the Panel to provide, as part of its annual progress report, a summary outlining the procedures that the Panel and its technical options committees have undertaken to ensure adherence to the Panel's terms of reference through clear and transparent procedures, including full consultations with the focal points, in line with the terms of reference, regarding: a) nomination processes, taking into account the ma trix of needed expertise and already available expertise; b) proposed nominations and appointment decisions; c) termination of appointments; and d) replacements; Under TEAP's mandates from parties , TEAP continuously works to identifying appropriate expertise and finding qualified candidates who are interested and available to serve . TEAP takes into consideration of its current pool of experts, with the potential loss of expertise , through attrition or lack of support, and the need for specific and cross -cutting e xpertise within TOCs and the TEAP itself . TEAP communicate s these needs to parties through its annual progress reports and the matrix of needed expertise. To facilitate the submission of nominations by the parties, the terms of reference instruct the Panel and its TOCs to draw up guidelines for the nomination of experts. It is stipulated that \"the TEAP/TOCs will publicize a matrix of expertise available , and the expertise needed in the TEAP/TOCs so as to facilitate submission of appropriate nominations by the parties. The matrix must include the need for geographic and expertise balance and provide consistent information on expertise that is available and req uired. The matrix would include the name and affiliation and the specific expertise required including on different alternatives. The TEAP/TOCs, acting through their respective co -chairs, shall ensure that the matrix is updated at least once a year and sha ll publish the matrix on the Secretariat website and in the Panel's annual progress reports. The TEAP/TOCs shall also ensure that the information in the matrix is clear, sufficient and consistent as far as is appropriate between the TEAP and TOCs and balan ced to allow a full understanding of needed expertise\" (TOR 2.9). Annex 1 of this report provides updated TOC membership lists , includ ing the current terms of appointment for all members . Each TOC describes the expertise that is currently available and the expertise that is needed. The TOR specify that \"nominations of members to the TEAP, including co -chairs of the TEAP and TOCs, must be made by individual parties to the Secretariat through their respective national focal points. Such nominations will be f orwarded to the Meeting of the Parties for consideration. The TEAP co -chairs shall ensure that any potential nominee identified by TEAP for appointment to the Panel, including co -chairs of TEAP and the TOCs, is agreed to by the national focal points of the relevant party. A member of TEAP, the TOCs or the TSBs shall not be a current representative of a party to the Montreal Protocol\" (TOR 2.2.1). 2022 TEAP Progress Report - Volume 1 82 For TOCs or temporary subsidiary bodies (TSBs) , the TOR require all nominations to be made in full consultation with the national focal point of the relevant party. The TOR further state that \"all nominations to the TOCs and TSBs shall be made in full consultation with the national focal point of the relevant party. Nominations of members to a TOC (other than TOC co-chairs) may also be made by individual parties , or TEAP and TOC co -chairs may suggest to individual parties experts to consider nominating. Nominations to a TSB (including TSB co-chairs) can be made by the TEAP co -chairs\" (TOR 2.2.2). 8.1.1 Proposed nominations and appointment decisions Ensuring relevant and sufficient technical expertise is the priority consideration for the Panel and its committees. The need to maintain a reasonable size and balance, to avoid the duplication of expertise a nd to ensure that particular gaps in expertise are filled, means that experts nominated by parties may sometimes be declined or that their consideration may be deferred by the committee co -chairs in consultation with the Panel co -chairs. Although the commi ttee co -chairs take into account A5/non -A5, gender and geographical balance, relevant technical expertise can outweigh those other considerations . Nominations are currently made through a standardised nomination form (Annex 3) , that may include a curriculu m vitae , and which is also available on the Ozone Secretariat's website70. If information is not already included in the curriculum vitae of the nominee, t he standardised form requests relevant information such as education and other qualifications, relevant employment history, publications, awards, memberships, and references. It is helpful when there is consultation between the parties and the co -chairs of the Panel and/or the relevant commit tee on potential nominations for the positions of co -chairs of the Panel or the committees. In the case of nominations or nominations for reappointment for the position of members in a committee, the committee co -chairs consult with the Panel co -chairs and the relevant national focal points. The TOCs committees also receive nominations for the position of members directly from parties. In determining whether to accept or decline a nomination, the committee co -chairs, in consultation with the Panel as appro priate, consider the expertise of the nominee taking into account the expertise needed by the relevant committee, and also the balance of A5/non -A5, geographical and gender. The gaps in the expertise within the committees are presented in the matrix of nee ded expertise and annual progress reports . It has been the practice that nominations for committee membership and appointments to the committee can be made at any time , which has worked well in promptly sourcing the needed expertise and flexibly responding to the constant and yet changing workloads of some committees . As specified in section 2.3 of the TOR , upon nomination by the relevant party, parties appoint members of the panel upon nomination by the relevant party for periods of up to four years each. As specified in section 2.5 of the TOR , the \"TOC members are appointed by the TOC co-chairs, in consultation with TEAP, for a period of no more than four years.\" 70 https://ozone.unep.org/science/assessment/teap 2022 TEAP Progress Report - Volume 1 83 8.2 TEAP and TOCs organisational and other matters TEAP takes this opportunity to bring to parties' attention information relevant to each TOC: 8.2.1 FTOC FTOC meets regularly, virtually, due to the pandemic, and has increased the frequency to biweekly meetings to prepare for the 2022 Assessment Report. FTOC members curre ntly have expertise in: producing and handling foam blowing agents; foam formulation; foam production (XPS, Spray Foam, appliance etc.) and life cycle analysis; emissions and banks model ling; certification testing for foams; regulations related to foams; global foam markets including forecasting future production; historical knowledge of foams, foam blowing agents, regulations, and the Montreal Protocol; the building envelope and reducing energy demand from buildings; appliance design and production energy efficiency. 8.2.2 HTOC Following the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol, the role of the Halons Technical Options Committee (HTOC) has broadened to cover low /no-GWP alternatives to halons, HCFCs, and high -GWP HFCs. However, the Kigali amendment does not necessarily bring the need for any additional areas of expertise in fire protection because the use s remain unchanged , although additional expertise for regional or sub -regional considerations will be needed . From a fire safety standpoint, the HTOC remains concerned that the flammability of refrigerants, foam blowing agents and solvents requires fire protection expertise which almost exclusively resides in the HTOC within the TEAP . The HTOC remains available to assist in this area. Generally speaking, the HTOC maintains expertise in the following five main areas: 1) a fundamental scientific understanding of fire chemistry and the process of combustion and fire exti nguishment , and technical and economic expertise in fire protection needs, active and passive methods, system maintenance and personnel training. 2) the use of halons, HCFCs, high -GWP HFCs and their alternatives in fire protection, including emissions and installed amounts ( bank estimates ), 3) \"banking\" i.e., collection, recycling/reclamation, and re -deployment of fire extinguishants including their application standards, purity requirements, and destruction issues, 4) issues impacting current and future use, e.g., continued reliance on halons for existing uses in military, oil and gas, merchant shipping, etc., and for existing/new installations in civil aviation, and phase -down requirements of fire protections uses of high GWP HFCs. This includes modelli ng of remaining quantities and emissions of halons, and growth of HCFCs and high -GWP HFCs. 5) In addition , the HTOC maintains an understanding of the workings of the Montreal Protocol and how lessons learned in phasing out production and consumption of halons, for example, on some applications could be reapplied in phasing out the production and consumption of HCFCs and phasing down the high -GWP HFCs under the Kigali Amendment. Within the five main areas, the expertise is further divided into sectoral expertise and regional expertise. From a sectoral perspective, the HTOC has experts on fire protection requirements for on-going uses of halons , HCFCs, high -GWP HFCs and their alternatives within civil 2022 TEAP Progress Report - Volume 1 84 aviation, military, telecommunications, oil and gas, power generation, merchant shipping, explosion protection, etc. The HTOC also maintains expertise in banking and recycling of halons, HCFCs, high GWP HFCs and their alternatives . HTOC recently adde d expertise on halon recovery (amounts, quantity and qualify) from active and historic shipbreaking activities. From a regional standpoint, the HTOC has expertise covering North America, Eastern and Western Europe, Australia , and Japan, with some limited expertise in Anglophone North Africa (Egypt), the Middle East ( Kuwait), South America (Brazil), Asia (India and World Bank expertise on halon production phase -out in China). As noted in the matrix of expertise needed, the HTOC is continuing to look for add itional experts to promote A5/non -A5 and regional balance while also being mindful of gender balance. 8.2.3 MBTOC MBTOC met virtually at the beginning of April 2022 to conduct assessment of CUNs for methyl bromide submitted by parties, and to prepare its 2 022 Progress Report. A face -to-face meeting is planned in September 2022 to finalize the 2022 Assessment Report. MBTOC currently has two co -chairs (one A5, one non -A5) and fourteen members, 5 from A5 countries and 8 from non -A5. MBTOC is seeking new members who are QPS experts preferably females from Asia and Latin America . Members with crossover links to the TPPT Committee of the IPPC would be most welcome. Stocks of MB and illegal trade continue to be prominent issues , as well as e missions of MB . MBTOC further suggests that in response to the Rome Declaration, the increasing importa nce of the 2030 Agenda and its SDGs plus recent action taken by UNEA (e.g. , nitroge n, use of plastics a nd others), the committee may in the near future work on a wider scope of issues where it has relevant expertise and where its expertise could be strengthened. 8.2.4 MCTOC Face-to-face meetings were impossible due to COVID -19 and MCTOC's Progress Report was developed online and through electronic means. 2022 MCTOC A ssessment Report preparations are underway through online and electronic means . At the end of 20 21, MCTOC had 1 co-chair and 7 members whose terms of appointment ended, 6 of whom were appointed for additional terms of up to 4 years : William Auriemma (aerosols, US); B. Narsaiah (chemicals, India); Rajiev Sharma on his retirement from MCTOC for his years of voluntary service to the Montreal Protocol. Considering additional expertise needs, a new member , Alex Wilkinson (metered dose inhalers, UK) has been appoint ed, following his nomination and in consultation with the national focal point of the relevant part y, in accordance with TEAP's terms of reference. MCTOC co -chairs continue to review and renew its membership and to consider its structure to ensure it can a ddress current and future predicted challenges of the Montreal Protocol in medical and chemicals sectors. Some new areas of expansion in knowledge and expertise include: HFC semiconductor etchants, a sector which uses controlled substances, in the manufact ure of semiconductors in etching processes and also in chemical vapour deposition, that are subject to the HFC phase down; and end -of-life waste management of controlled substances to address the status of banks and the options available for managing them so as to 2022 TEAP Progress Report - Volume 1 85 avoid emissions and the associated systemic opportunities and challenges with their disposal and destruction. MCTOC seeks new members to strengthen expertise in the following identified key knowledge areas: HFC semiconductor etchants; destruction technologies and end -of-life metered dose inhalers; and aerosols . 8.2.5 RTOC During the second half of 2021 and the first half of 2022 RTOC met twice virtually, during 27-29 September 2021 and 9 -11 March 2022. Consensus was reached in 2021 about the structure of the 2022 Assessment Report (AR2022), and the same vertical organi sation of the previous RTOC AR2018 was maintained, including the Chapter Lead Authors and Chapters Authors structure. During the 2021 meeting , the revision of the First Order Draft (FOD) of AR2022 and the release of the guidelines for the preparation of the Second Order Draft (SOD , were performed. The revision of the SOD was worked on during the March 2022 meeting and the deadline for the Third Order Draft (TOD) was established for mid -June 2022. The TOD will be edited and completed by the RTOC co -chairs, it will then be submitted on September/October 2022 for peer review and RTOC members' review, to 18 international RACHP organi sations and a few outside experts, as it was done for the RTOC 2018 Assessment Report. During the 2020 -2022 pandemic, the RTOC membership stood at 42 members (i.e., as of January 2020). 8.4 Organisational Matters - Recommendations 8.4.1 Introduction TEAP continues to maintain or have access to the expertise, experience , and capacity to provide the parties with the technical and economic information they need to further the goals and objectives of the Vienna Convention and Montreal Protocol thr ough reports, presentations, analyses, recommendations requested by the parties. The expertise and structure of TEAP and its TOCs are designed to address its current workload, including completing its Assessment Reports at the end of 2022. TEAP continues to review its organi sation and structure to ensure that TEAP and its TOCS are structured in size and expertise to support future efforts of the parties to phase out ODS and phase down HFCs. In its presentation to the high -level segment at MOP -33, TEAP noted some of the challenges to its work over the past few years: The COVID pandemic has required Montreal Protocol processes to adapt (e.g., online comment forums, written responses to comments, extended technical sessions, repeated presentations, expanding scope over tim e). Despite the substantial additional workload and challenges with maintaining consensus and engagement virtually, TEAP has provided 14 reports since MOP -31. TEAP and TOC memberships are world -leading technical experts in their field, and we constantly st rive to maintain that level of independent technical and economic expertise for the service of parties. TEAP is aware of the need to ensure that its membership meets the evolving needs of parties whilst ensuring continuity of its work under the Montreal Pr otocol. 2022 TEAP Progress Report - Volume 1 86 TEAP is planning face -to-face discussions in 2022 on its structure, membership, and future directions to present in its 2022 Progress Report. In May 2022, at its hybrid meeting in London , TEAP discussed its structure , memberships , particularly within its TOCs , and how best to meet the continuing trends and challenges that may impact the future efforts of the parties to ensure the phase out of ODS and phase down of HFCs. In particular, TEAP considered the increasing emphasis on food and vaccine cold chains and the overall health and performance of buildings especially during the pandemic, including energy efficiency, safety, and availability of alternatives during the transition to ODS and HFC alternatives . Based on its discussions a t its meeting, TEAP is providing its recommendations for the consideration of parties to address these specific challenges through a restructuring of two TOCs: RTOC and FTOC. In addition, TEAP considered the scope of work for its three additional TOCs (MCT OC, MBTOC, HTOC). According to t he TEAP Terms of Reference (TOR), \"[to] carry out its work programme, technical options committees (TOCs) are established and agreed to by a decision of the parties.\" These recommendations to parties follow a detailed consideration of work and reflect TEAP 's continuing commitment to the aims of the parties so that its TOCs are structured to support current and future efforts under the Vienna Convention and Montreal Protocol. 8.4.2 Considerations for RTOC and FTOC A synergistic approach to cold chains for f ood and other perishables as well as medicines would allow for more thoughtful consideration of the architecture of retail facilities and how that may impact foam blowing agent and refrigerant selection and safe , efficient use. Similarly, issues such as se lection of ODS and HFC alternatives and energy demands in the context of ventilation needs and load reduction in buildings through insulation and design, could be ex amined in a holistic manner . The TEAP is recommending the following to enhance its ability to provide necessary support to the Parties and provides further background information below . 1. In recognition of the timely opportunity to address these challenges, t he TEAP would like the parties to consider forming two new TOCs in place of the current Refrigeration, Air Conditioning and Heat Pumps Technical Options Committee (RTOC) and the Flexible and Rigid Foams Technical Options Committee (FTOC, to be called the Cold Chain TOC (CCTOC) Building & Indoor Climate Control TOC (BICCTOC) 2. TEAP understands that the terms of appointment for the existing co -chairs of the RTOC and FTOC would expire upon establishment of the new TOC. TEAP recommends the following co -chairs for these new TOCs: For the CCTOC, that the parties consider appointing Roberto Piexoto and Fabio Polonara , co-chair s of the current and Paulo Alto\u00e9, co -chair of the current FTOC, as co -chairs for a period not to exceed four years; and For the BICCTOC, that the parties con sider appointing Omar Abdelaziz, co -chair of the current RTOC , and Helen Walter -Terrinoni, co -chair of the current FTOC, as co -chairs for a period not to exceed four years. 3. With the formation of two new TOCs from the existing RTOC and FTOC, the terms of members of the current RTOC and FTOC are proposed to expire as of 31 December 2022. Co -chairs of the new TOCs will appoint members with terms beginning in 2023, ensuring compliance with the TEAP TOR, including: 2022 TEAP Progress Report - Volume 1 87 Paragraph 2.1.2: TEAP, through its TOC co -chairs, shall compose its TOCs to reflect a balance of appropriate and anticipated expertise so that its reports are comprehensive, objective, and policy -neutral. Paragraph 2.2.2: All nominations to TOCs shall be made in full consultation with the national fo cal point of the relevant party. Nominations of members to a TOC may be made by individual parties or TEAP or TOC co -chairs may suggest to individual parties experts to consider nominating Paragraph 2.5: The TOC members are appointed by the TOC co -chairs, in consultation with TEAP, for a period of no more than four years. 8.4.3 Background to Recommendations TEAP is very mindful of the ongoing operational and organi sational constraints on its TOCs. From time to time, the Parties have re-organized TEAP to maintain an effective and efficient structure to provide the Parties with the technical and economic information they need. As part of this on -going process to meet changing needs, TEAP believes Parties may wish to consider adjustments to the current structure of TEAP and its TOCs with a restructuring of two of its key TOCs: the RTOC and the FTOC. TEAP believes this change now would support the ongoing efforts of partes to ensure the phaseout of ODS and meet the challenges to phase down HFCs , in the larger context of shifting technologies and market needs . TEAP has concluded that creation of a committee focused on the transition broadly in the refrigeration and air conditioning and foams sectors, in the context of the cold chain and overall indoor temperature control of buildings and transportation, is important to an effectively functioning body responsive to the needs of parties now and for the future. This structure allows identifying the needed expertise important to these sector tran sitions while remaining a cohesive organi sation which can continue to effectively and efficiently coordinate responses to requests from parties. TEAP believes that the proposed structure will allow for more collaboration between experts in load reduction in buildings and cold chain architecture design and in overarching system performance. There are also common considerations for ODS and HFC replac ement selection for foam blowing agents and refrigerants, such as the safe use of flammable alternatives and use of some of the same replacements. In recognition of the challenges to parties to achieve the phaseout of ODS and phasedown of HFCs, the TEAP would like Parties to consider integrating relevant issues such as energy efficiency into the formation into two new TOCs which would be formed starting from the existing RTOC and FTOC and would cover all sectors of the current RTOC and FTOC. These two new TOCs could be called the Cold Chain TOC or CCTOC and the Building & Indoor Climate Control TOC or BICCTOC . The functional areas served by each new TOC are as follows: Cold Chain TOC : Sectors to be covered include cold chains for food and other perishable s including agriculture and fisheries, and medicines, such as vaccines , with a focus on sustainability ; refrigeration including foam insulati on and other foams and refrigerants . Examples of equipment include factory -sealed appliances, food retail and food service, transport refrigeration, industrial refrigeration. Expected coordination on cross -cutting issues, e.g., safety standards, with BICCTOC. Building & Indoor Climate Control TOC : Sectors to be covered include stationary and mobile AC, heat pumps (HP), construction foam), and refrigerants. Examples of equipment includes air to air AC and HP, commercial comfort AC, MAC, heating HP, heat engines. Expected coordination on cross -cutting issues with CCTOC. 2022 TEAP Progress Report - Volume 1 88 TEAP recommends that the current RTOC and FTO C co-chairs be appointed as co -chairs to the new TOCs for a term of no longer than four years to provide continuity in this new structure. All current chairs hold significant institutional knowledge and excellent understanding of the expectations of the Mo ntreal Protocol, meeting the standards expected of TEAP reports and presentations to the Parties, and program management of the TOC for Temporary Subsidiary Body (TSB) reports, assessment reports, etc. TEAP believes this new construct would provide increas ed capabilities to the Parties in an effective and efficient manner. In recommending this restructuring of the RTOC and FTOC, TEAP wishes to recognize the significant contributions that all three RTOC co -chairs, Omar Abdelaziz, Roberto Peixoto co Paulo Alto\u00e9 and Helen Walter -Terrinoni, have made. TEAP recognizes that integrating two existing TOCs into two newly structured TOCs will be a significant commitment of effort for the co -chairs. TEAP believes that in the first year or so, these integration efforts will require significantly more time than would otherwise be the case. Regarding membership, TEAP is recommending that current members' terms of the RTOC and FTOC expire at the end of 2022, and new TOCs co -chairs would consider new appointments for the needed expertise (based on the TEAP Matrix of Needed Expertise) starting in 2023 following the requirements in the TEAP TOR for nominations and appointments to the TOCs. TEAP also considered the forward roles and scope of work for HTOC, MBTOC, and MCTOC : 1. HTOC : reflecting the broad role of HTOC in fire safety, and the increasing range of fire suppressant options to Halons, we propose to re -name as Fire Protection TOC (FPTOC) . 2. MBTOC: Reflecting the broad importance of sustainability in food production and food s afety as well as sustainable agriculture beyond methyl bromide, we propose to rename MBTOC as the Methyl Bromide, Agriculture and Sustainability TOC (MBASTOC) . This TOC would still address important MB uses - controlled (CUNs) and exempted (QPS) and their alternatives, but its scope of work would be much wider and relevant to sustainable production in agriculture (e.g. , nitrogen management). Cross cutting issues will also be addressed jointly with other TOCs as appropriate (e.g. , the impact of the cold chai n on food security). 3. Medical and Chemicals Technical Options Committee ( MCTOC ): no proposed change at this time.] TEAP will provide an updated Matrix of Needed Expertise well ahead of MOP -34. 2022 TEAP Progress Report - Volume 1 89 Annex 1: TEAP and TOC membership and administration The disclosure of interest (DOI) of each member can be found on the Ozone Secretariat website at: https://ozone.unep.org/science/assessment/teap . The disclosures are normally updated at the time of TEAP's annual meeting (normally in April/ May) . TEAP's Terms of Reference (TOR) (2.3) as approved by the Parties in Decision XXIV/8 specif y that \"... the Meeting of the Parties shall appoint the members of TEAP for a period of no more than four years...and may re -appoint Members of the Panel upon nomination by the relevant party for additional periods of up to four years each.\" . TEAP member appointments end as of 31 December of the final year of appointment, as indicated in the follo wing tables . TEAP's TOR (2.5) specifies that \"TOC members are appointed by the TOC co -chairs, in consultation with TEAP, for a period of no more than four years...[and] may be re -appointed following the procedure for nominations for additional periods of up to four years each. \" New appointments to a TOC start from the date of appointment by TOC co -chairs and end as of 31st December of the final year of appointment, up to four years. 1. Technology and Economic Assessment Panel (TEAP) 2022 TEAP is presently composed of three co-chairs, the co -chairs of the Technical Options Committees and five senior experts as indicated in Table 1 below.

TEAP Halons Technical Options Committee (HTOC) Following the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol, the role of the Halons Technical Options Committee (HTOC) has broadened to cover low /no-GWP alternatives to halons, HCFCs, and high -GWP HFCs. However, the Kigali Amendment does not necessarily bring the need for any additional areas of expertise in fire protection because the use s remain unchanged , although additional expertise for regional or sub -regional considerations will be needed . From a fire safety standpoint, the HTOC remains concerned that the flammability of refrigerants, foam blowing agents and solvents requires fire protection expertise which almo st exclusively resides in the HTOC within the TEAP . The HTOC remains available to assist in this area. Generally speaking, the HTOC maintains expertise in the following five main areas: 1) a fundamental scientific understanding of fire chemistry and the p rocess of combustion and fire extinguishment , and technical and economic expertise in fire protection needs, active and passive methods, system maintenance and personnel training. 2022 TEAP Progress Report - Volume 1 91 2) the use of halons, HCFCs, high -GWP HFCs and their alternatives in fire p rotection, including emissions and installed amounts ( bank estimates ), 3) \"banking\" i.e., collection, recycling/reclamation, and re -deployment of fire extinguishants including their application standards, purity requirements, and destruction issues, 4) issues impacting current and future use, e.g., continued reliance on halons for existing uses in military, oil and gas, merchant shipping, etc., and for existing/new installations in civil aviation, and phase -down requirements of fire protections uses of hi gh GWP HFCs. This includes modelling of remaining quantities and emissions of halons, and growth of HCFCs and high -GWP HFCs. 5) In addition , the HTOC maintains an understanding of the workings of the Montreal Protocol and how lessons learned in phasing ou t production and consumption of halons , for example, on some applications could be reapplied in phasing out the production and consumption of HCFCs and phasing down the high -GWP HFCs under the Kigali Amendment. Within the five main areas, the expertise is further divided into sectoral expertise and regional expertise. From a sectoral perspective, the HTOC has experts on fire protection requirements for on-going uses of halons , HCFCs, high -GWP HFCs and their alternatives within civil aviation, military, telecommunications, oil and gas, power generation, merchant shipping, explosion protection, etc. The HTOC also maintains expertise in banking and recycling of halons, HCFCs, high GWP HFCs and their alternatives . From a regional standpoint, the HTOC has expertise covering North America, Eastern and Western Europe, Australia , and Japan, with some limited expertise in Anglophone North Africa (Egypt), the Middle East ( Kuwait), South America (Brazil), Asia (India and World Bank expertise on halon production phase -out in China). As noted in the matrix of expertise needed, the HTOC is continuing to look for additional experts to promote A5/non -A5 and regional balance while also being mindful of gender balance.
