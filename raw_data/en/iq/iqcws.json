In addition, the book is meant to shift the paradigm of thinking from a monological to a multilogical perspective. A multilogical perspective acknowledges multiple truths and perspectives of the same event. As such, we are providing a list of supplemental resources for readers who wish to learn more about the themes presented in this book.

We conducted in-depth interviews with six Native healers about their perspectives on traumatic injury and healing. We analyzed the interviews using an inductive approach to identify common themes. We categorized these themes into four categories: causes and consequences of traumatic injury, risk factors, protective factors, and barriers to care. The implications of our study include a need for improving cultural competence among health care and social services personnel working with Native trauma patients. Additional cumulative analyses of Native healers and trauma patients would contribute to a much-needed body of knowledge on improving recovery and promoting healing among Native trauma patients.\" Dion, S.D., & Salamanca, A.
