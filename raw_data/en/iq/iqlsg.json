This information is for you! As you are aware, there are known side-effects associated with the COVID-19 vaccinations, ranging from mild symptoms that pass within a short time, to less common, severe adverse reactions. This includes rare incidents of death. Due to the 'investigational' nature of these vaccines and the brand new gene technology being used, we are currently unable to predict how natural therapies will interact with the vaccines and impact adverse reactions. Following new recommendations from our professional association, and erring on the side of caution, please take note of our following advice regarding use of natural therapies for clients taking the COVID-19 vaccine. This advice applies for both the first and second shot as well as any future 'booster' shots: 1. We advise you to stop taking all prescribed natural medicines 48 hours before COVID-19 vaccination and stay off them until 72 hours afterwards. The exception to this would be any vitamins and minerals you are currently taking to correct nutrient deficiencies and specific homeopathic support. As such, we recommend scheduling consultations where medicines will be prescribed for at least a week before vaccination if you would like homeopathic support, or else 72 hours after your vaccination. 2. We advise against having acupuncture treatments for 72 hours after vaccination. 3. If you suffer from any side-effects to a COVID-19 vaccine, you should not recommence natural therapies after 72 hours, apart from the exceptions noted in point 1 above. Instead, please consult with your GP until the situation is resolved. You should also reschedule any appointments with our clinic to be at least 3 days after you have fully recovered. Unfortunately we are unable to treat you while you are suffering an adverse reaction due to the many unknown variables of these new vaccines, the lack of information about contra-indications in respect of natural therapies, and the very rare but real risk of death. Please note that failure to follow this advice may result in unforeseen complications, for which we cannot be held responsible. There is one caveat to the above, in that if you are unlucky enough to suffer a serious vaccine injury, we will do our very best to assist you, should you find treatment via the medical route to be unsuccessful. Victorian government information about the COVID-19 vaccinations can [be found here](https://www.coronavirus.vic.gov.au/vaccine). Full, informed consent is a requirement of all medical procedures, and as such we recommend you gather information a range of science-backed sources, so you can make your own informed decisions regarding risks vs benefits. It's a good idea to look back at the morbidity data specific to your age group, now the pandemic has been ongoing for over 18 months, to assess your actual risk. General Covid-19 Information Please note it is your responsibility to inform us if you have had any COVID-19 symptoms or recent exposure.
