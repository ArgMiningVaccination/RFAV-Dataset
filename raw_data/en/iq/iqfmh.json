Journal of Pharmaceutical Innovation The world has witnessed an unprecedented series of events triggered by the pandemic of COVID-19 (coronavirus disease), a disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, a new virus belonging to the Coronavideae family, of great impact on individual and collective health worldwide, and high impact implications for the global economy. On the other hand, it is possible to identify positive aspects in facing the pandemic, ranging from humanitarian solidarity aid actions to accelerating strategies for the development of vaccines, which assumes the position of main hope in solving this problem of global scope. Immunologic Research Toxicologic Pathology The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak that started in Wuhan, China, in 2019 resulted in a pandemic not seen for a century, and there is an urgent need to develop safe and efficacious vaccines. The scientific community has made tremendous efforts to understand the disease, and unparalleled efforts are ongoing to develop vaccines and treatments. Toxicologists and pathologists are involved in these efforts to test the efficacy and safety of vaccine candidates. Presently, there are several SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in clinical trials, and the pace of vaccine development has been highly accelerated to meet the urgent need. By 2021, efficacy and safety data from clinical trials are expected, and potentially a vaccine will be available for those most at risk. This review focuses on the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development efforts with emphasis on the nonclinical safety assessment and discusses emerging preliminary data from nonclinical and clinical studies. ... Anaesthesia & Critical Care Medicine Journal 2020 The COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic is the defining global health crisis of our time and the greatest challenge we are facing. The virus has spread to all countries except Antarctica. As of 17 August 2020 2020, more than 22,113,000 people have been infected, and over 778,530 people have lost their lives. The global spread of the virus has overwhelmed health systems, and caused widespread social and economic disruption. Putting societies and economies on hold (lockdown) has helped to limit some of the short-term impacts of the virus. The faster all cases are found, tested and isolated, the harder we make it for this virus to spread. This strategy will save lives and mitigate the economic impact of the pandemic. This pandemic requires a whole-of-government and whole-of-society response. This virus may become just another endemic virus in our communities, and may never go away. Even if a vaccine was found, coping with the disease would require a massive effort. Countries are racing to slow the spread of the virus by testing and treating patients, carrying out contact tracing, limiting travel, quarantining citizens, and cancelling large gatherings. Educational institutions are closed. COVID-19 has the potential to create devastating social, economic and political crises that will leave deep scars. Every day, people are losing jobs and income, with no way of knowing when normality will return. The financial crisis is already having a severe impact on poverty and inequality. The informal sector, a large employer in many EMs, has been highly vulnerable to the lockdowns and demand drops caused by the pandemic. Millions of workers who have abruptly lost jobs and incomes need urgent attention. Currently, there is no vaccine available and there are few specific antiviral strategies. Several potent candidates of antivirals and repurposed drugs are under urgent investigation. There is an urgent need to increase pooled sample testing and also start undertaking anti-body testing. Life and livelihood are crucial. The lockdown must be rolled back in a phased and staggered manner while ensuring that high risk groups are encouraged to stay home. Strict social distancing norms, use of face masks and hyperlocalization to contain hotspots and areas of high risk should be the way forward. International Journal of Scientific Research in Science and Technology 2021 [International Journal of Scientific Research in Science and Technology IJSRST](https://technoscienceacademy.academia.edu/IJSRST), [Pallavi Pogaku, G Renuka, S Ram Reddy](https://independent.academia.edu/PallaviPogakuGRenukaSRamReddy) The pandemic COVID -19 caused by novel coronavirus, SARSCoV-2, has infected more than 125 million individuals and resulted in over 2,756,768 deaths globally spread over 219 countries and territories. There has been an intensive search for an effective drug against the virus and the resultant disease. However, till now no single effective drug could be found against SARS-CoV-2. Hence, all research efforts to contain the epidemic are being focussed on effective vaccine development. Here, we review the current scenario of vaccines being developed all over the world and also India to restrict the COVID-19. Advances in genetic sequencing and other technological developments have speeded up the establishment of a variety of vaccine platforms. Most of the platforms mainly based upon the viral spike protein due to its vital role in viral infectivity. Accordingly, numerous vaccines are under various stages of development. Some vaccines like Astra-Geneca, Moderna, Covaxine, and Pfizer are already released for vaccination to general public. Principles, advantages and disadvantages of different vaccine platforms are discussed. Notwithstanding the tall claims made by manufacturers, concerns are expressed especially over the rush, at which the vaccines are developed, and their efficacy and safety. In India, two vaccines viz, covaxin and covishield are released even before finishing the mandatory phase III trials on conditional trial basis. Salient features and differences between these two vaccines are discussed. Golden Meteorite imperative vaccine created in such a short time frame, is the Covid-19 vaccine safe? What in the World are COVID Vaccines? addresses the history of vaccines and the research that has gone into mRNA technology. Nature Reviews Immunology Golden Meteorite Press As COVID-19 pandemic ravages the globe, eyes turn to vaccines as the most effective way to end the public health emergency. With the strict timeline set by the ever-deteriorating state of global health, COVID-19 vaccine development has seen some of the fastest, most innovative advances in the history of immunology. As our most powerful tool in returning us to the normal routines of life, understanding how vaccines are developed and distributed is critical. While hundreds of millions suffer at the hand of COVID-19, we all wonder: when will a vaccine become available? Let's take a deep dive into the path to COVID-19 immunization \u2014 from knowledge to needle. COVID-19 PANDEMIC. UGANDA IN BRACKETS 2021 The COVID-19 pandemic book is a compilation of detailed information on the disease from its outbreak to its vaccination. The book explains the disease in global context and the Uganda context in particular. The writer of the book collected information from different sources and he expects that it will be used for teaching this generation and the generations to come, understand the COVID-19 pandemic in its scientific and historical descriptions. The writer, to make the book easily readable, broke it down into ten chapters. Chapter one deals with epidemiology of the COVID-19 pandemic. Under this chapter, the writer laid down explanations on the study and analysis of the disease conditions, its determinants, its patterns and its distribution. More clarifications were focused on the name of the disease, its history, its transmission and its pathophysiology. Chapter two highlights is the diagnosis of the COVID-19 pandemic. The focal points under this chapter are the testing of COVID-19, its complications, the pathological findings, its immunity resistance and the management of COVID-19. Chapter three of this COVID-19 pandemic book, concentrates on prevention and treatment of the disease. Prevention described in this chapter involves the use of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). These are hand washing with detergent soap, use of sanitizers, putting on face mask, social distancing, surface cleaning, use of ventilation and eating healthy diet. Chapter four describes key statistics of the COVID-19 pandemic from its outbreak to its vaccination (Late 2019 to March 2021). The author reviewed statistics on global cases, recovery, deaths, vaccinations and their mitigations. In chapter five, the writer explains the COVID-19 pandemic related researches. He detailed the medical treatment research emerged to counter the COVID-10 disease. Also the chapter explained the researches involved in the fight against COVID-19 pandemic. The next chapter (6), was raised to not miss information about responses to COVID-19 pandemic by governments and United Nations. From chapter seven to chapter ten, the author discussed the common global impacts of COVID-19. These are impacts on global economy, impacts on education, impacts on health sector, impacts on arts, entertainment and sports and impacts on social movements in communities. Chapter eleven came up with details on the COVID-19 misinformation. It explains the misinformation about the origin of the disease, misinformation about cases and deaths reports, treatment misinformation and effort to combat misinformation about COVID-19 pandemic. Chapter twelve of the book collected information on protests over responses to COVID-19 pandemic in Africa, Asia, Europe and America.
