Various knowledge systems have developed and evolved in the country which has enriched and benefitted the world in numerous ways. yurveda, the ancient science of life is also one such contribution, the roots of which can be traced back to the Vedic literature. It is a highly codified system which has been documented in detail by various learned preceptors starting from the era of Caraka and Suruta upto the modern era. Being a medical science, it has always been a living tradition learnt in the Gurukula where the student learned under the direct supervision of the teacher. With advancement of time, like many other knowledge systems, the knowledge flow of yurveda has weakened due to changes in educational system, loss of information in the form of destruction of literature etc. which has led to increasing gap between theory and practice. Still, much of the knowledge was preserved in the form of various palm leaf, paper and other manuscripts available throughout the country which are preserved in various Manuscript libraries and museums. In the present era, yurveda is undergoing a new renaissance and there is growing global attention and acceptance. However, there is a real need to protect, preserve, promote and propagate this medical heritage for a better future of the world. Medico-historical research and Literary research are important components of research in medical systems like yurveda which are rooted in history because of the need to preserve the knowledge and to re represent the knowledge in terms of the needs of the present day. Medico-historical research helps to understand how these systems worked in the past and Literary research is needed to disseminate the knowledge in the form of publications and also to develop up to date information through analytical studies of the literature. Apart from these, preservation of the information by digitization of information and saving this knowledge for the future is also an important domain of Literary Research. The means of attaining knowledge are called as Prama. Among the various prama, ptopadea or abda prama (teachings of learned preceptors) are given prime importance in yurveda. The ancient literature available are also known by various names such as gama, tantra etc. The teachings which are codified and locked in the classical literature are expounded to the learner by a learned preceptor by the use of various Tantrayukti (criteria for critical evaluation of technical texts), which act as the key to the knowledge. The revival, retrieval and preservation of national medical heritage has great contemporary relevance owing to the fact that much of the valuable information of Ayurveda is preserved in the form of various manuscripts preserved in various manuscript libraries. Since the life of manuscipts are limited, there is need to preserve and digitize them and further take them up for publication in the form of critical editions, transcription, translation and publication to make them available in public domain. The Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences (CCRAS) is an autonomous body under the Ministry of A YUSH (Ayurveda, Y oga & Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homeopathy), Government of India. It is an apex body in India for the formulation, coordination, development and promotion of research on scientific lines in Ayurveda and Sowa-Rigpa system of medicine. Literary xii VOLUME-VIIResearch and Medico-historical Studies are one among the priority areas of research of CCRAS since from its inception. The Literary research program and Documentation is effectively carried through several means viz. revival and retrieval of manuscripts and rare books; medico-historical investigations in A YUSH Systems of Medicine; by undertaking Research projects; maintaining the medico-historical library and medico-historical museum; publication of books, monographs and scientific journals and development of Information technology based applications etc., Core components of Medico-historical Research and Documentation 1. Revival and Retrieval of Manuscripts and rare books 2. Medico-historical studies 3. Research Projects 4. Medico-historical Library 5. Medico-historical Museum 6. Publications under Literary Research & Documentation 7. Information Technology based applications Revival and Retrieval of manuscripts and rare books Under revival and retrieval system of manuscripts and rare books, the Council adopts chiefly two mechanisms: 1. Survey, Acquisition, Edit and Publication of books based on manuscripts and rare books. 2. Survey, Acquisition, Digitizing and Cataloguing of manuscripts and rare books. CCRAS has surveyed/ acquired several valuable manuscripts from manuscript repositories, academic institutions, private collections etc. Among the collection of manuscripts, some of the important and unpublished manuscripts are further taken up for editing, transcription, transliteration, translation of the principal text (mlapha) and there by bringing out the critical editions. As on date, the Council has published 39 books/ works based original manuscripts/ rare books. Out of 39, 16 books are based on manuscripts and 23 on rare books/ books. Among the 39 published works, eleven pertaining to the books listed under First schedule of Drugs & Cosmetics Act 1940. Council has taken major initiative to create a 'Centralized Digital Repository of Medical Manuscripts of A YUSH Systems of Medicine' with an objective to conserve and preserve rich cultural and medical heritage of India for posterity as well as to provide easy access. As on date, CCRAS has surveyed and digitized more than 5000 yurveda, Y oga, Unni, Siddha, Sowa Rigpa etc., & Kashmir (Leh) etc. Out of 5000 collections, more than 4000 manuscripts are digitized and catalogued. The metadata of 2086 yurveda, 598 Siddha, 542 Unni, 628 Sowa-Rigpa, 49 Y oga and 179 other manuscript' s under 44 fields and metadata of 1336 rare books under 18 fields is published in nine descriptive catalogues.Glimpses of CCRAS Contributions - (50 Glorious Y ears) xiiiFurthermore, CCRAS made continuous efforts to collect, edit and publish yurveda books (S. No. 1 to 54d) mentioned under Schedule I of Drugs and Cosmetics Act 1940. By extensive surveys, the Council collected manuscripts and printed books/works of different editors/ publishers/ editions and in different languages pertaining to 49 books out of 55 [excluding Ayurvedic Formulary of India 54a and Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia of India, Part I and II (54c & 54d)]. Out of 49 books, there are about 200 palm-leaves/ paper manuscripts pertaining to 23 books are retrieved in CCRAS in digitized form (and some manuscripts in physical form) and more than 600 published books pertaining to 49 books are available in printed form. Medico-historical studies As on date, Council has published 396 medico-historical studies pertaining to A YUSH Systems of medicine, Modern medicine and works of European writers. These studies include yurveda (233 in no.); Unni (76 no.); Homoeopathy (8 in no.); Y oga & Naturopathy (3 in no.); Modern Medicine (13 in no.); works of European medical writers on drugs and diseases (3 in no.) and bibliography indexes (31 in no.). These studies are focused on the topics like search and collection of information in medical manuscripts/rare books; biographical account of authors/ commentators/ compilers of classical works of A YUSH Systems of Medicine and pioneers in A YUSH; translations of select passages of classical works; medico-historical investigations on drugs and diseases; documentation of health related information from non-classical literature and archaeological and epigraphical sources; lists of medical works, general articles etc., These studies have explored rich literary heritage of A YUSH systems of medicine and provided valuable insight into the medico-historical aspects of A YUSH. Research Projects CCRAS has undertaken several research projects and successfully executed in time bound man- ner. As on date, under Literary Research and Documentation program, Council has taken up 37 research projects which includes Extramural Research projects supported by Ministry of A YUSH (03 in no.); project(s) supported by WHO-India Office Intramural Research Projects supported under CCRAS- IMR Scheme/ Research Policy (31 in no.) and Collaborative projects (02 in no.). Out of 37 projects, 22 projects are completed and 15 are ongoing. Out of 22 completed projects, 9 are published and remaining is under process of finalization for publication/ under vetting/ under modifications as per expert' s comments/ under editing. Medico-historical Library A dedicated medico-historical library established at CCRAS-National Institute of Indian Medical Heritage (NIIMH), Hyderabad contains significant collection of manuscripts, rare books and journals on A YUSH systems of Medicine and Biomedicine. Due to the rich and valuable collection of works/ books and journals/ periodicals, CCRAS-NIIMH, Hyderabad often serves as great resource and referral Institute for scholars engaged in the Medico-historical & Literary research in A YUSH Systems of medicine and Biomedicine.xiv VOLUME-VIIMedico-historical Museum A medico-historical museum located at CCRAS-National Institute of Indian Medical Heritage (NIIMH), Hyderabad has several exhibits viz., objects, paintings, documents, manuscripts, replica of stone inscription(s) and art works related to the medical history of the A YUSH and Biomedicine.

These systems were developed by ancient scholars on the basis of their own philosophy, oriental methodologies and practices prevalent in that era and have popularized as a system of medicine. The advent of foreign invasions and cross cultural interactions had definite impact on these systems. The beginning of twentieth century saw efforts to revive these systems. The members of the Imperial Legislative Council got the resolution of investigations and recognition of these systems was accepted in the year 1916. The Indian National Congress also passed similar resolution in 1920. This led to establishment to number of colleges of Ayurveda. In the post-independence era, the efforts to develop research gained momentum. As per recommendation of the various committees, grant-in-aid projects were sanctioned to selected colleges. The Central Council for Ayurvedic Research as an Advisory body was established in 1962 and finally the Central Council for Research in Indian Medicine & Homoeopathy (CCRIM&H) was established in 1969. This Council initiated research programs in the Indian Systems of Medicine & Homoeopathy in different parts of the country and started coordination at the National level for the first time. The Central Council for Research in Ayurveda & Siddha (CCRAS), an apex body for the formulation, coordination and development of research in Ayurveda & Siddha on scientific lines was established in March 1978 after reorganization of CCRIM&H. The Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences is a Registered Society under Societies Registration Act XXI of 1860 on 29.07.2011 (formerly registered as Central Council for Research in Ayurveda and Siddha on 30 thMarch, 1978). The Minister of A YUSH is the President of the Governing Body of the Council while the Joint Secretary chairs the Standing Finance Committee. The Scientific/ Research programs are supervised by the respective Scientific Advisory Board/Groups chaired by eminent scholars of the system. Research Areas The Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences (CCRAS), an autonomous body under Ministry of A YUSH, Govt. of India is an apex body in India for undertaking, coordinating, formulating, developing and promoting research on scientific lines in Ayurvedic sciences. The activities are carried out through its 31 Institutes/ Centres/ Units located all over India and also through collaborative studies with various Universities, Hospitals and Institutes. The research activities of the Council include Medicinal Plant Research (Medico-ethno Botanical Survey, Pharmacognosy and Tissue culture), Drug Standardization, Pharmacological Research, Clinical Research and Literary Research & Documentation. Besides this, Council has conducting outreach activities viz., Tribal Health Care Research Program (THCRP) under Tribal Sub-Plan, Ayurveda Mobile Health Care Program under Scheduled Castes Sub Plan (SCSP), Ayurvedic Health Centres under North East Plan, Swasthya Rakshana Program (SRP) 2 VOLUME-VII and National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke (NPCDCS).

Ayurveda, the oldest medical tradition, passed down through generations over centuries as oral tradition, and the rich heritage and intellectual healing practices have been preserved in the form of manuscripts. These manuscripts are scattered in different parts of India and in libraries/ museums around the world which is evident from the different catalogues published from time to time. However, cataloguing of manuscripts is not sufficient to understand the knowledge that is contained in them. Keeping in view of the same, the Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences (previously known as Central Council for Research in Ayurveda and Siddha), New Delhi seriously pursuing the tasks related to revival and retrieval manuscripts and rare books of Ayurveda, Y oga & Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, Homoeopathy and Sowa-Rigpa etc. since from its inception. CCRAS adopts a systematic mechanism for the revival and retrieval of manuscripts and rare books by following means: Survey of manuscripts, analyzing the knowledge, editing and publishing manuscripts. Systematic survey and study of works in manuscript and printed form to bring out translated and critical editions for wider accessibility. Conservation and preservation of manuscripts and books to preserve the rich intellectual heritage of A YUSH Systems of Medicine. Digitization of manuscripts for easy access, to maintain a centralized digital repository and to save the manuscripts and rare books to posterity. The Documentation and Publication Division started at CCRAS (CCRIM&H), New Delhi in the year 1969-70 assisted in different literary research projects by providing source manuscripts/ rare books and other related works. For successful implementation of the task of revival and retrieval of manuscripts/ books, Literary Research Program was initiated in Council from 1970-71 onwards. The Council had established Literary Research Units at Thanjavur, Varanasi, Jamnagar, Lucknow, Aligarh respectively. These units were successfully engaged in survey and acquisition of ancient medical manuscripts and published them from time to time. Among the thirty peripheral Institutes functioning under CCRAS, National Institute of Indian Medical Heritage (NIIMH) located at Hyderabad designated as Nodal Institute for Medico-historical and Literary Research. This Institute is actively engaged in the tasks of revival and retrieval of manuscripts and rare books since from its establishment. NIIMH, Hyderabad maintains repository of manuscripts of Ayurveda, Siddha and Unani manuscripts. The collection includes palm-leaf and paper manuscripts in Glimpses of CCRAS Contributions - (50 Glorious Y ears) 5 different languages: Sanskrit, Telugu, Tamil, Malayalam, Urdu, Arabic, Persian etc. The manuscripts are housed in the Institute are periodically subjected to curative and preventive conservation to reduce and prevent the deterioration. These manuscripts are retrieved in digital form too.The Institute has taken up of editing, translation and publication of several books/ works based on original manuscripts and rare books which are published from time to time. Apart from manuscripts, the Institute' s library contains rare and valuable collection of books on History of Medicine of different Systems and medical journals. NIIMH, Hyderabad is a great resource Institute for scholars engaged in the Medico-historical & Literary research in A YUSH Systems of medicine as well as Biomedicine. Background and Origin of National Institute of Indian Medical Heritage, Hyderabad1,2,3 NIIMH, Hyderabad has its origin by the recommendation made by Prof. Henry E. Sigerist, the then Director of History of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University, USA. Prof. Henry E. Sigerist made a recommendation to establish 'Department of History of Medicine in India' to the Health Survey and Development Committee (Bhore Committee), constituted by Imperial Government of India in 1943, which was headed by Sir Joseph Bhore. Based on the committee' s recommendation, a special committee headed by Dr. A.L. Mudaliar, the then Vice Chancellor of Madras University was established to identify suitable premises to establish the new institute. Dr. Mudaliar and Major General S.L. Bhatia, the Surgeon General of the composite State of Madras recommended that a Department of History of Medicine be opened in the Andhra Medical College, Visakhapatnam. Thus the 'Department of History of Medicine' was established on 26-09-1956 at Andhra Medical College, Visakhapatnam. Afterwards it was transferred to Hyderabad in the month of December 1956 under the honorary Directorship of Dr. D.V . Subba Reddy. In 1962, the department shifted to the newly constructed building of the Osmania Medical College, Hyderabad. In view of the national importance of the 'Department of History of Medicine', it was handed over to Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) on 14-02-1969 and was renamed as 'Institute of History of Medicine'. In 1973, the Institute transferred to Central Council for Research in Indian Medicine and Homoeopathy (CCRIM&H) and renamed as 'Indian Institute of History of Medicine' in the 9 th Executive Committee of CCRIM&H held on 04-08-1973. Thereafter, the CCRIM&H bifurcated into four separate Councils and the Institute came under the administrative control of CCRAS from 01-01-1979. Considering the Institute' s achievements and capabilities, the Govt. of India has upgraded the Institute as 'National Institute of Indian Medical Heritage' (NIIMH) on 15-12- 2009. Later, NIIMH has shifted to its own building at Gaddiannaram, Hyderabad on 21-02-2013. 1 Report of the Health Survey and Development Committee, V ol.

Summary :Dravyaguna deals with the vast materia medica employed for food and medicine in Ayurveda. There is vast amount of literature chronicling the history of usage of drugs based on literary works spread over from Vedic period (1500 BC) till date. It is unfortunate to observe that, the literary legends pertaining to the history of Ayurveda with respect to use of medical substances (herbal, animal and mineral origin), hardly have any supporting archaeological evidences in the current historical literature about Ayurveda Itihsa. Considering the nature of evidences material available through Paleo-botany & other Archaeological data will surely enable reconstruction of History of Ayurveda based on concrete foundations of tangible evidences and to ascertain their relevance within the framework of evolution of Ayurveda from Pre-Vedic, Vedic, and later periods.
