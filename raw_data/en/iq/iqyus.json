When our immune system is running below its optimal level we are more susceptible to infections such as colds, flu and tummy bugs - as well as more serious conditions. So for good health we need to be pro-active in looking after our immune system in order to be 'fighting fit'. Indigo Herbs has a range of cost-effective botanicals to help us achieve this. Scientific studies have shown that certain herbs and foods can support and enhance immune function, some by providing the nutrition needed to build the immune system and some by actually increasing the number of white blood cells which destroy bacteria, viruses and other pathogens (micro-organisms that can cause disease). As always, prevention is better than cure, and this is where healthy lifestyle choices come in. A balanced wholefood diet, supplemented with nutrient-dense superfoods such as seeds, berries, algae, grasses and seaweeds, will provide a solid foundation for feeding and maintaining the immune system. Add our high-quality, cost-effective herbs and essential oils to the equation, and you have a veritable army of helpful allies. One of the most interesting recent branches in medical science is psycho-neuro-immunology, which basically means that what we think and feel can affect our immunity. So by taking charge of your health you are already creating positivity in your body! Browse the list of natural health ingredients below and see what catches your eye.", "sitename": "Indigo Herbs", "date": "2023-01-01", "cleaned_text": "Boost your immune system with botanicals known to support our body's ability to fight infection.
