We are very spiritual people, we believed that we all went through our etsxem training when we were pubescent. This has changed mainly due to the Residential School system and Christianity. Our spiritual ways are separate from our politics. Keepers of the Flame/Traditional Knowledge Keepers ('Knowledge Keepers') The Knowledge Keepers are those that hold our sacred Secw\u00e9pemc knowledge, ceremonies and practise them with extreme humility and humbleness. The Secw\u00e9pemc knowledge and ceremonies have passed down through generations. Despite the outlaw of our way of life, we have been able to continue on by gaining knowledge of ceremonies, and earning the right to the 1 ceremonies by our etsxem training. Further knowledge keepers are recognized as: spiritual persons, pipe carriers, medicine keepers, sun dancers, fasters, eagle whistle carriers, coyote whistle carriers, sweat lodge keepers, Smudging There will be smudging by the knowledge keepers during the ceremony.
