Validation Guidance for Industry1 This guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page. I. INTRODUCTION This guida nce helps sponsors of investigational new drug applications (INDs) or applicants of new drug applications (NDAs), abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs), biologic license applications (BLAs), and supplements validate bioanalytical methods used in human clinical pharmacology, bioavailability (BA), and bioequivalence (BE) studies that require pharmacokine tic, toxicokinetic, or biomarker concentration evaluation. 2 This guidance can also inform the development of bioanalytical methods used for nonclinical s tudies that require toxicokinetic or biomarker concentration data. For studies related to the veterinary drug approval process such as investigational new animal drug applications (INADs), new animal drug applications (NADAs), and abbreviated new animal drug applications (ANADAs), this guidance may apply t o blood and urine BA, BE, and pharmacokinetic studies. The information in this guidance applies to bioanalytical procedures such as chromatographic assays (CCs ) and ligand binding assays (LBAs) that determ ine the levels of drugs , their metabolites, therapeutic proteins , and biomarkers in biologica l matrices such as blood, serum, plasma, urine, and tissue such as skin. This final guidance incorporates public comments to the revised draf t published in 2013 and provides recommendations for the development, validation, and in-study use of bioanalytical methods. The recommendations can be modified with justification , depending on the specific type of bioanalytical method. This guidance reflect s advances in science and technology related to validating bioanalytical methods. In general, FDA 's guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead , guidances describe the Agency' s current thinking on a topic and s hould be viewed only 1 This guidance has been prepared by the Office of Clinical Pharmacology in the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and the Center for Veterinary Medicine at the Food and Drug Admini stration. 2 This guidance applies to both sponsors and applicants. The use of the word sponsor applies to both sponsors and applicants and hence, INDs, NDAs, 05/24/18 2 as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required. II. BACKGROUND The 2001 guidanc e for industry on Bioanalytical Method Validation was originally based on the deliberations of two workshops described in publications entitled: Analytical Methods Validation: Bioavailability, Bioequivalence, and Pharmacokinetic Studies3 Bioanalytica l Methods Validation: A Revisit W ith a Decade of Progress4 Additional workshops , summarized in the following publications, have informed subsequent revisions (e.g., the 2013 draft guidance for industry entitled Bioanalytical Method Validation5): Quantitative Bioanalytical Methods Validation and Implementation: for Chromatographic and Ligand Binding Assays6 The AAPS/FDA Workshop on Incurred Sample Reanalysis7 The AAPS Workshop on Crystal City V \u2014 Quantitative Bioanalytical Method Va lidation and Implementation: 2013 Revised FDA Guidance8 3 Shah, V KK Midha, S Dighe, Cook, Analytical Methods Validation: Bioavailability, Bioequivalence, and Pharmacokinetic Studies, Pharm Res, 9:588 -592. 4 Shah, V P, JD Yacobi, 2000, Bioanalytical Methods Validation: A With a Decade of Progress, Pharm Res, 17:1551- 1557. 5 When final, this guidance will represent the FDA's current thinking on th is topic.

These validated methods provide critical data to support the safety and effectiveness of drugs and biologic products. Valid ating the analytical method ensures that the data are reliable by addressing certain key questions , including : Does the method measure the intended analyte? For example, does anything interfere with the measurement , and is the method specific or selectiv e for the analyte? What is the variability associated with these measurements? For example, what are the accuracy and precision of the method? What is the range in measurements that provide reliable data ? For example, what is the sensitivity of t he met hod (e.g., what is the l ower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) of the method, and w hat is the upper limit of quantitation the method (ULOQ) ?) How do sample collection, handling, and storage affect the reliability of the data from the bioanalytical method? For example, what steps need to be followed while collecting samples? Do the samples need to be frozen during shipping? What temperatures are required to store the samples , and how long can the samples be stored? When changes are made to a validated metho d, the sponsor should conduct additional validation (i.e., partial or cross validation ). The fit-for-purpose (FFP) concept states that the level of validation should be appropriate for the intended purpose of the study. The key questions listed above should be evaluated relative to the stage of drug development. Pivotal studies submitted in an NDA, BLA , or ANDA that require regulatory decision making for approval , safety or labeling , such as BE or pharmacokinetic studies, should include bioanalytical met hods that are fully validated. Exploratory methods that would not be used to support regulatory decision makin g (e.g., candidate selection) may not require such stringent validation . This FFP concept applies to drugs, their metabolites , and biomarkers. The analytical laboratory conducting toxicology studies for regulatory submissi ons should adhere to 21 CFR 58, Good Laboratory Practices (GLPs) . 9 The bioanalytical method for human BA, BE, and pharmacokinetic studies must meet the criteria specified in 21 CFR 320 Bioequivalence and Bioavailability Requirements ( i.e., 21 CFR 320.29). Crystal City V \u2014 Quantitative Bioanalytical Method Validation and Implementation: The 2013 Revised FDA Guidance, AAPS J, 17 :277- 288. 9 For the Center for Veterinary Medicine , all BE studies are subject to Good Laboratory Practices. Cont ains Nonbinding Recommendations Bioanalytical Method Validation 05/24/18 4 The following sections discuss the development, validation, and in-study use of bioanalytica l methods and how best to document validation methods and results . Refer to the G lossary for the definitions of assay parameters and analytical terms used in this guidanc e. III. BIOANALYTICAL METHOD DEVELOPMENT A ND VALIDATION A. Guiding Principles The purpose of bioanalytical method development is to define the design, operati ng conditions, limitations, and suitability of the method for its intended purpose and to ensure that the method is optimized for validation. Before the development of a bioanalytical method, the sponsor should understand the analyte of interest (e.g., determine the physicochemical properties of the drug, in vitro and in vivo metabolism, and protein binding) and consider aspects of any prior analytical methods that may be applicable . The elements and acceptance criteria of method development and vali dation are summarized in Table 1 . Table 2 describes how the sponsor should document the development and validation of the bioanalytical assay and where it should be stored or submitted. Method development involves optimiz ing the procedures and conditions involved with extract ing and detecting the analyte . Method development include s the optimization of the following bioanalytical parameters (which are discussed in greater detail in section III.B) to ensure that the method is suitable for validation: Reference standards Critical reagents Calibration curve Quality control samples (QCs) Selectivity and specificity Sensitivity Accuracy Precision Recovery Stability of the analyt e in the matrix Bioanalytical m ethod development does not require extensive r ecord keeping or notation. However, the sponsor should record the changes to procedures as well as any issues and their resolutions during development of the bioanalytical method to provide a rationale for any changes during the development of the method. Bioanalytical method validation prove s that the optimized method is suited to the analysis of the study samples . The sponsor should: Cont ains Nonbinding a full validation of any new bioanalytical method for the analysis of a new drug entity , its metabolite(s) , or biomarkers . Conduct a full validation for any revisions to an existing validated method that adds a metabolite or an additional analyte. Establish a detailed, written description (e.g., protocol, study plan, and/or standard operating procedure (S OP)) for the bioanalytical method before initiating validation. The description should identify procedures that control c ritical parameters in the method (e.g., environmental, matrix, procedural variables) from the time of collection of the samples to the ti me of analysis to minimize their effects on the measurement of the analyte in the matri x. Document and report (in the method validation report) a ll experiments used to make claims or draw conclusions about the validity of the method. Validate the measure ment of each analyte in the biological matrix. The specific recommendations and acceptance criteria for each bioanalytical parameter are listed in Table 1 . B. Bioanalytical Parameters of CCs and LBAs The bioanalytical parameters applicable to CCs and LB As are discussed below. Issues unique to either CCs or LBA s are specifically identified. 1. Reference Standards and Critical Reagents The sponsor should appropriately characterize and document (e.g. determine the identity, purity, and stability) all reference standards and critical reagents, such as antibodies, labeled analytes, and matrices and store them under defined conditions. a. Reference standards The purity of reference standards used to prepare calibrat ors and QCs can affect the study data. Therefore, the sponsor should use authenticated analytical reference standards with known identit ies and purit ies to prepare solutions of known concentrations. The reference standard should be identical to the analyte ; however, w hen this scenario is not possible, the sponsor can use an established ch emical form (e.g., free base, free acid, or salt) of known purit y. The sponsor should provide the certificates of analyses (CoA), including the source, lot number, and expiration date (with the exception of United States Pharmacopeia ( USP) standards) for commercially available reference standards. For internally or externally generated reference standards that do not have a CoA, the sponsor should provide evidence of the standard's identity and purity in addition to the source and the lot number. When using expired reference standards, the sponsor should provide an updated CoA or re -establish the identity and purity of the standard. If the reference standard expires, the sponsor should not make stock soluti ons with this Cont ains Nonbinding Recommendations Bioanalytical Method Validation 05/24/18 6 lot standard unless the standard's purity is re -established . For internal standards (ISs), the sponsor does not have to provide a CoA or evidence of purity if it demonstrates that the IS is suitab le for the specific use (e.g., lack of interference with an analyte). b. Critical reagents The sponsor should appropriately characterize and document (i.e., determine the identity, purity and stability ) the critical reagents , including - but not limited to - any reference standards, antibodies, labeled analytes, and matrices. Assay validation is important when there are changes to the critical reagents, such as lot -to-lot changes or switches to another reagent. For example, if there are changes to the labeled analytes, detector reagents, or antibodies, the sponsor should: Evaluate binding and re -optimize assays Verify performance with a standard curve and QCs Evaluate cross -reactivities 2. Calibration Curve During method development , the sponsor should choose the quantitation range of the assay and the concentrations of the calibration standards on the basis of the concentration range expected in a particular study. For LBAs, i n addition to the calibration standards, anchor points outside the range of quantification can facilitate the fit ting of the curve. Anchor points should not be used as part of the acceptance criteria for the run . For most LBAs, calibration (standard) curves are inherently nonlinear , and in general, more calibration standards are needed to define the fit over the calibration curve range for LBAs than for CCs. In addition, the response -error relationship for LBA standard curves is a variable function of the mean response ( i.e., heteroscadisticity ). The sponsor should use the simplest model that adequately describes the concentration-response relationshi p, as well as an appropriate weighting scheme and regression equation. For LBA s, the concentration-response relationship is most often fitted to a four- or five-parameter logistic model, although other models can be assessed. When the method is validated, the calibration curve should be continuous and reproducible. The sponsor should prepare t he calibration standards in the same biological matrix as the samples in the intended study. Study samples may contain more than one analyte. The sponsor should generate a calibration curve for each analyte in the sample. When surrogate matrices are necessary, the sponsor should justify and validate the calibration curve s. The requirements for the calibration curve, includi ng the LLOQ , ULOQ, as well as the acceptance criteria are liste d in Table 1 . Cont ains Nonbinding Recommendations Bioanalytical Method Validation 05/24/18 7 3. Quality Control Samples Quality control s are used to assess the precision and accuracy of an assay and the stability of the sample s. Sponsors should prepare QCs in the same matrix as the study samples to be assayed with the validated method. Freshly prepared QCs are recommended for precision and accuracy analys es during method development , as stability data are generally not available at this time . During method validation , QCs evaluate the performance of a method and the stability of an analyte . Performance QCs are included in validation runs to determine the precision and accuracy of the method (see section III.B). Stability QCs evaluate the stability of an analyte under various stress conditions (Refer to section III.B for the selection of QC concentrations). The sponsor should prepare any c alibration standards and QCs from separate stock solutions. However, if the sponsor can demonstrate the precision and accuracy in one validation run using calibrators and QCs prepared from separate stock solutions, then the sponsor can use calibrators and QCs prepared from the same stock solution in subsequent runs . The sponsor should make up calibrators and QCs in lots of blank ma trix that is free of interference or matrix effects. 4. Selectivity and Specificity During method development, the sponsor should verify that the substance being measured is the intended analyte to minimize or avoid interference. Selectivity of the met hod is routinely demonstrated by analyzing blank sample s of the appropriate biological matrix (e.g. , plasma) from multiple sources. Depending on the intended use of the assay, the impact of hemolyzed samples, lipemic samples , or samples from special popul ations can be included in the selectivity assessment. When using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS ) methods, the sponsor or applicant should determine the effects of the matrix on ion suppression, ion enhancement , or extraction efficiency. Internal standards should be assessed to avoid interference with the analyte. Potential interfering substances in a biological matrix include endogenous matrix components such as metabolites , decomposition products - and from the actual study - concomitant medication s and other xenobiotics . If a stabilizer or enzyme inhibitor is used during sample collection, the sponsor should evaluate the potential for interference on the quantitation of the analyte. Sponsors should make a scientific judgment about the need to assess these (and any other) potential interferences during method development. During validation, the sponsor should confirm that the assay is free of potential interfering substances including endogenous matrix components, metabolites, anticipated concomitant medication s, etc . If the study sample contains more than one analyte and the analytes are intended to be quantified by different methods , the sponsor should test each method for interference from the other analyte . The sponsor should ana lyze blank samples of the appropriate biological matrix (e.g. plasma) from at least six ( for CCs) or ten ( for LBA s) individual sources. The sponsor should ensure that there are no matrix effects throughout the application of the method. Refer to Table 1 for details of selectivity and specificity requirements and acceptance criteria. Cont ains Nonbinding Recommendations Bioanalytical Method Validation 05/24/18 8 For LBAs, it is important to investigate any interference originating from structurally or physiologica lly similar analytes ( i.e., exogenous interference) ( i.e., endogenous interference). Investigati ng exogenous interference involves determining the cross -reactivity of molecules that could potentially interfere with the binding interaction, including molecules structurally related to the drug, any metabolite s, concomitant medications (and their significant metabolites), or endogenous matrix components . The sponsor should evaluate e ach factor individually and in combination with the analyte of interest to determine its ability to cause interference. Matrix e ffects evaluation involve s compari ng calibration curves in multiple sources of the biological matrix against a calibration curve in the matrix for parallelism (serial dilution of incurred samples) and nonspecific binding. The sponsor should eliminate or m inimize any significant interference. If such attempts are unsuccessful , the sponsor could consider the development of an orthogonal method to eliminate or minimize the interference. Carryover between samples can occur in analytical methods. The spons or should eliminate any carryover during method development. If carryover cannot be eliminated, the sponsor should assess the impact o f any carryover during method validation on the accuracy of the study sample concentrations. 5. Sensitivity The LLOQ defines the method sensitivity and should be determined during method development. The method should be developed and validated such that it will be able to meet the requirements necessary for the intended study samples. The LLOQ evaluation can be done separately or as part of the precision and accuracy assessment for the calibration range. The specific recommendations to validate sensitivity are listed in Table 1. 6. Accuracy, Precision, and Recovery Evaluating the accuracy and precision across the quantitation range during method development is essential to determine whether the method is ready for validation and involves analyzing replicate QCs at multiple concentrations across the assay range. Specifically, the sponsor should evaluate the performa nce at the LLOQ , low, mid and high QCs ( and the ULOQ for LBAs ) to determine if the method is suitable to analyze study sample s. Method validation experiments for estimating accuracy and precision should include a minimum of three ( for CCs) and six (for L BAs) independent runs (i.e., accuracy and precision (A & P) runs; see Table 1 ) conducted over several days. Each A & P run should include a calibration curve and multiple QC concentrations that are analyzed in replicates. The sponsor should determine the accuracy and precision of the method based on the performance of the QC in the A & P runs . The specific validation requirements for accuracy and precision and A & P runs are listed in Table 1 . The sponsor should use freshly prepared calibrators and QCs in all A & P runs. Use of freshly prepared QCs in all A & P runs is preferre d; however, if this is not possible, the sponsor should use freshly prepared QCs in one or more A & P runs . The sponsor should optimize the r ecovery of the analyte to ensure tha t the extraction is efficien t and reproducible . Recovery need not be 100 percent , but the extent of the recovery of an analyte Cont ains Nonbinding Recommendations Bioanalytical Method Validation 05/24/18 9 and of the ISs should be consistent and reproducible. The sponsor should perform r ecovery experiments by comparing the analytic al results of extracted samples with corresponding extracts of blanks spiked with the analyte post-extraction (i.e., to represent 100 percent recovery). Recovery evaluation is not necessary for LBAs unless sample extraction is involved. Recovery experime nts should be performed as described in Table 1. 7. Stability During method development, the sponsor should determine the chemical stability of the analyte in a given matrix, including the effects of sample collection, handling, and storage of the analy te. The sponsor should assess autosampler , benchtop, processed or extracted sample s, freeze -thaw , stock solution, and long-term stability of the analyte . The sponsor should assess the stability in the same matrix as that intended for in -study samples ; however, when the matrix is rare, t he sponsor can explore the use of suitable surrogate matrices. For drugs administered as fixed combinations, or part of a specific drug regimen, the stability of the analyte should be assessed in the presence of the other drug. The sponsor should also consider the stability of the analyte in the presence of other co -medications that are known to be regularly administered to patients for the indication of the drug under development. Depending on the analyte as well as t he sample collection and assay conditions, evaluat ing the stability of the analyte in whole blood during method development can be useful. For example, a drug can be unstable in whole blood or adsorb to cellular components during collection. During vali dation, stability evaluations should cover the expected sample conditions before receipt at the analytical site (e.g., at the clinical site, during shipment , and at all other secondary sites) as well as during receipt and analysis at the analytical site. Validation of drug stability in a biological fluid is a function of the storage conditions, the physicochemical properties of the drug, the matrix, and the container system. The stability of an analyte in a particular matrix and container system is relevant only to that matrix and container system and should not be extrapolated to other matrices and container systems. If the storage conditions changed or the sample analysis occurred outside of the validated storage condition , the stability should be re-established under these new conditions. Stability testing of the analyte in whole blood should be revalidated if necessary (e.g., if the analytes are unstable during blood collection). The specific recommendations and acceptance criteria for stability are listed in Table 1. Matrix-related stability experiments should compare stability QCs against freshly prepared calibration curves and freshly prepared QCs . Although the use of freshly prepared calibrators and QCs is the preferred approach, in some cases, (e.g., for macromolecules ), it may be necessary to freeze them overnight. In such cases, the sponsor should provide valid justification and demonstrate the freeze -thaw stability. Cont ains Nonbinding Recommendations Bioanalytical Method Validation 05/24/18 10 All stability determinations (see list below) should use a set of samples prepared from a freshly made stock solution of the a nalyte in the appropriate analyte -free, interference-free biological matrix. Autosampler stability : The sponsor should demonstrate the stability of extracts in the autosampler only if the autosampler st orage conditions are different or not covered by extract (processed sample) stability . Bench-top stability : The sponsor should determine the stability of samples under the laboratory handling conditions that are expected for the study samples (e.g., the stability of samples maintained at room temperature or stored in an ice bucket ). Extract (or processed sample ) stability : The sponsor should assess t he stability of processed samples, including the residence time in the autosampler against freshly prepa red calibrators . Fre e ze -thaw stability : The sponsor should assess the stability of the sample after a minimum of three freeze -thaw cycles . QC samples should be thawed and analyzed according to the same procedures as the study samples. QC samples shoul d be frozen for at least 12 hours between cycles. Freeze-t haw stability QCs should be compared to freshly prepared calibration curves and QCs . Long -te rm stability : The sponsor should determine the long-term stability of the sample over a period of time equal to or exceed ing the time between the date of first sample collection and the date of last sample analysis. The storage temperatures studied should be the same as those used to store study samples. Long-term stability QCs should be compared to freshly prepared calibration curves and QCs. Determination of stability at minus 20\u00baC would cover stability at colder temperatures. Stock solution stability : Stock solutions should not be made from reference materials that are about to expire unless the purit y of the analyte in the stock solutions is re - established . When the stock solution exists in a different state ( e.g., solution versus solid) or in a different buffer composition ( which is generally the case for macromolecules) from the certified reference standard, the sponsor should generate stability data on stock solutions to justify the duration of stock solution storage stability. 8. Dilution Effects If the method measure s diluted samples, the integrity of the dilution should be monitored during validation by diluting QC samples above the ULOQ with like matrix to bring to within quantitation range , and the accuracy and precision of these diluted QCs should be demonstrated. Dilutions used during the validation should mimic the expected dilutions in t he study. The prozone effect should be demonstrated in LBAs. Refer to the specific recommendations and acceptance criteria in Table 1 . Cont ains Nonbinding Recommendations Bioanalytical Method Validation 05/24/18 11 9. Partial and Cross Validations The following section defines other types of methods validation. a. Partial validat ion Partial validations evaluate modifications of already validated bioanalytical methods. Partial validation can range from as little as one intra -assay accuracy and precision determination to a nearly full validation. Raw data on partial validations s hould be retained at the analytical site for inspection when requested. Typical bioanalytical method modifications or changes that fall into this category include , but are not limited to, the following : Bioanalytical method transfers between laboratories Change s in analytical methodology (e.g., a change in detection systems) Changes in sample processing procedures Changes in sample volume ( e.g., the smaller volume of pediatric samples ) Change s in instruments and/or software platforms Extensions of the assay range Change s in the anticoagulant ( but not changes in the counter -ion) in harvesting biological fluids (e.g., heparin to EDTA) Change s in the matrix within species (e.g., switching from human plasma to human blood) or changes to the species w ithin the matrix (e.g., switching from rat plasma to mouse plasma) Change s to the matrices (e.g., cerebrospinal fluid) Demonstrati ng the selectivity of an analyte in the presence of concomitant medications Changes in LBA critical reagents (e.g., lot -to-lot changes, changes in reagents) b. Cross validation Cross validation is a comparison of validation parameters of two or more bioanalytical methods or techniques that are used to generate data within the same study or across different studies. Also, cross validation is necessary when sample analyses within a single study are conducted at more than one site or more than one laboratory. In such cases, cross validation with shared matrix QCs and nonpooled subject samples should be conducted at each site or laboratory to establish interlaboratory reliability. Pooled incurred samples can be used when insufficient volume exists . An SOP or validation plan should define the criteria a priori. Cont ains Nonbinding Recommendations Bioanalytical Method Validation 05/24/18 12 C. Validated Methods: Expectations of In-Study Analysis and Reporting This section describes the expectations for the use of a validated bioanalytical method for routine drug analysis. The specific recommendations and acceptance criteria are listed in Table 1 . If system suitability is assessed, a specific SOP shoul d be used. System suitability, including apparatus conditioning and instrument performance, should be determined using samples that are independent of the current study calibrators, QCs, and study samples. Records of system suitability should be maintained and available for audits. Calibration curves and QCs should be included in all analytical runs (see Table 1 for details). The QCs should cover the expected study sample concentration range . Typically, the same curve fitting, weighting, and goodness -of-fit determined during validation should be used for the calibration curve within the study. Changes in the response -function relationship between the validation and study sample analyses indicate potential problems. A SOP should be developed a priori to address such issues. Total QCs should number at least five percent of the total samples anal yzed, or be at least six in number (low-, mid -, and high-QCs, in duplicate) , whichever is greater (see Table 1 for details) . Duplicate low -, mid -, and high-QCs should be used on all distinct processing batches within a run. If the study sample concentrations are clustered in a narrow range of the standard curve, additional QCs should be added to cover the sample range. If the additional QC concentrations are not bracketed by QCs validated before the study, the accuracy and precision of the additional QCs should be demonstrated before continuing with the analysis. If the partial validation is acceptable, samples that have already been analyzed do not require re -analysis. The QCs should be interspersed with study samples during processing and analysis . In each analytical run, the lack of analyte interference at the LLOQ should be confirmed (see Table 1 for Selectivity and Sensitivity ). The analytical run fai ls if the calibration and/or QC acceptance criteria are not met (see Table 1 ). QC results (including outliers) from analytical runs that meet the acceptance criteria should be included in the estimation of accuracy and precision during the study's sample analysis. The QC results from all analytical runs (passed and failed) should be reported, but QCs results from failed runs need not be included as part of the estimation of accuracy and precision. Cont ains Nonbinding Recommendations Bioanalytical Method Validation 05/24/18 13 If the bioanalytical method necessitates separation of t he overall analytical run into distinct processing batches (e.g., groups of samples processed at distinctly different times or by different analysts ), each distinct batch should process duplicate QCs at all levels (e.g., low, middle, high) along with the s tudy samples . Examples might include when the number of samples exceeds the capacity of a 96-well plate or when a solid phase extraction manifol d cannot accommodate all samples . See Table 1 for what constitutes an acceptable run based on QC acceptance cr iteria. A distinct batch or batches in an analytical run may be rejected when it fails to meet QC acceptance criteria, but the remaining batches may pass provided that the analytical run meets the overall QC acceptance criteria. Study samples with concentrations listed below the LLOQ should be reported as below the LLOQ ( BQL ). Study samples with concentrations above the ULOQ should be diluted and re -analyzed , or the standard curve should be extended and revalidated. Study sample dilutions should use the same matrix (e.g., human plasma to human plasma). Assays of all study samples of an analyte in a biological matrix should be completed within the time period for which stability data are available. If sample handling conditions are changed or exceed va lidated stability data, then the stabilit y of the sample should be established at the new conditions . For CCs, the IS response should be monitored for variability. An SOP should be developed a priori to address issues with IS variabilit y. Drift shoul d be monitored and its impact on the accuracy of the estimated unknown sample concentrations , if any, should be addressed (e.g., the impact of drift on the accuracy of interspersed QCs). All study samples from a subject should be analyzed in a single run, especially for studies designed with repeated measures from individual subjects (e.g., crossover or sequential design required for BE studies). If other approaches are taken , the sponsor or applicant should justify the approach and take steps to minimiz e the variability between periods. Carryover, if any, should be monitored, and its impact on the quantitation of study samples should be addressed. Incurred sample reanalysis (ISR) should be performed (See s ection IV, Table 1 and Table 2). An SOP or gui deline describing the reasons for a repeat analysis should be established a priori . Repeat analysis is acceptable only for assignable causes (e.g., the samples are above the ULOQ, there are sample processing errors, there is an equipment failure, the chromatography is poor ). The SOP should include the acceptance criteria for re-analysis , and the sponsor or applicant should report final valu es. The specific recommendations Cont ains Nonbinding Recommendations Bioanalytical Method Validation 05/24/18 14 are described in Table 1 and Table 2 . The rationale, approach , and all data for the repeat analysis and reporting should be clearly documented. For study samples involving multiple analytes , a valid result for one analyte should not be rejected because of another analyte failing the acceptance criteria. If a unique or disproportionate ly high concentration of a metabolite is discovered in human studies, a fully validated assay may need to be developed for the metabolite, depending upon its activity (refer to the FDA guidance for industry entitled Safety Testing of Drug Metabolites10). An SOP or guideline for sample data reintegration for CCs should be established a priori. This SOP or guideline should define the criteria for re -integration and how the re - integration will be performed. The rationale for the re -integration should be cl early described and documented. Audit trails should be maintained. Original and re -integrated data should be documented and reported. IV. INCURRED SAMPLE REANALYSIS ISR is a necessary component of bioanalytical method validation and verif ies the relia bility of the reported study sample analyte concentrations. ISR is conducted by repeating the analysis of a subset of subject or patient samples from a given study in separate runs, preferably during the study, to critically support the precision and accuracy measurements established with the QCs. The original and repeat analys es should be conducted using the same bioanalytical method procedures. If a bulk frozen calibration curve was used for the original analysis, then it is acceptable to use a frozen curve for the ISR evaluation. The calibration curve, QCs, and study samples for the ISR evaluation should be extracted or processed separately from those used in the original runs. Incurred samples should not be pooled. ISR should be conducted in all st udies submitted in an NDA, BLA , or ANDA that provide pivotal data for the approva l or labeling of the product, regardless of the matrix. For instance, ISR is expected for all in vivo human BE studies in ANDAs, or all pivotal pharmacokinetic , pharmacodynam ic, and biomarker studies in NDAs or BLAs. For nonclinical safety studies, the performing laboratory should conduct ISR at least once for each method and species. Table 1 lists the sample requirements and acceptance criteria for ISR. Written SOPs should be established for the conduct of ISR and to guide an investigation in the event of ISR failure to resolve the lack of reproducibility. All aspects of ISR evaluations should be documented to allow reconstruct ion of the study, as well as guide any investi gations (see Table 2 ). The percentage difference of the results between the original study and the repeat study is determined with the following equation: 10 This guidance is available on the Internet at http://www.fda .gov/Drugs/default.htm under G Method Validation 05/24/18 15 (Repeat - Original) * 100 Mean V. ADDITIONAL ISSUES A. Endogenous Compounds For analytes that are also endogenous compounds, the accuracy of the measurement of the analytes poses a challenge when the assay cannot distinguish between the therapeutic agent and the endogenous counterpart. In such situations, the following approaches are recommended to validate and monitor assay performance. Other approaches, if justified by scientific principles, can also be considered. The biological matrix used to prepare calibration standards should be the same as the study samples and free of the e ndogenous analyte. To address the suitability of using an analyte -free biological matrix, the matrix should be demonstrated to have : (1) no measurable endogenous analyte ; and (2) no matrix effect or interference when compared to the biological matrix . The use of alternate matrices (e.g., buffers, dialyzed serum) for the preparation of calibration standards should be justified. The QCs should be prepared by spiking known quantities of the analyte in the same biological matrix as the study samples. The en dogenous concentrations of the analyte in the biological matrix should be evaluated before QC preparation ( e.g., by replicate analysis). The concentrations for the QCs should account for the endogenous concentrations in the biological matrix (i.e., additi ve) and be representative of the expected study concentrations. Parallelism should be evaluated for assays for endogenous compounds . B. Biomarke rs The recommendations in this guidance only pertain to the validation of assays to measure in vivo biomarker concentrations in biological matrices such as blood or urine. Considerable effort also goes into defining the biological function of biomarkers, and confusion may arise regarding terminology (e.g. biomarker method validation vs biomarker qualification) . Biomarkers are increasingly used to assess the effects of new drugs and therapeutic biological products in patient populations. Because of the important roles biomarkers ca n play in evaluating the safety, activity, or effectiveness of a new medical pro duct, it is critical to ensure the integrity of the data generated by assays used to measure them. Biomarkers can be used for a wide variety of purposes during drug development; therefore, a FFP approach should be used when determining the appropriate extent of method validation. When biomarker data will be used to support a regulatory decision making, such as the pivotal determination of safety and/or effectiveness or to support dosing instructions in product labeling, the assay should be fully . Cont Method Validation 05/24/18 16 For assays intended to support early drug development (e.g., candidate selection, go-no-go decisions, proof -of-concept), the sponsor should incorporate the extent of method validation they deem appropriate. Method validation for biomarker assays shoul d address the same questions as method validation for drug assays. The accuracy, precision, sensitivity, selectivity, parallelism, range, reproducibility, and stability of a biomarker assay are important characteristics that define the method. The approa ch used for drug assays should be the starting point for validation of biomarker assays, although the FDA realizes that some characteristics may not apply or that different considerations may need to be addressed. C. Diagnostic Kits Diagnostic kits are s ometimes co -developed with new drug or therapeutic biologic al products as analytical methods that are used during the development of new drugs and therapeutic biologics . The recommendations in this section of the guidance do not apply to commercial diagnostic kits intended for point -of-care patient diagnosis (e.g., companion diagnostic kits ), which are addressed in the following CDRH guidance documents : Principles for Codevelopment of an In Vitro Companion Diagnostic Device with a Therapeutic Product11 In Vitro Companion Diagnostic Devices However, when commercial diagnostic kits are repurposed as analytical methods to measure the concentrations of drugs , therapeutic biologics , or biomarkers in development, the FDA has the following recommendations : LBA kits with various detection platforms are sometimes used to determine analyte concentrations in pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic studies when the reported results must exhibit sufficient precision and accuracy. Because such kits are generally developed for use as clinical diagnostic tools, their suitability for use in such studies should be demonstrated. Diagnostic kit validation data provided by the manufacturer may not ensure that the kit method is reliable for drug development purposes. In such s ituations, t he performance of diagnostic kits should be assessed in the facility conducting the sample analysis. Validation considerations for kit assays include, but are not limited to, the following examples: 11 When final, this guidance will represent the FDA's current thinking on this topic. For the most recent version of a guidance, check the FDA Drugs guidance Web page at http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/G Site-specific validation should be perform ed. The specificity, accuracy, precision, and stability of the assay should be demonstrated under actual conditions of use. Modifications from kit processing instructions should be completely validated. - Kits that use sparse calibration standards (e.g. , one- or two-point calibration curves) should include in-house validation experiments to establish the calibration curve with a sufficient number of standards across the calibration range as specified in Table 1 . - Actual QC concentrations should be known. Concentrations of QCs expressed as ranges are not sufficient for quantitative applications. In such cases, QCs with known concentrations should be prepared and used, independent of the kit -supplied QCs. - Standards and QCs should be prepared in the same matrix as the subject samples. Kits with standards and QCs prepared in a matrix different from the subject samples should be justified, and appropriate cross -validation experiments should be performed. Refer to section V.A of this guidance for additional discussion. - If the analyte source ( i.e., reference standard) in the kit differs from that of the subject samples (e.g., the sample is a protein isoform of the reference standard), testing should evaluate differences in assay performance of the kit reagents. - If multiple kit lots are used within a study, lot -to-lot variability and comparability should be addressed for any critical reagents. - Individual batches using multiple assay plates (e.g., 96-well ELISA plates) should include sufficient replica te QCs on each plate to monitor the accuracy of the assay . Acceptance criteria should be established for the individual plates and the overall analytical run (refer to Table 1 and section III.B). D. Bridging Data From Multiple Bioanalytical Technolog ies The FDA encourages the development and use of new bioanalytical technologies. However, the use of two different bioanalytical technologies for the development of a drug may generate data for the same product that could be difficult to interpret. Thi s outcome can occur when one platform generates drug concentrations that differ from another platform. Therefore, when a new platform is used in the development of a drug, the data it produces should be bridged to that of the other method. This is best a ccomplished by assessing the output of both methods with a set of incurred samples ( a minimum of 20 samples ). In cases where one method produces data with a constant bias relative to the other, concentrations can be mathematically transformed by that factor to allow for appropriate study interpretation. Sponsors are encouraged to seek feedback Cont ains Nonbinding Recommendations Bioanalytical Method Validation 05/24/18 18 from the appropriate FDA review division early in drug development. The use of two methods for BE studies in ANDAs is discouraged. E. Dried Blood Spots Dried blo od spot (DBS) technology has been under development for several years. The benefits of DBS include reduced blood sample volumes collected for drug analysis as well as ease of collection, storage, and transportation. A dditional validation of this sampling approach is essential before using DBS in regulat ory studies. This validation should address, at a minimum, the effects of the following issues: storage and handling temperature s, homogeneity of sample spotting, hematocrit, stability, carryover, and reproducibility , including ISR. Correlative studies with traditional sampling should be conducted during drug development. Sponsors are encouraged to seek feedback from the appropriate FDA review division early in drug development. VI. DOCUMENTATION Gene ral and specific SOPs and good record keeping are essential to a properly validated analytical method. The data generated for bioanalytical method development and/or validation should be documented and available for data audit and inspection. Documentati on at the analytical site and for submission to the FDA is described in Table 2 . All relevant documentation necessary for reconstructing the study as it was conducted and reported should be maintained in a secure environment. Relevant documentation includes, but is not limited to, source data , protocols and reports , records supporting procedural, operational, and environmental concerns , and correspondence records between all involved parties. Regardless of the documentation format (i.e., paper or elect ronic), records should be contemporaneous with the event, and subsequent alterations should not obscure the original data. The basis for changing or reprocessing data should be documented with sufficient detail, and the original record should be maintaine d. A. Summary Information Summary information should include the following items : summary of assay methods used for each study protocol should be included. Each summary should provide the protocol number, the protocol title, the assay type, the assay method identification code, the bioanalytical report code, and the effective date of the method. For each analyte, a summary table of all the relevant method validation reports should be provided, including partial validation and cross validation reports. The table should include the assay method identification code, the type of assay, t he reason for the new method or additional validation (e.g., to lower the limit of quantification), and the dates of final reports. Changes made to the method should be clearly identified. Cont ains Nonbinding Recommendations Bioanalytical Method Validation 05/24/18 19 A summary table cross -referencing multiple identification codes should be provided when an assay has different codes for the assay method, the validation reports, and the bioanalytical reports.

Incurred Sample Reanalysis (ISR) : ISR is the repeated measurement of an analyte 's concentration from study samples to demonstrate reproducibility. Inter f er ence : Interference refers to the action of sample components, including structurally similar analytes, metabolites, impurities, degradants, or matrix components that may impact quantitation of the analyte of interest. Refer to Selectivity and Matrix e ffe ct for further information. Internal standard (IS): ISs are test compounds (e.g., structurally similar analog s, stable isotope labeled compounds ) added to both calibration standards and sampl es at known and constant concentrations to facilitate quantification of the target analyte(s). Long -te rm stability: Long-term stability assesses the degradation of an analyte in the matrix relative to the starting material after periods of frozen storage . Lower limit of quantification (LLOQ ): The LLOQ is the lowest amount of an analyte that can be quantitatively determined with acceptable precision and accuracy. Cont ains Nonbinding Recommendations Bioanalytical Method Validation 05/24/18 39 Matrix effect: The matrix effect is a direct or indirect alteration or interference in response because of the presence of unintended analytes (for analysis) or other interfering substances in the sample. Method: A method is a comprehensive description of all procedures used in the collection, storage , and analysis of samples.
