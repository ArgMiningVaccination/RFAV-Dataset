But you might be wondering, how do we even go about making the COVID19 [vaccine](/learn/Vaccinations)? There are two main goals in [vaccine](/learn/Vaccinations) development: First, the [vaccine](/learn/Vaccinations) needs to be safe to administer to the general population. Second, the [vaccine](/learn/Vaccinations) needs to be efficacious against the pathogen, for instance a virus. There are a couple ways to identify that - by seeing if it produces a significant [immune response](/learn/Introduction_to_the_immune_system) to the virus or by seeing if it reduces the chance of getting the disease itself. Before a candidate [vaccine](/learn/Vaccinations) even begins being administered to humans, it goes through extensive animal testing, typically using lab mice. In this phase researchers are looking for side effects within the mice, which can range from mild skin irritation at the site of injection, to death. Researchers also take blood samples from the mice over the next several days to weeks. Researchers measure the blood antibody levels of the mice, and specifically look for antibodies being produced that would combat the virus. A sufficient number of antibodies being produced after the [vaccine](/learn/Vaccinations) is administered is a promising result. Sometimes mice are given the virus to see if having the [vaccine](/learn/Vaccinations) prevents them from getting the disease. If there are no significant negative side effects and there's evidence of [vaccine](/learn/Vaccinations) efficacy, the [vaccine](/learn/Vaccinations) can move to clinical trials. Clinical trials are broken down in three [phases](/answers/compensatory-shock), and are designed to measure both the safety of the candidate [vaccine](/learn/Vaccinations) and the [immune response](/learn/Introduction_to_the_immune_system), just like in mice. In all of these [phases](/answers/compensatory-shock), humans are given the candidate [vaccine](/learn/Vaccinations), and others are given a placebo with the goal to help make it easier to compare the efficaciousness of the [vaccine](/learn/Vaccinations). Healthy adults are usually chosen for these studies because the goal is to ensure that they are least likely to develop a serious problem from the [vaccine](/learn/Vaccinations) and so that if they do develop a health issue, it's most likely from the [vaccine](/learn/Vaccinations) and not from an underlying condition.
