Activities: Promote the dissemination of scientific literature Organize workshops and training sessions, produce communication materials, manage relations with the press, provide advice on communication Develop strategies to diversify research income Arrange meetings with companies and partners, and answer Intellectual Property (IP) concerns Ms Najet Hadhri : Knowledge Manager MrHichem Ben Hassine : Communication Officer MrOussama Ben Fadhel : Project Manager in Technology TransferOur KTOMain Development Programs Clinical Trials Treatment of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (CL): Study of Phase III (in Tunisia, IPT) Shows Antibiotic Cream Has High Cure Rate, Few Side Effects An international research partnership from Tunisia, France and the United States (WRAIR). CL is a parasitic disease that causes disfiguring lesions and affects 1.5 million people worldwide annually, including the socio -economically disadvantaged in the developing world, especially children. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has designated this new antibiotic cream eligible for fast -track review, given CL's status as a neglected disease. The international research partnership is actively engaged with the FDA to support this review.Main Development Programs Vaccine Development Development of a rabies vaccine for human use at Institut Pasteur de Tunis, Tunisia, in collaboration with international industrial partners, with perspective of production in Tunisia (Under negotiation with industrial partners) The National Institutes of Health has agreed to provide researchers from the IPT with the expertise and support to improve the thermostability and the freeze -drying cycle of the rabies vaccine developed at IPT ( WIPO Re Search connection) The BCG vaccine (2 forms): Technology transfer to South Korea (KCDC, GCC) and currently under negotiation with Industrial partner.Initiatives TT Signature, in 2018, with SATT Lutech of a license agreement on a European patent application entitled \" Lebecetin , C-type lectin , as neovascularization inhibitor\", December invention IPT, IRD) In 2018,H2020 twinning project: STRENGTHENING OMICS INTERACTION ; PHINDaccess (Pathogen -Host INteraction Data access) with a Work Package (WP6) dedicated to Technology Transfer : \"UNLEASHING IPT'S FULL POTENTIAL FOR AN EFFICIENT TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH\", coordinated by the PM in TT (IPT, C2VT2) Deliverable WP6 Task 6.2 An institutional IP policyJoint Inventions License on patented technologies : co -ownership on patent 1stthing we had to negotiate inventorship in the invention disclosure Phdunder joint supervision assignment of rights or sharing ownership?
