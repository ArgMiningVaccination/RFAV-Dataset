CBIS, FAOTA Professor and Chair, Division of Occupational Therapy School of Medicine West Virginia University swheeler@hsc.wvu.edu 5 Mission of the West Virginia University OTD Program The West Virginia University Occupational Therapy Doctorate Program exists to educate current and future occupational therapy professionals on the power of occupation to foster effective solutions for maximal participation in everyday living, enhanced quality of life, and lifelong health and wellness for all people. We are committed to cultivating resilient, confident, and culturally aware professionals who promote the distinct value of occupational therapy with accountability, honesty, and purpose. Graduates from our program will be empowered to transform lives locally and globally through participation in scholarly activity, research, and service to the community. Fieldwork Philosophy and Relationship to the OTD Curriculum General Program Objectives of Occupational Therapy Fieldwork Education The overarching goal of the OTD program is to prepare graduates to meet the standards of competence stated in the Accreditation Council for Occupational Therapy Education (ACOTE) documents and the state regulations governing occupational therapy practice. Fieldwork is planned with two major objectives. One objective is to provide the student with opportunities to observe treatment processes conducted in the actual settings and to become acquainted with practitioners and clients (Level I fieldwork). The second objective is to build upon acquired knowledge, professional attitudes, and performance skills in treatment settings to develop those skills expected of entry level occupational therapy students (Level II Fieldwork). In support of the OTD program curriculum design and philosophy of learning, fieldwork experiences foster the growth of one's professional values and professional identity through experiential learning and opportunities for self-reflection. Level I fieldwork education courses, in combination with clinical and community-based lab experiences, provide diverse opportunities to experience occupational therapy in both traditional (OTH 585 and 585), non-traditional (OTH 586), and emerging (OTH 586) practice settings with a variety of clinical populations across the lifespan. The extensive and diverse list of fieldwork education clinical partners afford students additional opportunities to explore traditional, non-traditional, and emerging areas of practice during level II fieldwork rotations. In West Virginia, primary areas of non-traditional and emerging occupational therapy include community-based practice and culturally relevant rural Appalachian initiatives that maximize health, well-being, and quality of life. Level I Fieldwork is integral to our program's curriculum design. There are a series of 3 Level I fieldwork courses that occur over the first six semesters of the OTD program curriculum sequence. These fieldwork courses align with prior and concurrent course content to reinforce and refine skill competencies while supporting the progression of one's professional identify and self-confidence. Level I fieldwork also nurtures an appreciation for evidence-based, interprofessional, rural healthcare while expanding one's occupational perspective and clinical reasoning skills. The OTD program level I fieldwork courses are listed and described below. OTH 584 Summer 2nd year (2 credits) The first in a series of three clinical instruction courses in the occupational therapy process. OT documentation, basic measurement skills and clinical skills, experiences with people with disabilities, and participation in professional activities. This course includes clinical simulation instruction, interprofessional education and classroom instruction. Fieldwork meetings will be held as needed throughout the semester 6 to discuss any relevant fieldwork situations. Instruction occurs through observation and hands on experience. Students will demonstrate competence in assessing cardio/pulmonary function, functional mobility (bed mobility/transfers) and creating an occupational profile. OTH 585 fall 2nd year (2 credits) A ten session (traditionally attended once-a-week) clinical rotation in a physical disabilities/developmental setting. OT staff must be present, either COTA or OTR. Fieldwork meetings will be held as needed throughout the semester to discuss any relevant fieldwork situations. Instruction occurs through observation and hands on experience. Assignments include treatment planning, documentation, and critically appraising research to develop evidenced- based answers to real-world clinical questions. OTH 586 spring 2nd year (2 credits) A 32 hour, once-a-week or daily, rotation focused on the psychosocial factors that influence occupational engagement and interpreting the role of Occupational Therapy in non-traditional and emerging practice settings. Supervisors will include qualified personnel such as social workers, program directors, house managers, etc. The WVU OT program Academic Fieldwork Coordinator or specified faculty will provide distant supervision. By the completion of the rotation, students are expected to have developed a project that compliments the site's mission and goals for the clients served. A clear understanding of how OT can contribute to the site in terms of consultative services offered will also be demonstrated. Instructional methods include meetings, direct communication/ supervision with students and site leaders, and hands-on client experience. In West Virginia, primary areas of non-traditional and emerging occupational therapy include community-based practice and culturally relevant rural Appalachian initiatives that maximize health, well-being, and quality of life. Level II Fieldwork is a natural continuation of our curriculum, and its primary purpose is to provide students with the opportunities to integrate the theory and skills learned in the classroom within diverse practice settings. Students complete site-specific assignments as well as multiple reflective to ensure congruence of their experiences with their academic preparation. These level II fieldwork experiences are an integral part of the curriculum design and include in-depth experiences in delivering occupational therapy services to clients, organizations and/or populations. The goal of Level II Fieldwork is to \"develop competent, entry-level\", practice scholars and designed to promote clinical reasoning and reflective practice, to transmit the values and beliefs that enable the application of ethics related to the profession, to communicate and model professionalism as a developmental process and a career responsibility, and to develop and expand a repertoire of occupational therapy assessments and treatment interventions related to human performance (C.1.1). A minimum of six months of Level II Fieldwork is required. At least six months (24 weeks) of sustained fieldwork is desirable on a full-time basis (C.1.10). Time should be appropriate to the setting selected, student needs, and continuity of client services, e.g., consecutive half days. No prior Level I FW can be substituted for any part of Level II FW (C.1.9). To ensure diversity of practice settings and exposure across the lifespan, it is recommended that Level II fieldwork take place in two separate full time; twelve-week placements arranged by the AFWC in collaboration with the student. The student can complete Level II fieldwork in a minimum of one setting if it is reflective of more than one practice area, or in a maximum of four different settings. Discernment of the 7 practice settings available must occur and be confirmed by the AFWC and the fieldwork site prior to the placement (C.1.10). The first Level II experience (OTH 540) will take place from approx. May-September and the second Level II experience (OTH 640) will take place from October to December. Students must have successfully completed all the academic classes and Level I Fieldwork with a minimum of a 3.0 OT Cum GPA before being allowed to participate in Level II experiences. Affiliated placement sites are located throughout the country and must meet ACOTE requirements (C.1.6). Level II sites are assigned by the AFWC (Academic Fieldwork Coordinator) based on quality of clinical experience rather than geographical convenience. If it is felt that a student would not be successful at a site for certain reasons, that student will be placed at an alternative site. All students will be guided by the AFWC in their selection process to ensure successful learning opportunities and a 'just-right-fit'. During the Level II experience, the student will remain registered at West Virginia University and will be monitored and assisted by the AFWC and any other university faculty as needed, however, the experience is completed off campus and will be supervised by the onsite Occupational Therapist (Fieldwork Educator FWE). We expect students to be knowledgeable about the fieldwork process and adhere to all University, School of Medicine (SOM), Division and Fieldwork specific policies and procedures. All Level II fieldwork experiences/requirements must be completed within 24 months of the student's last class on campus. The level II fieldwork education courses are listed and described below: OTH 540 Summer 3rd year (6 credits) Level II fieldwork rotation represents the first full-time, long term clinical placement in the occupational therapy curriculum. The length of this clinical rotation is twelve weeks; there is some variation as to how the 12 weeks can be structured. Instructional methods consist of demonstration and individual assignments as per the clinical fieldwork instructor. By the end of the rotation, students should have successfully completed the clinical education goal /objectives of the program and their specific site. Clinical education goals and objectives are developed by the site or through the academic fieldwork program and carried out in collaboration with clinical site supervisors. The clinical education process allows the students to practice and refine both professional and clinical skills. Students practice under the supervision of a licensed qualified occupational therapist in a qualified practice setting, which may include but are not limited to hospitals, home health agencies, nursing homes, schools, or outpatient clinics. OTH 640 fall 3rd year (6 credits) Level II fieldwork rotation represents the second and final full-time, long term clinical placement in the occupational therapy curriculum. The length of this clinical rotation is twelve weeks; there is some variation as to how the 12 weeks can be structured. Instructional methods consist of demonstration and individual assignments as per the clinical fieldwork instructor. By the end of the rotation, students should have successfully completed the clinical education goals /objectives of the program and their specific site. Clinical education goals and objectives are developed by the site or through the academic fieldwork program and carried out in collaboration with clinical site supervisors. The clinical education process allows the students to practice and refine both professional and clinical skills. Students practice under the supervision of a licensed qualified occupational therapist in a qualified practice setting, which may include but are not limited to hospitals, home health agencies, nursing homes, schools, or outpatient clinic. 8 Student Supervision and the Role of the Fieldwork Educator Occupational therapy practitioners often use supervision models that they encountered on their own clinical rotations when in school. West Virginia University recommends that each student be handled differently depending on their needs as well as the needs of the setting and the severity of the client's condition. The Academic Fieldwork Coordinator provides information on multiple different supervision methods to fieldwork educator, but recommends a developmental type approach to supervision. First starting with constant supervision, direction, and guidance. As the student's skills and confidence improve the fieldwork educator can begin to wean down on supervision as appropriate. Supervision should also be student centered. Just like when in practice, occupational therapists' strive to be client centered. We believe each student has a unique set of needs and abilities. The fieldwork educator's job is to steer the experience when applicable, but allows the student to take initiative in their own learning. The fieldwork educator provides the student with the tools, guidance, and resources that ultimately can get the student towards a successful experience, however, it is up to the student to use those tools and resources productively. Part of the mission of the WVU OTD Program is to create life long active learners. This holds true in the supervisory relationship as well. Although it is up to the supervisor to create the learning environment on fieldwork, it is also the student's responsibility to take an active part in the process. The OTD Program policy on student supervision and other important fieldwork policies are included in this manual. In addition, supervision related educational information is included in Appendix D of this Handbook. Participants in Fieldwork Education Fieldwork Coordinator The Academic Fieldwork Coordinator (AFWC) is a core, full-time faculty member who is responsible for the planning, coordination, and implementation of integrated and sustained fieldwork experiences. The AFWC negotiates the logistics of recruiting, assigning, confirming, and monitoring Level I and Level II fieldwork placements. The AFWC serves as a resource for students, fieldwork sites and fieldwork educators, faculty & advisors, as needed, regarding negotiating logistics and processing outcomes of fieldwork experiences. Additionally, the AFWC provides orientation to the fieldwork program and process, upon admission, and, throughout participation in the WVU OT program. Fieldwork is a degree requirement and functions as the \"bridge\" between academic and professional roles for our students. (ACOTE A2.4) The AFWC responsibilities include: 1.

WVU Entry Level OTD Program Curriculum Design The goal of the OTD program at West Virginia University is to transform lives through the Occupational Therapy Process. To meet this goal, the program curriculum will graduate professionals that can enhance the lives of others through critical reasoning and evidence-based practice. These graduates will work effectively across interdisciplinary teams with the capacity to create solutions for real-world problems. As a land- grant institution, the faculty, staff and students at West Virginia University commit to creating a diverse and inclusive culture that advances education, healthcare and prosperity for all by providing access and opportunity; by advancing high-impact research; and by leading transformation in West Virginia and the world through local, state and global engagement. The design of the WVU OTD curriculum echoes the fundamental beliefs and values articulated in the AOTA Philosophy of Education (2018) and encourages diverse engaged learning experiences that occur both within and outside the classroom toward a goal of self-reflection, life-long learning and meeting societal needs through occupation. 11 At WVU, service, curiosity, respect, accountability, and appreciation are highly valued. These values are mirrored in the WVU occupational therapy curriculum. As students' progress through the curriculum, they are expected to seek opportunities to serve others and to be committed to providing the highest quality of service. Throughout their academic experience OT students develop through asking questions and constructing individualized internal models that position them to seek new opportunities and change through innovation. Throughout the educational journey students learn to be respectful, transparent, and inclusive with each other. They are challenged to perform at their absolute best every day to create real world solutions that are responsive, efficient, and effective. Building on the values of service, curiosity, respect, and accountability, is the value of appreciation. Students in the WVU occupational therapy program support and value each other's contributions as members of a vibrant professional and university community. These values provide a strong foundation for leadership through local, state, and global engagement. Students entering the WVU Occupational Therapy Doctorate (OTD) program are adult learners. As such they each have their own world and educational experiences that will affect their experiences in the program. We believe that adult learners are motivated to achieve a goal, want to be active participants in their education and seek opportunities to apply what they have learned. We also believe that once provided the foundations of occupational therapy practice adult learners are able to self-direct their learning within the fields through their selection of the scholarly project and capstone experience. We believe knowledge is constructed, not transferred (Senge, 2014). We believe what adult learners see changes what they know and, what they know changes what they will see. (Piaget, 2001; Vygotsky, 1978). These believes about learners and learning drive the teaching and learning experience throughout the WVU Occupational Therapy OTD experience. The curriculum at WVU is based on the constructivist learning theory (Bruner, 1960). 1. Learning is an active process through which learners construct new ideas and concepts that build on existing, foundational knowledge. 2. Faculty act as facilitators of learning, encouraging students to explore within a structured framework 3. Learners who engage and learn with others can organize their own ideas and construct their own knowledge 4. The process of learning includes selecting and transforming information, making decisions, generating hypotheses, and making meaning through interweaving information and experience. 5. Learning is a developmental and therefore a continuous process that moves along a cycle. Learners start with a concrete experience, move to observation and reflection, next form abstract concepts and testing their understanding in new situations and finally returning to gather new concrete experiences with greater capacity for understanding the experience. 6. Learning environments that emphasize authentic engagement and active participation in a meaningful context promotes learners who are ready to construct innovative solutions to real world problems. The values of WVU and the concepts of specific learning theories frame the educational experience of our occupational therapy program. We introduce these ideals early and home in on the six threads of our 12 curriculum to develop students into expert occupational therapists who represent WVU and West Virginia. The identified focus areas of the WVU Occupational Therapy Program are: Professional Identity Students demonstrate self-efficacy by embracing the full breadth of what it means to be an occupational therapist (e.g., practitioner, leader, educator, researcher), one who uses their education and experience to build on WVU's core values: health care professionals who are agents of change, who contribute to the health and wellbeing of society, and who advocate for the belief that humans are occupational beings who can influence the state of their own health through occupational engagement as influenced by community and cultural contexts. Interprofessional Practice Occupational therapists practice in consultation and collaboration with a variety of healthcare, educational, service-oriented, and community professions. The students at WVU engage in a rich milieu of interprofessional learning experiences through didactic, simulation, laboratory, community, and clinical activities to enhance their self-efficacy. Students learn to become occupational therapists who communicate effectively, demonstrate effective teamwork, adhere to OTs values and ethics, and represent OTs defined and specific roles and responsibilities to improve patient safety and health and wellness outcomes. As advocates of occupational engagement, social participation and accessible social-political environments, our graduates create innovative pathways through which occupation and occupational science can serve the needs of society. Occupational perspective Students use an occupational lens helps understand what people are doing, want to do or need to do to be healthy and live satisfying lives. Participating in occupations is central to a person's health, sense of well-being and life satisfaction. Occupation is used by students to establish or remediate skills and body functions, promote health, or prevent dysfunction in individuals, groups, and populations Evidence-based practice to solve real world problems Occupational therapy is an evidence based, science-driven profession. Occupation and the relationship between occupation, occupational science, and occupational therapy, informs student selection of targeted occupational therapy process and supports client-centered outcomes. Clinical reasoning/ critical thinking Clinical reasoning is the ability to think in action, to focus and filter clinical cues and data to drive the occupational therapy process. Our students are critical thinkers who use strong evidence and theoretically sound occupational approaches to plan, direct, perform and reflect on best practices in client care. Rural health needs 13 West Virginia is a primarily rural state with unique health and wellness needs that arise from its geography and population distribution. West Virginia University as the Land Grant Institution is dedicated to addressing the needs of West Virginians. Occupational therapy brings specialized perspective, knowledge, and skills to this mission. Graduates of the WVU OT program possess the specialized perspective, knowledge and skills occupational therapy can provide to improve the health of individuals living in rural and/or underserved settings. By integrating the mission of the university, the values of occupational therapy, and the curricular threads, the program is designed to facilitate learning unique to West Virginia University Occupational Therapy students through teaching, service and scholarship for competency, proficiency, and mastery of skills. Students use an occupational lens helps understand what people are doing, want to do or need to do to be healthy and live satisfying lives. Participating in occupations is central to a person's health, sense of well-being and life satisfaction. Occupation is used by students to establish or remediate skills and body functions, promote health, or prevent dysfunction in individuals, groups, and populations Foundational courses address structure and function of the human mind and body and how humans develop throughout the lifespan. Students are active learners who become familiar with the interplay of sociocultural, socioeconomic, diversity factors, and lifestyle choices in contemporary society with the theories, models of practice, and frames of reference that underlie the occupational therapy process. Students exhibit a knowledge of occupational therapy's history and the relationship to meet society's current and future occupational needs. Students demonstrate an understanding of the varied roles of occupational therapy and applicable credentialing and licensing. With didactic, case based, experiential, practical, and fieldwork education, the students gain an understanding of community resources, reimbursement, and professional and personal responsibilities. Students also establish competence in instructional design and research ethics and process as evidenced by completing standardized training and other related activities within the Health Sciences Center. Next, through reinforcement of concepts and knowledge of the social determinants of health, students become proficient in designing and implementing intervention strategies to remediate and/or compensate for deficits or enhance the performance of occupations through the use of patient and caregiver education, functional mobility tasks, assistive technology, therapeutic use of self, orthotics and prosthetics, modalities, community mobility and access, and ergonomics. Students are able to gather, evaluate, interpret, and discuss statistical data and scientific evidence using occupational therapy theories and models of practice in a variety of contexts and environments to inform practice decisions and create scholarly products. Students participate in a faculty guided scholarship project to support inquiry and development of in-depth knowledge. Students become adept in their ability to use the Occupational Therapy Code of Ethics and AOTA Standards of Practice to guide their ethical decision-making in professional interactions. The curriculum supports the acquisition of leadership skills to participate in management and understand business aspects of practice, and the value of professional development, care coordination, advocacy, legislation, policy, and regulation. 14 Finally, through mastery of concepts, students develop expertise in applying, analyzing, and evaluating the interaction of occupation and activity using evidence-based practice to explain the importance and use of occupation. The students are able to utilize their strong occupational perspective, knowledge of the disease process on occupational performance, activity analysis skills, critical analysis of evidence, unique features of rural health, and clinical reasoning to modify interventions based on the specific needs of the patient, group or population. The curriculum enhances the student's development of a strong professional identity that will be evident through their engagement in interprofessional education activities while demonstrating and educating others on the value of occupation and establishing professional responsibility for engaging in leadership positions. Achievement of this allows the student to then develop in-depth knowledge and expertise in an area of interest through completion of the Doctoral Experiential and Capstone Project. WVU OTD Curriculum Sequence The WVU OTD full-time curriculum will proceed in a lock-step fashion with each semester's work building on the last. This approach is designed to foster reflection on learning and the application of content from one course to subsequent courses. If a student fails to demonstrate course competency (grade of less than C or other competency criteria outlined in the course syllabus), he/she will be required to step-out of the program until the course is offered again. If this were to occur, an individual action/remediation plan may be developed to increase the likelihood of the student's success in the curriculum when he/she repeats the required course. The first six semesters of the nine-semester curriculum occur on campus including Level I fieldworks, which are completed in the local region and integrated into semesters 3 through 6. The final three semesters are considered clinical/experiential semesters and the students will be engaged in their two 12-week Level II fieldwork rotations and the 14-week Doctoral Experiential. However, the students will be actively engaged with the academic program through online seminar courses with five-day residencies during semester 7 & 8. These seminars with residencies are intended to facilitate the student integration of their clinical and didactic learning and to prepare them for the next phase of their off-campus learning. During their final semester while on the Doctoral Experiential the students are enrolled in their capstone course and are actively working with their faculty mentor and the capstone coordinator to ensure integration of the experiential, clinical and academic learning. The students complete their Doctoral experiential with a one-week on campus residency where they present their completed Doctoral Capstone project. In the first year of the OTD curriculum develop a solid theoretical and scientific knowledge base that underlies modern occupational therapy practice. Students take courses that address anatomy, kinesiology, lifespan development, neurobiology, and occupational science and pathophysiology. As they strengthen their knowledge base students begin to apply their knowledge to occupational therapy by developing basic clinical reasoning, evaluation, and intervention skills. There is a strong emphasis on learning the basic psychomotor skills necessary in OT practice. The 2nd year of the OTD program allows the students to integrate and apply previously learned information and skills in new and challenging situations to build further reasoning and skill. Students 15 practice the basic skills of a clinician through participation in Level 1 fieldwork where they complete occupational profiles, basic evaluations and assessments and plan treatment intervention. In the didactic portion of the 2nd year students expand their understanding and competence in OT practice moving beyond individual focused intervention to focus on groups and populations as clients. They also move beyond the basic areas of BADL and IADL evaluation and intervention to develop specialized skills in client factor assessment and interventions that address, client factors, prevention and wellness, and advocacy. This expansion of knowledge is further developed through participation in the 3rd and final Level I fieldwork experience that addresses OT service in non-traditional and community settings. These course structure and sequence of Level I fieldworks encourages the student to develop strong professional identity and occupation focused practice Throughout the 2nd year OTD students also develop skills in leadership, management, entrepreneurship, and scholarship through development and implementation of practice and research projects. Students also focus on expanding their clinical reasoning skills through participation in case- based and simulated client experiences addressing the full breadth of occupational therapy practice. With this supporting base of experience and knowledge students identify and explore an area of OT practice of particular interest to them for advanced study through engagement in the Capstone planning courses. As the second year concludes and the students prepare to initiate their clinical/experiential year they complete their scholarly project and identify potential future sites for their doctoral capstone. In the 3rd year of the OTD program students apply what they have learned in the didactic portion of their education to clinical practice through participation in their Level II fieldwork experiences. Although students are engaged in full time clinical practice, they continue to participate with the academic program through assignments completed as part of the Level II fieldwork and through participation in seminar classes. As part of the fieldwork class students complete periodic journals answering questions posed by the AFWC that ask the students to reflect on their clinical practice and identify how it relates to the academic curriculum and threads of the program. This encourages students to become reflective practitioners who ground their practice in a broad knowledge base. Student also participate in seminar courses and capstone preparation courses that help them prepare for their future doctoral experiential and professional practice. At the conclusion of the Level II fieldwork students have integrated their knowledge and clinical skills and begin the portion of the curriculum that allows them to develop advanced knowledge and understanding in a practice area of their choosing. Throughout the curriculum and capstone development practice students are asked to reflect on how what they know and have learned effects their understanding of OT practice in the experiential site. The curriculum design emphasis reflection as a key part of both learning and professional development. All three phases of the OTD education, didactic, clinical/fieldwork, and experiential are critical in the curriculum achieving its goal of providing occupational therapists with a strong believe in the power of occupation to improve the lives of individuals. 16 References American Occupational Therapy Association, (2018).

Level II fieldwork Please refer to appendix A for level II fieldwork objectives. Fieldwork Syllabi: Please refer to appendices B for Level II syllabi. Level I syllabi are distributed in advance of the beginning of the applicable semester. Scholarships/Aid from Fieldwork Sites Any student who is receiving financial assistance from a future employer in the form of scholarships, signed work agreements, or other resources must INFORM THE AFWC immediately upon signing a contract. Because of the conflict of interest which could arise in situations like these, students will not be allowed to 20 do fieldwork in a center where they have made a commitment to work upon graduation in exchange for financial assistance. Conflict of Interest Students will NOT be placed at a site where a family member may be in a supervisory capacity of the student or student's Fieldwork Educator. A student will not be assigned to a site where he or she has already accepted a job or is negotiating employment. In addition, students are not permitted to do FW placements at sites where they have been previously employed by the Occupational Therapy, Rehabilitation, or related department, or have been a patient. Lastly, students will not be placed at sites where they have volunteered/shadowed extensively. Requests for exceptions to this policy may be submitted, in writing, by the student requesting a particular site. The student should provide the AFWC with a rationale in writing that would justify setting aside this policy. Criminal Background Checks & Fingerprinting Most, if not all, sites are now requiring criminal background checks and/or fingerprinting. Students are responsible for meeting these requirements on their own and in most cases, at their expense. The Division of Occupational Therapy has an affiliation with My Record Tracker, to ensure completion and management of all educational, professional, and personal information for students. Students are responsible for renewing security clearances as necessary to meet the timeline requirements of their assigned fieldwork placements. If doing fieldwork out-of-state, please double check what type of background checks are required by the site. Drug Testing Many sites are requiring drug testing. Students are responsible for meeting this requirement on their own, and in most cases at their expense. Students must be cleared prior to starting the placement. Keep in mind that some results may take several weeks to receive. If your site requires drug testing, please meet with Assistant Director of Clinical Education to obtain information on how to fulfill this requirement. Please double check what TYPE of drug panel your site requires (5 panel, 10 panel, 11 panel screenings etc.). The Division of Occupational Therapy complies with the WVU professional Programs Drug Testing Policy (Appendix C). Professionalism Fieldwork education is a crucial part of professional preparation. The term professionalism means conforming to the standards of a profession. Positive professional behaviors are critical to effective occupational therapy practice. A therapist must adhere to ethical standards, reflect cultural sensitivity, work collaboratively with others, show self-initiative and motivation, and demonstrate therapeutic use of self and competent leadership skills. This thread is addressed throughout the curriculum of West Virginia University. Becoming an occupational therapist encompasses development of clinical as well as professional skills. Communication, receptiveness to feedback, taking initiative, dependability and other interpersonal behaviors are essential learning outcomes of fieldwork and coursework. The Occupational Therapy Program at West Virginia University is a professional program and as occupational therapy 21 students, you are expected to dress and present yourselves in a professional manner at all times. The West Virginia University Student Professional Behavior Policy and the AOTA Code of Ethics apply to all Level I and Level II Fieldwork experiences in addition to the specified behaviors required by the specific clinical sites. As a health professional in training, students should demonstrate appropriate professional behavior during all fieldwork activities. Remember that on fieldwork, students are representing West Virginia University, the Division of Occupational Therapy, the OTD Program, and the profession of occupational therapy. Professional behavior criteria along with OT values and attitudes are outlined in the Occupational Therapy Code of Ethics and Ethics Standards (2020). These include but are not limited to: being punctual for & attending all clinical activities arriving before scheduled time to begin and not asking to leave early notifying fieldwork & AFWC of emergencies and/or illnesses being respectful of others demonstrating appropriate interpersonal communication skills being organized completing assignments (from University and FW site) in a timely manner ask questions but not to challenge the supervisor's authority or competence **Students can be dismissed from Level I/II Fieldwork experiences for inappropriate/ unprofessional behavior, as determined by the FWEd in collaboration with the AFWC. Computer Use Use of fieldwork site computers is restricted to activities associated with client-care unless otherwise instructed by the Fieldwork Educator, such as performing evidenced-based literature research. Under no circumstance should the fieldwork student use the facility-based computer to check his/her personal email, participate in social networking, gaming or access the Internet for personal use. Computers are to be used for fieldwork-related activities only. Social Media & Networking Since online social media and social networking have become one of the options for daily communication with others, it is necessary to clarify professional behavior expectations with its use, especially pertaining to fieldwork education. Social media often crosses traditional boundaries between professional and personal relationships. Therefore, it takes extra vigilance to assure that personal, professional and university reputations are protected. It is important to consider what is posted on the Internet, in addition to adhering to the OT Code of Ethics (AOTA, 2020). The ethical concepts include Beneficence, Nonmaleficence, Confidentiality, Procedural Justice, Veracity, and Fidelity. Adherence of this policy is expected of students in the WVU OT Program. These guidelines are intended to protect the privacy and confidentiality of fellow students, faculty and staff, clinical educators and facility staff, and any clients of a facility. These guidelines may continually change as new social networking tools emerge. Compliance with this policy is expected at all times. 22 Violation of these guidelines will result in disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal from the WVU OT Program. You are responsible for what you post. A posting should never reference (or allude to) a client's name, fieldwork site name, clinical instructor name, criticism about site or information about what is happening, or any other disclosure of confidential material to unauthorized parties in a posting or reference West Virginia University. A posting should never disclose confidential or HIPAA-related information. Sharing this type of information, even unintentionally, can result in legal action against you, WVU, the fieldwork site, and/or the client. It is important to adhere to copyright laws and reference or cite sources appropriately. Plagiarism applies online as well. The content of the posting should be respectful. Consider what you post on ANY social networking site. Many potential employers go to these sites to see what you have posted and often determine if they are interested in having you as an employee. Do not ask your supervisor to \"friend\" you while on Fieldwork. This puts your supervisor and yourself in an awkward situation with personal information about each other. If you mutually decide to do this after the Fieldwork experience, this is your personal choice. Tardiness/Absenteeism Regular attendance and promptness are professional behaviors that facilitate learning and teaching and show respect for one's fieldwork educators, colleagues and peers. Attendance is required for all fieldwork education experiences. Students are expected to arrive to fieldwork prior to the scheduled start time, and to be prepared to begin fieldwork ON-TIME. There are NO designated holidays, vacation days, personal days or sick days/leave during Level II Fieldwork. Therefore, you are NOT entitled to any days off during fieldwork. While the possibility of extraordinary life and/or crisis circumstances is acknowledged, absences from the experiential learning environment causes significant concern regarding clinical and professional skill development and knowledge acquisition as it relates to the integration and utilization of occupational therapy theory and best practice. Acceptance of these extreme circumstances will be determined on a case-by-basis by the AFWC. Personal illness and personal or family (parents, spouse, siblings, and children) emergencies, and death of a family member (including extended family) are the only excused absences. Students must request time off for religious observances from the fieldwork educator in advance and must make up the time. Any requests for time off/variances in schedule to attend conferences, interviews, study for exams, personal appointments, outside employment, weddings/honeymoons, family vacations/ reunions or other personal purposes are NOT considered valid excuses for missing fieldwork and/or alternating start/end dates of experiences. The AFWC must be notified of all planned/unplanned absences. In the event of an illness or emergency, students must notify the fieldwork educator prior to the start of the workday. It is recommended that the student and FWEd exchange phone numbers and for the student to be aware of the attendance policy/call- off procedure of the site. The student must speak with both the FWEd and AFWC. Voicemails and messages are not acceptable forms of communication. Any absences must be reported to the AFWC. This is important due to School/University liability issues. 23 Students are to follow the work schedule established by the clinical facility, not the academic calendar of West Virginia University. Students need to be aware that the hours/schedule may include evenings, weekends, and Holidays. Make-up days for absences on fieldwork are only an option when the missed days are determined excusable (i.e., unplanned emergencies/ circumstances), according to the reasons listed above, and at discretion of the AFWC. The plan for make-up days must be created with permission of, and at the convenience of the Fieldwork Educator, and agreed upon by the AFWC. Therefore, any changes to the fieldwork schedule (including but not limited to start/end date), need approval from the AFWC. It is not permitted that the student/FWEd change the end date if no days are missed or based upon good performance. Please be aware that time missed in the first Level II FW placement may affect the student's ability to begin their second Level II FW placement. If the completion date of the first fieldwork is affected, the student must notify the AFWC to discuss arrangements for the change of the fieldwork start date. Tardiness and absenteeism which is excessive and patterned is not acceptable. Proper documentation may be requested by the University as well as the fieldwork site. Repeated and/or excessive lateness or absence or failure to comply with this stated attendance policy may require repeating or failure of the experience. Holidays During fieldwork the student will follow the holiday schedule established by the placement facility, NOT the academic schedule of the University. Therefore, whatever schedules your fieldwork educator/site requests of you during the Holidays, you are expected to be present and committed to your clinical duties - without exception. School systems and clinics that normally schedule days-off around the Holidays during Level II placements may extend the fieldwork experience and require make-up days, at discretion of the FWEd and AFWC. Inclement Weather Fieldwork sites expect the same attendance from students as they do from their employees. Students should plan appropriately for potential commute delays during inclement weather. Make sure to address bad weather and emergency policies (as they affect attendance) with the fieldwork educator on the first visit/orientation period. Some fieldwork educators may wish to exchange home telephone numbers in case of emergency. Please note that students follow the schedule of the fieldwork site, and NOT University while on fieldwork. Any missed days due to inclement weather MUST be made up. AFWC Monitoring & Site Visits Close communication with the fieldwork sites is vital to the process of fieldwork education (C.1.2; C.1.3). Email is used extensively, along with other methods such as phone, fax, and U.S. mail. The AFWC will communicate with students via WVU email and students should check frequently (at least three times a week) throughout fieldwork experience. In addition, the AFWC will provide all students with phone numbers to use for phone contacts. The AFWC will be available on evenings and weekends for phone contacts as well. 24 The AFWC of West Virginia University works hard to maintain a positive relationship between the University and all affiliated sites. The purpose of site visits and monitoring is multidimensional and may include, but is not limited to: Student performance evaluation Fieldwork site evaluation Fieldwork educator evaluation Assistance with implementation of fieldwork education program Assistance with managing student performance problems Fieldwork educator and staff education and development Site visits can be announced and/or unannounced. On site visits are scheduled whenever possible to assist in this relationship and to ensure that sites are providing students with opportunities that relate to our curriculum. On site visits do not mean that the student is in jeopardy of failing. The AFWC always remains in contact with the FWEd regarding student's progress and performance during fieldwork. Problem areas may be identified by the AFWC, FWEd, student or department faculty. The AFWC shall assist in the problem-solving process of resolving performance issues related to the student, facility, or educational program only after the student and facility have used their appropriate resources. If a site visit is needed, the visit will entail meeting with the student and the Fieldwork Educator both individually and together to discuss the types of learning experiences, strengths and weaknesses of the student's performance and strengths and weaknesses of the student's academic preparation. The discussion will be documented, and appropriate information will be shared with the academic faculty as needed (C.1.1). In many cases, a formal learning contract will be used. Access to Email/Internet on Fieldwork Students will need to have regular access to a computer with internet connection & email outside of fieldwork hours. A Level II FW Sole site has been created. It is the student's responsibility to check site/email on a regular basis to maintain correspondence with AFWC. Your Wet Virginia University personal email account is the official method of communication for all WVU administrative matters. You are required to periodically check your account for time critical notices such as billing notifications, insurance requirements or other important alerts or administrative notices requiring a timely response. Notice will be considered received one day following the date the notice is posted to your email account. Failure to check your email account does not excuse or exempt you from any actions required of you by the University. It is expected that students respond to phone-call or email from AFWC or WVU faculty within 48 hours. Communication/Sole Online Fieldwork Course Website Level I and II Fieldwork courses are maintained electronically via Sole, WVU's on-line teaching system. Through this means, students can access the Fieldwork Manual, syllabi and evaluation forms as needed, along with any other relevant information or forms. The student is highly encouraged to contact the AFWC 25 at the first sign of any concern with the fieldwork placement and/or supervision. Routine communication is encouraged throughout the fieldwork experience (C.1.3). WVU Level I and II Fieldwork Assignments See course syllabus for all WVU OT required assignments/projects on Level I and II Fieldwork. Collaboration of Fieldwork Objectives West Virginia University has established Level II Fieldwork behavioral objectives that are aligned with the competencies within the 37 performance items listed on the AOTA Fieldwork Performance Evaluation. These objectives are communicated to clinical sites in advance of the placement through an electronic fieldwork packet. Prior to the fieldwork experience, sites are encouraged to work collaboratively with the Academic Fieldwork Coordinator to supplement these objectives with site specific objectives, site requirements and assignments as needed. Available site-specific objectives are filed in Sole for students' perusal (C.1.2; C.1.3). If the fieldwork site has site-specific fieldwork objectives, the student is responsible for acknowledging these and turning in a copy of the signed objective sheet to the AFWC. If the site does not have site-specific student objectives, the site must adopt West Virginia University's Level II FW behavioral objectives and acknowledge in Sole assignment. It is encouraged for the student to assist in developing site-specific objectives as a student project if the site does not have any. Cost of Fieldwork Students must be prepared financially to assume ALL costs that will accompany any fieldwork experience. In addition to full university tuition and fees, other expenses may include: transportation, travel, parking, housing, meals, as well as incidental costs such as materials for a special project, uniforms or costs related to clearances/medical requirements. Plan your budget carefully. Given the competition for available sites in the Morgantown area for Fieldwork Level II, all students must be prepared to relocate for a minimum of one of their two 12-week fieldwork rotations. When it is possible, consideration will be made for those students who have special needs. Housing, Transportation and Food Students are responsible for ALL housing needs relating to their fieldwork placements. Therefore, it is important to plan to meet all financial obligations during fieldwork. Tuition as well as travel, living arrangements, commuting/parking costs, and day-to-day personal expenses may be greater than the expenses incurred during an academic semester. On site housing and food stipends are rarely available. Transportation is the sole responsibility of the student. This includes transportation expenses to and from the sites as well as between sites. Some fieldwork sites require students to commute between multiple locations during the fieldwork; therefore, a personal car is necessary during the fieldwork phase of the program. Public transportation is an option for some of our affiliated sites, yet not all. Whenever possible, commutes to fieldwork are limited to approximately 75 minutes, each way. The AFWC works closely with 26 all students to minimize transportation costs & hardships whenever possible. Concerns about transportation and housing are not acceptable reasons for requesting a change in fieldwork assignment as students are given placement information in advance, allowing time for appropriate arrangements to be made. Students can indicate their fieldwork site preferences prior to the fieldwork selection process. However, no fieldwork request can be guaranteed. Employment during Fieldwork With the expense of a graduate education, many students feel the need to work during the school year. West Virginia University Occupational Therapy students are expected to prioritize their responsibilities: class attendance and fieldwork appointments are top priorities. Fieldwork is an extension of the classroom, and is a full-time clinical commitment, not unlike having a full-time job. With this understanding, full-time work is not realistic and can lead to decreased performance in the classroom/clinic, and/or health problems. Reasonable work hours can be incorporated into your schedule; however, you are expected to rearrange your work schedule to accommodate class and fieldwork requirements including allowing adequate time for study. Students are STRONGLY DISCOURAGED from pursuing employment while they are completing full-time fieldwork experiences. It is very common for fieldwork placements to require additional time beyond the regular 40-hour work week, including evening hours and weekend shifts. The focus of fieldwork is on the integration of professional knowledge and behaviors and general clinical skills. In addition, outside readings, reports, studying and/or special projects are often required. Site hours for fieldwork education are not negotiable. The hours of the affiliation are set by the facility. The weekly schedule will be determined by each fieldwork educator and/or site. Some sites require evening or weekend hours. Or you may be expected to work 4 (10 hour) days as required by your fieldwork educator. Some fieldwork educators work different schedules such as Tuesday-Saturday. You are expected to maintain the same work schedule as your fieldwork educator. Any changes to the dates for the fieldwork experience must be approved and documented in writing by the Academic Fieldwork Education Coordinator AND the Fieldwork Educator before the start of the fieldwork experience. Failure of Fieldwork A failed fieldwork experience is a serious concern. Fieldwork education is the opportunity to put academic learning into practice. This applied knowledge and critical thinking are paramount to being a successful occupational therapy practitioner. It is necessary to demonstrate proficiency in both the clinical and academic components of both entry level occupational therapy practice and the professional world of healthcare. The AFWC reserves the right, on behalf of the Department of Occupational Therapy, to assign a grade other than that which is reflected by earned points alone on the FWPE. Justification for doing so could include such things as the failure of the student to maintain and/or provide in a timely fashion proof of health requirements/clearances, evidence of academic misconduct, unethical behavior, or violation of the Division of Occupational Therapy Professional Behavior Policy. Prior to adjusting the grade, the AFWC will consult with the student, the FWEd, Academic Advisor, and/or Program Director as deemed appropriate. In addition, the fieldwork site may terminate a student at any time, whose performance is not competent and threatens the clients' treatment/safety. Terminated failing could also occur if the student violates a 27 facility policy or procedure, the violation of which, if done by an employee of the facility, would cause immediate termination of the employee. Examples include drug use, theft of property, unsafe practice, unprofessional behavior, violation of patients' rights, violation of AOTA Code of Ethics, excessive tardiness/absenteeism or HIPPA violation (such as discussion of a patient in an inappropriate situation) etc..... It is important for students to be familiar with facility policies and procedures, particularly policies related to patient confidentiality. Lastly, depending on the nature of the problem, a student may be withdrawn immediately from the fieldwork site and the occupational therapy program and not provided an additional fieldwork experience. Students have a right to complete a written appeal via processes outlined in the student handbook. Level I Fieldwork Failure A student who fails a Level I Fieldwork experience may be allowed one additional opportunity to complete the experience successfully at the discretion of the academic and professional standards committee, the OTD Program Director and AFWC. If deemed eligible to proceed, a remediation plan and learning contract will be developed and attested to. Then, the student will need to re-register for the Level I Fieldwork course they failed. Level II Fieldwork Failure When a student fails Level II Fieldwork, a second opportunity may be given after a plan of remediation has been successfully completed and/or at the discretion of the academic and professional standards committee, the department OTD Program Director and AFWC. If deemed eligible to continue, the student must repeat the failed experience before beginning the next fieldwork. To repeat the fieldwork experience, he/she must re-register for the same course the following semester, or when a placement is available. The dates and location of the new assignment are dependent on the availability of a placement, but in most cases, this will mean that a student may not be rescheduled for their last rotation until the next academic year. A student cannot proceed with additional coursework until the failed course is passed. If failure occurs a second time, dismissal from the occupational therapy program will be initiated. A student who is failing fieldwork may be asked to leave the fieldwork site before the date on which the assignment ends and still receive a failing grade. Other students may finish the full assignment and still fail. In either case, the decision to be asked to leave or continue in the affiliation is based on an assessment of: 1) The student's difficulties and the individual's potential to remain in the clinical setting without being disruptive to patient/client care 2) The student's response to supervisory feedback 3) The student's potential to change skills, judgments, and professional behaviors in a reasonable amount of time with normal supervision. Withdrawal from fieldwork Like any university course, students can withdraw from fieldwork. Due to this being a professional program with a set curriculum, there is a procedure that needs to be followed. Please refer to the OTD Program Student Handbook for the most up to date information on withdrawing from an OT course. 28 WVU OTD Program Fieldwork Policies and Procedures 29 West Virginia University Division of Occupational Therapy - OTD Program POLICY F1: OTD Program Criteria and Process for Selecting Fieldwork Sites Intended to meet ACOTE standard C.1.2. Policy: Criteria and Process for Selecting and adding fieldwork sites Purpose: To define the process for selecting fieldwork sites Procedure: Initiation of new sites for the OTD Program is generated through various means including requests from the program, site initiation of contracts, and inquiries by students. The academic fieldwork coordinator (AFWC) also networks with alumni and other occupational therapists at state and national conferences to set up contracts in different settings and possibly different states. 1. Justification for new site additions include: a. Demonstrates an alignment with the WVU OTD Program curriculum design and threads b. Offers a specialty area of practice c. Use of the site long term d. Expand the fieldwork areas available to students from outside of WV 2. A verbal confirmation is the first step in adding a contract to the WVU OT program 3. This is followed by an email from the Assistant Director of Clinical Education to obtain all required information to initiate a formal affiliation agreement / contract with the new site. 4. The Assistant Director of Clinical Education then notifies the AFWC when the contract has been signed by the site and the university. 5. The signed contract is then uploaded to the online database and the AFWC can access a copy at any time. 30 West Virginia University Division of Occupational Therapy - OTD Program POLICY F2: Criteria and Process for Maintaining Fieldwork Site Objectives Intended to meet the requirements for ACOTE C.1.2. Policy: Criteria and processes for maintaining fieldwork site objectives will be followed by the OTD Program. Purpose: To define the process for maintaining fieldwork site objectives Procedure: 1. The West Virginia University OTD Program has established Level II Fieldwork behavioral objectives that are aligned with the competencies within the 37 performance items listed on the AOTA Fieldwork Performance Evaluation. 2. Whenever the fieldwork site receives a student confirmation, they check a box to report what objectives they use. 3. If the clinical site does not use the WVU fieldwork objectives, they are directed to send a copy of their site objectives to the AFWC. These objectives are also sent to the clinical sites in advance of the placement through an electronic fieldwork packet. Available site-specific objectives are filed in and posted to the online database for students' perusal. 31 West Virginia University Division of Occupational Therapy - OTD Program POLICY F3: Criteria and Process for Maintaining Fieldwork Agreements/MOUs Intended to meet the requirements for ACOTE standard C.1.2. Policy: Criteria and Process for maintaining fieldwork agreements/MOUs Purpose: To define the process for maintaining fieldwork agreements/MOUs Procedure: 1. A verbal confirmation is the first step in adding a contract to the WVU OT program 2. This is followed by an email from the assistant director of clinical education to get required information to initiate a contract with the new site 3. The assistant director of clinical education will either send the site a WVU human performance contract template or use the fieldwork site's contract 4. Whenever a contract is within 3 months of expiration, the assistant director of clinical education initiates the renewal process for the contract, if the site is agreeable 5. The assistant director of clinical education will then notify the AFWC when a fieldwork site either renews their contract or chooses to cancel 6. The assistant director of clinical education then notifies the AFWC when the contract has been signed by the site and the university. 7. The signed contract is then uploaded to the online database and the AFWC can access a copy at any time 32 West Virginia University Division of Occupational Therapy - OTD Program POLICY F3.1: Fieldwork Objectives Intended to meet the requirements for ACOTE standard C.1.3. POLICY: Guidance to fieldwork educators about WVU OT program expectations while on FW rotations. PURPOSE: To ensure the WVU OT program and fieldwork sites/ supervisors collaborate on use and design of fieldwork objectives. PROCEDURE: 1. Level I and II FW objectives are written to provide guidance on assignments, expectations, and essential skills required. Please refer to each course FW syllabi (see Appendix D&E) for details. 2. WVU OT program FW objectives may be altered as per the needs of the FW site, and/ or FW supervisor(s). Student feedback, faculty discussions regarding curriculum changes, individual student needs may be reasons for changes. 3. Level I fieldwork: 4. Site(s)/supervisor(s) may choose to add additional FW objectives and assignments, but still must follow all written WVU FW objectives as per each syllabus. 5. Level II fieldwork: 1. WVU OT program has written FW objectives in each Level II FW syllabi and Fieldwork Manual. 2. Site(s)/ supervisor(s) may choose to add additional FW objectives and assignments to WVU OT program FW objectives. 3. Sites must identify if they will be using WVU FW objectives or their own site- specific objectives. i. Written documentation of these objectives is required during the FW rotation. ii. The students are required to have their fieldwork educator either sign off on WVU objectives or upload a copy of their site objectives during first week of level II fieldwork. iii. If changes occur with FW site/ supervisor or WVU OT program, the other party will be notified, and documentation will be updated. 33 West Virginia University Division of Occupational Therapy - OTD Program POLICY F4: Process for Maintaining the Secure Electronic Database Intended to meet the requirements for ACOTE standard C.1.2., C.1.3 Policy: Process for maintaining the SOLE (Secure Online Learning Environment) fieldwork database Purpose: To define the process for maintaining the SOLE fieldwork database Procedure: The fieldwork database is utilized to upload information on the fieldwork sites used by the WVU OTD Program. This database is maintained by the AFWC or a designee to remain up to date. The site is located within the WVU Human Performance SOLE website. Information is organized by clinical site and has the following information: 1. Clinical site website (if available) 2. Human resources (HR) requirements 3. Student Evaluation of Fieldwork Experience (SEFWE) 4. Fieldwork data sheet 5. Site objectives, if different than WVU OTD Program Since not all clinical sites are used every year, students are reminded that some information may have changed since the last placement at this site. The AFWC will update the clinic site information after each level II fieldwork is completed to ensure accurate communication with students. 34 West Virginia University Division of Occupational Therapy - OTD Program POLICY F5: Ratio of Fieldwork Educators to Students Intended to meet the requirements for ACOTE standard C.1.4. POLICY: Ensure that the ratio of FW educator to students does not exceed 1:4 for level I FW or 1:2 for level II FW. PURPOSE: Ensure that the ratio of fieldwork educators to students enables proper supervision, and provides protection of consumers, opportunities for appropriate role modeling of occupational therapy practice, and the ability to provide frequent assessment of student progress in achieving stated fieldwork objectives. PROCEDURE: 1. It is the responsibility of the AFWC to ensure that the ratios noted in this policy are adhered. 2. The fieldwork site data form is completed by each fieldwork site. Information is collected on supervisor patterns - including ratio of educator to students. If this information is not provided by the clinical site on the form, the AFWC will follow-up with the site via phone or email to collect the data on supervisory patterns. 3. The site confirmation form asks the site to confirm the fieldwork supervisor(s) for each placement. 4. After the student has begun fieldwork, they complete a survey to verify this information matches the original confirmation. 5. At the conclusion of the fieldwork experience, the student completes the Student Evaluation of FW Experience Form which asks about educator to student ratio. 35 West Virginia University Division of Occupational Therapy - OTD Program POLICY F6: Level I and II Fieldwork Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) Intended to meet the requirements for ACOTE standard C.1.6. POLICY: The program must have evidence of valid memoranda of understanding in effect and signed by both parties from the onset to conclusion of the Level I fieldwork and the Level II fieldwork if it involves an entity outside of the academic program. PURPOSE: To ensure that every student placement is completed in a site with a current contract/MOU. PROCEDURE: 1. Prior to sending confirmations to fieldwork sites the Assistant Director of Clinical education verifies that the site has a current signed contract on file with the university. 2. Contracts are kept in a web-based database that is available to the AFWC at all times. 3. A valid MOU must be signed by both parties and ne in effect from the onset to conclusion of the Level I fieldwork and the Level II fieldwork. 36 West Virginia University Division of Occupational Therapy - OTD Program POLICY F7: OTD Program Policy and Procedure on Fieldwork Educator Qualifications Intended to meet the requirements for ACOTE standard C.1.8 and C.1.11. POLICY: All fieldwork experiences will be supervised by qualified personnel as defined below. PURPOSE: Ensure that personnel who supervise Level I and Level II fieldwork education are informed of the curriculum and fieldwork program design and affirm their ability to support the fieldwork experience. PROCEDURE: Fieldwork education is an essential part of the Occupational Therapy Program at West Virginia University. The occupational therapists and health care facilities participating in the fieldwork program are carefully screened and must share the OTD Program's commitment to excellence in patient care. The fieldwork educators at the level I and level II affiliation sites will meet the qualifications established by the Accreditation Council for Occupational Therapy Education. The AFWC ensures supervision by an occupational therapist or an occupational therapy assistant for traditional fieldworks through a confirmation form. The confirmation for each traditional Level I fieldwork experience requires the site to indicate the fieldwork educator by name, credentials, and their signature as verification for licensure. Prior to beginning fieldwork, an electronic packet is sent to each site containing a syllabus for the course and a copy of the curriculum design. The OTD Program will only schedule students to supervisors who meet the following qualifications: 1. Qualifications for Fieldwork Supervisor for Traditional Level I OT Students A. Level I fieldwork experiences may be supervised by a currently licensed occupational therapist or occupational therapy assistant. B. License must be in good standing with the state licensure board. C. Fieldwork supervisors responsible for educating traditional Level I fieldwork Occupational Therapy Students (OTS) shall be Occupational Therapists (OT) or Certified Occupational Therapy Assistants (COTA) licensed by the state in which they practice and meet their state regulations governing practice. 2. Qualifications for Fieldwork Supervisor for Non-Traditional Level I OT Students A. Level I fieldwork experiences may be supervised by \"qualified personnel\". B. The qualified personnel may include but not limited to: social workers, behavior specialists, counselors, psychologists, teachers, supervisors, and programs managers, etc. 37 3. Qualifications for Fieldwork Supervisor for Level II OT Students A. Level II fieldwork students must be supervised by a currently licensed occupational therapist. B. License must be in good standing with the state licensure board. C. Fieldwork supervisors responsible for educating level II fieldwork occupational therapy students shall be Occupational Therapists (OT), licensed by the state in which they practice, have a minimum of one year of NBCOT licensure, and meet their state regulations governing practice. D. Level II Fieldwork Educators must be adequately prepared to supervise students. Resources will be provided through the WVU OTD Fieldwork Educator Handbook. In addition, the Division of Occupational Therapy will provide annual continuing education for fieldwork educators. These free CEU events are intended to help supervisors become better educated on topics associated with students and fieldwork. 4. Qualifications for Fieldwork Supervisor for Non-Traditional Level II OT Students A. The policy of the WVU OTD Program is that Level II fieldwork only occurs at facilities with qualified, licensed occupational therapists. Qualifications are as outlined above. 5. Screening Process for Fieldwork Educators A. All Fieldwork educators are screened prior to the start of the student's rotation through the licensure verification process. B. License verification is completed prior to the student arrival C. If a fieldwork educator is changed between the AFWC screening the initial therapist and the student's arrival, then the AFWC will re-screen the new fieldwork educator as soon as possible. 38 West Virginia University Division of Occupational Therapy - OTD Program POLICY F8: Level I Fieldwork Distinct from Level II Fieldwork Intended to meet the requirements for ACOTE standard C.1.9. POLICY: It is the policy of the WVU Division of Occupational Therapy, that no part of level one fieldwork will be used to count towards level II fieldwork experience. 39 West Virginia University Division of Occupational Therapy - OTD Program Policy F9: Level 1 Fieldwork Policy on Formal Student Evaluation Intended to meet the requirements for ACOTE standard C.1.9. POLICY: Ensure that all level 1 fieldwork experiences have a formal evaluation component. PURPOSE: Ensure that Level I fieldwork enriches didactic coursework through directed observation and participation in selected aspects of the occupational therapy process and includes mechanisms for formal evaluation of student performance. PROCEDURE: 1. OTH 584 and OTH 586 each have assignments as outlined in the syllabus and are graded on a point scale. 2. OTH 585 utilizes the Philadelphia Region Fieldwork consortium level 1 fieldwork student evaluation. 40 West Virginia University Division of Occupational Therapy - OTD Program Policy F10: Length of Level II Fieldwork Intended to meet the requirements for ACOTE Standard C.1.10 POLICY: Students are required to complete a minimum of 24 weeks full-time Level II fieldwork to graduate. PROCEDURE: Level II fieldwork is completed over two 12-week placements at WVU. The first of these experiences occurs in the summer of their final year in the program (OTH 540), the second 12-week fieldwork (OTH 640) occurs in the fall of the final year. 1. To ensure diverse and varied experiences during the level II fieldwork process, students complete OTH 540 and OTH 640 in different clinical settings. Students may complete Level II fieldwork in one setting if it is reflective of more than one practice area, or in a maximum of four different settings. 2. The WVU OT Program realizes that sometimes extenuating and/ or unpredictable circumstances arise for students, FW Educators, or sites. Each case will be reviewed individually, with the necessary parties, and a solution developed that ensures that the student completes 24 full-time weeks of Level II fieldwork prior to graduation. 3. Due to the need to continue to the capstone experience in the spring of the student's final year, it is not normal procedure for the division of OT to consider a part-time fieldwork option as this would delay progression to the capstone portion of the student's education. However, if the situation does arise, the AFWC and DCC will meet with the student to explore strategies for continuation in the OTD Program. 41 West Virginia University Division of Occupational Therapy - OTD Program Policy F11: Evaluating the Effectiveness of Supervision Intended to meet the requirements for ACOTE standard C.1.12 POLICY: Document a mechanism for evaluating the effectiveness of supervision PROCEDURE: 1. All WVU OT students are required to complete the AOTA SEFWE (Student Evaluation of Fieldwork Experience) by the completion of each Level II fieldwork placement. 2. Students are encouraged to share a copy of this document with each of their fieldwork educators at the fieldwork site. 3. All SEFWEs are reviewed by the AFWC, including the individual ratings of the student regarding their personal fieldwork educator(s). 4. Additional opportunities to evaluate the effectiveness of fieldwork supervision include site visit feedback, student journaling and reflection assignments, student surveys, and informal discussions. 5. Actions related to ineffective student supervision are made collaboratively by the AFWC and OTD Program Director. Such actions may include education related to effective supervision, discontinuation of a particular fieldwork educator, or discontinuation of a fieldwork site. 42 West Virginia University Division of Occupational Therapy - OTD Program Policy F12: Level II Fieldwork Supervision Intended to meet the requirements for ACOTE Standard C.1.13 Policy: Supervision of the WVU OTD Level II fieldwork students should initially be direct and gradually decrease to less direct supervision, as appropriate, depending on the: Competence and confidence of the student Complexity of client needs Number and diversity of clients Role of occupational therapy and related services Licensure requirements of the state in which the fieldwork is taking place Type of practice setting Requirements of the practice setting or facility Payor requirements Procedures: Foundational concepts of OTD student supervision are based upon the following concepts: A. Occupational therapy practitioners often use supervision models that they encountered on their own clinical rotations when in school. The WVU OTD Program recommends that each student be handled differently depending on their needs as well as the needs of the setting and the severity of the client's condition. The Academic Fieldwork Coordinator provides information on multiple different supervision methods to fieldwork educator, but recommends a developmental type approach to supervision. First starting with constant supervision, direction, and guidance. As the student's skills and confidence improve the fieldwork educator can begin to wean down on supervision as appropriate. B. Supervision should also be student centered. Just like when in practice, occupational therapists' strive to be client centered. We believe each student has a unique set of needs and abilities. The fieldwork educator's job is to steer the experience when applicable, but allows the student to take initiative in their own learning. The fieldwork educator provides the student with the tools, guidance, and resources that ultimately can get the student towards a successful experience, however, it is up to the student to use those tools and resources productively. Part of the mission of the WVU OTD Program is to create life long active learners. This holds true in the supervisory relationship as well. Although it is up to the supervisor to create the learning environment on fieldwork, it is also the student's responsibility to take an active part in the process. 43 West Virginia University Division of Occupational Therapy - OTD Program Policy F13: Level II Fieldwork Supervision where no OT exists Intended to meet the requirements for ACOTE standard C.1.14 POLICY: It is the policy of the WVU division of OT not to place Level II fieldwork students in sites without an OT present. PROCEDURE: 1. The AFWC uses the fieldwork site data form and site confirmation form to ensure that a qualified occupational therapist will provide supervision to the OTD student. 2. In cases where a site does not have a qualified OT to serve as the Level II fieldwork supervisor, the site will not be used until the conditions of this policy are met. 3. In cases where a supervisor is not able to continue supervision after the onset of a placement, the AFWC will work with the student to find an alternate site to continue the Level II rotation. 44 West Virginia University Division of Occupational Therapy - OTD Program Policy F14: Level II Fieldwork Evaluation Intended to meet the requirements for ACOTE standard: C.1.15. POLICY: The WVU division of OT will use the standardized electronic evaluation of fieldwork. PROCEDURE: 1. The AOTA FWPE is provided to the Level II Fieldwork Educator through Formstack. The AFWC will enter the email addresses of the primary fieldwork educator and deploy a midterm-evaluation at week 6, and a final evaluation, at week 12. 2. Midterm scores are relayed to the AFWC via a survey on the WVU Secure Online Learning Environment (SOLE). 3. If the score is under 74 at midterm, the AFWC speaks with the fieldwork educator and the student. The student and fieldwork educator develop a written learning contract is developed in collaboration with the AFWC. This learning contract cites specific areas of concern with behavioral objectives that must be met to successfully pass the fieldwork experience. 4. To pass the fieldwork, the final score must be 111 or greater. The grades are then entered into the student's record by the AFWC. 45 West Virginia University Division of Occupational Therapy - OTD Program Policy F15: Fieldwork Supervision Outside the U.S. Intended to meet the requirements for ACOTE standard C.1.16. POLICY: It is the policy of the WVU Division of Occupational Therapy that students will not be placed on Level I or II fieldwork outside of the United States. 46 West Virginia University Division of Occupational Therapy - OTD Program Policy F16: Conflict Resolution Policy During Student Fieldwork Experiences Intended to partially meet ACOTE standards C.1.13 Policy: The West Virginia University OTD Program has a process for facilitating resolution of conflict involving students participating in fieldwork experiences. Procedure: Should a conflict arise during the student's performance in the clinical setting, the following steps for resolution should be followed: 1. The student and the Fieldwork Educator should try to resolve the conflict. 2. If the conflict is unable to be resolved, the Clinical Instructor should approach the site's coordinator for fieldwork education for intervention. 3. The clinical site coordinator for fieldwork education should serve as an objective third party in his/her observation of the student/CI relationship and make recommendations for possible positive solutions to the situation. 4. If the conflict is judged by the fieldwork educator and/or the coordinator for fieldwork education to be a more serious matter, the fieldwork educator and/or coordinator for fieldwork education should contact the OTD Program immediately and apprise the Academic Fieldwork Coordinator of the situation. The AFWC will then take action based on the information provided. 5. At any point in the process, the student, fieldwork educator or coordinator of fieldwork education may contact the AFWC to assist with strategies to help facilitate a successful resolution. When a problem situation arises, whether it is due to a conflict in professional behaviors or decreased performance expectations, the most likely sequence of events will be as follows: 1. The AFWC will talk to the student and the fieldwork educator separately to get each individual's account of the problem. 2. The AFWC may schedule a time to come to the clinic to discuss the situation further with all parties involved 3. The AFWC will meet or speak individually with the student, the fieldwork educator and/or the coordinator of fieldwork education, if indicated, and make recommendations for possible resolutions. 4. If indicated, the AFWC will then meet with all parties involved in a joint meeting to help define concrete actions that will be taken. 47 5. A written plan of action will be generated and specific timelines for completion will be agreed to by all parties involved (student, fieldwork educator, coordinator of fieldwork education, AFWC). 6. The AFWC will remain involved for as long a period as necessary and will go to the site as necessary to ensure resolution of the situation. 7. If the conflict cannot be resolved, or if the student has violated the law or the AOTA Code of Ethics, the student will be removed from the clinic immediately and dealt with in accordance with applicable program and West Virginia University policies. 8. If the conflict is judged by the AFWC to be a personality or professional behavior issue and if intervention has not been successful, the student will be removed from the clinical setting and referred to the WVU OTD Program Academic and Professional Standards Committee. If, following that process, it is determined that the student is able to successfully remediate, they will be reassigned to another clinical site. 9. Students who have been removed from the clinic, for knowledge or skill deficits, will be referred to the WVU OTD Program Academic and Professional Standards Committee. If, following that process, it is determined that the student is able to successfully remediate, they will be required to formulate and carry out a remediation plan in collaboration with the AFWC. The plan may call for the student to participate in a variety of activities such as reading the literature, working with the program faculty on case studies, practicing techniques, etc. 48 Appendices 49 APPENDIX A LEVEL II FIELDWORK OBJECTIVES West Virginia University OTD Program Level II Fieldwork Objectives Upon completion of this 12-week, full-time Level II fieldwork rotation, the student will be able to successfully: I.

Students will be placed in facilities where individualized instruction can occur. (Course will be graded P/F.) Course Description: OTH 540 Level II fieldwork rotation represents the first full-time, long term clinical placement in the occupational therapy curriculum. The length of this clinical rotation is twelve weeks; there is some variation as to how the 12 weeks can be structured. Instructional methods consist of demonstration and individual assignments as per the clinical fieldwork instructor. By the end of the rotation, students should have successfully completed the clinical education goals /objectives of the program and their specific site. Clinical education goals and objectives are developed by the site or through the academic fieldwork program and carried out in collaboration with clinical site supervisors. The clinical education process allows the students to practice and refine both professional and clinical skills. Students practice under the supervision of a licensed qualified occupational therapist in a qualified practice setting, which may include but are not limited to hospitals, home health agencies, nursing homes, schools, or outpatient clinics.

However, in order to effectively prepare for this rotation students may need to refer to class notes and textbooks from prior classes. Students are responsible for providing texts that may be necessary for the rotation that were included in the didactic portion of the educational program. Students should not expect the fieldwork site to provide copy of textbooks. Course Learning Objectives Please refer to the WVU OT Level 2 student objectives on SOLE Fieldwork Course Goals: The goal of the fieldwork process is to provide integration of classroom knowledge, attitudes, and professional development with the skills and attitudes and professionalism needed to practice occupational therapy. Upon successful completion of the fieldwork experiences, the occupational therapy student will perform at or above the minimum entry level expected of the occupational therapy professional. \"Graduating therapists are increasingly expected to take on expanded responsibilities, assume leadership roles, and be active participants not only as service providers but as decision makers as well.\" (ACOTE) The student will be able to assess client adaptive behaviors and occupational performance as they relate to the client's life expectations. The student will implement and supervise treatment programs for improving and/or maintaining occupational performance and adaptive responses throughout the life span. The student will demonstrate entry-level ability in administration, supervision, consultation, and application of research to practice. ACOTE Standards for Doctoral Degree Level Education: This class addresses in full or part (italicized) the following standards for OTD education. ACOTE Standards for Doctoral Degree Level Education: C.1.1. Ensure that the fieldwork program reflects the sequence and scope of content in the curriculum design, in collaboration with faculty, so that fieldwork experiences in traditional, nontraditional, and emerging settings strengthen the ties between didactic and fieldwork education. (Reflection Assignment) C.1.3. Document that academic and fieldwork educators agree on established fieldwork objectives prior to the start of the fieldwork experience and communicate with the student and fieldwork educator about progress and performance throughout the fieldwork experience. Ensure that fieldwork objectives for all experiences include a psychosocial objective. (Objectives assignment) 61 C.1.7 At least one fieldwork experience (either Level I or Level II) must address practice in behavioral health, or psychological and social factors influencing engagement in occupation. C.1.10. Require a minimum of 24 weeks' full-time Level II fieldwork. This may be completed on a part-time basis, as defined by the fieldwork placement in accordance with the fieldwork placement's usual and customary personnel policies, as long as it is at least 50% of an FTE at that site. The student can complete Level II fieldwork in a minimum of one setting if it is reflective of more than one practice area, or in a maximum of four different settings. C.1.11. Document and verify that the student is supervised by a currently licensed or otherwise regulated occupational therapist who has a minimum of 1 year full-time (or its equivalent) of practice experience as a licensed or otherwise regulated occupational therapist prior to the onset of the Level II fieldwork. C.1.12 Document a mechanism for evaluating the effectiveness of supervision (e.g., student evaluation of fieldwork) and for providing resources for enhancing supervision (e.g., materials on supervisory skills, continuing education opportunities, articles on theory and practice). (AOTA SEFWE) C.1.13. Ensure that Level II fieldwork supervision is direct and then decreases to less direct supervision as appropriate for the setting, the severity of the client's condition, and the ability of the student to support progression toward entry-level competence. C.1.15 Document mechanisms for requiring formal evaluation of student performance on Level II fieldwork (e.g., the AOTA Fieldwork Performance Evaluation for the Occupational Therapy Student or equivalent). (AOTA FWPE) Assessment Major Assignments/Assessments: Grading OTH 540 is given a grade of Pass or Fail in accordance with University grading policy for clinical sites. The student is evaluated at mid-term and at finals. The AOTA Fieldwork Performance Evaluation (FWPE) is currently used to measure student's clinical performance. One FWPE is used for both mid-term and final evaluation of the student, refer to FWPE for details. The complete FWPE and SEFWE must be received by the academic fieldwork coordinator in the electronic system prior to a grade be issued. If the documents are not received before final grades are due the student will receive an \"I\" for a course grade. This may delay the student's graduation. Students must have a performance score of 85 or greater to successfully pass midterm. 62 A score of 84 or below at midterm requires to student to complete a learning plan with their fieldwork educator and the AFWC in order to be successful. The student is required to contact the AFWC within 24 hrs. of receiving their score with information on their learning plan. Students must obtain at least a score of '3' on Items 1, 2, and 3 on the FWPE and a total performance score of 111 to pass the fieldwork experience. A student that obtains a final score of 111 or above but does not score at least a '3' on those three items will receive a Fail for the fieldwork course. This is a national expectation set by the Accreditation council for Occupational Therapy Education and cannot be over-ruled by the course instructor and/or the AFWC. Assignments: Week What is due?

All of the U.S. Text HELP to 741741 APPENDIX C - Drug Screening Policy West Virginia University - OTD Program Professional and Undergraduate Programs Drug Screen Policy Academic programs at the Health Sciences Center have an obligation to protect the public and to respect students' privacy rights. Accordingly, this policy is designed to balance those interests. Students involved in direct patient care or handling prescription medications as part of clinical rotations who are under the influence of alcohol or drugs may put patients' safety at risk. Students are not permitted to unlawfully possess or use illegal drugs, prescription drugs, over-the-counter drugs, or alcohol while participating in direct patient care or handling prescription medications as part of the academic program. Prohibited substances include amphetamines, benzodiazepines, cocaine, phencyclidine, and propoxyphene. It is the responsibility of every student to be aware of the risks associated with alcohol use and abuse. Students are required to conduct themselves in accordance with School and University policies, and federal, state and local laws regarding alcohol consumption. It should be understood that possession or consumption of alcoholic beverages by individuals under the age of 21 is a violation of state liquor laws. Likewise, it is illegal for anyone to provide alcoholic beverages to persons under the age of 21. Students are permitted to take medications that may affect urine drug screen results, when legally prescribed to the student. Students taking legally prescribed medications that may affect urine drug screen results or that may impair their alertness or cognition must notify their academic program and provide appropriate documentation as described in the Legally Prescribed Medication section. Students may not be under the influence of alcohol while performing patient care duties or handling prescription medication. Initial Drug Screening All students will undergo a urine drug screen prior to matriculation or the initiation of the first clinical experience in their program. The Assistant Director of Clinical Education for Professional and Undergraduate Programs will provide students with instructions for contacting Certiphi Screening via a secure website to make arrangements and pay for the drug screening. The Assistant Director of Clinical Education for Professional and Undergraduate Programs will have access to Certiphi inquiry results via a secure website with a unique username and password. The Assistant Director of Clinical Education for Professional and Undergraduate Programs will prepare a report on any positive results of drug testing for review by the Vice Dean for Professional and Undergraduate Programs. The Vice Dean will review and initial the drug screen reports. Additional Drug Screening Students may be required to undergo repeat drug screening whenever such testing is required by program on an annual basis or required by a clinical site. At the discretion of the program's committee on academic standards, students may also be required to undergo drug screening for reasonable suspicion, such as direct observation of an individual engaging in drug-related activity; direct observation of the individual demonstrating physical symptoms of being under the influence; a pattern of erratic behavior; conviction of a drug-related offense; sudden change in performance, including excessive absenteeism; or information received from a credible source (note: student reports of an individual's drug use must have other substantiation to meet the standard for reasonable suspicion). Any additional drug screening will be done at the student's expense. Prior to beginning each clinical rotation, the student will be notified if an additional drug screen is required by the site and will receive instructions for completion of the testing. Students are responsible for contacting Certiphi to make arrangements and pay for the drug screen. When repeat drug screen is required, the student will not be permitted to begin the clinical rotation until the drug screen result is available. It is the student's responsibility to ensure that drug testing is completed in a timely manner. Upon request, the student will provide access to his or her drug screen result from the Certiphi site to the clinical education site. Negative Dilute Drug Screen In the event of a negative dilute drug screen, the student will be required to repeat the drug screen at their own expense. In the event of two consecutive negative dilute drug screens, it will be considered a positive result. Positive Drug Screen In the event of a positive drug screen, the Vice Dean will refer the case to the program's committee on academic standards for consideration and recommendations. In the interim, student may be subject to temporary administrative removal from clinical site while the committee meets. Following review by the program's committee on academic standards, students with a positive drug screen not due to a legally prescribed medication may be subject to one or more of the following penalties: Placement on program probation Deceleration (required repetition of a portion of the didactic or clinical phase of the program) with a delay in graduation Dismissal from the program Students with a positive drug screen not due to a legally prescribed medication will be referred for counseling and/or a provider support program within one week of the notification of the positive drug screen result. A student's return to academic studies is contingent upon full compliance with the recommended counseling and/or provider support program. Documentation of successful completion and/or continued compliance with the counseling/support program will be maintained in the student's permanent program record. WVU's Student Assistance Program (SAP) offers drug and alcohol counseling for students. Student should contact the Carruth Center at 304-293-4431 to schedule an appointment. Legally Prescribed Medication In cases where a legally prescribed medication results in a positive drug test, the student must follow the process outlined by Certiphi to provide appropriate documentation.
