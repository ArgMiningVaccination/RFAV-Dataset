CONTEXT AND NATURE OF VISIT A. Purpose of Visit An 11-member review team (hereafter: Team) conducted a standard comprehensive evaluation visit for continued accreditation of Colorado State University (CSU). The visit did not include any Change Requests or other special reviews. B. Institutional Context Like almost all public colleges and universities in the United States, CSU experienced declining state financial resources during the recession that began in 2008, resulting in reductions in expenditures and increases in tuition. Also like all of higher education, the University experienced a rapidly changing social, political and technological environment during the past ten years, including dramatic growth in various forms of online education. Finally, the University experienced a change in presidents and other senior leadership since the last comprehensive review. C. Unique Aspects or Additions to the Visit There were no unique aspects or additions to this visit. D. Additional Locations or Branch Campuses Visited (if applicable) No additional locations or branch campuses were visited. E. Distance Delivery Reviewed The Team reviewed the University's distance courses and programs, including courses and programs offered online and found that such courses and programs have the same expectations, learning outcomes, and undergo the same review process and by the same committees as those offered in the traditional face-to-face modality. The evaluation Team reviewed and compared syllabi of undergraduate, graduate and professional degree programs of both online and traditional formats in various disciplines and found them to be comparable. II. COMMITMENT TO PEER REVIEW A. Comprehensiveness of the Self-Study Process The Self-Study process at CSU was led by a Leadership Team appointed by the President. The process was comprehensive and engaged a broad and diverse community of faculty, administrators, and staff. The Self-Study process was designed to fit within the University's existing quality improvement structures and processes and to complement the institution's strategic planning processes. B. Integrity of the Self-Study Report The Self-Study Report was thorough and addressed all of the HLC Criteria and their various Components and Subcomponents as well as all 10 areas of Federal Compliance. The visiting Team found consistency, and thus integrity, between the PEAQ Comprehensive Evaluation Report Colorado State University Version 2.0 2013 5 11/20/13 information contained in the Self-Study Report and the information gathered onsite during the visit. The Team found the Self-Study Report and numerous attachments, via embedded links, to be forthright. The close relationship between institutional strategic planning and the self-study process ensured that the range of individuals with whom the Team spoke were familiar with and invested in the HLC review process. C. Adequacy of Progress in Addressing Previously Identified Challenges The 2004 evaluation team identified several areas that needed CSU's attention, including, for example, research, resources, compensation, faculty diversity, efficiency in technology services, among others. None of these challenges, however, rose to the level of requiring follow-up reports or HLC action of any type. The only area that required a follow-up Progress Report was the Library, where three specific issues were identified: inadequate collections budget; inadequate space; and eroded purchasing power. The required follow-up report on the Libraries, specifically documenting how these three issues had been addressed, was submitted by CSU in 2006 and was subsequently reviewed and accepted by HLC. Since then, CSU has undertaken additional initiatives to enhance its Libraries. The current visiting team found that CSU made adequate progress in addressing the previously identified challenges, although less progress was made in some areas (compensation for administrative professionals in Extension and faculty diversity) than in others. D. Notification of Evaluation Visit and Solicitation of Third-Party Comment The University informed both the internal and larger community of the HLC evaluation through various and appropriate means. Prior to arriving onsite, the visiting Team was informed by HLC that no third-part comments were submitted. III. COMPLIANCE WITH FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS CSU is in compliance with Federal Requirements. See Appendix C for details. IV. FULFILLMENT OF THE CRITERIA FOR ACCREDITATION CRITERION ONE: MISSION. The institution's mission is clear and articulated publicly; it guides the institution's operations. Core Component 1A: The institution's mission is broadly understood within the institution and guides its operations. Subcomponent 1. The mission statement is developed through a process suited to the nature and culture of the institution and is adopted by the governing board. Subcomponent 2. The institution's academic programs, student support services, and enrollment profile are consistent with its stated mission. PEAQ Comprehensive Evaluation Report Colorado State University Version 2.0 2013 6 11/20/13 Subcomponent 3. The institution's planning and budgeting priorities align with and support the mission. Team Determination: _X_ Core Component is met __ Core Component is met with concerns __ Core Component is not met Evidence: A strategic mission statement is developed through collaboration between the Board and the President, in consultation with faculty and the student leadership. Through these discussions and drafting a Strategic Plan in 2006, CSU develops actions in support of its mission. Considerations of the addition, discontinuation or modification of programs assure alignment with the institutional mission. For example, hundreds of curricular course changes and an average of four new degree programs are approved each year through processes aligned with the strategic plan and institutional mission. Several Presidential Cabinet-level changes were made in recent years to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of institutional administration. The University recognized a need for consolidated oversight of policies and compliance, establishing the Office of Policy and Compliance (OPC); the Director reports to the Vice President for University Operations. OPC is responsible for researching, drafting and facilitating the approval process for a range of University policy documents and works with administrative and academic units to review compliance. CSU has selective admissions standards requiring that most students admitted should have a 101 index or above (a sliding-scale combination of GPA or class rank with the ACT or SAT scores). In support of creating a diverse student body, CSU also admits students below 101, provided that number does not exceed 20% as part of a state-wide aggregation of all baccalaureate institutions. These practices result in a University headcount enrollment of >30,000 (>26,000 are residents) and an incoming class of ~4,500. The campus offers a climate that is designed to welcome, encourage and embrace differences, creating an environment where all community members are recognized and valued. A retention working group (A Plan for Excellence: Enhancing Undergraduate Education and Student Success) evaluated the current status of student retention and graduation rates and developed recommendations for improvement. In addition to continued growth in student headcount, the University plans to achieve 60% 4-year graduation and 80% 6-year graduation success, improving from the current 41% and 65%, respectively (see 4.C). The report's recommendations, also known as the Student Success Initiatives (SSI), rely on three elements: (1) Create opportunities for exceptional educational experiences across the breadth of the University; (2) create a community-wide culture of high expectations for student involvement and success; and (3) require data-driven planning and administration. CSU appropriately allocates the revenues it receives to support the education, research and public service missions of the institution (see Financial Accountability Report), which steadily increased over the past years. For example, over the past five years the University's total operating expenses have increased from $618.5 PEAQ Comprehensive Evaluation Report Colorado State University Version 2.0 2013 7 11/20/13 million to $765.1 million, representing an overall increase of 24%. However, budgetary constraints limit the support and implementation of many programs that support the University's broader mission. Recognizing today's responsibilities to environmental issues and sustainability, CSU's Climate Action Plan presents short-term, medium-term and long-term strategies to enable facilities and operations to support sustainability and master planning and campus beautification, within a meritorious framework of climate neutrality. Core Component 1B: The mission is articulated publicly. Subcomponent 1. The institution clearly articulates its mission through one or more public documents, such as statements of purpose, vision, values, goals, plans, or institutional priorities. Subcomponent 2. The mission document or documents are current and explain the extent of the institution's emphasis on the various aspects of its mission, such as instruction, scholarship, research, application of research, creative works, clinical service, public service, economic development, and religious or cultural purpose. Subcomponent 3. The mission document or documents identify the nature, scope, and intended constituents of the higher education programs and services the institution provides. Team Determination: _X_ Core Component is met __ Core Component is met with concerns __ Core Component is not met Evidence: CSU's Vision, Mission and Values Statement is prominently publicized on the institutional website and in key publications such as the General Catalog. Based on targeted searches and random walk of the University web site, the Team found that the material is readily accessed by constituents within and outside the institution, as well as through dedicated websites of the Office of the President, Accountability and the CSU System. CSU's Vision, Mission and Values Statement was formally reaffirmed in 2006 by the Board. In particular, the Strategic Plan outlines the University's major priorities within the mission. The institution has a regular schedule for periodic updates of the Strategic Plan to reflect new priorities, emerging opportunities and novel approaches. Administrative divisions, colleges, departments and other units are encouraged to develop detailed courses of action in respective unit plans that support the University's strategic plan and its mission. Strategic planning processes are used toward continuous quality improvement structures. Strategic Plan Area Review Committees (SPARCs) are aligned with specific goals in the Strategic Plan. Whereas there are budgetary components, the SPARCs are also used toward valued-added issues and opportunities for inter-connectiveness. SPARCs have campus-wide membership that is representative of all constituent groups and includes key administration as leads. The outcomes are shared with relevant communities in the form of campus presentations during, what are called, \"SPARCfests.\" Budgetary realities limit the ability to respond to meritorious SPARC-based proposals. PEAQ Comprehensive Evaluation Report Colorado State University Version 2.0 2013 8 11/20/13 The mission of CSU states that it will deliver a \"comprehensive array of baccalaureate, master's and doctoral degree programs.\" The nature and scope of this University-level statement are fully reflected in the colleges, departments and other academic units through their respective missions and practices. Campus interactions with groups and individuals affirmed the University's educational mission. Core Component 1C: The institution understands the relationship between its mission and the diversity of society. Subcomponent 1. The institution addresses its role in a multicultural society. Subcomponent 2. The institution's processes and activities reflect attention to human diversity as appropriate within its mission and for the constituencies it serves. Team Determination: _X_ Core Component is met __ Core Component is met with concerns __ Core Component is not met Evidence: CSU has shown a commitment to diversity by focusing on recruitment, retention and graduation of a diverse population of students as supported by its mission and as found in its Strategic Plan, Area 5 - Diversity. The Strategic Plan item 35.3.b. states that there should be an increase in student support funding for programs related to diversity. This is supported by the expansion of a half-time position into a full-time position for the Vice President for Diversity and by redefining another position for Director of Diversity Education and Training. While there is evidence of some increased activity, further evidence on financial increases was not found. The new Vice President for Diversity was hired full-time in order to increase campus diversity and to coordinate the various activities leading to the success of underrepresented students. Students from underrepresented ethnic or racial groups increased from 11.4% in 2003 to 15.6% in 2012. The proportion of low-income undergraduate students with Pell Grants went from 16.4% in 2008 to 24.5% in 2011. Students from first-generation households make up almost a quarter of the new freshman cohort. Support services for first-generation and low-income students are provided through the Academic Advancement Center which provides such services as tutoring, academic coaching and connection with the TILT Center and other campus resources. There is an Admissions Advisory Committee, made up of representatives from all colleges, that works with the Office of Admissions to increase diversity by consulting with the various departments. Various events have been sponsored by the University to enhance the diversity of the campus. For example, in 2011 there was a Diversity symposium that engaged 1,747 participants and in 2012 two receptions for multicultural staff and faculty were offered. A University Diversity website was developed and implemented in 2012 that includes a section to highlight research and scholarship of diverse faculty. There exists a consultation team to investigate incidents of bias and a committee on assessment and campus climate. The Graduate School has sponsored diversity grants to support travel of faculty to recruit underrepresented students. PEAQ Comprehensive Evaluation Report Colorado State University Version 2.0 2013 9 11/20/13 The Diversity SPARC Report outlines internal performance assessment, program initiatives and rationale behind budget requests. By defining campus climate as being inclusive of all faculty, staff and students, it strives to establish a milieu where each person is valued and affirmed. The Diversity SPARC Report has recommended activities and funding for a number of initiatives to enhance diversity. The Teams campus interviews substantiated the implementation of several programs advocated by the SPARC. It is also clear that the various SPARCS work with each other and create synergy. CSU considers its internationalization objectives as an integral part of the effort to increase diversity and is stated as such in the University's Strategic Plan. Its Internationalization Plan states that the guiding principle for CSU's international strategy should be \"Critical Choices for a Critical Century: Matching the Land-Grant University to a Global Mission.\" The paper challenges the University to establish approximately 20 \"key institutional partnerships\" in the world which include four major regions. Interviews with staff noted that the University currently has key partnerships with 17 countries, including five Chinese universities and others such as Costa Rica, Ethiopia, Germany, India, Kenya, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Russia, and Vietnam. The University also encourages education abroad experiences for its domestic students with nearly 750 students studying abroad last year in credit bearing programs. In 2012 the University began a collaboration called INTO Colorado State University to further increase international student enrollment. The program includes English language training and personalized support for international students. A new international study center and the Pathway Program helps international students adapt to the U.S. university culture. A plan to increase diversity among employees is evident although further improvement is desirable. The Strategic Plan contains various items relating to increasing diversity among employees. Towards this end an employee climate survey was completed in 2012 to establish a baseline that will later help administration gauge the University's progress. Within that survey, when asked what has had the greatest impact in regard to diversity, 44% of the respondents identified working or interacting with a diverse individual. The diversity of the faculty has climbed from 12.2% in 2009 to 14.5% in 2012, with women faculty comprising 34.7% of the tenure-track positions. The percent of minority faculty, as new hires, matches that of all faculty hires on campus, thus creating only limited progress in this area. However, various activities are underway to boost diversity among this group, including focus groups examining barriers and orientation sessions that discuss establishing a more welcome atmosphere. It was reported during the visit that there is special emphasis on recruiting minority individuals during each search. The University engages with the community to help students develop college aspirations and readiness through work with middle and high schools. Much of this activity includes such programs as TRIO, the Bridge Scholarship Program, the Alliance Partnership, the Reach Out - CSU Program, and the Dream Project. Accessibility for diverse populations is enhanced through the Native American Legacy Awards, the College Horizons Program, the Commitment to Colorado Program, the TRIO programs such as Upward Bound, Talent Search, and Educational Opportunity Programs. Additional opportunities exist through the Daniels PEAQ Comprehensive Evaluation Report Colorado State University Version 2.0 2013 10 11/20/13 Fund, the Denver Scholarship Foundation, and Gear UP to serve underrepresented students. Diverse students are supported through a Hispanic Alumni interest group and a Black Alumni group. Support services include extensive programs provided by the Asian/Pacific Cultural Center, the Black/African American Culture Center, El Centro for Latino/a students, the GLBTQQA relating to gender issues, the Native American Cultural Center, the Women and Gender Advocacy Center and the Resources for Disabled Students Center. A Multicultural Student Advisory Committee serves the President and includes representatives from various sectors relating to multicultural issues. The University currently has a 65% 6-year graduation rate and a 41% 4-year graduation rate for undergraduate students. A student success initiative has been launched with the goal of achieving 80% and 60%, respectively, by utilizing all-University initiatives followed later with departmental initiatives. Graduation of master's students is generally between the mid to upper 70% range and is in alignment with national norms. Graduation of doctoral students is generally between the mid 50% and lower 60% range and again is within standard national norms. Gender equity has been recognized as an area of dissatisfaction among the faculty with the number of women holding leadership positions decreasing and discrepancies found in compensation between men and women. However, to address these issues a new initiative to further improvements for women is underway. The President has expressed a desire to advance equity in salaries for women faculty and administrative professionals. It was reported that gender equity increases are considered, and those who feel discriminated against are able to submit a form documenting the inequity. Core Component 1D: The institution's mission demonstrates commitment to the public good. Subcomponent 1. Actions and decisions reflect an understanding that in its educational role the institution serves the public, not solely the institution, and thus entails a public obligation. Subcomponent 2. The institution's educational responsibilities take primacy over other purposes, such as generating financial returns for investors, contributing to a related or parent organization, or supporting external interests. Subcomponent 3. The institution engages with its identified external constituencies and communities of interest and responds to their needs as its mission and capacity allow. Team Determination: _X_ Core Component is met __ Core Component is met with concerns __ Core Component is not met Evidence: The university states that it does not generate funding for other entities except to support the operations of the Board. Any expenditure that is provided to other entities, other than membership dues, must be approved by the Board. PEAQ Comprehensive Evaluation Report Colorado State University Version 2.0 2013 11 11/20/13 The Annual Research Reports and the economic impact report give credence to the statement that the University engages with its identified external constituencies and communities. In 2012, the University reported research expenditures of $376 million dollars. According to the economic impact report, the University through its alumni is responsible for generating greatly to the revenue collected by Colorado. It directly employs 6200 persons and supports over 13,000 jobs within the State. Recent spin-off companies have created approximately 550 new jobs in Colorado. The University engages with the community through various extension and outreach activities. Through 17 district offices of the Colorado State Forest Service, CSU provides information and technical assistance on forest management, wildfire protection urban and community forestry and conservation. The Colorado Forest Restoration Institute serves to bridge the efforts of researchers, land managers and communities in the Rocky Mountain region in regard to forest restoration and wildfire hazard reduction. An example of the University's impact has been a focus on assisting communities with restoration after the recent forest fires. Agricultural issues are addressed by the Colorado Agricultural Experiment Station through site specific research at its eight research centers. An example of the impact of these centers includes assisting the State identify the source of the recent Listeria outbreak by working with the local community in the southeast corner of the State. The Colorado Water Institute provides water expertise on water conditions experienced by the population. An example of the impact of this unit is indicated by the Institute's response to the September 11, 2013 three-day flood when it provided citizens information about the effects of the flood on drinking water, waste water, animals and crops. CSU Extension is one of the four focal points relating to the mission of the University. The Extension programs have relationships with colleges and counties to help address area, regional, and state issues through education of the public. The President reported that in the first five years following the most recent comprehensive accreditation review, little emphasis was placed on supporting the Extension programs, but the last five years has seen a resurgence of interest in such programs. Graduate students are often involved in research projects initiated by Extensions services. Interviews during the Team visit identified major activities occurring in Extension, but also identified budget cuts to the Extension programs. Conversations with a member of the Board of Governors verified the importance of the Extension programs to Colorado. Every year the University works with K-14 schools through the Alliance Partnership Program in 10 high schools. Enrollment in this program increased from 49 in 2007 to 77 in 2011. CSU also operates the STEM Center offering a summer STEM camp for students and a Culture of Care program to help prepare future STEM teachers. The STEM Center staff have worked to create professional development outreach programs including physics education and curriculum evaluation and innovation. The use of sustainable natural resources is taught through the Environmental Learning Center. The Division of Continuing Education offers noncredit courses for personal and professional growth developing such offerings as Project Management, Regulatory Affairs and grant supported courses. The Osher Lifelong Learning Institute provides PEAQ Comprehensive Evaluation Report Colorado State University Version 2.0 2013 12 11/20/13 continuing education for adults aged 50 and above. The Colorado Agricultural Experiment Station takes new technologies and methodologies from its research programs and transfers them to the agricultural industries of the state, impacting the wheat, potato and onion crops. The Station also connects the University's expertise with the region. It interacts with producers and, through its field days, has individuals come onto stations and interact with scientists. Many external constituencies are enhanced through the Centers, Institutes and Other Special Units within CSU. Some of these entities include the Little Shop of Physics (providing K-12 hands-on experiments), the Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratories (conducting tests on samples), the James L. Voss Veterinary Teaching Hospital (serving animal patients), and the Math-Science-Tech Day (on-campus activities). More than 45 Ram Networks engage CSU alumni in their communities through communications and involvement. Team Determination on Criterion One: _X_ Criterion is met __ Criterion is met with concerns __ Criterion is not met Summary Statement on Criterion: CSU offers a range of documents and webpostings on mission, goals and institutional values that are clear, consistent and available publicly. The mission's connection to the state of Colorado is particularly well articulated and fully embraced by the University community. It aligns with state priorities and directions. The University recognizes the value of a diverse community and supports a range of offices and activities that serve minority and other underrepresented groups. While using a broad definition of diversity, CSU still continues to struggle with the creation of a more diverse faculty, and to some extent, a student cohort, which, in part, reflects difficult budgetary constraints and institutional visibility beyond the state. The University has a range of ongoing and well-coordinated educational activities, multicultural events and partnerships with the local community, has a very strong working relationships with the state of Colorado and is developing a growing international dimension. The Team concludes that there is ample evidence that documents that the institution's mission is clear, articulated publicly and that it guides the University's operations and planning. CRITERION TWO: Integrity: Ethical and Responsible Conduct. The institution acts with integrity; its conduct is ethical and responsible. Core Component 2A: The institution operates with integrity in its financial, academic, personnel, and auxiliary functions; it establishes and follows fair and ethical policies and processes for its governing board, administration, faculty, and staff. Team Determination: _X_ Core Component is met PEAQ Comprehensive Evaluation Report Colorado State University Version 2.0 2013 13 11/20/13 __ Core Component is met with concerns __ Core Component is not met Evidence: CSU's commitment to operating with integrity can be seen through its extensive and well-developed set of explicit policies and procedures that relate to all members of the campus community. Existing policies are examined for continued relevance, revised as necessary, and then collected into a policy library that is easily found on the campus website. Policy development is both proactive and reactive. The office of Policy and Compliance is vigilant in addressing new areas of needed attention. The process of creating new policies is transparent and faculty and effected parties are involved throughout the policy creation and review process. All policies are reviewed on a regular schedule and revised as necessary. CSU monitors its integrity through several means, including both internal (e.g., Office of Policy and Compliance and the Research Integrity and Review Office) and external (e.g., audits) structures. The CSU's Student Conduct Code sets clear expectations for students, and the University offers protections in the form of appeals and hearings to assure that students are treated fairly when infractions occur. The University's commitment to operating with integrity is also demonstrated through the avenues it provides its students and employees to address conflicts and grievances. CSU's Office of Conflict Resolution and Student Conduct Services addresses student, staff, faculty and other complaints, referring them to the appropriate department for a response and or resolution. All complaints are tracked and clients are surveyed at the conclusion of their case. As a whole, students and employees feel that they are treated fairly in the resolution of complaints. The campus has an organizational structure of offices that provide training and support to the campus community in fulfilling its responsibility to act with integrity; for example, the Institute for Learning and Teaching (TILT) provides academic integrity presentations to faculty, graduate students and groups of undergraduate students. They also sponsor an Academic Integrity Week. Core Component 2B: The institution presents itself clearly and completely to its students and to the public with regard to its programs, requirements, faculty and staff, costs to students, control, and accreditation relationships. Team Determination: _X_ Core Component is met __ Core Component is met with concerns PEAQ Comprehensive Evaluation Report Colorado State University Version 2.0 2013 14 11/20/13 __ Core Component is not met Evidence: CSU communicates clearly with prospective students, current students, staff and faculty through institutional catalogs and student handbooks. These publications include all policies relevant to the intended reader. That information is also made available through web materials that are easy to locate and access. Explicit information on tuition and the cost of attendance is readily available online. All academic rules, transfer requirements and curricular expectations are clearly laid out. CSU instituted a differential tuition model recently, in which tuition is based on the cost of delivering the course, course demand and the projected financial benefit to the student. This change in the tuition model is being rolled out over a three-year period and seems to have been well received by stakeholders, including students. Faculty and academic policies are addressed in the Academic Faculty and Administrative Professional Manual. The Colorado Personnel Board Rules and Procedures define the roles of state classified employees. The Human Resources Manual explains policies and procedures which apply to all employees. Accreditation information as it relates to the Higher Learning Commission and to specific disciplines (e.g., ABET and AACSB) is accurate and readily available. Core Component 2C: The governing board of the institution is sufficiently autonomous to make decisions in the best interest of the institution and to assure its integrity. Subcomponent 1. The governing board's deliberations reflect priorities to preserve and enhance the institution. Subcomponent 2. The governing board reviews and considers the reasonable and relevant interests of the institution's internal and external constituencies during its decision-making deliberations. Subcomponent 3. The governing board preserves its independence from undue influence on the part of donors, elected officials, ownership interests, or other external parties when such influence would not be in the best interest of the institution. Subcomponent 4. The governing board delegates day-to-day management of the institution to the administration and expects the faculty to oversee academic matters. Team Determination: _X_ Core Component is met __ Core Component is met with concerns __ Core Component is not met Evidence: Minutes of the Board of Governors' deliberations demonstrate that the Board engages in discussions of the priorities of the CSU System and as part of the System, the CSU campus. Discussions focus on, among other topics, governance issues, strategic and campus planning, financial operations and legal commitments. Minutes show the Board and its discussions to be forward-looking and directed PEAQ Comprehensive Evaluation Report Colorado State University Version 2.0 2013 15 11/20/13 toward the sustainability and enhancement of CSU. During the Team visit, Board members confirmed that their role was to govern, not manage the campus. The Board's membership includes 15 members, at least two of whom must come from Agricultural interests. Nine are appointed by the Governor of Colorado and 6 represent CSU, CSU Pueblo, and CSU global (a faculty leader and a student leader from each campus). Board meetings have an open segment in which any stakeholder can address the Board on any issue. The system and campus administrators are present and provide presentations and points of view which represent their campuses. The CSU System Bylaws have a Conflict of Interest Policy which requires that all conflicts of interest must be disclosed and that Board members with conflicts must refrain from participation. While the Board may approve policies brought forward through the campus committee processes, the Board does not make campus policy. The Board operates with a set of committees, but specifically limits deliberations to governance issues. Core Component 2D: The institution is committed to freedom of expression and the pursuit of truth in teaching and learning. Team Determination: _X_ Core Component is met __ Core Component is met with concerns __ Core Component is not met Evidence: CSU Policies and Guiding Principles specifically address the importance of the freedom of expression and inquiry. The Office of Conflict Resolution and Student Conduct Services serves as a contact point (among others) for any members of the University community who believe that they have been treated unfairly because of their views. No University restrictions are placed on form or content of lectures and exhibits, other than those imposed by law. The CSU Student Conduct code specifically prohibits behavior or activities that obstruct the right to of free speech or expression of any person on campus. Core Component 2E: The institution ensures that faculty, students, and staff acquire, discover, and apply knowledge responsibly. Subcomponent 1. The institution provides effective oversight and support services to ensure the integrity of research and scholarly practice conducted by its faculty, staff, and students. Subcomponent 2. Students are offered guidance in the ethical use of information resources. Subcomponent 3. The institution has and enforces policies on academic honesty and integrity. Team Determination: _X_ Core Component is met PEAQ Comprehensive Evaluation Report Colorado State University Version 2.0 2013 16 11/20/13 __ Core Component is met with concerns __ Core Component is not met Evidence: CSU's Research Integrity and Compliance Review Office supports ethical research by providing training to researchers using animal and/or human subjects and through the leadership and oversight of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, the Institutional Review Board and the Institutional Biosafety Committee. Plagiarism is defined in the Student Conduct Code, as is the possession or distribution of pornography or its viewing or posting in public venues. Faculty are expected to address academic misconduct as it relates to each course and, thus, expected to cover appropriate uses of information resources. Academic integrity policies are explicitly explained in the Policies and Guiding Principles as well as in the Student Conduct Code found in student catalogs, handbooks and bulletins. Faculty are explicitly expected to address academic integrity as it applies to each course. An Honor pledge is available for faculty use and faculty are expected to act to prevent and detect academic misconduct. A specific process for assigning and reporting academic penalties is in place which allows student appeals and incorporates hearings for contested, repeat and serious incidents. Disciplinary outcomes vary along a continuum, from grading penalties to probation up to suspension, transcript notation and finally, revocation of degree. Team Determination on Criterion Two: _X_ Criterion is met __ Criterion is met with concerns __ Criterion is not met Summary Statement on Criterion: CSU acts with integrity, fostering campus actions which are ethical and responsible. The University has well thought out policies and procedures to govern student conduct, appeals, research activities and the wide variety of complex activities which are part of a large research university. The University communicates clearly with faculty, staff, students and other stakeholders about their responsibilities to act in ethical and responsible ways. The Board of Governors supports the campus with its actions and with advocacy. CRITERION THREE: Teaching and Learning: Quality, Resources, and Support. The institution provides high quality education, wherever and however its offerings are delivered. Core Component 3A: The institution's degree programs are appropriate to higher PEAQ Comprehensive Evaluation Report Colorado State University Version 2.0 2013 17 11/20/13 education. Subcomponent 1. Courses and programs are current and require levels of performance by students appropriate to the degree or certificate awarded. Subcomponent 2. The institution articulates and differentiates learning goals for its undergraduate, graduate, post-baccalaureate, post-graduate, and certificate programs. Subcomponent 3. The institution's program quality and learning goals are consistent across all modes of delivery and all locations (on the main campus, at additional locations, by distance delivery, as dual credit, through contractual or consortial arrangements, or any other modality). Team Determination: _X_ Core Component is met __ Core Component is met with concerns __ Core Component is not met Evidence: Course and program approval documents, governance documents and routing forms ensure faculty have authority over curriculum and academic policies. Procedures for such are clearly outlined in Curricular Policies and Procedures Handbook and New Program Planning Proposal. During the Team visit it was clear that the curriculum rested with the faculty, that the faculty has multiple venues for input and was pro-active in its approval from the department through the board and the Colorado Commission on Higher Education. Undergraduate and graduate policies require the inclusion of learning outcomes in the approval process for each program. Course syllabi are required to, and do, reflect appropriate learning outcomes for the respective undergraduate, master's and doctoral degrees and disciplines. The learning goals are publically disclosed in the Undergraduate Catalog and the Graduate and Professional Bulletin and are reflected on syllabi and measured. The process for gathering assessment data is under revision; however, the achievement of learning goals at course and program levels are expected to be evaluated in an assessment process that is informed by a culture of assessment that drives most of degree programs. Though there is a less robust culture of assessment for general education and for co-curricular programs in the Student Affairs area, appropriate processes have been designed and are awaiting implementation. It was also clear through the Team visit that the distance education courses had the same rigorous vetting and approval process with a focus on learning outcomes as courses delivered in traditional norms. There are various support mechanisms to help faculty develop online courses/programs. Assessments and learning outcomes PEAQ Comprehensive Evaluation Report Colorado State University Version 2.0 2013 18 11/20/13 are similar to traditional classes and the data from course syllabi and assessment documents affirm standards, outcomes and quality. Core Component 3B: The institution demonstrates that the exercise of intellectual inquiry and the acquisition, application, and integration of broad learning and skills are integral to its educational programs. Subcomponent 1. The general education program is appropriate to the mission, educational offerings, and degree levels of the institution. Subcomponent 2. The institution articulates the purposes, content, and intended learning outcomes of its undergraduate general education requirements. The program of general education is grounded in a philosophy or framework developed by the institution or adopted from an established framework. It imparts broad knowledge and intellectual concepts to students and develops skills and attitudes that the institution believes every college-educated person should possess. Subcomponent 3. Every degree program offered by the institution engages students in collecting, analyzing, and communicating information; in mastering modes of inquiry or creative work; and in developing skills adaptable to changing environments. Subcomponent 4. The education offered by the institution recognizes the human and cultural diversity of the world in which students live and work. Subcomponent 5. The faculty and students contribute to scholarship, creative work, and the discovery of knowledge to the extent appropriate to their programs and the institution's mission. Team Determination: _X_ Core Component is met __ Core Component is met with concerns __ Core Component is not met Evidence: The foundational objectives of the general education program are clearly articulated in the Colorado State University Academic Core Curriculum: Report On Objectives And Criteria and are embraced by the campus and reflected in the curriculum. These are evident in the course syllabi and assessment rubrics reviewed. The general education program exceeds the minimums specified in the Assumed Practices and the State of Colorado requirements, but there were important discussions about intent and learning outcomes, which warrant further discussion on campus. The University values diversity but struggles with defining it, which can include global diversity and study abroad but implicitly avoids racial/ethnic/cultural/ demographic/economic diversity in the U.S. However, discussions with the Director of the Office of Equal Opportunity revealed that she has a legal background and clearly understands the definition of diversity as required for Federal reporting PEAQ Comprehensive Evaluation Report Colorado State University Version 2.0 2013 19 11/20/13 purposes. She discussed the advantage of using the term \"inclusiveness\" along with \"diversity\" to help distinguish between socially and culturally desirable diversity and diversity as defined by Federal law. The objective of the Global and Cultural Awareness requirement is to engage students in the study of particular cultural identities, explore the interactions among these cultural identities and consider the ways in which these patterns of interaction are related to the larger global context in which they take place. The addition of the B.A. degree in International Studies provides opportunities for recognition of cultural diversity with concentrations in Asian, European, Middle Eastern, and Latin American Studies. Additionally, the University has experienced substantial growth in student participation in study abroad programs. CSU has experienced significant growth in undergraduate research as noted in the Research and Discovery Strategic Plan Area Review Committee Report. The institution sponsors programs to support both undergraduate and graduate research. The University prides itself on its substantial record of research funding, particularly in the context of the downturn in state support. This additional funding has been used effectively and creatively to provide staff and research equipment that support both research and teaching. There is substantial faculty contribution in scholarship and research as evidenced, for example, by increases in research dollars and from a review of faculty vita. Faculty have embraced the critical role research plays in the life of a land grant institution and have woven it throughout the fabric of CSU as a direct reflection of the University's mission. Core Component 3C: The institution has the faculty and staff needed for effective, high-quality programs and student services. Subcomponent 1. The institution has sufficient numbers and continuity of faculty members to carry out both the classroom and the non-classroom roles of faculty, including oversight of the curriculum and expectations for student performance; establishment of academic credentials for instructional staff; involvement in assessment of student learning. Subcomponent 2. All instructors are appropriately credentialed, including those in dual credit, contractual, and consortial programs. Subcomponent 3. Instructors are evaluated regularly in accordance with established institutional policies and procedures. Subcomponent 4. The institution has processes and resources for assuring that instructors are current in their disciplines and adept in their teaching roles; it supports their professional development. Subcomponent 5. Instructors are accessible for student inquiry. Subcomponent 6. Staff members providing student support services, such as tutoring, financial aid advising, academic advising, and co-curricular activities, are appropriately qualified, trained, PEAQ Comprehensive Evaluation Report Colorado State University Version 2.0 2013 20 11/20/13 and supported in their professional development. Team Determination: _X_ Core Component is met __ Core Component is met with concerns __ Core Component is not met Evidence: Although the University instituted a hiring freeze from 2008 to 2012 due to budgetary constraints, the tenure track faculty has grown 7% over the past ten years. During the same period, the number of special (non-tenure track) faculty has doubled to 401 faculty members. While CSU's student to faculty ratio has remained competitive with peer institutions, the percent of credit hours taught by tenure track faculty has decreased from 47% to 41%. The University has made increasing the tenure track faculty a priority in the Strategic Plan by 2020. In spite of the hiring freeze, the University has continued to identify and respond to faculty needs. Differential tuition was established to enable academic units to fund faculty positions. In addition, faculty positions have been added in response to professional accreditation recommendations. The University's policy of annual activity reports and performance reviews, and periodic reviews of tenured faculty members (Academic Faculty and Administrative Professional Manual), along with the promotion and tenure reviews ensure regular evaluation of faculty. The Student Course Survey is administered in every course and provides feedback on instruction that is used in both annual evaluations and promotion and tenure considerations. Students feel that faculty are readily available to them. Multiple programs ranging from discipline-based to university-wide are provided for faculty and staff professional development. The Institute for Learning and Teaching provides pedagogical and technological support for course and program design. Sabbatical leaves for faculty are described in Academic Faculty and Administrative Professional Manual. The University's hiring process ensures that all faculty and staff have the appropriate credentials for the positions they will occupy. A concern was raised about the lack of data on the credentials for adjunct faculty. Through the Team interview process, it was discovered that faculty credentialing is included in the advertisement for the pool PEAQ Comprehensive Evaluation Report Colorado State University Version 2.0 2013 21 11/20/13 of adjunct faculty. Indeed, appropriate credentials are a threshold for interviewing potential candidates. The institution does not have a mechanism for compiling this data on a macro level. Still, the Team found that, as a whole, current faculty are well-qualified for the positions they hold. Core Component 3D: The institution provides support for student learning and effective teaching. Subcomponent 1. The institution provides student support services suited to the needs of its student populations. Subcomponent 2. The institution provides for learning support and preparatory instruction to address the academic needs of its students. It has a process for directing entering students to courses and programs for which the students are adequately prepared. Subcomponent 3. The institution provides academic advising suited to its programs and the needs of its students. Subcomponent 4. The institution provides to students and instructors the infrastructure and resources necessary to support effective teaching and learning (technological infrastructure, scientific laboratories, libraries, performance spaces, clinical practice sites, museum collections, as appropriate to the institution's offerings). Subcomponent 5. The institution provides to students guidance in the effective use of research and information resources. Team Determination: _X_ Core Component is met __ Core Component is met with concerns __ Core Component is not met Evidence: The Division of Enrollment and Access provides institutional support for admissions, registration and financial aid services that meet the needs of students and the University. Placement exams are required of all entering students and available online. AP, CLEP, IB and other assessments are used to assign credit and place students in appropriate courses. Orientation and continuing academic support programs are available to undergraduate students: those coming directly from high school, transfer students, and those in their second year. Survey results indicate that students recognize the contribution of orientation to their success and University data indicate that students participating in orientation had higher retention and success rates. Because of these results, the University has made attendance at orientation mandatory for all new and transfer students. An online orientation was developed and is available as an alternative to the on-campus orientation only upon approval. An online orientation has also been developed for students enrolling in distance learning courses. PEAQ Comprehensive Evaluation Report Colorado State University Version 2.0 2013 22 11/20/13 Students are introduced to library services in the freshman composition class and in presentations provided by library faculty across campus. The Division of Student Affairs provides student life activities, including career services, veteran's needs, Greek life, legal services, multicultural programs, wellness initiatives and housing services. The Division utilizes numerous student surveys to assess use and satisfaction of the services available. The Division also participates in national benchmarking of programs including student health services, housing and dining, student activities and Greek Life. The University provides programs to promote both physical and mental health through the Colorado State Health Network. The University Student Diversity Programs and Services office (SDPS) supports diversity and global awareness across the campus. The SDPS oversees and coordinates the activities of the Asian/Pacific American Cultural Center, Black/African American Cultural Center, El Centro, Native American Cultural Center, Resources for Disabled Students, Women and Gender Advocacy Center, and Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Resource Center. Accessibility and services for students with disabilities are provided by the office of Resources for Disabled Students. Co-curricular activities are numerous and satisfaction is regularly assessed through surveys of participants. However, learning outcomes are not identified or assessed for co-curricular activities. Student academic support services provided by the Institute for Learning and Teaching (TILT) include tutoring, study groups and study skills workshops. These programs are evaluated for student participation and performance. In the 2012 academic year, over 11,000 visits were made to the Arts and Sciences Tutoring Program. TILT sponsored workshops attracted over 2,500 students in 2012. Student advising for undergraduate students is provided by the academic departments, the Center for Advising and Student Achievement (CASA) and the Transfer Center. The addition of 14 new advisors and a $1.7 million investment in 2012 illustrates the University's commitment to advising. The position of Academic Support Coordinator was established to provide proactive advising and early intervention for students advised by the academic departments. CASA provides coordination across campus and uniform advisor training. PEAQ Comprehensive Evaluation Report Colorado State University Version 2.0 2013 23 11/20/13 All graduate students are advised by departmental faculty. Students are subsequently assigned an advisory committee (except for students in non-thesis Masters Degree programs). Facilities of TILT provide infrastructure for pedagogical professional development and support for online course and program design. The Provost's Course Redesign Competition was initiated to support the redesign of up to 100 courses over a five year period. The redesign project focuses on core and foundational courses that will have the greatest impact on student retention. The Online Course Development Project is a partnership between TILT and the Division of Continuing Education to increase the number of courses available through distance learning. Overall, students feel that a wide variety of student services are available to them and that these services are accessible by students. Core Component 3E: The institution fulfills the claims it makes for an enriched educational environment. Subcomponent 1. Co-curricular programs are suited to the institution's mission and contribute to the educational experience of its students. Subcomponent 2. The institution demonstrates any claims it makes about contributions to its students' educational experience by virtue of aspects of its mission, such as research, community engagement, service learning, religious or spiritual purpose, and economic development. Team Determination: _X_ Core Component is met __ Core Component is met with concerns __ Core Component is not met Evidence: The mission statements of the University and Colorado State System specify the mission as \"teaching, research, service and extension for the benefit of the Citizens of Colorado, the United States, and the world.\" The assurance evidence demonstrates that the first three items are satisfied. The four state agencies support the contribution of extension in the mission. The promotional materials distributed by the University inform students of the variety of academic programs, co-curricular activities and student life at CSU. The over 400 student organizations supported by the Division of Student Affairs provide student engagement and leadership opportunities. Service learning, undergraduate research, co-op and internship opportunities are available to enhance the curricular programs. The Student Leadership, Involvement, and Community Engagement program coordinates student organizations and the PEAQ Comprehensive Evaluation Report Colorado State University Version 2.0 2013 24 11/20/13 Office of Service Learning combines academic and community engagement activities. Team Determination on Criterion Three: _X_ Criterion is met __ Criterion is met with concerns __ Criterion is not met Summary Statement on Criterion: Overall the visiting Team was impressed with the quality of teaching and learning at the CSU. The degrees, curriculum, and appropriateness of learning outcomes to degree type seem to be very strong. While there appears to be a rooted culture of assessment in the various majors, there is a less than robust culture of assessment in the general education and co-curricular programs in Student Affairs. There are highly effective learning and student services programs throughout the institution and the level of collaboration between divisions should be a source of pride for CSU. Based on the information put forth in the Self-Study Report, supporting evidence, and throughout the visit the team asserts that CSU is indeed an enriched learning environment and, thus, meets Criterion Three. CRITERION FOUR: Teaching and Learning: Evaluation and Improvement. The institution demonstrates responsibility for the quality of its educational programs, learning environments, and support services, and it evaluates their effectiveness for student learning through processes designed to promote continuous improvement. Core Component 4A: The institution demonstrates responsibility for the quality of its educational programs. Subcomponent 1. The institution maintains a practice of regular program reviews. Subcomponent 2. The institution evaluates all the credit that it transcripts, including what it awards for experiential learning or other forms of prior learning. Subcomponent 3. The institution has policies that assure the quality of the credit it accepts in transfer. Subcomponent 4. The institution maintains and exercises authority over the prerequisites for courses, rigor of courses, expectations for student learning, access to learning resources, and faculty qualifications for all its programs, including dual credit programs. It assures that its dual credit courses or programs for high school students are equivalent in learning outcomes and levels of achievement to its higher education curriculum. Subcomponent 5. The institution maintains specialized accreditation for its programs as appropriate to its educational purposes. Subcomponent 6. The institution evaluates the success of its graduates. The institution assures that the degree or certificate programs it represents as preparation for advanced study or employment accomplish these purposes. For all programs, the institution looks to indicators it deems appropriate to its mission, such as employment rates, admission rates to advanced degree PEAQ Comprehensive Evaluation Report Colorado State University Version 2.0 2013 25 11/20/13 programs, and participation rates in fellowships, internships, and special programs (e.g., Peace Corps and Americorps). Team Determination: _X_ Core Component is met __ Core Component is met with concerns __ Core Component is not met Evidence: A noteworthy respect for data-driven inquiry, reflection and change informs CSU's approach to the assessment of student learning. For example, a new Student Success Initiative (SSI) currently under discussion called \"the science of learning\" aspires to ensure that instructors engaged in course and curricular design understand and use aspects of learning theory and effective instructional design in their work. Leaders are promoting a full institutional transition away from a \"compliance model\" to one in which faculty and staff from a variety of approaches (including student life, academic support, enrollment management and various participants in the SSI) approach student learning as \"action research\" in which assessment activities are undertaken using good research design to acquire useful data to inform decisions. The aspiration to cultivate a research-intensive decision-making process was expressed clearly in the Self-Study Report and validated repeatedly in several conversations with the Team. The process of departmental and academic program review is under revision, a change associated with a recent decision to move away from the Plan for Researching Improvement and Supporting Mission system (PRISM) that was implemented prior to the last HLC review and which had been used for more than a decade. The selected technology (Campus Labs Program Review module) and proposed changes have the support of the Provost and have been piloted by several departments. This \"powerful and flexible\" commercial product was selected using a deliberative and consultative process that included a number of departments that tested the program review module. The new system is regarded by these faculty as being easy to use; it has the benefit of being able to pull data from systems maintained by the Office of Institutional Research, thereby reducing \"busy work\" that was seen as a deficiency of the old system. Beyond these technical improvements, the proposed system seems to align with values expressed by department heads, who seek a process that promotes planning for improvement, which is informed by the regular work of assessing student learning, for purposes of helping departments and deans make strategic decisions. At the time of this visit, the revised program review process had not yet been presented to the Faculty Council; however, team members were able to review the proposed system. The design reinforces the institutional culture of research and inquiry, and aligns with the values expressed by the department heads. To evaluate overall commitment to review, the team studied historical PRISM reviews. These documents - though they suffered from some of the technical deficiencies of the system - revealed that CSU's process of conducting data informed program review had, indeed, brought to light matters requiring attention (e.g., required courses that didn't effectively lead students to desired outcomes, creation of better links between program mission, vision and requirements) and led to programmatic change and subsequent improvement. That said, it was clear to Team members that compliance PEAQ Comprehensive Evaluation Report Colorado State University Version 2.0 2013 26 11/20/13 was uneven and the software interface was dated and difficult to use - factors that contributed to the institutional decision to change its system. The overall pattern of evidence suggests that the University has the capacity to make appropriate decisions to design and implement an effective and useful program review processes. CSU has risen to the challenge of monitoring carefully and effectively the success of its graduates. The University has signed an MOU with the State of Colorado that grants access to state employment records, allowing CSU to track employment rates and income levels of all CSU graduates who remain in the state. Thus the institution can provide clear and accurate information about the median income levels for its in-state graduates, one, five, and ten years post-graduation - data which many institutions struggle to assemble. (This project has attracted the attention of the Lumina Foundation, which is seeking to replicate in College Measures a similar system for all public post-secondary institutions.) The Self Study Report indicates that while the University has not yet undertaken the analysis of the \"return on investment\" for Colorado's commitment to higher education, this tool would make such an analysis possible. Core Component 4B: The institution demonstrates a commitment to educational achievement and improvement through ongoing assessment of student learning. Subcomponent 1. The institution has clearly stated goals for student learning and effective processes for assessment of student learning and achievement of learning goals. Subcomponent 2. The institution assesses achievement of the learning outcomes that it claims for its curricular and co-curricular programs. Subcomponent 3. The institution uses the information gained from assessment to improve student learning. Subcomponent 4. The institution's processes and methodologies to assess student learning reflect good practice, including the substantial participation of faculty and other instructional staff members. Team Determination: _X_ Core Component is met __ Core Component is met with concerns __ Core Component is not met Evidence: Program descriptions in the General Catalog include clear descriptions of learning outcomes, which are frequently combined with clearly written and accessible definitions of academic programs and research fields. As noted above, CSU is currently changing from using PRISM to Campus Labs to capture, monitor and share information about student learning. Team members were able to review examples of historical PRISM assessment reports. Though assessment reporting found in PRISM was somewhat inconsistent, Team members found sufficient evidence that CSU understands how to effectively document achievement of measurable outcomes of student learning, to use that documentation to help faculty understand if change is needed, and to track the impact of changes made. Most learning outcomes were found to be \"student-centered,\" and program-PEAQ Comprehensive Evaluation Report Colorado State University Version 2.0 2013 27 11/20/13 level measures included \"embedded demonstration platforms\" that offer opportunities for authentic evaluation of student learning. The historical record of PRISM activity and the ongoing and effective work of the Office of Institutional Research (which fields some 300 ad hoc requests each year) demonstrate that data about student learning informs improvement and decision-making, not only at the department/program level, but also, through meta-analysis of reports, at institutional levels. That said, the University has identified (and Team members agree) that there is room for improvement, noting that programmatic changes have tended to focus on improving assessment methods, revising courses and curriculum, enhancing faculty research and improving outreach to faculty about assessment. Though a new Director of Assessment has yet to be hired, improvements under consideration include enhancing that individual's institutional connections to TILT and to the Office of Institutional Research, for purposes of ensuring that enhancing student learning is the focus of assessment. University-wide assessment strategies (necessarily) rely on tools that have a broad reach, though they may not delve too deeply into direct assessment of student learning (e.g., the CLA, NSSE). Nevertheless, CSU works to obtain the greatest possible impact from these tools, linking them to the other metrics where possible. The faculty-developed All University Core Curriculum (AUCC) has been adapted over the years to accommodate the Colorado gtPathways system (the transfer pathway required of all state institutions). The AUCC is a multi-tiered approach that includes basic skills in writing, speaking and problem-solving; broad distributional requirements that provide \"Foundations and Perspectives;\" and integration of these skills and foundations at more sophisticated levels via \"Depth and Integration\" in each student's major. Every undergraduate major is required to conform to a structure that supports this system of general education, with requirements that build on basic skills, move beyond the foundations and perspectives, and culminate in a capstone experience that integrates learning in the major with the broader skill set. Each program is required to measure program-level outcomes, and to adapt these measures to include assessment of the \"Depth and Integration\" tier of the AUCC. Institutional analysis of PRISM assessment reports revealed that programs most frequently assessed \"information management, knowledge content, communication skills, and critical thinking\" as components of the AUCC; further, some of these reports included direct measures of learning, such as \"oral presentations, experiential learning, exams, juried performance, and projects.\" Though these efforts are promising, these general skills are evaluated in the context of each discipline's learning outcomes rather than AUCC program outcomes, and therefore do not seem to reflect an integration of \"program level\" evaluation of learning across the AUCC. Student perspectives on the acquisition of broad skills are monitored via such instruments as the Collegiate Learning Assessment (CLA) and the National Survey of Student Engagement (NSSE). As CSU undertakes the task of implementing the new system for program review and assessment, the faculty should consider how to integrate program level assessment of the AUCC into the new system. Overall, CSU seems to be constantly working to optimize assessment activities and the ways in which the gathering and analysis of data can, and can better, inform decision-making. Recommendations for improvement in the Self Study Report for this sub-component are reasonable and insightful, suggesting that CSU understands PEAQ Comprehensive Evaluation Report Colorado State University Version 2.0 2013 28 11/20/13 already how best to use the tools of inquiry related to assessment for purposes of improvement. Core Component 4C: The institution demonstrates a commitment to educational improvement through ongoing attention to retention, persistence, and completion rates in its degree and certificate programs. Subcomponent 1. The institution has defined goals for student retention, persistence, and completion that are ambitious but attainable and appropriate to its mission, student populations, and educational offerings. Subcomponent 2. The institution collects and analyzes information on student retention, persistence, and completion of its programs. Subcomponent 3. The institution uses information on student retention, persistence, and completion of programs to make improvements as warranted by the data. Subcomponent 4. The institution's processes and methodologies for collecting and analyzing information on student retention, persistence, and completion of programs reflect good practice. (Institutions are not required to use IPEDS definitions in their determination of persistence or completion rates. Institutions are encouraged to choose measures that are suitable to their student populations, but institutions are accountable for the validity of their measures.) Team Determination: _X_ Core Component is met __ Core Component is met with concerns __ Core Component is not met Evidence: CSU has accountability for student success metrics including retention, progress, completions and achievement gaps through a performance contract with the Colorado Department of Higher Education (CDHE), known as the Colorado Performance Contract. The most recent contract seems to have a broad range of goals including institutionally developed descriptions and targets. For example, in the category of Student Momentum and Success, CSU's institutional goal is to \"Annually increase the proportion of freshman cohort students who accumulate at least 30 credit hours by the beginning of the third semester.\" CSU had met the graduation metric on the previous contract every year. The accountability expectations from coordinating or policy entities such as CDHE or the Colorado Commission on Higher Education (CCHE) reinforce institutional commitment to tracking student outcomes and prioritize the assessment and improvement of actions designed to impact success metrics. CSU will likely find it both prudent and necessary to utilize such state-mandated tools; however, dependency on state-defined metrics may become cumbersome or outdated: a review of the reports at the CDHE website indicates that contracts were reviewed in 2010 but have not been reviewed since. CSU may find it more useful to articulate and track \"local\" student success metrics and goals, which may ultimately prove to be more durable. The progression of efforts defines the current strategic initiatives and data collection focusing on student success including retention, persistence and completion. In addition to the CDHE goals, the University has stated a six-year graduation rate goal of 70% \"at the point when all parts of the proposed Student Success Initiatives PEAQ Comprehensive Evaluation Report Colorado State University Version 2.0 2013 29 11/20/13 retention/graduation plan were in place\" as well as eliminating the graduation rate gap between minority and nonminority students. At the time of the visit, the SSI was 73% implemented, with some programs fully funded. The President has also stated long-term goals of graduating 60% of students in four years and 80% in six years by 2020 or at least having an entering cohort that can achieve that level of success by that time. Overall, CSU has lofty student success goals with a history of performing well and improving. There is planning underway that provides pathways to and interim markers to attain the longer term goals. Those in campus leadership roles express confidence that CSU has the capacity (physical space, student support services, etc.) to add 5,000 more students by the year 2020, though some faculty and staff were careful to note that this plan will be revisited if the funding picture changes. Institutional representatives (and, in particular, those who are involved in providing academic support and student services) understand that this plan is ambitious when combined with the student success goals previously described. The advent of the \"SSI 2\" will be critical to ensure the resources are appropriately deployed when supporting a surge in students that are expected to enter the University at the same preparation levels and possibly more challenges associated with increasing enrollments of students who are first-generation, have higher financial need, and/or who are more geographically diverse. CSU has robust tracking in place for student success metrics. Data include updated student success reports with persistence and completion rates by variables including ethnicity, gender, need, first-generation, preparation, by college and including transfers. In addition, the Institutional Research office has interactive tools that anyone can use to research student success data with several years and variables available to the user. The integration of Institutional Research personnel and the AVP for Retention is a constructive mechanism in creating and maintaining student success data. This linkage has benefitted the data gathering process by allowing a continuing review of available and necessary data management for student success efforts. The impact of co-curricular and student support programs involved in SSI are carefully and actively assessed. According to the most recent SSI report, there are approximately 18 programs at the core of current student success initiatives. Investments in transitions, web-based early warning, early grade feedback, learning communities and creating Academic Support Coordinators appear to be paying dividends. Hiring Academic Support Coordinators is a large scale investment in enhancing student support, learning and advisement with the largest funding in the current SSI inventory. This initiative is much more than hiring additional academic advisors; it revolves around proactive strategies and data analysis embedded in the process to support students and has different models to accommodate the unique academic environments. Team Determination on Criterion Four: _X_ Criterion is met __ Criterion is met with concerns __ Criterion is not met PEAQ Comprehensive Evaluation Report Colorado State University Version 2.0 2013 30 11/20/13 Summary Statement on Criterion: As might be hoped in light of the improvements noted at the time of the last comprehensive visit, the institution continues to report gains in retention and graduation rates. Though there is still room for improvement, a significantly higher proportion of students are retained during and after the first year, and more students complete their degrees in four years. CSU notes that these changes have been achieved not by raising admission criteria or correcting a \"glaring problem,\" but rather, by a system-wide approach that uses analytics to promote early and appropriate intervention. The robust Student Success Initiative is an approach that reaches into the student experience before matriculation and addresses student needs in curricular and co-curricular environments after they matriculate, by utilizing early warning systems to identify students in need of enhanced support, and by supporting students who need help. CSU is looking forward, too, to designing the next generation of the Student Success Initiative, in anticipation of plans to grow the student population by recruiting and retaining more students. CSU's approach is multi-faceted, as befits a complex problem: student support might be found in improved tutoring for required courses, strategic intervention with at-risk populations, redesign of courses to increase opportunities for engagement, and expansion of residential learning communities. This data-driven, holistic approach is clearly paying dividends. The University's own summary of its recent activities reveals that its members have the capacity to reflect usefully on its past. Team members encourage CSU to continue to engage in the work required to understand and interpret the historical record, using a variety of data to inform and guide decisions, the better to prepare for the future. CRITERION FIVE: Resources, Planning, and Institutional Effectiveness.

Team Determination: _X_ Core Component is met __ Core Component is met with concerns PEAQ Comprehensive Evaluation Report Colorado State University Version 2.0 2013 31 11/20/13 __ Core Component is not met Evidence: The University has systems in place to effectively monitor and manage its fiscal and human resources. The past decade witnessed significant flux in state funding that adversely impacted CSU's financial stability. The University responded with plans to shore up decreased state funding through the reduction of internal expenses, hiring only for critical positions, foundation support, fund raising and student tuition increases in order to keep pace with annual operating expenses. The result of these efforts, in combination with modest increases in state support of late, has generated a positive balance sheet. Concern was expressed by the 2004 site visiting team that compensation patterns for extension and outreach administrative personnel were not commensurate with such areas as teaching and research. By its own admission in the Self-Study Report, over the past decade CSU has not adequately addressed this issue and net income loss for extension employees has only eroded further. Reasons given for not addressing this issue include reductions in state appropriations and the institutional choice not to divert new sources of revenue from tuition to non-academic programs. CSU is a public institution of higher learning governed under the rules and statutes of the State of Colorado. Its Board of Governors, in carrying out its fiduciary responsibility, annually approves the University's budget. Allocated budget lines are directed to assigned institutional academic units within the University. Planning and budgeting are carried out according to established policies. There is no evidence that financial resources are being dispersed to superordinate entities. Non-academic support services to the University, e.g. housing, dining, campus recreation, etc., are self-funded by users of these services and by the University. Funds generated from these sources are used in maintaining and upgrading services and for the provision of new enhancements. The University is linked to three distinct mission statements. The first is that of the Colorado State University System Board of Governors that oversees two other public institutions of higher learning in addition to CSU. Its mission statement encompasses all three institutions and focuses on the support, enhancement and protection of these public universities. The second layer is a mission statement embedded in Colorado statutes and relates to its mission as a Land Grant university. The statute identifies CSU as a comprehensive graduate research university offering an array of baccalaureate, master's and doctoral degrees. It also gives the University exclusive authority to offer degrees in agriculture, forestry, natural resources and veterinary medicine. At the third level, the Board of Governors adopted a strategic mission statement in April, 2005, exclusively for CSU. It seeks excellence in research, teaching, service and extension services for the citizens of Colorado, the United States and the world. As a public institution, the state-mandated mission statement has defined the educational raison d'etre of the University and the programs it is required to support. For its part, CSU fulfills its obligations and operates successful programs supported by highly qualified faculty, administrators and staff with adequate financial resources PEAQ Comprehensive Evaluation Report Colorado State University Version 2.0 2013 32 11/20/13 in an environment of fiscal uncertainty. For the CSU-specific mission statement, the goals of excellence in research, teaching and service are common features found in most public institutions of higher learning and are certainly realistic in light of how the University is organized and operates. The academic and administrative leadership positions in the University are filled with competently trained and experienced individuals. National searches are routinely conducted to seek the best qualified candidates. As a result, the make-up of personnel has created a profile of individuals from various backgrounds who possess diverse skills and training. Academic programs within the University are also accredited by specialized agencies whose standards place a high degree of importance on the qualifications of the dean and faculty. None of these agencies have questioned the competence of personnel in their respective programs. In addition, the University supports an extensive array of faculty development initiatives that promote career improvement at various levels. The University takes seriously its responsibility to invest in its people by seeking to improve the skills of its faculty, administration and staff. A recent initiative, started in November, 2012, by the President, has been to improve opportunities for women to work and learn within the University. The institution has focused on advancing its procedures in areas of finance as noted in the response to the 2004 HLC review. Policies have been established through the creation of the Office of Policy and Compliance (OPC) including policies that enhance business practices to comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations across campus units. Evidence shows that policies have provided the institution with a framework to deal with the financial challenges it faced in the past five years. From FY10 through FY13, CSU experienced a total reduction in state funding of approximately $39 million, or over 30% of its state funding. In addition to these reductions, the University lost state funding for controlled maintenance and was required to internally fund mandatory cost increases. To manage these cuts, starting in FY09, the University began to reduce its expenses, instituting a freeze on salaries and a commitment to hires that were absolutely critical. Through FY13, CSU cut approximately $39 million (around 30%) from its expense budgets and reduced its already lean workforce by more than 5% (around 312 positions). FY12 marked the third consecutive year in which a salary increase was not budgeted and some employees actually experienced a net income loss because of changes to the PERA retirement program. In FY13, the University was able to provide an average salary increase of 3% and the changes to PERA have been reversed. CSU has a well-established budget development process that annually engages the entire campus and uses the Budget Subcommittee of the President's Cabinet, composed of the President, Provost/EVP, Vice President for University Operations, Vice President for External Relations, Chief Financial Officer and the President's Chief of Staff, to guide the process. The institution has a budgeting process for each fiscal year that begins in July of the previous fiscal year with initial development of a draft incremental budget that includes initial projections of new revenues and new expenses. PEAQ Comprehensive Evaluation Report Colorado State University Version 2.0 2013 33 11/20/13 The year-long process for the new budget reviews revenue and projected expenses and program priorities. The Budget Subcommittee of the President's Cabinet begins the process to gain input by engaging campus constituents including the Faculty Council's Committee on Strategic and Financial Planning (CoSFP), the full Cabinet, the Council of Deans, the Associated Students of CSU, the Board, among others. The University's Self-Study Report provides a summary of the major changes in tuition assessment that provided a significant resource increase. Savings and expenditure reductions helped to balance budgets so tuition increases could be kept to single-digit percentage increases on a per credit hour basis. Without the expenditure reductions, resident tuition collections would have increased by an additional $38.9 million net, which could have resulted in a rate increase of over 40%. CSU was able to avoid such a dramatic tuition increase by gradually decreasing costs and staffing. In conjunction with the savings and expenditure reductions, the University implemented increases to its tuition rates during this same period. In FY12, the University closed the existing \"credit-hour gap.\" Prior to FY12, CSU's full-time undergraduate tuition rates were based on 10 credit hours making the University an outlier among other colleges and universities. With the close of the credit-hour gap, the University moved the undergraduate full-time definition to 12 credit hours, effectively raising the full-time undergraduate tuition base rate by 20%. Along with closing the credit hour gap, the University implemented a formal differential tuition plan, which resulted in differing tuition amounts based on the program of study. This plan is being phased in over a three-year period which started in FY12 and will continue through FY14. Revenue generated through this mechanism flows directly to the colleges and departments providing the specific coursework with a minor portion being provided to the Provost's Office to enhance enrollment growth activities. With full implementation at the end of the three-year period, the projected revenue from differential tuition is estimated to be approximately $20 million. CSU's focus is on planning and budgeting its resources to control and impact its administrative costs, tuition rates, attracting and retaining students, increasing its sponsored program capacity and increasing its support through the Foundation. Incorporated within the University's financial system is a robust expense monitoring process. It is an electronic workflow engine and its use across the University effectively delegates levels of responsibility throughout the organization based upon each individual's role and level of authority. The University requires all business officers and unit leaders (Deans, VPs, etc.) to annually certify their compliance with University policies and procedures. In addition to the above, units are required to reconcile their accounts on a monthly basis to ensure the proper recording of transactions. Campus Services, a unit within Business and Financial Services, also provides a level of oversight by monitoring units at an aggregated level. Unusual items noted during these monitoring procedures are addressed with each respective unit. Individuals within Campus Services are assigned specific units for oversight and serve as a liaison for all PEAQ Comprehensive Evaluation Report Colorado State University Version 2.0 2013 34 11/20/13 functions carried out within Business and Financial Services, such as Accounts Payable, Accounts Receivable and financial system operations. The University also supports an Internal Audit unit through the CSU System office. This unit is responsible for performing financial audits of all units on a rotating basis. The department of Internal Audit reports directly to the Board of Governors of the CSU System. Core Component 5B: The institution's governance and administrative structures promote effective leadership and support collaborative processes that enable the institution to fulfill its mission. Subcomponent 1. The institution has and employs policies and procedures to engage its internal constituencies\u2014including its governing board, administration, faculty, staff, and students\u2014in the institution's governance. Subcomponent 2. The governing board is knowledgeable about the institution; it provides oversight for the institution's financial and academic policies and practices and meets its legal and fiduciary responsibilities. Subcomponent 3. The institution enables the involvement of its administration, faculty, staff, and students in setting academic requirements, policy, and processes through effective structures for contribution and collaborative effort. Team Determination: _X_ Core Component is met __ Core Component is met with concerns __ Core Component is not met Evidence: At all levels, one can find examples of participation and engagement by various constituents within the University community. The Board of Governors includes faculty and student representation in an advisory capacity. There are four University Governance Groups: (1) Associate Students of CSU; (2) Faculty Council; (3) Administrative Professional Council; and (4) Classified Personnel Council. Using a shared governance model, each of the four groups performs functions that contribute to the institution's governance. The Faculty Council, for example, has elected officers and operates through 12 standing committees with broad representation of faculty. It meets monthly and, like the other Governance Groups, makes recommendations to the administration. In addition, the Strategic Planning Area Review Committees (SPARCs), the units that serve as the backbone of strategic planning at the University, are composed of an impressive mix of faculty, administration and professional staff members. Activities of the governance groups and SPARCs, as reflected in minutes, are widely disseminated and available for viewing on websites. For its part, the administration openly shares information via on-line publications, including the ever-sensitive topic of the University budget as noted in the Budget Updates and Communications which can also be viewed readily by the University community. Internal constituents are included in governance and information on governance issues is easily accessible. PEAQ Comprehensive Evaluation Report Colorado State University Version 2.0 2013 35 11/20/13 The Board of Governors is responsible for the oversight of three separate institutions of higher learning in Colorado, of which the university at Fort Collins is the flagship. Composed of nine voting members appointed by the State Governor and confirmed by the State Senate, the Board also has one faculty member and one student (both non-voting) from each of the three institutions. The Board meets six times a year. There are five standing committees: (1) Executive; (2) Evaluation; (3) Academic and Student Affairs; (4) Audit and Finance; and (5) Real Estate/Facilities. The Board routinely receives and reviews reports generated by the University in support of the work undertaken by the standing committees. As a result and verified in minutes kept, the Board is heavily invested in the University, it fulfills its own mission statement, and actively provides oversight of CSU's financial and academic activities. The Board has its own strategic plan that is reviewed and reassessed periodically. Included in the plan are issues of student success and satisfaction and financial sustainability. Policy-making is a University-wide activity that is conducted within a structured process. The Faculty Council has broad representation of University constituents and is the backbone for academic policy initiatives. Administrators, administrative professionals, classified staff, and undergraduate and graduate students can be found as members of committees, as appropriate, that operate under the umbrella of the Faculty Council. The Office of Policy and Compliance was created in 2010 for the stated purpose of managing the University's administrative, human resource and other non-academic policies founded on a shared-governance model. It ensures that constituents impacted by proposed policy changes have a voice and are considered as participants in non-academic policy-making. Core Component 5C: The institution engages in systematic and integrated planning. Subcomponent 1. The institution allocates its resources in alignment with its mission and priorities. Subcomponent 2. The institution links its processes for assessment of student learning, evaluation of operations, planning, and budgeting. Subcomponent 3. The planning process encompasses the institution as a whole and considers the perspectives of internal and external constituent groups. Subcomponent 4. The institution plans on the basis of a sound understanding of its current capacity. Institutional plans anticipate the possible impact of fluctuations in the institution's sources of revenue, such as enrollment, the economy, and state support. Subcomponent 5. Institutional planning anticipates emerging factors, such as technology, demographic shifts, and globalization. Team Determination: _X_ Core Component is met __ Core Component is met with concerns __ Core Component is not met Evidence: With a clear mission statement and strategic goals, CSU allocates its resources to meet stated aims. Effective oversight is provided by the Board of Governors in PEAQ Comprehensive Evaluation Report Colorado State University Version 2.0 2013 36 11/20/13 ensuring consistency of purpose. Planning is accomplished with input from several vested constituent groups and efforts are made to disseminate information about planning and priorities throughout the University and its community partners. Evidence of these efforts can be noted on web sites, in publications, news releases and awareness is demonstrated by students, faculty and staff. Between FY-09-FY12, the University has invested more than $670 million in campus improvements and capital construction and added 981,117 sq. ft. to physical footprint. These additions are consistent with the Strategic Plan that calls for increases in CSU's academic programs, enrollment, research, sponsored programs and efforts to broaden its financial and resource base. The Strategic Plan has been coordinated closely with educational outcomes. The Strategic Planning Area Review Committees (SPARCs) annually analyze data provided through institutional research to measure compliance with the strategic plan. Based on objective outcomes, recommendations are made to enhance and further expand successful programs or address situations when results fall below expectations. In both instances, the SPARCs engage in revisions in goal-setting that include budget recommendations. Each SPARC presents budget recommendations linked to its initiatives within the Strategic Plan that are automatically plugged into the University's budgeting process. The planning process begins with the mission statement and vision that is articulated and endorsed by the administration and the Board of Governors. The design and implementation of the vision is articulated in the Strategic Plan. Once approved, the strategic plan becomes the challenge to the university community. The University organizes itself and creates a structure and process to see that the Strategic Plan is properly overseen and implemented. The Strategic Planning Area Review Committees (SPARCs) assume this responsibility. Expectations and timelines are established, internal data is reviewed carefully, tasks are assigned and reports generated. In this manner, the use of SPARCs engages staff, faculty, and administrators in efforts to advance the University. CSU takes a conservative approach to calculating the credit hour projections used in determining the base budget decisions/allocations. Projected increases in enrollment revenue are not included in base budget projections. Operating budget reserves are established for maintenance, financial aid, sustainable energy related projects and Presidential/Provost programmatic initiatives. The above referenced reserves could be combined to compensate for a major budgetary issue. Consistent with university planning documents, budget modeling is used for revenue projections, multifactorial analysis of institutional capacity, physical capacity (including housing capacity and classroom capacity), support services, faculty and staff hiring and infrastructure costs to ensure a sound understanding of capacity limitations. These models provide a framework within which the University is prepared to sustain access and quality given a spectrum of different, potential fiscal scenarios. PEAQ Comprehensive Evaluation Report Colorado State University Version 2.0 2013 37 11/20/13 Despite its ambitious plans, the University has been appropriately cautious in its institutional planning efforts. CSU is a positive engine for change in the local community and is the leading employer. The University is acutely aware of the fickleness of state funding, changing population demographics, issues related to globalization of higher education and the need to train individuals for a rapidly changing work environment. Thus, it has developed a planning model that can be quickly adjusted to accommodate various scenarios. Consideration is even being given to the scenario that the University will have to operate without any state funding in the future. In the formation of its strategic plans, CSU has taken into consideration the known and potential clouds on the horizon. Core Component 5D: The institution works systematically to improve its performance. Subcomponent 1. The institution develops and documents evidence of performance in its operations. Subcomponent 2. The institution learns from its operational experience and applies that learning to improve its institutional effectiveness, capabilities, and sustainability, overall and in its component parts. Team Determination: _X_ Core Component is met __ Core Component is met with concerns __ Core Component is not met Evidence: As a service unit, the Office of Institutional Research is designated as the official reporting unit for the University to state and federal agencies. Its mission is to support strategic planning activities and continuous quality improvement at the institution through data-informed decision-making. Institutional Research accomplishes its mission by: o Collecting, maintaining and preserving institutional data; o Providing data analysis to inform executive decision-making and strategic planning initiatives; o Serving as the official reporting office for the institution that is used in federal and state mandated reporting requirements; and o Data on student/applicant, finance and human resources used for program and institutional assessment, program and institutional accreditation and facilitating program review and institutional assessment activities. The Team found that CSU routinely uses reports produced by Institutional Research for making decisions and improve its programs and operations. CSU operates with a balanced budget and maintains sufficient reserves for emergency needs. The institution has shown it can handle budgetary changes in the face of severe economic challenges to sustain programs while controlling the cost of education and continue to improve the quality of educational programs. Bonding for facilities capital has enabled CSU to construct (new and revitalized) excellent physical facilities that meet the basic needs of programs, faculty and students. PEAQ Comprehensive Evaluation Report Colorado State University Version 2.0 2013 38 11/20/13 CSU can be considered to be at a transformative period in its history. Rapid changes have occurred in the past five years, ambition and vision have been noted in the development of new programs, campus buildings and in patterns of growth. The staff, faculty and administration have been challenged to keep pace with the rate of change under a cloud of uncertain financial resources. Concurrently, these same groups need to ensure that the quality of existing programs is not adversely impacted. As CSU encounters an uncertain financial future, it is aware that adjustments will be required, experimental initiatives will either succeed or fail, and leadership will be obligated to make changes and move forward. With its overall goal improving institutional effectiveness, the University is poised to handle change as needed. Team Determination on Criterion Five: _X_ Criterion is met __ Criterion is met with concerns __ Criterion is not met Summary Statement on Criterion: CSU has linked its planning function to the budget process through implementation of coordination of planning with the budget decision-making process. The University has an effective formal planning process. Administrative and support staff personnel, faculty, students and the public are effectively included in the planning process through committees, open meetings and a website. CSU has weaved the planning process into its fiscal processes, even at a time when the appropriations from the state of Colorado significantly decreased. V. TEAM RECOMMENDATION A.

Teams should expect institutions to address these requirements with brief narrative responses and provide supporting documentation, where necessary. Generally, if the team finds in the course of this review that there are substantive issues related to the institution's ability to fulfill the Criteria for Accreditation, such issues should be raised in appropriate sections of the Assurance Section of the Team Report or highlighted as such in the appropriate AQIP Quality Checkup Report. This worksheet outlines the information the team should review in relation to the federal requirements and provides spaces for the team's conclusions in relation to each requirement. The team should refer to the Federal Compliance Guide for Institutions and Evaluation Teams in completing this worksheet. The Guide identifies applicable Commission policies and an explanation of each requirement. The worksheet becomes an appendix to the team's report. If the team recommends monitoring on a Federal Compliance requirement in the form of a report or focused visit, it should be included in the Federal Compliance monitoring sections below and added to the appropriate section in the team report template. Institution under review: ___Colorado State University______________ Assignment of Credits, Program Length, and Tuition Address this requirement by completing the \"Team Worksheet for Evaluating an Institution's Assignment of Credit Hours and on Clock Hours\" in the Appendix at the end of this document. Institutional Records of Student Complaints The institution has documented a process in place for addressing student complaints and appears to be systematically processing such complaints as evidenced by the data on student complaints since the last comprehensive evaluation. 1. Review the process that the institution uses to manage complaints as well as the history of complaints received and processed with a particular focus in that history on the past three or four years. 2. Determine whether the institution has a process to review and resolve complaints in a timely manner. 3. Verify that the evidence shows that the institution can, and does, follow this process and that it is able to integrate any relevant findings from this process into its review and planning processes. 4. Advise the institution of any improvements that might be appropriate. PEAQ Comprehensive Evaluation Report Colorado State University Version 2.0 2013 45 11/20/13 5. Consider whether the record of student complaints indicates any pattern of complaints or otherwise raises concerns about the institution's compliance with the Criteria for Accreditation or Assumed Practices. 6. Check the appropriate response that reflects the team's conclusions: __X_ The team has reviewed this component of federal compliance and has found the institution to meet the Commission's requirements. ___ The team has reviewed this component of federal compliance and has found the institution to meet the Commission's requirements but recommends Commission follow-up. ___ The team has reviewed this component of federal compliance and has found the institution not to meet the Commission's requirements and recommends Commission follow-up. ___ The team also has comments that relate to the institution's compliance with the Criteria for Accreditation. See Criterion (insert appropriate reference). Comments: CSU instituted a new student complaint policy in February 2013. This policy was designed to help students understand the differing processes (and offices) for reporting varying types of complaints (e.g. sexual harassment v. academic v. EEO) and to assure compliance with Federal policies. Discussion with individuals from Policy and Compliance, the office of the Vice President for Student Affairs and Conflict Resolution, coupled with reviews of compilations of reported student complaints confirmed that the institution has a process to receive, review and react to student complaints in a timely manner. The database that is used to record student complaints under the new policy is being modeled on the database used by conflict resolution. This will assure that timeliness can be assessed and that the multiple offices within the university that need to stay appraised of student complaints are in the loop. The central administration (president and provost offices, among others) monitor the nature of student complaints to determine if there are processes or systems that can be improved to reduce the number of complaints. Additional monitoring, if any: None Publication of Transfer Policies The institution has demonstrated it is appropriately disclosing its transfer policies to students and to the public. Policies contain information about the criteria the institution uses to make transfer decisions. 1. Review the institution's transfer policies. 2. Review any articulation agreements the institution has in place, including articulation agreements at the institution level and program-\u00adspecific articulation agreements. 3. Consider where the institution discloses these policies (e.g., in its catalog, on its web site) and how easily current and prospective students can access that information. Determine whether the disclosed information clearly explains the criteria the institution uses to make transfer decisions and any articulation arrangements the institution has with other institutions. Note whether the institution appropriately lists its articulation agreements with other institutions on its website or elsewhere. The information the institution provides should include any program-specific articulation agreements in place and should clearly identify program-specific articulation agreements as such. Also, the information the institution provides should include whether the articulation agreement anticipates that the institution under Commission review: 1) accepts credit from the other institution(s) in the articulation PEAQ Comprehensive Evaluation Report Colorado State University Version 2.0 2013 46 11/20/13 agreement; 2) sends credits to the other institution(s) in the articulation agreements that it accepts; or 3) both offers and accepts credits with the other institution(s). 4. Check the appropriate response that reflects the team's conclusions: _X__ The team has reviewed this component of federal compliance and has found the institution to meet the Commission's requirements. ___ The team has reviewed this component of federal compliance and has found the institution to meet the Commission's requirements but recommends Commission follow-up. ___ The team has reviewed this component of federal compliance and has found the institution not to meet the Commission's requirements and recommends Commission follow-up. ___ The team also has comments that relate to the institution's compliance with the Criteria for Accreditation. See Criterion (insert appropriate reference). Comments: Review of transfer information provided in course catalogs and on the University's website, along with explanations provided in the Self-Study Report confirmed that identical information was being provided to students regarding transfer credits and processes in a manner that was clear and accessible. CSU has multiple articulation agreements negotiated with the Colorado Department of Higher Education to assure that students can transfer credits easily among various state institutions (community colleges and four-year colleges and universities). Discussions with staff within the Office of the Registrar charged with overseeing the day-to-day aspects of student transfers confirmed that the appropriate processes, help-desks and oversight are in place to facilitate compliance with this Federal requirement. Additional monitoring, if any: None Practices for Verification of Student Identity The institution has demonstrated that it verifies the identity of students who participate in courses or programs provided to the student through distance or correspondence education and appropriately discloses additional fees related to verification to students and to protect their privacy. 1. Determine how the institution verifies that the student who enrolls in a course is the same student who submits assignments, takes exams, and earns a final grade. The team should ensure that the institution's approach respects student privacy. 2. Check that any fees related to verification and not included in tuition are explained to the students prior to enrollment in distance courses (e.g., a proctoring fee paid by students on the day of the proctored exam). 3. Check the appropriate response that reflects the team's conclusions: __X_ The team has reviewed this component of federal compliance and has found the institution to meet the Commission's requirements. ___ The team has reviewed this component of federal compliance and has found the institution to meet the Commission's requirements but recommends Commission follow-up. ___ The team has reviewed this component of federal compliance and has found the institution not to meet the Commission's requirements and recommends Commission follow-up. ___ The team also has comments that relate to the institution's compliance with the Criteria for Accreditation. See Criterion (insert appropriate reference). PEAQ Comprehensive Evaluation Report Colorado State University Version 2.0 2013 47 11/20/13 Comments: Review of documents provided in the Self-Study Report and discussions with faculty and technology staff confirmed that the University is in compliance with this requirement. Proctoring to assure academic integrity of the course is required for non-face-to-face exams and charges, if any, are noted. CSU's electronic courseware system is built on a Blackboard platform that supports sound student identification practices. Additional monitoring, if any: None Title IV Program Responsibilities The institution has presented evidence on the required components of the Title IV Program. This requirement has several components the institution and team must address: General Program Requirements. The institution has provided the Commission with information about the fulfillment of its Title IV program responsibilities, particularly findings from any review activities by the Department of Education. It has, as necessary, addressed any issues the Department raised regarding the institution's fulfillment of its responsibilities in this area. Financial Responsibility Requirements. The institution has provided the Commission with information about the Department's review of composite ratios and financial audits. It has, as necessary, addressed any issues the Department raised regarding the institution's fulfillment of its responsibilities in this area. (Note that the team should also be commenting under Criterion Five if an institution has significant issues with financial responsibility as demonstrated through ratios that are below acceptable levels or other financial responsibility findings by its auditor.) Default Rates. The institution has provided the Commission with information about its three year default rate. It has a responsible program to work with students to minimize default rates. It has, as necessary, addressed any issues the Department raised regarding the institution's fulfillment of its responsibilities in this area. Note for 2012 and thereafter institutions and teams should be using the three-\u00adyear default rate based on revised default rate data published by the Department in September 2012; if the institution does not provide the default rate for three years leading up to the comprehensive evaluation visit, the team should contact Commission staff. Campus Crime Information, Athletic Participation and Financial Aid, and Related Disclosures. The institution has provided the Commission with information about its disclosures. It has demonstrated, and the team has reviewed, the institution's policies and practices for ensuring compliance with these regulations. Student Right to Know. The institution has provided the Commission with information about its disclosures. It has demonstrated, and the team has reviewed, the institution's policies and practices for ensuring compliance with these regulations. The disclosures are accurate and provide appropriate information to students. (Note that the team should also be commenting under Criterion One if the team determines that disclosures are not accurate or appropriate.) Satisfactory Academic Progress and Attendance. The institution has provided the Commission with information about policies and practices for ensuring compliance with these regulations. The institution has demonstrated that the policies and practices meet state or federal requirements and that the institution is appropriately applying these policies and practices to students. In most cases, PEAQ Comprehensive Evaluation Report Colorado State University Version 2.0 2013 48 11/20/13 teams should verify that these policies exist and are available to students, typically in the course catalog or student handbook. Note that the Commission does not necessarily require that the institution take attendance but does anticipate that institutional attendance policies will provide information to students about attendance at the institution. Contractual Relationships. The institution has presented a list of its contractual relationships related to its academic program and evidence of its compliance with Commission policies requiring notification or approval for contractual relationships (If the team learns that the institution has a contractual relationship that may require Commission approval and has not received Commission approval the team must require that the institution complete and file the change request form as soon as possible. The team should direct the institution to review the Contractual Change Application on the Commission's web site for more information.) Consortial Relationships. The institution has presented a list of its consortial relationships related to its academic program and evidence of its compliance with Commission policies requiring notification or approval for consortial relationships. (If the team learns that the institution has a consortial relationship that may require Commission approval and has not received Commission approval the team must require that the institution complete and file the form as soon as possible. The team should direct the institution to review the Consortial Change Application on the Commission's web site for more information.) 1. Review all of the information that the institution discloses having to do with its Title IV program responsibilities. 2. Determine whether the Department has raised any issues related to the institution's compliance or whether the institution's auditor in the A-\u00ad133 has raised any issues about the institution's compliance as well as look to see how carefully and effectively the institution handles its Title IV responsibilities. 3. If an institution has been cited or is not handling these responsibilities effectively, indicate that finding within the federal compliance portion of the team report and whether the institution appears to be moving forward with corrective action that the Department has determined to be appropriate. 4. If issues have been raised with the institution's compliance, decide whether these issues relate to the institution's ability to satisfy the Criteria for Accreditation, particularly with regard to whether its disclosures to students are candid and complete and demonstrate appropriate integrity (Core Component 2.A and 2.B). 5. Check the appropriate response that reflects the team's conclusions: _X__ The team has reviewed this component of federal compliance and has found the institution to meet the Commission's requirements. ___ The team has reviewed this component of federal compliance and has found the institution to meet the Commission's requirements but recommends Commission follow-up. ___ The team has reviewed this component of federal compliance and has found the institution not to meet the Commission's requirements and recommends Commission follow-up. ___ The team also has comments that relate to the institution's compliance with the Criteria for Accreditation. See Criterion (insert appropriate reference). Comments: During the Team's site visit, discussions with institutional officials (legal, public safety, university operations, policy and compliance, student financial services and the PEAQ Comprehensive Evaluation Report Colorado State University Version 2.0 2013 49 11/20/13 registrar's office) confirmed the detailed information related to Title IV that was provided in the Self-Study Report and led the Team to conclude that the University is in compliance with this Federal requirement. Staff are provided with sufficient resources to perform the necessary tasks and were afforded sufficient professional development opportunities to permit them to remain current in their respective areas. Changes have been instituted to correct deficiencies identified in the most recent Federal program review (2010). Additional monitoring, if any: None Required Information for Students and the Public 1. Verify that the institution publishes fair, accurate, and complete information on the following topics: the calendar, grading, admissions, academic program requirements, tuition and fees, and refund policies. 2. Check the appropriate response that reflects the team's conclusions: _X__ The team has reviewed this component of federal compliance and has found the institution to meet the Commission's requirements. ___ The team has reviewed this component of federal compliance and has found the institution to meet the Commission's requirements but recommends Commission follow-up. ___ The team has reviewed this component of federal compliance and has found the institution not to meet the Commission's requirements and recommends Commission follow-up. ___ The team also has comments that relate to the institution's compliance with the Criteria for Accreditation. See Criterion (insert appropriate reference). Comments: Review of University policies and procedures published in catalogs and on the institutional website along with discussions with staff from student financial services and the office of the registrar confirmed compliance with this requirement. Spot checks of individual program materials and course syllabi, including courses offered in face-to-face and distance formats or in compressed formats, across a broad range of curricula at the undergraduate, graduate and professional levels confirmed that the academic policies were being implemented. Additional monitoring, if any: None Advertising and Recruitment Materials and Other Public Information The institution has documented that it provides accurate, timely and appropriately detailed information to current and prospective students and the public about its accreditation status with the Commission and other agencies as well as about its programs, locations and policies. 1. Review the institution's disclosure about its accreditation status with the Commission to determine whether the information it provides is accurate and complete, appropriately formatted and contains the Commission's web address. 2. Review institutional disclosures about its relationship with other accrediting agencies for accuracy and for appropriate consumer information, particularly regarding the link between PEAQ Comprehensive Evaluation Report Colorado State University Version 2.0 2013 50 11/20/13 specialized/professional accreditation and the licensure necessary for employment in many professional or specialized areas. 3. Review the institution's catalog, brochures, recruiting materials, and information provided by the institution's advisors or counselors to determine whether the institution provides accurate information to current and prospective students about its accreditation, placement or licensure, program requirements, etc. 4. Check the appropriate response that reflects the team's conclusions: __X_ The team has reviewed this component of federal compliance and has found the institution to meet the Commission's requirements. ___ The team has reviewed this component of federal compliance and has found the institution to meet the Commission's requirements but recommends Commission follow-up. ___ The team has reviewed this component of federal compliance and has found the institution not to meet the Commission's requirements and recommends Commission follow-up. ___ The team also has comments that relate to the institution's compliance with the Criteria for Accreditation.

Additional monitoring, if any: None Review of Student Outcome Data 1. Review the student outcome data the institution collects to determine whether it is appropriate and sufficient based on the kinds of academic programs it offers and the students it serves. 2. Determine whether the institution uses this information effectively to make decisions about academic programs and requirements and to determine its effectiveness in achieving its educational objectives. 3. Check the appropriate response that reflects the team's conclusions: _X__The team has reviewed this component of federal compliance and has found the institution to meet the Commission's requirements. ___ The team has reviewed this component of federal compliance and has found the institution to meet the Commission's requirements but recommends Commission follow-up. ___ The team has reviewed this component of federal compliance and has found the institution not to meet the Commission's requirements and recommends Commission follow-up. ___ The team also has comments that relate to the institution's compliance with the Criteria for Accreditation. See Criterion (insert appropriate reference). Comments: The information provided in the Self-Study Report and information obtained during the visit relative to graduation rates, employment of graduates and the like, coupled with the processes in place for the review of new and on-going academic programs relative to specific outcomes provides sufficient evidence for the Team to conclude that this Federal requirement is met. PEAQ Comprehensive Evaluation Report Colorado State University Version 2.0 2013 51 11/20/13 Additional monitoring, if any: None Standing with State and Other Accrediting Agencies The institution has documented that it discloses accurately to the public and the Commission its relationship with any other specialized, professional or institutional accreditor and with all governing or coordinating bodies in states in which the institution may have a presence. The team has considered any potential implications for accreditation by the Higher Learning Commission of sanction or loss of status by the institution with any other accrediting agency or loss of authorization in any state. Important note: If the team is recommending initial or continued status, and the institution is now or has been in the past five years under sanction or show-cause with, or has received an adverse action (i.e., withdrawal, suspension, denial, or termination) from, any other federally recognized specialized or institutional accreditor or a state entity, then the team must explain the sanction or adverse action of the other agency in the body of the Assurance Section of the Team Report and provide its rationale for recommending Commission status in light of this action. In addition, the team must contact the staff liaison immediately if it learns that the institution is at risk of losing its degree authorization or lacks such authorization in any state in which the institution meets state presence requirements. 1. Review the information, particularly any information that indicates the institution is under sanction or show-\u00adcause or has had its status with any agency suspended, revoked, or terminated, as well as the reasons for such actions. 2. Determine whether this information provides any indication about the institution's capacity to meet the Commission's Criteria for Accreditation. Should the team learn that the institution is at risk of losing, or has lost, its degree or program authorization in any state in which it meets state presence requirements, it should contact the Commission staff liaison immediately. 3. Check the appropriate response that reflects the team's conclusions: _X__ The team has reviewed this component of federal compliance and has found the institution to meet the Commission's requirements. ___ The team has reviewed this component of federal compliance and has found the institution to meet the Commission's requirements but recommends Commission follow-up. ___ The team has reviewed this component of federal compliance and has found the institution not to meet the Commission's requirements and recommends Commission follow-up. ___ The team also has comments that relate to the institution's compliance with the Criteria for Accreditation. See Criterion (insert appropriate reference). Comments: A review of the 20 program accreditation documents provided in the Self-Study Report indicates that the programs are in good standing with their accrediting bodies and that faculty are working to continually improve academic programs. Additional monitoring, if any: None Public Notification of Opportunity to Comment PEAQ Comprehensive Evaluation Report Colorado State University Version 2.0 2013 52 11/20/13 The institution has made an appropriate and timely effort to solicit third party comments. The team has evaluated any comments received and completed any necessary follow-up on issues raised in these comments. Note that if the team has determined that any issues raised by third-party comment relate to the team's review of the institution's compliance with the Criteria for Accreditation, it must discuss this information and its analysis in the body of the Assurance Section of the Team Report. 1. Review information about the public disclosure of the upcoming visit, including sample announcements, to determine whether the institution made an appropriate and timely effort to notify the public and seek comments. 2. Evaluate the comments to determine whether the team needs to follow-\u00adup on any issues through its interviews and review of documentation during the visit process. 3. Check the appropriate response that reflects the team's conclusions: _X__ The team has reviewed this component of federal compliance and has found the institution to meet the Commission's requirements. ___ The team has reviewed this component of federal compliance and has found the institution to meet the Commission's requirements but recommends Commission follow-up. ___ The team has reviewed this component of federal compliance and has found the institution not to meet the Commission's requirements and recommends Commission follow-up. ___ The team also has comments that relate to the institution's compliance with the Criteria for Accreditation. See Criterion (insert appropriate reference). Comments: The visiting Team reviewed the procedures, website and associated copy used to make stakeholders aware of this opportunity to comment and found them to be adequate to assure compliance with this Federal requirement. Prior to arriving on site, the Team was informed by HLC that no third-part comments were received. Based on the Team's review, we conclude that the lack of comments received was not due to inadequate notice or opportunity.

Review the \"Worksheet for Use by Institutions on the Assignment of Credit Hours and on Clock Hours\" as well as the course catalog and other attachments required for the institutional worksheet. Worksheet on Program Length and Tuition A. Answer the Following Questions Are the institution's degree program requirements within the range of good practice in higher education and contribute to an academic environment in which students receive a rigorous and thorough education? __X__ Yes ____ No Comments: Are the institution's tuition costs across programs within the range of good practice in higher education and contribute to an academic environment in which students receive a rigorous and thorough education? __X__ Yes ____ No Comments: The newly implemented differential tuition policy was rolled out successfully and seems to have been well-received by stakeholders. B. Recommend Commission Follow-up, If Appropriate Is any Commission follow-up required related to the institution's program length and tuition practices? ____ Yes _X___ No PEAQ Comprehensive Evaluation Report Colorado State University Version 2.0 2013 55 11/20/13 Rationale: Identify the type of Commission monitoring required and the due date: Part 2: Assignment of Credit Hours Instructions In assessing the appropriateness of the credit allocations provided by the institution the team should complete the following steps: 1. Review the Worksheet completed by the institution, which provides information about an institution's academic calendar and an overview of credit hour assignments across institutional offerings and delivery formats, and the institution's policy and procedures for awarding credit hours. Note that such policies may be at the institution or department level and may be differentiated by such distinctions as undergraduate or graduate, by delivery format, etc. 2. Identify the institution's principal degree levels and the number of credit hours for degrees at each level. The following minimum number of credit hours should apply at a semester institution: Associate's degrees = 60 hours Bachelor's degrees = 120 hours Master's or other degrees beyond the Bachelor's = at least 30 hours beyond the Bachelor's degree Note that one quarter hour = .67 semester hour Any exceptions to this requirement must be explained and justified. 3. Scan the course descriptions in the catalog and the number of credit hours assigned for courses in different departments at the institution. At semester-based institutions courses will be typically be from two to four credit hours (or approximately five quarter hours) and extend approximately 14-16 weeks (or approximately 10 weeks for a quarter). The description in the catalog should indicate a course that is appropriately rigorous and has collegiate expectations for objectives and workload. Identify courses/disciplines that seem to depart markedly from these expectations. Institutions may have courses that are in compressed format, self-paced, or otherwise alternatively structured. Credit assignments should be reasonable. (For example, as a full-time load for a traditional semester is typically 15 credits, it might be expected that the norm for a full-time load in a five-week term is 5 credits; therefore, a single five-week course awarding 10 credits would be subject to inquiry and justification.) Teams should be sure to scan across disciplines, delivery mode, and types of academic activities. Federal regulations allow for an institution to have two credit-hour awards: one award for Title IV purposes and following the above federal definition and one for the purpose of defining progression in and completion of an academic program at that institution. Commission procedure also permits this approach. 4. Scan course schedules to determine how frequently courses meet each week and what other scheduled activities are required for each course. Pay particular attention to alternatively-\u00adstructured or other courses with particularly high credit hours for a course completed in a short period of time or with less frequently scheduled interaction between student and instructor. PEAQ Comprehensive Evaluation Report Colorado State University Version 2.0 2013 56 11/20/13 5. Sampling. Teams will need to sample some number of degree programs based on the headcount at the institution and the range of programs it offers. At a minimum, teams should anticipate sampling at least a few programs at each degree level. For institutions with several different academic calendars or terms or with a wide range of academic programs, the team should expand the sample size appropriately to ensure that it is paying careful attention to alternative format and compressed and accelerated courses. Where the institution offers the same course in more than one format, the team is advised to sample across the various formats to test for consistency. For the programs the team sampled, the team should review syllabi and intended learning outcomes for several of the courses in the program, identify the contact hours for each course, and expectations for homework or work outside of instructional time. The team should pay particular attention to alternatively-\u00adstructured and other courses that have high credit hours and less frequently scheduled interaction between the students and the instructor. Provide information on the samples in the appropriate space on the worksheet. 6. Consider the following questions: Does the institution's policy for awarding credit address all the delivery formats employed by the institution? Does that policy address the amount of instructional or contact time assigned and homework typically expected of a student with regard to credit hours earned? For institutions with courses in alternative formats or with less instructional and homework time than would be typically expected, does that policy also equate credit hours with intended learning outcomes and student achievement that could be reasonably achieved by a student in the timeframe allotted for the course? Is the policy reasonable within the federal definition as well as within the range of good practice in higher education? (Note that the Commission will expect that credit hour policies at public institutions that meet state regulatory requirements or are dictated by the state will likely meet federal definitions as well.) If so, is the institution's assignment of credit to courses reflective of its policy on the award of credit? 7. If the answers to the above questions lead the team to conclude that there may be a problem with the credit hours awarded the team should recommend the following: If the problem involves a poor or insufficiently-detailed institutional policy, the team should call for a revised policy as soon as possible by requiring a monitoring report within no more than one year that demonstrates the institution has a revised policy and evidence of implementation. If the team identifies an application problem and that problem is isolated to a few courses or single department or division or learning format, the team should call for follow-up activities (monitoring report or focused evaluation) to ensure that the problems are corrected within no more than one year. PEAQ Comprehensive Evaluation Report Colorado State University Version 2.0 2013 57 11/20/13 If the team identifies systematic non-compliance across the institution with regard to the award of credit, the team should notify Commission staff immediately and work with staff to design appropriate follow-up activities. The Commission shall understand systematic noncompliance to mean that the institution lacks any policies to determine the award of academic credit or that there is an inappropriate award of institutional credit not in conformity with the policies established by the institution or with commonly accepted practices in higher education across multiple programs or divisions or affecting significant numbers of students.

Answer the Following Questions 1) Institutional Policies on Credit Hours Does the institution's policy for awarding credit address all the delivery formats employed by the institution? (Note that for this question and the questions that follow an institution may have a single comprehensive policy or multiple policies.) _X___ Yes ____ No Comments: Does that policy relate the amount of instructional or contact time provided and homework typically expected of a student to the credit hours awarded for the classes offered in the delivery formats offered by the institution? (Note that an institution's policy must go beyond simply stating that it awards credit solely based on assessment of student learning and should also reference instructional time.) PEAQ Comprehensive Evaluation Report Colorado State University Version 2.0 2013 59 11/20/13 _X___ Yes ____ No Comments: For institutions with non-traditional courses in alternative formats or with less instructional and homework time than would be typically expected, does that policy equate credit hours with intended learning outcomes and student achievement that could be reasonably achieved by a student in the timeframe and utilizing the activities allotted for the course? _X___ Yes ____ No Comments: Is the policy reasonable within the federal definition as well as within the range of good practice in higher education? (Note that the Commission will expect that credit hour policies at public institutions that meet state regulatory requirements or are dictated by the state will likely meet federal definitions as well.) _X___ Yes ____ No Comments: 2) Application of Policies Are the course descriptions and syllabi in the sample academic programs reviewed by the team appropriate and reflective of the institution's policy on the award of credit? (Note that the Commission will expect that credit hour policies at public institutions that meet state regulatory requirements or are dictated by the state will likely meet federal definitions as well.) __X__ Yes ____ No Comments: Are the learning outcomes in the sample reviewed by the team appropriate to the courses and programs reviewed and in keeping with the institution's policy on the award of credit? _X___ Yes ____ No Comments: If the institution offers any alternative delivery or compressed format courses or programs, were the course descriptions and syllabi for those courses appropriate and reflective of the institution's policy on the award of academic credit? _X___ Yes ____ No Comments: If the institution offers alternative delivery or compressed format courses or programs, are the learning outcomes reviewed by the team appropriate to the courses and programs reviewed and in keeping with the institution's policy on the award of credit? Are the learning outcomes reasonably capable of being fulfilled by students in the time allocated to justify the allocation of credit? _X___ Yes ____ No Comments: PEAQ Comprehensive Evaluation Report Colorado State University Version 2.0 2013 60 11/20/13 Is the institution's actual assignment of credit to courses and programs across the institution reflective of its policy on the award of credit and reasonable and appropriate within commonly accepted practice in higher education? __X__ Yes ____ No Comments: C. Recommend Commission Follow-up, If Appropriate Review the responses provided in this section. If the team has responded \"no\" to any of the questions above, the team will need to assign Commission follow-up to assure that the institution comes into compliance with expectations regarding the assignment of credit hours. Is any Commission follow-up required related to the institution's credit hour policies and practices? ____ Yes __X__ No Rationale: Identify the type of Commission monitoring required and the due date: D. Identify and Explain Any Findings of Systematic Non-Compliance in One or More Educational Programs with Commission Policies Regarding the Credit Hour PEAQ Comprehensive Evaluation Report Colorado State University Version 2.0 2013 61 11/20/13 Part 3: Clock Hours Does the institution offer any degree or certificate programs in clock hours? ____ Yes ___X_ No Does the institution offer any degree or certificate programs that must be reported to the Department of Education in clock hours for Title IV purposes even though students may earn credit hours for graduation from these programs? ____ Yes __X__ No If the answer to either question is \"Yes,\" complete this part of the form. Instructions This worksheet is not intended for teams to evaluate whether an institution has assigned credit hours relative to contact hours in accordance with the Carnegie definition of the credit hour. This worksheet solely addresses those programs reported to the Department of Education in clock hours for Title IV purposes. Complete this worksheet only if the institution offers any degree or certificate programs in clock hours OR that must be reported to the U.S. Department of Education in clock hours for Title IV purposes even though students may earn credit hours for graduation from these programs. Non-degree programs subject to clock hour requirements (an institution is required to measure student progress in clock hours for federal or state purposes or for graduates to apply for licensure) are not subject to the credit hour definitions per se but will need to provide conversions to semester or quarter hours for Title IV purposes. Clock-hour programs might include teacher education, nursing, or other programs in licensed fields. For these programs Federal regulations require that they follow the federal formula listed below. If there are no deficiencies identified by the accrediting agency in the institution's overall policy for awarding semester or quarter credit, accrediting agency may provide permission for the institution to provide less instruction provided that the student's work outside class in addition to direct instruction meets the applicable quantitative clock hour requirements noted below. Federal Formula for Minimum Number of Clock Hours of Instruction (34 CFR \u00a7668.8) 1 semester or trimester hour must include at least 37.5 clock hours of instruction 1 quarter hour must include at least 25 clock hours of instruction Note that the institution may have a lower rate if the institution's requirement for student work outside of class combined with the actual clock hours of instruction equals the above formula provided that a semester/trimester hour includes at least 30 clock hours of actual instruction and a quarter hour include at least 20 semester hours. Worksheet on Clock Hours A. Answer the Following Questions Does the institution's credit to clock hour formula match the federal formula? ____ Yes ____ No Comments: PEAQ Comprehensive Evaluation Report Colorado State University Version 2.0 2013 62 11/20/13 If the credit to clock hour conversion numbers are less than the federal formula, indicate what specific requirements there are, if any, for student work outside of class? Did the team determine that the institution's credit hour policies are reasonable within the federal definition as well as within the range of good practice in higher education? (Note that if the team answers \"No\" to this question, it should recommend follow-up monitoring in section C below.) ____ Yes ____ No Comments: Did the team determine in reviewing the assignment of credit to courses and programs across the institution that it was reflective of the institution's policy on the award of credit and reasonable and appropriate within commonly accepted practice in higher education? ____ Yes ____ No Comments: B. Does the team approve variations, if any, from the federal formula in the institution's credit to clock hour conversion? ____ Yes ____ No (Note that the team may approve a lower conversion rate than the federal rate as noted above provided the team found no issues with the institution's policies or practices related to the credit hour and there is sufficient student work outside of class as noted in the instructions.)
