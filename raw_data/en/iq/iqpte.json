Another staple in the Homoeopathic First Aid cabinet, it will often be one of the first choices for injuries involving the muscle, tendons, joints, neck or back. Like Arnica, this very specific and valuable use has often obscured consideration by practitioners as a deeper constitutional remedy. In investigating Rhus tox, much like in my Carbo vegetablis project, I unearthed so many strong, peculiar and useful rubrics that it is clear that this remedy underused, or used often in a too-limited fashion. There are many physical themes upon which the generally prescribed picture rests, and while I will discuss these, it is the Mental and Emotional state of this medicine, and its usefulness for particular traumatic events that I want to explore more fully. Poison Ivy is generally a hated plant (Delusion he was pursued by enemies), due to the extreme allergic reactions many people experience when they come in contact with it. When discovered close to homes, it will usually be poisoned with highly toxic chemicals even if there is a risk of poisoning the soil around it, which is also a major theme of the remedy - FEAR OF BEING POISONED. The plant cannot just be burned, as the oil contained in the plant will become a highly toxic smoke which might kill anyone who breathes it, and interestingly this is another major theme - FEAR OF FIRE. Rhus-tox is also known as a mimic, able to take on many different forms depending on its surroundings. It can appear as a climbing vine, a low set herbaceous plant, a shrub, or even resembling a tree. This ability to disguise itself can make it difficult to avoid, since it won't always look the same, and the advice given is if it resembles Poison Ivy in any way to assume the worst and keep away (SUSPICIOUS). Another very interesting thing about Poison Ivy is that the heightened level of CO2 levels in our atmosphere is supercharging its growth, causing it to grow almost 150% faster, and creating larger, stronger plants with even more toxic sap. Reactions to the plant are becoming more common and more serious, and it is likely this will become a more significant problem. This suggests that the connection between the changes in our world and the plant, might also represent a stronger connection with the remedy in more people. Firstly, let's have a look at the well-known symptom picture of Rhus-tox, which students and many non-Homoeopathic practitioners are most familiar with. As usual, all symptoms in bold are rubrics taken from Synthesis repertory unless otherwise stated. Symptoms in CAPITALS are strong indications for the remedy repeatedly verified in clinic. SS denotes a symptom for which the remedy is the only one currently known. > represents 'better for' and < represents 'worse for'. Rhus tox is very highly indicated for DISLOCATIONS, SPRAINS, INJURIES OF MUSCLES, AILMENTS FROM LIFTING OR STRAINING MUSCLES, or COMPLAINTS FROM GETTING WET or ANY CHANGE OF WEATHER. Its general characteristic picture can be summarized thus: DESIRE FOR OPEN AIR (BUT DRAFT AGGRAVATES) DESIRE FOR CHANGE OF POSITION WHICH AMELIORATES COLD AIR/BATHING/WATER/FOOD AGGRAVATES PHYSICAL EXERTION AMELIORATES MOTION AMELIORATES, BEGINNING OF MOTION AGGRAVATES, CONTINUED MOTION AMELIORATES STRETCHING OUT OF THE LIMBS AMELIORATES RESTLESSNESS AT NIGHT, IN BED AGGRAVATED AFTER MIDNIGHT Rhus-tox may show an imbalance of KAPHA in Ayurvedic Medicine, since this Dosha is strongly associated with the connective tissues, ligaments and tendons. Kapha suffers greatly in cold, damp and swampy environments. In Chinese Medicine Rhus-tox might be seen as a 'Water' person, who are typically restless, need to move about and travel, are sensitive to coldness especially in Winter, cannot eat or drink cold foods and drinks, and are better for warmth. Rhus-tox fits the 'Flowing Water' type, who are active, restless, impatient and busy. Chill from working in water Diarrhea after standing on wet ground Involuntary urination in Winter Hoarseness after getting wet WEAKNESS OF MEMORY FROM EXPOSURE TO DAMPNESS The picture of Rhus-tox is hard to contain within a few rubrics. It is enormous, with many established and repeatedly verified characteristics. It can be daunting for students and even established practitioners to remember enough of this information to know when such a remedy might be appropriate. I was able to obtain 5 pages of Single Symptoms alone, not to mention the extra 5 pages of 3 and even 4 value Rubrics. This mass of details can also obscure the Core picture especially the Mental one, like a lot of white noise drowning out the 'melody' of the medicine. It's clear that in studying Rhus-tox in detail, this is another Polycrest of the highest order, well suited to many chronic cases, not just to situations of injury. As with my article on Carbo veg, it was difficult to know where to focus my attention, since most practitioners will already have access to those pictures which simply list a collection of poorly connected symptoms and themes. However there is a much more interesting picture here, one that I think is very relevant to the modern age. Poison Ivy has an interesting relationship to Humanity. I am going to attempt to thread some elements together to create a picture of Rhus-tox that might not be so familiar to practitioners. Like all of my articles, I attempt to work from hard data (Rubrics) towards logical interpretations of that data, based on my own experiences in clinic working in the other direction (client expressions into rubrics). This process is a reversal of how we normally work with clients, but utilizes similar skills (lateral thinking, creativity, knowledge of language etc.). I also strive to bring together knowledge from other fields and from other therapies or philosophies. Rather than theorizing wildly about the meaning of a single rubric or symptom, I have attempted to link my interpretation to other components within the remedy to form a justifiable and holistic picture. It is important to understand that a set of rubrics might generate several potential images of clients, for example the need to keep on the move in Rhus-tox might suggest someone fleeing a terrible danger, or it might suggest the need to keep moving to avoid the slow decline of old age. Both situations can be constructed out of the same base. RHUS-TOX PATIENTS FEEL UNSAFE * Delusion something forced him out of bed (SS) ANXIETY IN BED Delusion is falling through the bed Delusion bed is sinking ATTEMPTS TO ESCAPE, JUMPS UP SUDDENLY FROM BED RESTLESSNESS DRIVING HIM OUT OF BED Fear at night, cannot lie in bed (syph) The Bed is a major aggravating factor for Rhus-tox. Many symptoms occur while in it, the patient is compelled to leave it, and they are usually better for being up and about. What is the symbolism of the 'Bed'? One's bed represents home and safety, a secure retreat from the world, a place we can rest and recover. It is often a place we share with someone we love. We are also at our most vulnerable when in bed, pretty much helpless in fact like a baby (as the saying goes). Rhus-tox cannot rest in bed (REST AGGRAVATES). A place that should represent safety, instead provokes fear (Fear at night, cannot lie in bed - syph). The person is in real danger if they stay (Shrieking for help, jumping up from bed) and it's not just the bed that is the source of such risk, but the entire home (ANXIETY IN THE HOUSE). They have to get out to be safe, to get outside where there is less danger (Anxiety > walking in open air, MOROSE < IN HOUSE >WALKING IN OPEN AIR). What is a situation, a not uncommon one, which provokes this kind of feeling and behavior? It is a situation we see on the news almost every day, and at certain times it can become a community-wide emergency. It is the situation of a person whose home is burning. It is the situation of the Bushfire or Wildfire. RHUS-TOX PATIENTS AND FIRE *FEAR THAT THINGS WILL CATCH ON FIRE Fires are unpredictable, uncontrollable, and terrifying. The threat is immediate, urgent, and requires immediate action. There is a saying used in Fire Danger education 'Stay low and go go go!', and children are taught to move quickly to escape the house and get outside into the clean open air (OPEN AIR AMELIORATES). There are thousands of house fires in Australia every year, it is a constant ongoing risk when living in any house. For those affected by their home burning down, it can lead to significant emotional distress, a loss of all possessions including those of emotional value, and most importantly a loss of a security. The home can represent many years, decades, perhaps generations of work and comfort, of building a place which represents the center point of family life. Most deadly fires occur while people are asleep (Fear to go to sleep). There is little time on waking to find your home ablaze to do anything but escape (Attempts to escape, runs away). Survivors of a fire, though safe once they reach the outside, then face the problems of caring for their family (Anxiety about his family), money (Ailments from losing money) and shelter (Anxiety about the household). This can lead to more long term issues of how they are going to support themselves (Anxiety about the future). Such a trauma can be difficult to let go of (Dwells on past disagreeable occurrences), and can lead to flashbacks (Delusions visions of fire), nightmares (Dreams the world is on fire) and heightened emotional fragility (Causeless weeping, weeps without knowing why). \"HOW CAN WE SLEEP WHILE OUR BEDS ARE BURNING\" Midnight Oil, 1987 These are lyrics from a famous song by an Australian Band, and the song references the forced relocation by the Australian Government, of native Australian peoples from their ancestral lands. It is said that some of these people were literally forced to flee their homes because they were set alight. Rhus-tox might be indicated for any situation where people are forced to become refugees, whose places of safety were burned, and they were then forced to move around or to rebuild. It has been a common experience for many native peoples, for many races throughout history. RHUS-TOX PATIENTS WORK HARD TO REBUILD This experience is also a perfect description of the TYPHOID MIASM, for which Rhus-tox would be an important remedy. This miasmatic pattern is one of an urgent crisis which requires great effort to reach a point of safety. Once safety is achieved, you can rest and there is hope for recovery. During any disaster, there is confusion and chaos (Delusion surroundings whirled around her) but once it is over people are often ringed by nothing but the bones of their home and a devastated countryside , an incredibly tragic and isolating feeling (Delusion everything is dead and still, and she is alone SS). One can see that Rhus-tox is appearing to react to a sense of urgent crisis, an extremely dangerous situation that requires MOVEMENT. The strategy for this patient is to KEEP MOVING, to ESCAPE, to STAY ON THE MOVE in order to stay alive (Fear of death < sitting, MUST MOVE CONSTANTLY). They cannot stand still (Thoughts vanishing while standing SS). This strategy can become a long term one as well. Part of the conversation around the aftermath of any disaster is REBUILDING, and you will see in news reports discussion about affected individuals or communities needing to rebuild from scratch, to start over again. There is often a restlessness to get to work, to start the enormous task of recreating the (relative) safety of their home. Rhus tox can cover compulsion to work hard to recover from a terrible event. Remember that we are dealing with disease states here, not healthy ones, so the patient may be acting this way in response to a perceived disaster, or to anticipate a disaster they feel is going to happen (Fear something will happen, Dreams full of worries). * Delusion he is working hard Rhus-tox is an energetic, busy person who loves to work, who in fact needs to work. This might resemble Calc carb or Nux-vomica. Arguably they could be seen as a combination of these two remedies in a way. Calc carb fears disaster (fire, murder, rats) and works hard to create protection or a defense. Nux-vomica works hard to avoid losing their position to someone else (Fear their bed will be sold). Nux-vomica also sits within the Typhoid Miasm and so the two remedies might be seen to share a similar core experience and management strategy (you will lose everything, and have to work hard to regain your position or avoid losing it). RHUS-TOX ARE DISASTER SURVIVORS Rhus tox are very goal oriented, constantly pushing forward to either keep or regain the position of safety and security (Ambition increased, Full of cares about business, Fear to lose his lucrative job, Despair of Social position). This behaviour may be the result of a traumatic loss due to a fire or some other kind of sudden disaster that took everything from them, or perhaps threatened to do so. It's important to always remember that while the rubrics might be literal, the situation may not, so the 'FIRE' might be any kind of unpredictable chaotic situation that destroys or threatens to destroy their base of security. I feel Rhus-tox would be an excellent remedy for anyone who has lived through a disaster (hurricane, cyclone, tornado, bushfire, flash flooding and so on), and had to strive hard to rebuild their lives (DREAMS OF STRIVING, Delusion he is engaged in some occupation). It might even suit someone who lives through a stock market crash and loses savings, thus their security for the future. This is a very 'masculine' approach to solving or repairing a problem(energy-wise not gender-wise). RHUS-TOX ARE OVER-MASCULINIZED * Dreams of hurry to perform some labor (SS) Rhus-tox appears to be overbalanced in masculine energy. This type of energy is relates to Movement, Task, Activity, Achievement, Building success. It is the 'straight line' to a goal. There may be an imbalance in the remedy between Masculine and Feminine energies. Rhus tox dreams about Projects coming true in dreams (SS), STRIVING, Exerting themselves while climbing (SS), Rowing (SS), of Running through deep snow. Rhus-tox patients worry about their JOBS, their POSITION, their BUSINESSES, their AMBITIONS, their OCCUPATIONS. They must concern themselves with providing for the family. Masculine energy also tends to approach problems from an intellectual angle (Increased power of reason, Dreams of excelling at mental work). Rhus-tox displays the symptom Chill one sided, coldness on the right side and heat of the left (along with Puls). The right side of the body relates to the masculine principle in both men and women. This principle governs work, our jobs, our function in society, business. It reflects the feelings towards competing, achieving and filling the breadwinning role. How else might we see an imbalance between the Masculine and Feminine principles in Rhus tox? RHUS-TOX AND THE NIGHT *DISAGREEABLE THOUGHTS AFTER MIDNIGHT (SS) Rhus-tox is much worse at Night, much worse after Midnight, it is the time when these patients are least able to prevent their minds from running amok, from feeling their grief and pain. There is significant symbolism related to Day and Night, symbolism somewhat based on our evolutionary Circadian rhythms. Daytime is related to the active, conscious Masculine principle, Night to the passive, unconscious Feminine principle. The day is full of fast paced rhythms, the night is quiet and meditative. Midnight represents the height of the Feminine principles influence, the hour when most are asleep and vulnerable. It is the time when the unconscious overwhelms the conscious mind, and this is when Rhus-tox cannot avoid their past by keeping busy. Remaining still is difficult, if not impossible for these patients. The excessive Masculine energy drives them to keep working, keep building, to engage the intellect, even when they should be resting and dreaming and recovering from the activities of the day. RHUS-TOX FEARS THE ONSET OF OLD AGE *TWILIGHT AGGRAVATES As the sun sets and night falls, it signals the death of the day. This symbolism is important to Rhus-tox in a number of ways. As I've already mentioned, the darkest hours are often the worst for these patients. Twilight is the sharpest contrast between the light of Day and the dark of the Night, the time when the active animals of the sunlit world head to the safety of their homes, and this is a problem for the Rhus tox patient who finds no comfort in the place where they should be secure. Jung compares the end of the Day with old age, and the slow advance of death. This symbolism associating stages of human life with natural cycles extends to the seasons as well, and it is interesting to see that Rhus tox has three keynote symptoms Autumn aggravates, Winter aggravates, and Winter Solstice aggravates. Autumn represents the fading of youth and the entrance into Maturity. Autumn is often associated with mortality and melancholy. The wanderings of Summer (Delusion Roaming) must give way to the retreat back inside, into enclosed spaces. Winter represents Old Age, in mythology often being represented by an elderly man or woman. The ending of warm life, the coming of cold death (COLD FEELING IN THE BLOOD)and the fading of the bright colours of Autumn (Vision, objects become pale after looking long). The Winter solstice represents the heart of Winter, Darkness rules over Day longer than any other time of year. Just as Midnight aggravates Rhus-tox, so too does the darkest day of the year. Rhus-tox is well known for a very typical picture of 'Old Age Arthritis', or Osteoarthritis. Creaking joints, stiffness on waking or sitting long, painful joints that make movement difficult and can restrict the patient in living an active life. This condition has been associated with Old Age for much of human history, and in Homoeopathy Rhus-tox has been strongly associated with the disease. There are a number of rubrics which paint the picture of someone becoming old and weak, but who struggles to keep moving and working so as not to allow infirmity and death overtake them. *Delusion if he stooped, he could not rise up again Anxiety while sitting bent (SS) Fear of death while sitting bent over (SS) Fear of death with loss of strength (SS) The bed may not just be seen as a place where you are too vulnerable during an emergency, but the place we retire to when we are old and awaiting death. Falling backward on getting out of bed (SS) Rhus-tox suits individuals who believe that rest equates to being old, who maintain a restless busy attitude, who roam about having adventures and working on projects to keep themselves from submitting to the infirmity of age (Dreams of hurry to perform some labor SS, DREAMS OF ROAMING OVER FIELDS, Dreams adventurous, Dreams of projects coming true in their dreams SS). Keeping busy, active, moving, working - these things can stave off old age. If you stop, you may not be able to get going again, and immobility leads to death. Not being able to move, to get outside, to work, is paramount to dying. RHUS-TOX AND ITS RELATIONSHIP TO POISON Iophobia or Toxiphobia, is the irrational fear of being poisoned. Such a fear can develop from the fears held by a parent or guardian who are overly protective, or in someone who has actually been poisoned and survived. Rhus-tox is the MAIN remedy alongside Hyoscamus for this phobia. * FEAR OF BEING POISONED One of the primary symptoms associated with this phobia is suspicion. Rhus-tox is a 3 value remedy in the rubric SUSPICIOUS. Toxiphobic individuals will not be able to trust products they buy, food they consume, the people who cook or serve them. They must control whatever they ingest or otherwise allow into their bodies. This can create a real sense of paranoia (Delusion he is persecuted). You may see this kind of behaviour in people with potentially fatal allergies, where anaphylaxis is a risk. You may see this in the parents of such children, who will hover protectively around them examining everything given to them (Anxiety for their family, Full of cares for their relatives, Fear something will happen). There is an urban myth around poisoned Halloween candy, which interestingly started with a warning given in the famous 'Dear Abby' column in the 1970s. It was reiterated in an article by this author's sister, a journalist, over a decade later, quoting 'proof' that children had been poisoned by strangers providing treats during the night of 'Trick or Treating'. This myth spread throughout the community and is can still create anxiety today in parents. Sociologist Joel Best spent 30 years investigating claims of such poisonings, and found there had been no confirmed cases of strangers murdering children in this way. Poisoning crimes were popularized in Victorian times, and became a symbol of domestic violence (against men). Poison had always been associated with secrecy and hidden threats. Secret poisonings caused much anxiety amongst husbands in Victorian England, and the image of the 'Poisoning Woman' grew and was sensationalized in the press and literature, painting women as deceptive and dangerous. This harkens back to the days of the persecution of witches (see later). Poisons have been used throughout history for the assassination of high profile people, even rulers of countries (Delusion he will be murdered, Delusion he is pursued by enemies). It is difficult, if not impossible, to trace the source of the poison. They are weapons of terror, sowing uncertainty and fear. Russia in particular has favoured the use of poison to eliminate those who cross her, no matter where in the world they are. There have been many reports of strange deaths of prominent figures in Russia that might be connected to the use of poison. POISONS AND WITCHCRAFT Use of poisons has been ascribed to witches and sorcerers since ancient times. The ability to kill has always been the other side of the ability to heal, and the wise ones able to use herbs to do one were also capable of doing the other. Witches were often consulted for poisons to dispose of lovers or rivals, and during the European witch hunts it was believed that poison animals and people in their crusade against Christians (Delusion is bewitched). Poison and black magic have had a long association in human history, and this seems to be reflected within the picture of Rhus-tox as well RHUS-TOX AND THE ANTIVACCINATION MOVEMENT There is an interesting correlation in the picture of Rhus-tox and the various emotional traumas of those who identify as 'anti' or 'ex' vaccinators. The movement, and the language used when you read through the various websites or blogs devoted to supporting and educating such people, revolves around the injection of toxins into helpless victims (DELUSION HAS BEEN POISONED). Just as a disclaimer, I believe, and Homoeopathy generally agrees, that vaccines are indeed poisons, so this belief is not a reason to treat a person expressing such concerns. However what then grows out of this is an intense fear of anything else which might overload the body with further toxicity causing them to avoid anything that might remotely resemble a poison (Delusion he is being poisoned by the medicine). This will also lead them down the path of 'Detoxification', the belief that most illnesses and disruptions are caused by poisons sitting in the body, and that these poisons need to be 'drawn out' through various methods. This of course has its roots in the old Humoristic medical philosophy, which also promoted 'bleeding' as a way of removing the 'bad humors'. 'Detoxifying' becomes the first reponse to everything - colds, flus, headaches, skin rashes, tantrums, learning difficulties, memory problems, transgenderism, criminal behaviour, loss of religious beliefs - anything at all. This is where it becomes an imbalance and may require addressing as part of the case. Such patients will force their children, their spouses, their friends and relatives, to endure bouts of purging of imagined toxins out of the body, without any specific proof that there are such toxins present, or that the treatments will indeed do what they say. It is quite possible that such people have strayed from sensible caution and good health practices, into a significant phobic response (Fear, superstitious, Fear of imaginary things) Such a response may have come from the significant trauma associated with one's child being damaged, perhaps even killed, by a vaccine or by any other kind of pharmaceutical treatment such as chemotherapy or antibiotics. As hundreds of thousands of people are harmed or killed by allopathic treatments each year (conservatively), Rhus-tox might be well indicated for many people who enter our practices. Further to the historical event of being poisoned, or the ensuing fear of other toxins, the Antivaccination community typically suffers a great deal of persecution (Delusion is pursued by enemies). Their information and details may be obtained and used inappropriately in a 'Big Brother' manner (Delusion is being watched). They may fear losing their jobs, and may actually do so (Fear to lose his his lucrative job). Whatever credibility they might have is often lost the moment they 'come out', and this can be especially true if they are medical professionals or other high profile members of the community (Despair of social position). It has been noticed that some medical professionals, especially doctors, who speak up against the Pharmaceutical industry will suddenly be found dead, often through violence (Delusion he will be murdered). They often express fears that Child Services or other Government agencies will turn up suddenly at their house to arrest them or take their children away (Delusion has committed a crime, FEAR OF PEOPLE). There are frequent discussions about fleeing their homes, moving to other states or countries, to escape the persecution before that happens (ESCAPE, ATTEMPTS TO), or even living as refugees might, always moving around (RESTLESSNESS, MUST MOVE CONSTANTLY). There may be despair at being able to fight or protect themselves (Helplessness) and many choose to homeschool to avoid their children being noticed and targeted (Delusion everyone is looking at her). So I propose that Rhus-tox may be an important remedy for helping the many people now being traumatized by resisting the pressure of society to submit themselves to vaccination. The core trauma of Rhus-tox appears to be danger to your life, when you are most vulnerable and unable to protect yourself, and the need to get up and get out. This can apply to the children being vaccinated as well as to the parents who were unable or unaware that they needed to protect them. SUMMARY Rhus-tox core feeling is one of being UNSAFE IN THEIR PRIMARY PLACE OF SAFETY. There is a strong FEAR OF DISASTER STRIKING WHEN YOU ARE MOST VULNERABLE. You are FORCED TO FLEE YOUR HOME TO AVOID DISASTER AND DEATH. You may also be FLEEING PERSECUTION AND MURDER. There is a sense of THREAT FROM THINGS WHICH MIGHT OTHERWISE BE HELPFUL TOOLS. Fire provides warmth and cooking, Poisons can actually heal when used properly, and are the main tools of Allopathic medicine (who obviously don't use them properly). Rhus-tox has a HYPER-MASCULINIZED response, focusing on TASK, JOB, ACTIVITY, ACHIEVEMENT and BUILDING SUCCESS. Rhus-tox must keep MOVING TO AVOID INFIRMITY AND DEATH FROM OLD AGE. "}
