All those things add up to maintaining your body's own natural defenses. But, when we get busy, run down, or don't eat right, we're likely to have some nutrient shortfalls which can affect our immune system support. Today's lifestyles make it difficult to take care of yourself and your family. Sleep becomes a low priority when deadlines are looming. And, the same goes for healthy meals. In fact, [research shows](https://www.amwayconnections.com/healthy-living/research-findings-global-phytonutrient-report/) that most adults fall short of consuming the 5-9 servings of fruits and vegetables each day, as recommended by the World Health Organization. That's why you may be left searching for answers on how to boost immune system health. While you might stumble upon a product claiming to be an \"immune system booster,\" vitamins and nutrients are one of the best ways to give your body the support it may need. Immune support supplements can help fill those nutrient gaps by assisting in your body's natural resistance and helping to promote positive lifestyle behaviors that are key for a healthy immune system. Ready to learn how to be healthy and provide your body with the right nutrients? Here are eight immune support vitamins and supplements to help your body help itself, so you can be your best every day. One of the most well-researched vitamins for immune system support is vitamin C. It's a powerful antioxidant that helps [protect cells](https://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/vitamins/vitamin-C) in your body from damage-causing molecules (known as free radicals). Free radicals can impair those beneficial cells (like DNA, proteins, and immune cells). That's why it's important to make sure you're getting enough vitamin C every day. Aim for [90 mg per day for men](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/vitamin-c/) and 75 mg per day for women. To help you reach those targets, focus on healthy eating habits and including vitamin C-rich fruits into your meals - such as oranges, strawberries, and tomatoes, as well as cruciferous vegetables, white potatoes, and bell peppers. Not sure if you'll be able to fit those extra veggies and fruits into your diet? Try [Nutrilite Vitamin C Extended Release](/p/109747), which has 500 mg of vitamin C for all-day immune support. This immune supplement is made with acerola cherries grown on one of the Nutrilite certified organic farms. Acerola cherries are one of nature's most concentrated forms of vitamin C. Just one serving of the Nutrilite product provides more vitamin C than seven oranges, 16 lemons, or six grapefruits! Looking for something for kids? Try [Nutrilite Kids Complete Immunity Fast-Melt Powder. ](/p/123046) You could also try [Nutrilite Twist Tubes 2GO - Immunity Health](/p/110855), which is loaded with vitamin C. Zinc is said to be one of the best vitamins for immune system support since it's required for the daily maintenance of your body's natural defenses. Our bodies don't store zinc, yet many cells in our body [depend on zinc](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2277319/) to function, which means we need a daily dose to support our bodies. Much like vitamin C, zinc is also an antioxidant, so it helps to protect cells from free radicals and oxidative stress in a similar way. So, what are healthy foods to eat that include zinc? Some options include [meat](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/zinc/), poultry, shellfish, legumes, whole grains, and even dark chocolate. Aim for 8 mg per day. But, since we can't live on chocolate alone, consider a daily supplement like [Nutrilite Immunity Defense Zinc + Holy Basil](/p/124692), which offers 20 mg of zinc and 400 mg of holy basil. The combination supports your respiratory health and provides daily support to your body's natural defenses. [Holy basil](https://www.amwayconnections.com/healthy-living/adaptogens-that-may-be-in-your-cupboard/) is considered a sacred plant in Traditional Ayurvedic Medicine that supports respiratory health as well as healthy immune function. (If you get some fresh, its peppery leaves are great for spicing up your recipes, too.) [Studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5376420/) have found that holy basil can positively impact health conditions. Vitamin D is necessary for optimal immune function. The body needs vitamin D to produce [microbe-fighting proteins](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/vitamin-d/), which can support your body against unfavorable white blood cells. Experts recommend 600 IU per day for men and 800 IU per day for women. While our bodies [produce vitamin D](https://www.amwayconnections.com/vitamins-supplements/vitamin-d-deficiency-is-more-common-than-you-may-think/) when we're exposed to the sun, not many of us can bask in the rays all day. Thankfully, you can also get your daily dose by consuming vitamin D-rich foods like fish, beef liver, egg yolks, and fortified orange juice, milks, and cereals. Not a fish fan? Try [Nutrilite Vitamin D](/p/119346) with both D3 and D2 for a powerful combination. Bonus: Nutrilite Vitamin D includes mushrooms - one of nature's most concentrated botanical sources of the nutrient - grown on a Nutricert certified farm. Essential vitamins and minerals are critical for maintaining basic immune system health. When searching for the best multivitamin for immune system health, make sure whichever option you choose includes all the vitamins your body may need. We recommend a daily supplement for you (and your little ones), like [Nutrilite Men's Daily Multivitamin Kids Multivitamin Gummy](/p/123044), to help fill nutritional gaps and give your body the extra antioxidant vitamin and mineral support needed to fight off oxidative stress. Phytonutrient support is also a key part of maintaining a healthy immune system. [Phytonutrients](https://www.amwayconnections.com/vitamins-supplements/what-are-phytonutrients/), or plant nutrients, are what give fruits and vegetables their vibrant colors. They also act as a defense mechanism to protect plants from their environment and are thought to provide similar antioxidant benefits for people. [Studies](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34239993/) have shown that certain phytonutrients can even help support the immune system against unwanted obstacles. While [experts](https://www.amwayglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/global_phytonutrient_report_commissioned_by_the_nutrilite_health_institute.pdf) have yet to find a magic number for how many phytonutrients you should consume, aim for at least 5 servings of fruits and vegetables per day. Be sure to pick up different varieties each week at the store as well, to ensure you're getting a spectrum of nutrients in your diet. To give your body an extra supply of phytonutrients, consider taking [Nutrilite Double X Vitamin/Mineral/Phytonutrient Supplement,](/p/A0244) a power-packed supplement to help support a healthy heart, brain, eyes, skin, bones - and yes, the immune system. Nutrilite Double X supplements provide phytonutrients from every color on the spectrum and 22 essential vitamins and minerals, including 222 percent of the recommended daily serving of vitamin C, 100 percent of vitamin D and 360 percent of vitamin E. Those phytonutrients offer broad and targeted antioxidant protection, helping your body proactively defend against the excess free radicals that cause oxidative stress. Another powerful antioxidant is vitamin E, which provides antioxidant protection from free radicals and supports cellular health in your body. Try to consume 15 mg per day from sources like oil, nuts, leafy greens, and vegetables like pumpkin, red bell pepper, and asparagus. Looking for a recommendation? Try [Nutrilite Chewable Vitamin E](/p/A4042) with lecithin, which makes it easier for your body to absorb the nutrient. Many people reach for echinacea to help support the body's defense system \u2014and for good reason. Echinacea is widely used by people around the world to support the body's natural resistance. While there is no set amount for how much echinacea you should take a day, you can load up on it with a supplement, like [Nutrilite Immunity Echinacea](/p/A5986). These tablets are guaranteed for purity and potency and use echinacea derived from plants grown on Nutrilite organic farms. They even have a unique triple blend of extracts clinically tested to support immune function. It's great when you want to give your body's natural resistance some added support. Supporting a healthy digestive system supports a healthy immune system. Why? About 70 percent of your body's immunity [happens in the cells in your gut](https://www.amwayconnections.com/healthy-living/what-do-probiotics-do/). It's also the place where you absorb all the nutrients we just recommended, so it's important to keep your gut running smoothly. The average dose of [probiotic intake](https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/should-you-take-probiotics) ranges from five billion to 10 billion CFU per day. Find probiotics in fermented foods, like yogurt, sauerkraut, kimchi, and sourdough bread. Or, simply add [Nutrilite Balance Within Probiotic](/p/120571) on-the-go stick packets to your food or drink for immunity and digestion support. (It has as many probiotics as a full seven bottles of kombucha!) You can also pair your probiotic with [Nutrilite Fiber Powder](/p/102736) to support gastrointestinal health and good gut balance. Your body is a complex system and keeping it in balance is key. Give your healthy diet some assistance with these supplements to support your immune system and overall health and wellness.
