I know grapefruit and alcohol have adverse effects on the drug's treatments and can lead to uncontrollabe seizure possibilities in some cases. However, in the case of weed I do not not if it does have any interference or not. So if anyone could help me here I would appreciate it.

Dilantin did not work 100% of the time to control my Absence seizures. Cannabis Does! Without the use of Pharmaceutical BS!! Some people think of Cannabis as a harmfull drug and dare to criticize it, being very ignorant. Not knowing anything about this plants potential. Judging a plant that has been around since the beginning of time.. You can make all the ASSumptions you want about cannabis.. Learn the Facts! Vaporize it! I have not had a seizure in over 3 years, not even that aura feeling. If you are sick of taking pills with more adverse effects than good. Try something thats been proven before profits and pills.

Smoking marijuana isn't going to 'wreck my brain cells' any more than the 'crap' i've had to ingest daily just to be able not to 'shake, rattle and roll' , go unconscious for long periods, maintain my position of authority in my job, and do the things you suggest.....like run for fun and lift weights and keep a positive attitude! the doc said it was a good thing and guess what ? it doesn't make the floors tilt, it doesn't make me want to hurt myself, it doesn't make me exhausted, or nauseous, it doesn't mess with my vision, etc....it does let me sleep. ...so get off the pedestal and stop judging others. to ccs123, fyi...i am a newly diagnosed seizure patient...let's just say i'm 'old enough to know better' .

Have you read about all the internal organ breakdowns the scripts cause? With every seizure, we fry something in our brain. It's a question of legality and medically correct. Since you will know the legal aspect from where you are, let's look into medically correct. Drug interaction. This is the first concern. I've been on two perscriptions by the same doctor that are NEVER to be taken together. Brothers and sisters, friends and family of E this is no picnic, fun, or joy ride. God alone knows what long term damage I carry with me. And not everyone's body chemistry is the same. One might have a good reaction, another the experiance from hell. Purity and potency of the marajuana. Plain, nothing special type should be the first research trial. Cause most of us just want something to help us relax and turn off. What non-E's can't understand is alot of us don't stop. We can't just go to sleep and escape into dreamland. I proved on my EEG that I can hit the perfect alpha wave and be wide awake. That was how I \"slept\" before drugs. So don't be judging us for looking for help wherever it can be found. I have smoked, but not for many years because I couldn't trust that I wouldn't get laced weed. I did once and I thought I was going to die. I didn't smoke for the high, but to stop the twitches, jerks, fidgeting, and get some rest. Oh and for the concerned, that was about the same amount that \"stoned\" my friends without problems. Quite frankly, I wish they would legalize and regulate marajuana for people with medical conditions. If you don't have one, you have no idea what you are saying. It can reduce pain for the cancer patients, help the blood flow to the eyes for those with eye diease, and maybe help us. I miss being able to relax. I work still and I hurt in my brain from over use than anything else. Weekends may be spent in bed because I have lost the brain capacity to lift my index finger. Don't judge.

RE: RE: RE: Epilepsy and marijuana Submitted by AvidRunner22 on Thu, 2005-02-03 - 14:11 i do believe it should be legalized for medical purposes. But would I ever use it? probably never. Not trying to peeve anyone off, but people have said \"it's just a plant.\" A lot of the main ingredients in illegal drugs ARE plants. Poppy, well we all know that's a plant. And we know that you can find that stuff in a hardcore illicit drug... Also, ephedra comes from a plant. Ephedra is so unsafe it was pulled off the shelves. I used products containing ephedra like 4 years ago before people knew how unsafe it was, and my blood pressure jumped...a lot. And the same thing with Bitter Orange root, which is also something commonly found in weight loss drugs. And there have been a lot of studies that have came out stating that it may be as dangerous in some people as ephedra. I have done a research project on medicinal marijuana for college and there are many good uses for it and like I said already, I DO think it should be legalized for medicinal purposes BUT i don't think it should be legalized for everyone. And just because it grows from the ground doesn't make it safe. Not trying to upset anyone, but that's just my opinion. U aren't going to eat fruit off of a poisonous plant are you....?
