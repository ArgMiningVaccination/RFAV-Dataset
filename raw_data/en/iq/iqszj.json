They are educated in the conventional medical sciences, however, they are not orthodox medical doctors (MDs). Education and Licensing Requirements Naturopathic doctors graduate from a four-year accredited naturopathic medical school. They must pass a national board exam (NPLEX) to practice in states that are licensed in naturopathic medicine. The American Association of Naturopathic Physicians (AANP) supports legislation to license NDs in all states to make the distinction between properly trained physicians from those who call themselves NDs without the naturopathic medical school training. What Do They Do? Naturopathic doctors treat disease and restore balance in the body through the use of the following: - Clinical nutrition - Herbal medicine - Homeopathy - Physical medicine - Counseling - [Acupuncture](/acupuncture/) - Hydrotherapy Naturopathic medicine is very effective in treating both acute and chronic diseases. The integration of conventional medicine together with naturopathic medicine provides optimum care for patients. Naturopathic doctors perform physical exams, laboratory testing, nutritional and dietary assessments, allergy testing, and other means of diagnosis. The Foundational Principles of Naturopathic Medicine Naturopathic doctors aim to find the cause of a disease rather than just treat the symptoms. The following principles are the foundation of naturopathic medicine: - The Healing Power of Nature (Vis Medicatrix Naturae) - There is a healing power within each and every one of us. Naturopathic medicine taps into this energy through the use of natural therapies. - First Do No Harm (Primum non nocere) - Naturopathic doctors use the least invasive methods of treatment in order to avoid unwanted side effects. - Find the Cause (Tolle causam)- Naturopathic doctors aim to find the underlying cause of a certain disease process. This cause can be on the physical, mental, emotional, or spiritual level. They are trained to aid the patient in getting to the core issue. - Treat the Whole Person - There are many factors, which contribute to disease. Physical, emotional, mental, environmental, dietary, lifestyle, and many others are often involved concurrently. Naturopathic doctors treat the whole person and investigate all of these factors. - Preventative Medicine - Naturopathic doctors work with the patient in their journey toward optimum health in order to prevent disease before it starts. The prevention of chronic disease is one of the major attributes of natural medicine. - Doctor as Teacher (Docere) - The naturopathic doctor's role is to teach the patient. It is essential that the patient have an understanding of the process in which they are taking part. The more a patient knows about their body and their treatment the more they become empowered. This is when true healing occurs. An [initial consultation](/new-patients/) is one hour long. During this first session, our [naturopathic doctor Maria Wansacz](/dr-maria-wansacz/) will review your past and current medical history. You will also discuss in depth your current diet and lifestyle. Dr. Maria will then decide if any testing needs to be done to further aid in your diagnosis and treatment. A personalized treatment plan will be presented and discussed with you. Patient input and compliance are crucial parts of the process. - Initial visit- one hour- $110 - Follow-up visit- 30 minutes-$55 For more information on naturopathic medicine please visit: [www.naturopathic.org](https://naturopathic.org/) Book an Appointment To schedule an appointment for naturopathic medicine Moosic, call: 570-604-2800 or send "}
