The ITHS supports novel research resources in biomedical informatics, biosta tistics, therapeutic product development and clinical research, supported by expertise in bioethics and regulatory practices. To train the next generation of researchers, the ITHS has developed multidisciplinar y educational offerings in translational research: structured training programs (pre-doctoral and post -doctoral programs) and lifelong learning programs (flexible continuing education for res earchers at any stage of their caree r). Our overarching goals are to: 1) Develop and promote multidisciplinary teams and academic-community partnerships to increase the speed and quality of translational research, 2) Train scientists to cross the interface of translational research phases, so their ideas will move more quickly to a health impact, and 3) Transform research processes and practices in our regions and the CTSA network through dissemi nation of innovative approach es and best practices. The CTSA program, both at the local level and th rough the national CTSA consortium, provides the elements needed to accelerate disc overies at the bench into tangible he alth benefits for our communities.

It provid es an excellent opportunity for IWRI to consolidate its burgeoning infrastructure and strengthen existing partners in to a vibrant, synergistic, collaborative whole. IWRI's thematic focus is on behaviorally root ed health conditions that disproportiona tely affect AIANS (e.g., cardiovascular disease, obesity, diabetes, HIV/AIDS, substance abuse, and me ntal illness). Consistent with the four main objectives of NIMHD Centers, the proposed aims of IWRI are to improve AIAN health and eliminate health disparities by: (1) developing an integrated, comprehensive, and centralized trans-disciplinary research infr astructure that builds on the successes of IWRI's research, training activities, and comm unity capacity building; (2) cultivating existing and establishing novel partnerships with AIAN tribal communities and other organizations to facilitate truly collaborative research; (3) developing new and enhanc ing existing research training activities at IWRI that prepare researchers to conduct scientifically rigorous and cultu rally grounded health research; and (4 ) strengthening and consolidating AIAN engagement, outreach and in stitutional partnerships.

Task Force on Multicultural Soci al Work Education, Univ ersity of Michigan National Mentorship Programs From 1996 to the present, I have served as a mentor to over 70 scholars (90% scholars of color or sexual minority scholars) including: 40 doctoral students (16 of whom ar e Native American), 8 post-docs (6 Native), 7 junior faculty (3 Native), and 14 pre-masters students (9 Native ). Additionally, because there are less than a dozen American Indian or Alaska Native RO1-level investigators in the country, my career has been filled with mentorship activities and obligations. I am formally involved in 09 national research training programs for underrepresented racial and ethnic minorities at the pre and post-doctoral levels including the following: Indigenous HIV/AIDS Research Training Mexico Mentorship and Educati on Program in Health Services Research- MEP (R25 MH60288- Howard Waitzkin, PI); Network for Mu lticultural Research on Health and Healthcare (UCLA Robert Wood Johnson Health and Healthcar e Networking Program-Directors: Bill Vega and Michael A.

At the international level, my Fulbright obligation included mentorship activ ities with pre-and post-doctoral Maori scholars. My mentorship leadership was recently recognized in the UW School of Social Work where, this year, I was awarded the UW Doctoral Mentor Award. Recognition for my ment orship activities also is evident by my being nominated at least two times for the UW Distinguis hed Graduate Mentor Award and for receiving, the Professor of the Year Award at the School of Social Work at Columbia University in 2000. Finally, I am currently continuing mentorship activities in the following training programs: (1). Indigenous HIV/AIDS Research Training (IHART) Program (R25MH084565-01 -Walters- PI) . IHART will train 14 NIMH-funded junior, mid, and senior career research scientists in the area of HIV/AIDS and mental health preven tion through an intensive 27-month mentorship program comprising a 2- day winter roundtable; a 2-week summer training institute; year-round multidisciplinary learning opportunities; seed funding as well as statistical, admini strative, editoria l, and technical assistance for developing grant applications. I am the PI of this program and serve as a mentor as well. We have just begun recruiting into this program and ha d a successful preliminary workshop with 14 potential Native and UREM applicant fellows at the INIHKD co nference in May, 2010. I have already informally mentored at least 6 potential fellows in prep aration for recruitment into this program.
