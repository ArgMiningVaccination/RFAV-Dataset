ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The \"Guidelines for Use of Health Care Professionals and Health Care Procedures in a School Setting \" written in 200 7 and the supplemental \"Guidelines for the Emergency Use of Anti -Seizure Medication in Tennessee Schools \" written in 2009 were combined and revised by the Tennessee Departments of Health and Education . In 2014 a group of expert stake holders was formed to review both documents and current related laws to mak e recommendations . There was an initial face -to-face meeting with all stakeholders to plan and discuss the structure of the guidelines ; subsequently three smaller workgroups were formed to focus on disease specific topics. The smaller focused workgroups m et during three all -day meetings to review proposed recommendations and make revisions. The final draft was sent to the Board of N ursing for comment and review in December 2014 then distributed statewide by the Depart ment of E ducation. Periodic review and updates will be scheduled and revision will be made as needed.

INTRODUCTION The Tennessee Department of Education in collaboration with the Tennessee Department of Health has developed guidelines to assist Tennessee public school districts and non-public schools when developing policies and procedures to meet the diverse health ca re needs of students in school settings. The intent of the guidelines is to give direction to local school systems to adhere to state law. The guidelines have been written according to nationally recognized standards established by the National Association of School Nurses and the National Counci l of State Boards of Nursing, and in accordance with the \"Tennessee Nurse Practice Act.\" The Guidelines for Use of Health Care Professionals and Health Care Procedures in a School Setting details the following areas: Federal and State Requirements Health C are Procedures and Medication Administration (including Asthma -Reliever Inhaler) First Aid Emergencies Diabetes Management Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Management Seizure Management To be successful, a coordinated school health program requires collaboration among staff within the school district and community members representing the various components of the coordinated school health model . The guidelines define the roles of school personnel within Diabetes, Food Allergy and Seizure management sections. Health Assessment and Individual Health Plan : Any child with acute or chronic health issues should have a health assessment completed by a registered nurse . As warranted by the child's condition or diagnosis, an Individual Health Plan (IHP) will be completed by the registered nurse and reviewed annually or sooner as needed . An IHP helps to ensure that all necessary information, needs and plans are considered to maximize the student's participation and performance in school. The IHP also covers other aspects of care such as a student's knowledge about their condition, self -care abilities and any modifications needed to enhance learning and prevent emergencies. Benefits of an IHP include: quality assurance of school nursing services, continuity of care and development of a safer delegation process of nursing in the school setting . The National Association of School Nurses (NASN) position statement defines the IHP as a written document based on the nursing process. Development of the IHP by the school nurse provides a framework for meeting these clinical and administrative needs: Demonstrates Standard of School Nursing Practice Documents the Nursing Process Provides Legal Documenta tion Clarifies Clinical Practice Provides Administrative Information Becomes the Foundation for Health Portion of Other Educational Plans and Emergency Plans The student Emergency Plan (Emergency Care Plan or Emergency Action Plan) is developed based on th e IHP, and is written in clear action steps and provided to school staff to assist them in responding to a health crisis. Page 4 of 120 Annual Reporting: T.C.A. \u00a7 49 -5-415 requires the departments of education and health to jointly compile an annual report. The report should include data related to the self -administration of medications and health care procedures including the administration of medications to students served in all public and non -public accredited schools in Tennessee. Each year the Department of Education will distribute a form , designed by the Departments of Health and Education , to both public and non -public school systems to collect t he data and other school health information . This form should be submitted at the end of each school year . Reports can be found at: http://www.tn.gov/education/health_safety/reports.shtml Page 5 of 120 D. FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) , Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) require that each student with disabiliti es attending public school be able to participate fully in the academic program. Specifically, this means that students must have access to necessary health care during the school day and for school -sponsored activities, even when they occur outside regula r school hours. These laws require that health services for complex student health needs be provided so that students can access their education. Access to emergency medications, such as glucagon is critical and vital to the effectiveness of these life -saving interventions. In addition to other needs, students with diabetes require management of injectable medications (insulin and glucagon) for use during school and school -sponsored activities. (NASN, AAP) . Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) specify when student health information may be shared and when it may not. FERPA protects the confidentiality of student health information. Student health information must be kept private except for situations \"where disclosure serves a compelling purpos e\", is required by law or when parental permission is obtained. Occupational S afety and Health Administration (OSHA), a regulatory agency within the U.S. Departme nt of Labor, requires schools to meet safety standards set forth by this agency. These standa rds include the need for procedures to address possible exposure to blood -borne pathogens. Schools are also required to maintain a clean and healthy environment. They must adhere to Universal Precautions designed to reduce the risk of transmission of blood -borne pathogens, which include the use of barriers such as surgical gloves and other protective measures, such as needle disposal, when dealing with blood and other body fluids or tissues. Confidentiality: Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) was enacted by Congress in 1996 to, among other things , improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the health care system through the establishment of n ational standards and requirements for electronic health care transactions and to protect the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information. The HIPAA Privacy Rule requires covered entities to protect individuals' health records and other iden tifiable health information by requiring appropriate safeguards to protect privacy, and setting limits and conditions on the uses and disclosures that may be made of such info rmation without patient authori zation. The rule also gives patients' r ights over their health information, including rights to examine and obtain a copy of their health records, and to request corrections . (HIPAA 2008). Page 6 of 120 E. STATE REQUIREMENTS 1996 Guidelines were initially approved by the Tennessee Board of Nursing and the Sta te Board of Education for implementation during the 1996 -97 school year . The guidelines provide information for compliance with Tennessee Code Annotated (\"T.C.A .\") \u00a7 49-5-415 which requires certain health care procedures, including the administration of medications during the school day or at related events, to be performed by appropriately licensed health care professionals. 2002 T.C.A . \u00a7 49-5-415 (b) was amended to allow \"...school personnel who volunteer under no duress or pressure and who have been pro perly trained by a registered nurse\" to administer Glucagon in the event of a diabet es emergency in the absence of the school nurse. The guidelines were revised to address this change in law and to provide further clarification for medical and nursing proc edures performed in the school setting. 2004 T.C.A . \u00a7 49-5-415 was amended to \"permit possession and -administration of a prescribed, metered dosage, asthma -reliever asthmatic . \u00a7 49-5-415 was amended to \"permit school personnel to volunteer to assist with the care of students with diabetes , excluding the administration of insulin;\" as a volunteer; T.C.A . \u00a7 49-3-359 was amended so that each public school nurse employed or contracted by an LEA will maintain current CPR certification consistent with the guidelines of the American Heart Association ; T.C.A . \u00a7 49-6-5004 was amended to authorize health care professionals to indicate the need for a dental or vision screening on any report or form used in relationship to reporting immunization status for a child. Health care professionals shall provide a copy of the report or form to the parents or guardian s indicating the need to seek appropriate follow up. 2008 T.C.A . \u00a7 49-5-415 was amended to allow school staff, who under no duress, volunteer to be trained in the administration of anti -seizure medication, including diazepam rectal gel as prescribed by a l icensed health care provider. 2013 T.C.A . \u00a7 49-5-415 was amended to provide that each school is authorized to maintain at least two epinephrine auto -injectors so that epinephrine may be administered to any student believed to be having a life -threatening allergic or anaphylactic reaction. 2014 T.C.A . \u00a7 49-5-415 (b) was amended to allow \"...school personnel who volunteer under no duress or pressure and who have b een properly trained by a registered nurse\" to administer daily insulin to a student based on the s tudent's individual health plan in the absence of the school nurse. The guidelines were revised to address this change in law and to provide further clarific ation for medical and nursing procedures performed in the school setting. Page 7 of 120 F. SCHOOL NURSING ROLES This section seeks to differentiate the practice of registered nurses (RNs) from that of licensed practical nurses (LPNs). This information is provided in order to ensure students' health and safety as well as to help superintendents, principals, school staff, and school health personnel understand the differences in the roles of the RN, the LPN and other individ uals in the school setting who are assigned responsibility for health care . The school nurse is a professional licensed registered nurse meeting the licensing requirements of the Tennessee Department of Health. As part of the school education team, school nurses manage the school health services in collaboration with their supervising personnel, principal and superintendent. It is not feasible in many schools to have a school nurse always present ; therefore schools must make use of appropriately trained anc illary personnel to meet students' health related needs. The school administration is responsible for implemen ting policies and practices to e nsure the safety of students. Therefore, it is important to assure that: Any staff assigned health related tasks are working within their job descriptions and within their scope of practice, Any licensed professional is supervised by the proper authority, o This is especially appropriate in the case of the LPN where the Nurse Practice Act specifically requires supervision by the physician, dentist or registered nurse (T.C.A. \u00a7 63-7-108). Any unlicensed person providing health related tasks receives appropriate training by a qualified professional, and that The unlicensed individual staff i s competent to carry out the assigned task. The scopes of practice of RNs and LPNs are not interchangeable and such practices expose schools to potential litigation. The RN is the professional nurse in school setting who may independently, within the scope, triage, assess students, interpret clinical student data, develop nursing care plans, and make decisions regarding student nursing care. An LPN does not meet the professional requirements for licensure as a registered nurse. A. Role of the Registered Nu rse: Manages the school health services in compliance with school district policy. Functions in accordance with the Standards of Professional School Nursing Practice, the Nurse Practice Act, and Federal and State statutes that impact school nursing practi ce. Provides information to the school board and school administrators as they develop school health policies and procedures. Provides health related training to school personnel. Provides preventive health services to students including health educatio n, screening, consultation and referrals. Provides nursing assessments and nursing diagnoses and develops plans of care for students needing health and nursing interventions. Implements interventions within the plan of care directly, through delegation, o r through the provision of oversight and coordination to other responsible staff based on consideration of health, safety, and welfare of the student. Coordinates in -school health care with the student's health care provider , the school -based health center , and other providers/staff as necessary and appropriate. Page 8 of 120 Is responsible for determining appropriate delegation of health related tasks or coordination and oversight: o The Nurse Practice Act authorizes Registered Professional Nurses to delegate tasks to Licensed Practical Nurses. o Delegation and coordination/oversight of health related tasks/services must be determined on an individual basis. Factors to be considered for delegation and/or coordination and oversight include safety, acuity of the student, stability of the condition of the student, training and capability of the staff, and nature of the task. o The registered nurse must exercise professional judgment in determining delegation or coordination/oversight activities. Coordination and oversight of licensed health care professional (s) employed or contracted by the LEA . Training should include initial, annual and periodic review of skills competency. Coordinati on and oversight of unlicensed assistive personnel /school personnel volunteer . o Identify the student's needs and develop/consult the plan of care. o Identify the tasks to be performed by the school personnel volunteer . o Provide direction and training to the school personnel volunteer . o Determine the ability of the unlicensed staff to perform the task. o Monitor the designated staff's reporting and documentation of the task. o Ensure that designated staff reports directly to the registered nurse for the performa nce of the task. B. Role of the Licensed Practical Nurse and other Medical Personnel : May assist the r egistered nurse with specified health tasks. May assume health related responsibilities only when those responsibilities do not require independent, specialized nursing knowledge, skill, or judgment including assessment and evaluation of student health outcomes and only when those responsibilities have standardized protocols and procedures leading to a predictable outcome. Must re ceive appropriate annual training and demonstrate competency on the specific task to be performed before accepting the task. Must work under the direction of a registered nurse in providing school health services . Must function within their scope of pract ice including medication administration. C. Role of the Unlicensed Assistive Personnel (UAP) /School Personnel who Volunteer : May assist the registered nurse in carrying out specified tasks that do not require independent, specialized nursing knowledge, skill, or judgment including assessment and evaluation of student health outcomes and health counseling or teaching. (Examples of appropriate tasks include assistance with vision and hearing screenings and assist with self -administration of medication .) Must receive appropriate training on the specific task to be performed before accepting it. Must comply with policies, procedures, and health care plans as directed. Must report to and receive oversight from the School Nurse (RN) regarding assigned tasks. Must carry out assigned tasks as directed and document all tasks. Volunteer school personnel may also, with appropriate training, administer emergency medications, such as Diastat \u00ae (Diazepam ), glucagon, insulin and epinephrine . Page 9 of 120 G. HEALTH CARE PROCEDURE S AND MEDICATION ADMIN ISTRATION The provisions of Tennessee Code Annotated, Section 49 -5-415 (a)(2) state that health care procedures including administration of medication to students during the day or at related events shall be performed by appropriately licensed health care professionals in accordance with applicable guidelines of their respective regulatory boards and in conformity with policies and rules of local boards of education or governing boards of non-public schools . The student's parent or guardian must give permission in writing for appropriately licensed health care professionals to perform health care procedures. The written permission must be kept in the student's school records. T.C.A. \u00a7 49-5-415 (a)(3) requir es that a ny person assisting in self -administration of medication or performing health care procedures, including administration of medications under this section, and any local board of education or governing board for a non-public school authorizing the self-administration of medications or the performance of health care procedures shall not be liable in any court of law for injury resulting from the reasonable and prudent assistance in the self -administration of such medication or the reasonable performa nce of the health care procedures, including administration of medications, if performed pursuant to the policies and guidelines developed by the Departments of Health and Education and approved by applicable regulatory or governing boards or agencies. HEALTH CARE PROCEDUR ES G.1 The purpose of assisting with or performing health care procedures in school is to help each child maintain an optimal state of health to enhance his or her education. Nothing in the guidelines requires schools to assist students wit h procedures. However, any school which provides such assistance is required to follow these guidelines. School nursing staff and any other school personnel, including transportation personnel, who perform or assist with procedures which may involve blood borne pathogens, must receive annual training on blood borne pathogens and be offered the hepatitis B series of vaccinations if employee is determined to be at risk for potential exposure. Furthermore, the employer must provide all appropriate personal pro tective equipment (PPE). Suggested PPE in the school setting includes gloves, face shield, apron/gown and goggles. A mouth -to-mouth shield should also be available for use by those staff properly trained and certified in its use, i.e. emergency response/CP R/first aid trained employees. Exam quality, non -latex, powder free gloves must also be available for students or staff with a known or potential sensitivity to latex. PROCEDURES DONE BY LICENSED HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONAL T.C.A. \u00a7 49-5-415 requires that a licensed health care professional perform any health care procedure a student is not capable or competent to perform. Procedures should be documented and show compliance with standard nursing guidelines. Documentation should include the nam e of the procedure , name of the person performing the procedure, date, time, results of the procedure or the reason procedure was omitted. A prescriber's orders and parental authorization are required for any health care procedures performed by a licensed health care professional in the school setting. There are certain health care procedures that may only be provided by a licensed health care professional. Urinary catheterizations and tube feedings are two such procedures. The Tennessee Nurse Practice Act regulates this type of nursing care for both the RN and LPN. Page 10 of 120 Although nurses can legally perform procedures, there are trends in health care that can impact technology, interventions, treatments, and equipment being utilized daily that may be unfamiliar t o the nurse in the school setting ( i.e. insulin pumps). These changes can also i mpact the nurse's responsibilities. Specific orientation or training regarding a procedure or equipment may be required. At the beginning of the school year and periodically a s needed an LEA should determine the types of health care procedures that may be performed in their schools. With those specific procedures in mind, an initial, annual and periodic review of the skills competency evaluation should be performed by the licen sed health care professional employed or contracted by the LEA. The evaluation should be maintained by the School Nurse (RN) or principal. Suggested Training Resource for Health care Procedures Wisconsin Improving School Health Services Project (WISHeS) : A collaborative project between the Wisconsin Public Health Association and the Medical College of Wisconsin aimed at improving school health services (www.wishesproject.org ). The tool lists health care procedur es for the urinary, respiratory, digestive, endocrine and cardiovascular systems that could be performed in a school setting. Each procedure (i.e. ostomy care) lists considerations, supplies, resourc es, reference and detailed step -by-step instructions. PROCEDURES DONE BY STUDENTS WITHOUT ASSISTANCE If a student has been taught to perform his/her own procedure and does not need assistance, space must be made available for the student to perform this task. If a student is performing an invasive procedure, that student should have a minimal bi -annual nursing assessment of competency and proficiency as well as an IHP. Physician's orders and parental authorization are highly recommended but are not required for procedures done by a student without assistance. It is not the intent to make a child or adolescent feel the school system or School Nurse (RN) is attempting to remove personal choice or ability to manage medications or procedures. Every attempt should be made on an individual basis to allow a child who i s independent to continue self -management. It is prudent for the student and the nurse to work out a method of reporting or asking for assistance on an as needed basis. PROCEDURES DONE BY STUDENTS WITH ASSISTANCE FROM THE UNLICENSED ASSISTIVE PERSONNEL An IHP that includes a nursing assessment, physician's orders, and parental authorization are required . The nursing assessment will determine whether or not unlicensed assistive personnel (UAP ) can assist the student with a procedure . Appropriate training and demonstrat ion of competency on the specific task must be perform ed prior to providing assistance . Once trained to provide a specialized health service for one student, he/she cannot perform that same service for another student without receiving delegated authority and training from the School Nurse (RN). ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING Those activities that are commonly deemed to be activities of daily living (ADL) do not need to be performed by a licensed health care professional. Activities that can be performed by unlicensed assistive personnel or a teaching assistant may include but are not limited to: Toileting Bathing Diapering Dressing Feeding Transferring Positioning Application and removal of protective and supportive devices Recording intake and output Vital signs Page 11 of 120 In general, nursing assessment, physician's orders and parental authorization are not needed for ADL's, although some of the listed items may require a check off or competency evaluation by a registered nurse or therapist. ADMIN ISTRATION OF MEDICATI ON G.2 The purpose of administering medications in school is to help each child maintain an optimal state of health to enhance his or her education. Medications should be limited to those required during school hours and necessary to provide the student access to the educational program. The intent of the guidelines is to reduce the number of medications given in school, yet assure the safe administration of medications for those students who require them. Nothing in the guidelines requires schools to assist students with self -administration of medications or procedures. However, any school which provides such assistance is required to follow these guidelines. Some alternatives for medication administration include: Work with the licensed prescriber and the parent(s) o r guardian to adjust medication administration time so administration is not needed during the school hours. Hire a registered nurse or contract with a local community agency, e.g., local health department, home health agency, or local hospital, for a registered nurse to come into the school and administer medications. Allow a parent, guardian, or parental adult designee, per local school system policy and as determined by IHP, 504 Plan, IEP or other education plan, to come to the school to administer medic ation to their child. LEAs are encouraged to have on hand certain products, such as eye wash, for first aid purposes. If such products are kept, they, along with any student medications, should be monitored and stored under proper temperatures according to pharmacy or manufacturer guidance in order to maintain efficacy. If it is discovered that storage temperatures fell, at any time, outside the manufacturer's recommendations for more than a few hours, the products should be discarded and not used for stude nts. For all Prescription and Non -Prescription medications , a written request shal l be obtained from the parent or guardian requesting that medication be given during school hours. It is the parent's or guardian's responsibility to ensure that the written request and medication are brought to the school. Local school board policies related to \"Zero Tolerance\" may r equire all medications, prescription and non - prescription, be brought to school and delivered to appropriate or designated school personnel by a responsible a dult. The written request must state that the child is competent to self -administer the medication with assistance. All Prescription M edications (including CAM's - complementary and alternative medicines, if LEA permits) given at school shall: Be prescribed by a licensed prescriber on an individual basis as determined by the child's health status. Be brought to school in the original, pharmacy labeled container. The container shall display: o Child's name o Prescription number o Medication name and dosage o Administration route or other directions Page 12 of 120 o Date o Licensed prescriber's name o Pharmacy name, address, and pho ne number Require a written parental/guardian request which shall be kept in the student's school records and include: o Child's name o Name and address of parent/guardian o Name of medication, dose, route, time of administration o Discontinuation date o Reason medication is needed o Parent /guardian current phone number in case of emergency Be renewed at least annually. Have each dose of medication documented and the documentation easily retrievable. Documentation shall include date, frequency, time, dosage, route and the signature of the person administering or assisting the student in in self -administration . Have written authorization from the lic ensed prescriber and parent when there are changes in the prescription medication . The change will be noted on the medication administration record (MAR) without obliterating the previous information. Only an RN or LPN can make changes on the MAR. Changes can include but are not limited to: time, dose, addition, discontinuation, etc. All Non -Prescription M edications (excluding CAM) given in school shall : Be brought in with the original label listing the ingredients, dose schedule, and child's name affixed to the container . Require a written parental/guardian request which shall be kept in the student's school records and include: o Child's name o Name and address of parent/guardian o Name of medication, dose, route, time of administration o Discontinuation date o Reason medication is needed o Parent /guardian current phone number in case of emergency Have e ach dosage of medication documented and the documentation easily retrievable. Documentation shall include date, frequency, time, dosage, route and the signature of the person administering or assisting the student in in self -administration. STORAGE All individual students' medications, except those exempted by law, must be put in a leak proof container and stored in a secure or locked area . Each medication should be stored in the original pharmacy or manufacturer labeled container with the student's name on it. Medications must be kept no longer than the expiration date or end of the school year, whichever is sooner. Access to stored medication and medication cabinet keys must be limited to school personnel authorized to administer medications. It is recommended that if a medication requires refrigeration, it should be stored under proper temperatures according to the pharmacy or manufacturer guidance and in a locked r efrigerator or in a locked container in a refrigerator specifically for medications. It is also recommended to keep a certified, calibrated thermometer in the refrigerator. If it is suspected or discovered that storage temperatures fell, at any Page 13 of 120 time, outsi de the manufacturer's recommendations, for more than a few hours, the products should be discarded and not used for students. Emergency medications such as the Glucagon kit and the Epinephrine kit must be kept in a secure area near the student and readily available for timely, emergency use. The student's Individual Health Plan (IHP) will determine availability and parameters for use of emergency medications. ADMINISTRATION Certain guiding principles are mandatory when dealing with medication administratio n, the most important of which is being sure to follow the five \"R's\" of administration. These simple but important guidelines help assure that the correct person is given the intended medication in the prescribed amount at the correct time and in the proper way. Ensuring medication safety requires that health care providers identify and confirm the following facts prior to administering any me diation and/or treatment : 1) Right patient (student) 2) Right drug or treatment 3) Right dose 4) Right time 5) Right route of administration Schedule II controlled substances, e.g. Ritalin, as with any other medication , should be stored in a secure or locked area and inventoried upon receipt by the person routinely administering it. When administered, each dosage of medication shall be documented. If at the end of the medication regimen a count discrepancy is noted, it should be reported to the school nurse to enable further investigation. Self -Administration of Medication: The provisions of Tennessee C ode Annotated, Section 49 -5-415(a) state that a local board of education or a governing board for a non -public school may permit an employee or a person under contract to the board to assist in self -administration of medications, under the following condit ions: (1)(A) The student must be competent to self -administer nonprescription or prescription medication with assistance; (B) The student's condition, for which the medication is authorized or prescribed, must be stable; (C) The self -administration of the medication must be properly documented; (D) Guidelines, not inconsistent with this section, for the assistance in self -administration of nonprescription or prescription medications by personnel in the school setting, developed by the Departments of Health and Education and approved by the board of nursing, must be followed; (E) The student's parent or guardian must give permission in writing for school personnel to assist with self -administration of medications. The written permission shall be kept in the student's school records; and (F) Assistance with self -administration shall primarily include storage and timely distribution of medication. All training of school personnel providing assistance with self -administration of medications shall be done by a registered nurse employed or contracted by the local school system. Training for school personnel in the assistance with self -administration of medications shall be repeated annually, and competencies shall be documented in the employee personnel file. It i s strongly recommended that backup personnel be trained for each school site. Page 14 of 120 T.C.A. \u00a7 49-5-415 (a)(3) requires that a ny person assisting in self -administration of medication or performing health care procedures, including administration of medications under this section, and any local board of education or governing board for a nonpublic school authorizing the self - admin istration of medications or the performance of health care procedures shall not be liable in any court of law for injury resulting from the reasonable and prudent assistance in the self - administration of such medication or the reasonable performance of the health care procedures, including administration of medications, if performed pursuant to the policies and guidelines developed by the Departments of Health and Education and approved by applicable regulatory or governing boards or agencies. Guidelines f or Assistance with Self -Administration of Medication: Medications should be limited to those required during school hours and necessary to maintain the student's enrollment and attendance in school. The student should be able to identify his or her medication , the reason the medication is used and be competent to self -administer the authorized and/or prescribed medication with assistance. The individual assisting with medication self -administration must visually observe the stude nt self -administer the medication OR in the case of a cognitively competent but physically challenged student, perform that portion of self -administration for which the student is physically incapable. Each dosage of medication shall be documented and the documentation easily retrievable. Documentation shall include date, frequency, time, dosage, route and the signature of the person assisting the student in self -administration. In the event a dosage is not administered as ordered (e.g. missed dose) or any other medication error occurs, a Medication Error Form must be filled out and routed to the appropriate administrative person in the local school system or routed per the protocol of a contracted agency. The School Nurse (RN) and parent/guardian must be no tified in the event of a medication error. A procedure shall be established for providing communication with the parent(s) or guardian regarding any problems with administration of the medication. To assure safety and accountability, nursing supervision sh all be provided to personnel assisting with the self -administration of medication to insure local school board policies and state guidelines are being followed. DISCARDING The parent or guardian shall be responsible at the end of the treatment regimen for removing any unused medication from the school. When the duration of a medication is complete or out of date, the parent/guardian shall be advised to pick up the medication . After notification attempts per local school system policy, if not picked up in 14 days, the medication shall be destroyed per local environmental protocol by the School Nurse (RN) or School Administrator , documented and witnessed by at least one other s chool staff person. Page 15 of 120 Asthma -Reliever Inhaler G.2.a The provisions of Tennessee Code Annotated, Section 49 -5-415 (c) states that an LEA must permit possession and self -administration of a prescribed, metered dosage, asthma -reliever inhaler by any student with asthma if the student's parent or guardian: Provides to the school written authorization f or student possession and self -administration and Provides a written statement from the prescribing health care practitioner that the student is diagnosed with asthma and has been instructed in self -administration of the prescribed, metered dosage, asthma -reliever inhaler. The statement must also contain the following information : i. The name and purpose of the medication . ii. The prescribed dosage . iii. The time or times the pres cribed inhaler is to be regularly administered, as well as any additional special circumstances under which the inhaler is to be administered . iv. The length of time for which the inhaler is prescribed. These statements shall be kept on file in the office of t he School Nurse (RN) or school administrator. The LEA shall inform the student's parent or guardian that the school and its employees and agents shall incur no liability as a result of any injury sustained by the student or any other person from possession of self -administration of the inhaler. The student's parent or guardian shall sign a statement acknowledging that the school shall incur no liability and the parent or guardian shall indemnify and hold harmless the school and its employees against any cl aims relating to the possession or self -administration of the inhaler. The permission for self -administration of the prescribed, metered dosage, asthma -reliever inhaler shall be effective for the school year in which it is granted and must be renewed each following school year upon fulfilling the requirements set forth in these guidelines. The LEA may suspend or revoke the student's possession and self -administration privileges if the student misuses the inhaler or makes the inhaler available for usage by a nother person. Upon fulfilling the requirements set forth in these guidelines, a student with asthma may possess and use the prescribed, metered dose, asthma -reliever inhaler when at school, at a school -sponsored activity, or before or after normal school activities while on school property, including school - sponsored child care or before or after school programs. Students with asthma must have an Individual Health Plan (IHP) developed by the School Nurse (RN) . The IHP can serve as the Asthma Action Plan. T here should be a mechanism to include self -reporting of reliever inhaler use and frequency that can be documented on the student MAR and included in the annual report. A sample action plan is available at American Lung Association: http://www.lung.org/lung -disease/asthma/ . Page 16 of 120 H. FIRST AID EMERGENCIE S The provision of Tennessee Code Annotated, Section 49 -5-414 states every public elementary and secondary school in this state is encouraged to have in its employ, or as a volunteer, at least one (1), preferably more, persons who are currently certified by the American Red Cross or another qualified certifying agency appro ved by the department of education, as qualified to administer emergency first aid and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). The local board of education is authorized to allocate up to six and one half (6.5) hours a year of in -service days established purs uant to T.C.A. \u00a7 49 -6-3004 to conduct training programs for teachers and other personnel who have expressed an interest in becoming qualified to administer emergency first aid and CPR. In addition, T.C.A . \u00a7 49-3-359 states that each public school nurse employed by an LEA shall maintain current certification through a certifying cardiopulmonary resuscitation course consistent with the scientific guidelines of the American Heart Association in collaboration with the International Liaison Committee on Resusci tation . The following conditions may require first aid and/or immediate emergency care provided by a school staff person. Examples of conditions and school staff interventions may include but are not limited to: Seizures: vagal nerve s timulator magnet, emergency seizure protocol Respiratory distress: reliever inhaler, assisted nebulizer treatment, rescue breathing Bleeding: pressure to site, elevation, shock prevention Choking: Heimlich maneuver Fainting: protect from injury, elevated feet Heat/cold eme rgency: application of blanket, ice pack Major Trauma: activate EMS, airway management Hypoglycemic emergency: Glucagon injection if training completed Cardiac arrest: CPR, activate EMS Allergic reaction: epinephrine auto-injector if training completed School personnel must respond appropriately in any emergency situation. Children with known health problems or certain diagnoses should have an Individual Health Plan (IHP) that includes emergency care procedures, a nursing assessment, physician's orders, and parental authorization. In addition, it is recommended that the school protocol include parental or guardian notification, School Nurse (RN) notification, and activation of EMS as appropriate for any emergency situation. EXEMPTIONS BY LAW : EMERGENCY PR OCEDURES BY TRAINED PER SONNEL H.1 Tennessee law permits certain emergency procedures to be performed by school personnel with appropriate training. Those laws include: Diazepam Gel: T.C.A. \u00a7 49-5-415 provides th at \". . . school personnel who volunteer under no duress or pressure and who have been properly trained by a registered nurse employed or contracted by th e LEA or governing board for a non-public school may administer anti -seizure m edications, including diazepam gel, to a student in an emergency situation base d on that student's IHP. . .\" The Departments of Health and Education shall jointly amend guide lines to reflect the appropriate procedures for use by registered nurses in training volunteer school personnel to administer anti -seizure medicati ons to a student in an Page 17 of 120 emergency situation. The guidelines sha ll require at least one school employee to serve as a witness when a volu nteer administers anti -seizure medication during an emergency situation, unl ess a witness is not available within the tim e limit for administration spec ified in the IHP. Training to administer anti -seizure medication shall be repeated annually. Training is outlined in the Seizure section of the guidelines. Epinephrine: T.C.A. \u00a7 68-140 -310 allows any lay person eighteen ( 18) years and older who has been trained to administer epinephrine in emergency situations, and T.C.A. \u00a7 49-5-415 authorizes schools to maintain epinephrine auto -injector s in a secure, unlocked location and authorizes trained school personnel to administer epi nephrine to any student believed to be having a life -threatening allergic or anaphylactic reaction. The statute authorizes a physician to prescribe epinephrine auto -injector s in the name of an LEA or non -public school for such use. Training is outlined in the Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis section of the guidelines. Glucagon: T.C.A. \u00a7 49-5-415 provides that \"...school personnel who volunteer under no duress or pressure and who have been properly trained by a registered nurse employed or contracted by the local education agency [emphasis added] may administer Glucagon in emergency situations and may administer daily insulin to a student based on that student's Individual Health Plan (IHP). ...Training to administer Glucagon shall be repeated annually and competenci es shall be documented in the employee's personnel file.\" No school system is required to have volunteer school staff trained to administer Glucagon. This is a choice each school system will make based on their needs and the availability of school staff wh o volunteer. Training is outlined in the Diabetes section of the guidelines. Page 18 of 120 I. DIABETES OVERVIEW Tennessee Code Annotated, Section 49 -5-415(d )(3) states that all school nurses must be educated in diabetes care and have knowledge of the guidelines. School personnel, who volunteer under no duress to assist with the care of students with diabetes, must receive training pursuant to the guidelines from a school RN. The school RN may use certified diabetes educators and licensed nutritionists to assist with the training. All training must be renewed on an annual basis and competency must be noted in the personnel file. No school personnel shall be required to volunteer for the training. School personnel may not be reprimanded, subject to any adverse employment ac tion, or punished in any manner for refusing to volunteer. Per T.C.A. 49-5-415 (d)(7 ): Upon written request of the parent or guardian, and if included in the student's medical management plan and in the Individual Health Plan ( IHP), a student with diabetes shall be permitted to perform blood glucose checks, administer insulin, treat hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia and otherwise attend to the care and management of the student's diabetes in any area of the school or school grounds and at any school -related activity, and shall be permitted to possess on the student's person at all times all necessary diabetes monitoring and treatment supplies, including sharps. Any sharps involved in diabetes care and management for a student shall be s tored in a secure but accessible location, including on the student's person, until use of the sharps is appropriate. Use and disposal of sharps shall be in compliance with the guidelines set forth by the Tennessee Occupational Safety and Health Administ ration (TOSHA). Diabetes is considered a disability under federal law. Under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, it is illegal to discriminate against a person with a disability. Children with diabetes must have full access to all activities, serv ices, or benefits provided by public schools. A local education agency shall not assign a student with diabetes to a school other than the school for which the student is zoned or would otherwise regularly attend because the student has diabetes. The foll owing persons shall not be liable in any court of law for injury resulting from reasonable assistance with the care of students with diabetes if performed pursuant to these guidelines: Any School Nurse (RN) who provides the training. Any person who is trai ned and whose competency is indicated in such person's personnel file. Any local board of education or governing board for a non -public school that authorized school personnel to volunteer to assist with the care of students with diabetes. STUDENT HEALTH PLANS AND CARE PLANS It is recommended that the School Nurse (RN) develops an Individualized Health Plan (IHP) in collaboration with the student, parent/guardian, student's health care provider and other school staff. The student's IHP should include as applicable, information from the Diabetes Medical Management Plan (DMMP) , Diabetes Emergency Care Plan s, and Individualized Education Plan (IEP) , as well as documents such as plans for e vents outside the usual school day and protocols for the appropriate disposal of materials that come in contact with blood. Plan information should be reviewed and updated each school year or upon a change in the student's prescribed regimen, level of self -management, school circumstances (e.g., a change in schedule) or at the request of the student or parents/guardian. Use of t he following information is essential in the development of a student's IHP: Date of diagnosis Page 19 of 120 Current health status Emergency co ntact information Student's willingness and ability to perform self -management tasks at school List of diabetes equipment and supplies Specific medical orders o Blood glucose monitoring o Insulin, glucagon, and other medications to be given at school o Mea l and snack plan o Exercise requirements o Additional monitoring Typical signs, symptoms, and prescribed treatment for hypoglycemia Typical signs, symptoms, and prescribed treatment for hyperglycemia The DMMP is completed by the student's parents/guardians and the health care provider and is the medical basis for an IHP. It generally includes how to recognize and treat hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia as well as specific orders for blood glucose monitori ng, administration of insulin and the steps to take in an emergency. The emergency plan of care for hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia , based on the DMMP, summarize s how to recognize and treat hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia and who to contact for help. The School Nurse (RN) will coordinate development of these plans. An e mergency plan of care should be completed for each student with diabetes and should be copied and distributed to all school personnel who have responsibility for students with diabetes durin g the school day and during school -sponsored activities. Consider laminating these plans for use throughout the school year. Provide completed copies t o the parents/guardian as well. An e mergency plan of care should include: Emergency contact information f or parents/guardians and health care provider . Causes of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia . Symptoms of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia . Actions for treating hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia . During all levels of training, information in the emergency plans on t he signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, how to respond, and who to contact for help in an emergency should be reviewed with school personnel. Sample Health and Care Plans are available in the Diabetes Forms section. DIABETES DESCRIPTION I.1 Diabetes is a chronic disease in which the body does not make or properly use insulin, a hormone that is needed to convert sugar, starches, and other food into energy by moving glucose from blood into the cells. Insulin lowers blood glucose. People with diabetes have increased blood glucose (sugar) levels for one or more of the following three reasons: Either 1. Little or no insulin is being produced, 2. Insulin production is insufficient, and/or 3. The body is resistant to the effec ts of insulin. Page 20 of 120 As a result, high levels of glucose build up in the blood, and spill into the urine and out of the body. The body loses its main source of fuel and cells are deprived of glucose, a needed source of energy. High blood glucose levels may resul t in short and long term complications over time. Type 1 diabetes is usually diagnosed in children and young adults. In type 1 diabetes, the body does not produce insulin. Type 2 diabetes is the most common form of diabetes. In type 2 diabetes, the body do es not use insulin properly. According to the National Diabetes Education Program, d iabetes is one of the most co mmon chronic diseases in school aged children affecting about 20 8,000 young people in the United States. Most children with diabetes have Type 1 diabetes ( www.YourDiabetesInfo.org ). Diabetes is not contagious and cannot, at this time , be cured. However, it can be managed and treated. Treatment consists of administering multiple doses of insulin, mo nitoring blood sugar several times during the day, eating nutritious meals and snacks, as well as following a regular exercise program. A balance between insulin, food, and exercise must be maintained to prevent blood sugar levels from being either too low (hypoglycemia) or too high (hyperglycemia). Diabetes must be managed 24 hours a day, 7days a week. For students with Type 1 diabetes, and for some with Type 2 diabetes, that means careful monitoring of their blood glucose levels throughout the school day and administering multiple doses of insulin by injection or with an insulin pump to control their blood glucose and minimize complications. Blood sugar monitoring, careful attention to a healthy diet and daily exercise are important to controlling Type 2 d iabetes. SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF HYPOGLYCEMIA/HYPERGLYCEMIA 1) Causes of Hypoglycemia: too much insulin late food or too little food too much or too intense exercise a planned or unplanned activity without additional food The recognition and treatment of hyp oglycemia is vitally important. Mild hypoglycemia can usually be treated easily and effectively. Most episodes of hypoglycemia that will occur in the school setting are of the \"mild\" type. Symptoms of hypoglycemia may include the following: Extreme hunger Shakiness Tremors Dizziness Lethargy Headache Increased heart rate/palpitations Dilated pupils Pallor Clammy skin Sweating Anxiety Changed personality If not treated promptly a mild hypoglycemic reaction can quickly progress to a severe state or condition which may be characterized by: Irritability/frustration Behavior/personality changes Extreme tiredness/ fatigue Sudden crying Restlessness Confusion Inability to swallow Dazed Appearance Seizures, convulsions Unconsciousness/coma Page 21 of 120 Remember, onset and progression can happen very quickly. Each student will have his/her own set of symptoms that characterize hypoglycemia. These should be listed in the DMMP. The important thing to remember is that early recognition and intervention is th e best strategy to prevent progression to more severe symptoms. 2) Causes of Hyperglycemia: too much food too little insulin illness infection decreased activity stress increased growth puberty The recognition and treatment of significant hyperglycemia is vitally important. Symptoms of may vary somewhat from individual to individual, or from episode to episode and can include: Thirst Blurred vision Lack of concentration Weight loss Frequent urination Sweet, fruity breath Fatigue/sleepiness Stomach pains Increased hunger Flushing of skin The following symptoms indicate that hyperglycemia has escalated. Mild symptoms plus: Dry mouth Nau sea Vomiting Stomach cramps Sweet, fruity breath This last group of symptoms indicate s severe hyperglycemia, and probable ketoacidosis. Mild and moderate symptoms plus: Labored breathing Profound weakness Confusion Loss of consciousness The important thing to remember is that intervention at any of these levels will prevent progression to more severe symptoms. TREATMENT FOR HYPOGYLCEMIA/HYPERGLYCEMIA Diabetes is managed with medic ation, nutrition, physical activity and glucose monitoring. Intervene promptly when hypoglycemia is mild/moderate to prevent the progression to severe symptoms. The steps for intervening with each student will be outlined in his/her DMMP. o The initial resp onse would be to treat with oral carbohydrates according to the DMMP. o Glucagon is administered as an injection when a person's blood sugar becomes so low that the person is unresponsive, passes out, or cannot eat or drink safely. Glucagon is a hormone that raises blood sugar levels. Glucagon can cause severe nausea and vomiting when the person regains c onsciousness, but can be a life saving treatment for treating extreme low blood sugar. The goal in the treatment of hyperglycemia is to lower the blood glucos e level to within a student's target range. Always follow the individual student's DMMP which may include the administration of insulin . Page 22 of 120 DIABETES: CARE OF ST UDENT I.2 Tennessee Code Annotated, Section 49 -5-415 (d)(1) states a local board of education or a gov erning board for a non-public school may permit school personnel to volunteer to assist with the care of students with diabetes if parent or guardian and the student's personal health care team have developed a medical management plan that lists the health services needed by the student at school and is signed by the student's physician, nurse practitioner or physician assistant . The parent or guardian shall have given permission for the school's trained volunteer or school nurse to participate in the care of the student with diabetes. The written permission shall be kept in the student's school records. Assistance in care of a student by trained volunteers must be documented. Tennessee Code Annotated, Section 49-5-415 (d)(4) states that if a school nurse i s on site and available to assist, the school nurse must provide any needed diabetes assistance rather than other trained school personnel volunteering to assist the student. In addition, a school RN has primary responsibility for maintaining all student h ealth records. Tennessee Code Annotated, Section 49-5-415 (b) states that school personnel who volunteer under no duress or pressure and who have been properly trained by a registered nurse employed or contracted by the LEA may administer glucagon in emer gency situations and may administer daily insulin to a s tudent based on that student's I ndivid ual Health P lan (IHP). However, if a public school nurse is available and on site, the nurse shall provide this service to the student. The Diabetes Medical Man agement Plan (DMMP) details the specific conditions for all routine and emergency diabetes care tasks, including insulin and glucagon administration. Non -medical school staff can be trained to assist students with these tasks as laid out in the DMMP. Howev er, any and all clinical assessments are made by the student's health care providers in the development of the DMMP; school staff is simply following the plan as prescribed. Once the DMMP has been provided to the school, it is implemented collaboratively b y the school diabetes team, which includes the School Nurse (RN) , student, parent/guardian, and other school personnel. The need for performance of or assistance with diabetes care tasks will vary from student to student. Routine Care: Many students will be able to handle all or almost all of their routi ne diabetes care by themselves. They can check their own blood glucose, and they can dose and give their own insulin or medication, keeping it in balance with physical activity and food intake. Some st udents, because of age, developmental level, or inexperience, will need help from school staff, including performing tasks like insulin administration, blood glucose monitoring, or carbohydrate counting. Emergency Care: ALL students with diabetes will need help in the event of an emergency situation. CARBOHYDRATE COUNTING AND NUTRITION GUIDANCE: The nutritional needs of a student with diabetes differ slightly from the needs of a student without diabetes. Both should eat a variety of foods to maintain normal growth and development. The major difference is that the timing, amount, and content of the food that the student with diabetes eats are carefully matched to the action of the insulin. There are two methods of meal planning using carb count -Page 23 of 120 ing: following a consistent carb intake meal plan and adjust ing insulin for changing carb intake. Student s who follow a consistent carb meal plan aim for a set amount of carb grams at each meal and snack and do not adjust their mealtime insulin for the amount of carb intake. Students who use multiple daily injections or an insulin pump usually use the adjust ing insulin for changing carb intake method of meal planning. This method requires adjusting insulin doses to cover the amount of carbs consumed using an insulin -to-carb ratio. This information will be provided in the student's DMMP. Carbohydrate countin g involves calculating the number of grams of carbohydrate or choices of carbohydrate the student eats. This information can be obtained from nutrition information on food labels, school nutrition services, parents or at CalorieKing.com, and is used to de termine the amount of insulin the student needs to control blood glucose for any given meal or snack. The student's meal plan is designed to balance nutritional needs with the insulin regimen and physical activity level. The student should eat lunch at the same time each day. Snacks are often necessary for a child with diabetes and must be eaten to balance the peak times of insulin action. A missed or delayed snack could result in hypoglycemia. Additional information is available at National Diabetes Education Program (NDEP). Roles and Responsibilities for Management of Diabetes I.2.a Collaboration, cooperation and planning are key elements in developing and implementing su ccessful diabetes management at school. As is true for children with other chronic diseases, students with diabetes are more likely to succeed in school when students, parents, school nurses, principals, teachers, other school personnel and the student's h ealth care providers (or personal health care team) work together to ensure effective diabetes management. A. STUDENT WITH DIABETES To remain active and healthy, the student with diabetes should strive to maintain blood glucose levels within a target range. S chool health policy and staff will promote and support the student toward self -sufficiency and independence in following the DMMP designed by his/her health care provider. The student, however, must also assume age appropriate responsibility. The following responsible actions are recommended: Cooperate with school personnel in implementing the diabetes plan of care. Wearing a medical alert identification tag while in school is strongly advised . Observe all local policies and procedures related to blood and body fluid precautions and sharps disposals. Complete the initial and ongoing diabetes education provided by the health care provider. Seek adult help immediately when low blood glucose levels are suspected or verified by blood glucose monitoring. Record and report all blood glucose monitoring according to the medical plan of care. Conform to all nutritional guidelines according to the m edical plan of care. Demonstrate competence in blood glucose monitoring and insulin administration in the school setting. B. PARENT /GUARDIAN Inform the school as soon as possible when a student is newly diagnosed as having diabetes or when a previously dia gnosed student enrolls in a new school so that planning and training of Page 24 of 120 personnel can be arranged quickly. Ideally, parents should work with the school staff prior to their child's admittance to ease the student's transition into the school environment. Participate in team meetings and development of the IHP or communicate with individual school personnel who will be in contact with your child. Provide the school with emergency contact information (cell phone, work number, beeper) and designate someone to act on your behalf if you are unavailable. Provide the School Nurse (RN) with medication orders from a health care provider, permission to consult with the provider, and signed consent forms to administer medications and share health information on a need to-know -basis. Provide the School Nurse (RN) with any new written medical orders when there are changes in the medical management that must be implemented in school. Provide and transport to the school all medications, equipment, supplies, and carbohydrat e snacks associated with the medical management of the student's diabetes. Assume responsibility for the maintenance and calibration of all medical equipment. Work with health care providers, their staff, and the child to promote self -sufficiency in diabe tes management. Provide the school with updates on the child's diabetes status annually and as needed. Communicate with schools regarding parent participation on school field trips or off -site school sponsored events. Providing a medical alert identification tag for your child is strongly advised . C. SCHOOL NURSE (RN) Introduce yourself to the student and orient him/her how to access the nurse. At the beginning of the school year, meet with the parent of the student with diabetes or as soon as possible after diagnosis. Obtain and maintain a current knowledge base and update skills and abilities related to the medical management of diabetes in the school -age population. Organize and facilitate planning meetings with the student's pare nt/guardian and other key school staff to discuss planning and implementation of the student's IHP. Develop an IHP in cooperation with the student, the parents/guardians, the health care provider, and other school -based staff. Assure that the IHP with th e Emergency Care Plans includes the student's name and photo , if available. Regularly review and update the IHP whenever there is a change in medical management or the student's response to care. Establish and maintain a working relationship with the student's parent/guardians and health care provider and act as a liaison between the student's authorized health care provider and the school. If necessary, work with the health care provider and/or p arent to re -evaluate the student's competency level to further enhance the student's independence or, if necessary, to require closer supervision until the student's knowledge and skills improve. Practice universal precautions and infection control proced ures at all student encounters. Train school personnel who volunteer and are willing to assist with the care of students with diabetes. The nurse shall be under no duress to qualify any volunteer unless such volunteer is trained and deemed by the nurse to be competent. Page 25 of 120 Provide or arrange for student specific training to all school -based personnel who will have direct contact with the student on how to respond in an emergency. Maintain appropriate documentation of the training and care provided and monitor the documentation of services provided by unlicensed assistive personnel. Act as a resource to the principal and other school -based personnel, providing or arranging for in-service education appropriate to their level of involvement with the student with d iabetes. Establish a diabetes resource file of pamphlets, brochures, and other publications for use by school personnel. Participate in Individualized Education Planning or Section 504 planning meetings and provide relevant health information. Establish a process for ong oing and emergency communication with the parent/guardian (this should include a parental notification procedure to address repairing or replacing equipment, and replenishing supplies and medications), the authorized health care provider, the unlicensed assist ive personnel, and the school staff that come into direct contact with the student. Request a functioning communicati on device in the health clinic (example: phone system, intercom or two way radios ). Serve as the student's advocate. Respect the student' s confidentiality and right to privacy. D. SCHOOL ADMINISTRATOR Participate in planning the IHP as a member of the team, and support school personnel, the student and parents in its implementation. Review emergency response plans to ensure that any food , equipment or services unique to the needs of students with diabetes is covered by those plans. Provide leadership for all school -based personnel to ensure that all health policies related to diabetes management at school are current and implemented. Mon itor overall compliance with the implementation of the emergency response plan . Recommend that communication devices are provided and are in functioning condition in the appropriate location -nurse's clinic, classroom, cafeteria etc. Collaborate with the School Nurse (RN) in selecting and designating unlicensed assistive personnel to provide the student -specific services required for each student with diabetes in their school. Require that training and education of all involved personnel is completed and documented . Inform parent/guardian if any student experiences an emergency incident (hypoglycemia/hyperglycemia) at school. Communicate in advance with School Nurse (RN) when a field trip or off -site school sponsored event or class party might require adju stment in their meal plan or insulin administration. Provide adequate time for School Nurse (RN) to train school personnel who volunteer. E. EDUCATIONAL PERSONNEL (TEACHERS, AID ES, COACHES etc.) Participate in team meetings for the student with diabetes. Be aware of which students have diabetes and cooperate with the accommodations listed in the IHP or Section 504 Plan. Recognize the signs and symptoms associated with hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia. Page 26 of 120 Be sure volunteers, student teachers, aides, specialists a nd substitute teachers are informed of the student's diagnosis and necessary saf eguards on a need -to-know basis. Request that the classroom have a functioning intercom, two way radios or other communication device for communication with the School Nurse (RN) and administrator. Work with the School Nurse (RN) to educate other parents about the presence and needs of the child with diabetes on a need to know basis and with parent's permission . Respect the student's right to confidentiality and privacy. Inform parents of any special school events where food will be served. Ensure that the student (e.g. engaged in physical or extracurricular activity ) has a safe location (if possible) to monitor blood glucose or administer insulin in accordance with the stude nt's IHP. By law, students with d iabetes mus t not be restricted to certain areas to self -manage. Monitor before exercise or strenuous activity and allow for snacks before and after the physical activity if indicated in the student's IHP. Communicate and collaborate in advance with School Nurse (RN) when a field trip or off -site school sponsored event or class party might require adjustment in their meal plan or insulin administration. If for safety reasons, medical alert identification needs to be removed during specific activities, the student should be reminded to replace this identification immediately after the activity is completed. Notify substitute teachers of students with diabetes and l eave a clear plan of care regarding the special needs of the s tudent. Keep the student's Emergency Care Plan readily accessible in the classroom in an organized format for substitute teachers and for use in emergencies. F. GUIDANCE COUNSELOR While the school counselor and/or social worker may not always have direct co ntact with the student, they should be aware of the students in their schools who have diabetes and the potential impact of diabetes and its treatment on the student's behavior and performance. Communicate with the School Nurse (RN) as needed in the development of the student's IHP. Monitor anxiety, stress levels, and social development of students with diabetes and provide interventions as appropriate. Act as a resource to parents and students regarding anxiety, stress and normal de velopment. Educate classmates to avoid endangering, isolating, stigmatizing or harassing students with diabetes (with parental and student's permission) per LEA policy (at a minimum annually ). G. FOOD SERVICE MANAGER /PERSONNEL Food and nutrition service staf f members play an important role in providing nutritional and balanced meal for all students, including students with diabetes . Provide nutritional information including carb counts for all foods/drinks served. Keep information about students with diabetes readily available. Respect the student's right to confidentiality and privacy. Have a functioning communication device to support emergencies. Be knowledgeable about activation of emergency services. If a student is suspected to be experiencing a diabetes emergency , activate the school's emergency response plan. Page 27 of 120 H. SCHOOL BUS COMPANY Understand that students with diabetes may carry snacks or equipment for emergency response and may need to eat and/or drink during the bus ride. Provide functioning c ommunication devices. Know local emergency medical services procedures. Communicate to the School Nurse (RN) any concerns regarding the student's actions or behavior regarding diabetes management. Respect the student's right to confidentiality and privacy . Individual LEA's school bus company should consider receiving emergency CPR training. I. TRAINED SCHOOL PERSONNEL WHO VOLUNTEER Understand the student's DMMP , IHP, 504 Plan, IEP, or other education plan. Understand the student's Emergency Plan. Attend the student's school health team meetings. Participate in diabetes management training by the school registered nurse or designated educator . Assist with the care of the student, which may include blood glucose monitoring, urine or blood ketone testing, an d emergency Glucagon and Insulin administration, as trained. Practice universal precautions and infection control procedures. Participate in planned evaluations of care. Assistance with care must be documented in accordance with these guidelines and accord ing to standards and requirements outlined in school policy. Observe and record student health and behavior, noting any changes over time. Communicate directly and regularly with the School Nurse (RN) or the supervising health professional. Consult with appropriate member of the student's school health team when questions arise or the student's health status changes. Respect the student's confidentiality and right to privacy. Accompany the student on field trips or off -campus school -sponsored spor ts events and activities, as determined by the 504 Plan, IHP, IEP, or other education plan. Provide support and encouragement to the student. Help ensure that the student has a supportive learning environment. Off-site School Sponsored Event /School Adminis tered Care Programs I.2.b No student should be excluded from a field trip or any extracurricular program or activity due to diagnosis of diabetes. The parent of the student should be allowed to accompany their child on the school trip in addition to the school c haperone. Parents are not required to attend the trip. The teacher requesting/organizing the field trip will coordinate in advance with the principal, school RN or designee to meet the student's health care needs. Parent/guardian must provide glucose meter and supplies, appropriate snacks, and a suitable high glucose source (such as glucose tablets, a tube of cake frosting, or other oral solution) for their child's emergency for availability during extracurricular activities. Page 28 of 120 Before a field trip or extracu rricular activity, the school shall: Notify the student's parent(s) in a timely manner in order to prepare for food/snacks/medications. Make certain that an emergency communication device is always present. Minimum of two (2) people with cell phones is recommended. Maintain records of the names and phone numbers of parent/guardian of the student and the health care provider . Be sure that a trained staff person is assigned to stay with the student at all times if emergency medication has been administered. o Designate someone to call the student's parents with the name and location of the hospital. Verify that the school board employee accompanying the student has received specific training in the blood glucose monitoring procedure and insulin administration as documented on the skills checklist by the school RN. The school employee must also be trained in the signs/symptoms of high and low blood sugar and follow the student specific emergency care plan. This employee will supervis e the carrying of the glucose meter and supplies , snacks, glucose source, a copy of the orders , and emergency information card. Be sure that the bus driver has the emergency route to the hospital if the cell phone cannot make the connection to EMS. Only if EMS cannot be reached should the bus driver take the child to the nearest Emergency Room in the bus. Blood Glucose Monitoring According to the IHP, i f the student ordinarily performs his own finger stick and testing, he will do this while on the field trip if necessary. The health care provider orders will be followed if high or low blood sugar is found. If after doing so, the student appears disoriented or level of consciousness deteriorates, call 911. DIABETES MEDICATION ADMINISTRATION I.3 T.C.A . \u00a7 49-5-415 (b): If an LEA permits, school personnel who volunteer under no duress or pressure and who have been properly trained by a registered nurse employed or contracted by the LEA may administer glucagon in emergency situations and may administer daily insulin to a student based on that student's Individual Health P lan (IHP). However, if a public school nurse is available and on site, the nurse shal l provide this service to the student. The public school nurse may train as many school personnel as volunteer and are willing to assist with the care of students with diabetes but should seek to ensure at least two (2) volunteers are available. Glucagon Administration I.3.a Glucagon is a hormone that causes the liver to release sugar into the blood. It is used to raise the blood sugar when a child is unable to take liquids or food by mouth because of severe sleepiness, unconsciousness or seizure activity. Glucagon is an emergency medication, given by needle and syringe. It should be give n immediately in the event of severe hypoglycemia. It is important to remember that the risk of not giving Glucagon is more life -threatening than giving it under these emer gency conditions. Page 29 of 120 If Glucagon is part of a child's DMMP or emergency care plan then a health care provider's order and written parental permission is needed. One Glucagon Emergency Kit supplied by the family is needed. Keep Glucagon at room temperature, and inform the appropriate staff of the storage location. Check the date of Glucagon kits on a regular basis. Obtain a refill prior to expiration date and dispos e of expired medication . When possible, practice drawing up Glucagon with a Glucagon Demonstr ation Practice kit or an expired kit. Glucagon must be mixed per the specified instructions. If the School Nurse (RN) is unavailable, trained school personnel who volunteer may administer glucagon to a student with diabetes who may require prompt treatme nt in order to protect against serious harm or death. No trained school personnel who volunteer shall administer medication unless: such trained personnel annually completes any training required by the School Nurse (RN) in the administration of medication with injectable equipment used to administer glucagon; the School Nurse (RN) has attested, in writing, that such trained school personnel has completed such training . STEPS FOR ADMINISTERING GLUCAGON : 1. Never attempt to give a student suffering from severe hypoglycemia food or drink or put anything in their mouth because this could cause choking. 2. Position the student on their side to prevent choking in the event of vomiting, which is a side effect of the Glucagon. 3. Have a staff member call for emergency medical assistance (911) and also have them notify the parent/guardian. 4. Remove the cap from the glass vial conta ining the powder. 5. Remove the cap from the syringe and insert the needle into the vial through the rubber stopper. 6. Inject all of the fluid from the syringe into the bottle containing powder. 7. Shake gently, or roll to mix until all of the powder is dissolved in the liquid and solution is clear. 8. Inspect the vial. Glucagon, when mixed, should be clear and colorless. Do not administer if the liquid is discolored 9. Hold the vial upside down in one hand and insert the syringe into the vial. 10. Draw the solution into the syringe. 11. Clean the site with alcohol if possible. 12. The best locations to give Glucagon are in the thighs or upper arms. 13. Inject the Glucagon at a 90 angle and push syringe plunger all the way down. 14. Count to five. 15. Remove the needle from the skin and dispose of in a sharps container. 16. Confirm that 911 has been called. 1 mg of freeze dried glucagon (vial) 1 ml of water for reconstitution (syringe) Page 30 of 120 17. Stay with the student until EMS arrives. It may take the student 15 -20 minutes to regain consciousness. Do not be surprised if: The student doesn't remember being unconscious, or is incoherent. The student has nausea or vomiting. The student's blood glucose becomes very high. Administering Daily Insulin I.3.b Insulin is a hormone that can only, at this time, be taken by multiple injections or by insulin pump. Insulin lowers blood sugar. The various kin ds of insulin work for differing lengths of time. Most children take a combination of insulin at different times of the day. The types and amount of insulin the student needs must be ordered by the physician. Students with type 1 diabetes and some students with type 2 diabetes require insulin to be given at regular times each day. Some students who need insulin during the school day are able to administer it on their own; others need supervision; and some need someone to administer the insulin for them. The School Nurse (RN) should provide this help in accordance with the IHP. School personnel who are responsible for the student's care should be knowledgeable about the student's insulin delivery system and how t o respond to an emergency. The three most common ways to administer insulin are with a syringe, an insulin pen, or an insulin pump. The manufacturers of insulin, insulin syringes, insulin pens, and insulin pumps have websites where school personnel can lea rn more about these products. Storing Insulin: Review the product storage instructions and check the expiration date . Generally store at room temperature less than 86 degrees . Refrigerate unopened vials and insulin pens . Be careful NOT to freeze . When to G ive Insulin: Insulin must be administered as specified in the student's DMMP. The DMMP specifies the orders of the student's health care provider. The DMMP should clearly specify insulin dosing procedures. Dosing Insulin: Some students will use a standing insulin dose ( same dose) regardless of blood glucose level or food intake. Others will have a varied dose, depending upon: o Carb or meal boluses, to cover what is eaten and o Correction boluses , to cover high blood glucose. These two concepts are covered in the training link found in the Diabetes Training Section . Where to Give Insulin: Insulin works best when it is injected into a layer of fat under the skin, above the muscle tissue. Rotating sites is important to insulin absorption. Page 31 of 120 Common preferred sit es are the abdomen, thighs, buttocks, and upper arms. Student should help choose injection site. After Giving Insulin: A few points to keep in mind after insulin is given, regardless of whether it is by syringe, pen, or pump. Check site for leaks (Occasionally injection sites or infusion sites will leak when insulin is administered.) Document on log sheet. When correction doses are given to lower blood glucose, a retest should be done, if specified in the DMMP, to determine how well the correction dose worked. When insulin has been given prior to a meal or snack, it is important that the food is eaten soon (beginning within 15 minutes) after the insulin has been taken. DIABETES TRAINING I.4 TRAINING FOR SCHOOL NURSES: T.C.A . \u00a7 49-5-415(d)(3) states that all school nurses must be educated in diabetes care and have knowledge of the guidelines. Some health care professionals may have little expertise in diabetes education and/or management but provide support to students with diabetes. Licensed health c are professionals employed or contracted by an LEA who will be providing care to a student with diabetes should demonstrate competency for both knowledge and skills on an annual basis . o Suggested Training Resource for School Nurses : Helping Administer to th e Needs of the Student with Diabetes in School (H.A.N.D.S.) H.A.N.D.S. is a live continuing education full day program developed by the National Association of School Nurses (NASN) for school nurses to equip the school nurse with current diabetes knowledge , and provide tools and resources to facilitate effective diabetes management for students at school. It is presented by a School Nurse with a specific interest in diabetes and a Certified Diabetes Educator. For more information, contact NASN at http://www.nasn.org/ContinuingEducation/LiveContinuingEducationPrograms/HANDSDiab etesProgram TRAINING FOR SCHOOL PERSONNEL WHO VOLUNTEER: T.C.A . \u00a7 49-5-415 (b) states that school personnel who volunteer under no duress or pressure and who have been properly trained by a registered nurse employed or contracted by the LEA may administer glucagon in emergency situations and may administer daily insulin to a student based on that student's Individual Health P lan (IHP). Training to administer glucagon and insulin shall be repeated annually and competencies shall be documented at least twice a year in the employee's personnel file. The provisions of subdivi sion (a)(3) regarding protection from liability shall apply also to the volunteers who provide services pursuant to this subsection and the registered nurses who provide their training. o T.C.A . \u00a7 49-5-415 (a)(3) provides that a ny person assisting in self -administration of medication or performing health care procedures, including administration of medications under this section, and any local board of education or governing board for a non-public school authorizing the self -administration of medications or the performance of health care procedures shall not be liable in any court of law for injury resulting from the reasonable and Page 32 of 120 prudent assistance in the self -administration of such medication or the reasonable performance of the health care procedures, inc luding administration of medications, if performed pursuant to the policies and guidelines developed by the Departments of Health and Education and approved by applicable regulatory or governing boards or agencies. T.C.A . \u00a7 49-5-415(d)( 3) states that school personnel, who volunteer under no duress to assist with the care of students with diabetes, must receive training from a school RN. The school RN may use certified diabetes educators and licensed nutritionists to assist with the train ing. All training must be renewed on an annual basis and competency must be noted in the personnel file. No school personnel shall be required to volunteer for the training. School personnel may not be reprimanded, subject to any adverse employment action or punished in any manner for refusing to volunteer. o T.C.A . \u00a7 49-5-415(d)(5) states that t he following persons shall not be liable in any court of law for injury resulting from reasonable assistance with the care of students with diabetes if performed pursu ant to the guidelines developed by the Departments of Health and Education : (A) Any school RN w ho provides the training ; (B) Any person who is trained and whose competency is indicated in the person's personnel file as required in subdivision (d)(3); and (C) Any local board of education or governing board for a non-public school that authorizes school personnel to volunteer to assist with the ca re of students with diabetes . School Registered Nurses who provide training to volunteers under this subsection s hall not be subject to any disciplinary or otherwise adverse licensing action by the board of nursing for injury resulting from assistance with the care of students with diabetes if performed pursuant to these guidelines. Suggested Components for Training Curriculum: Training curriculum and teaching methods for preparing the school personnel who volunteer should include both knowledge and skills components. Both a written test and a skills check should be included, and the learner must demonstrate competenc y on both in order to be designated as a trained school personnel volunteer . A copy of the training guidelines, test and skills check results, and a record of staff training must be maintained by the School Nurse (RN) or principal. A Sample Skills Checklist and a Sample Written Test is available in the Diabetes Forms section. Content shall include, at a minimum, the following elements so that the learner: o Understands the essential elements of the DMMP , IHP, 504 Plan, IEP, or other education plan. o Has a general understanding of type 1 and type 2 diabetes. o Understands the effects of balancing insulin, food and exercise upon a student's blood glucose levels. o Recognizes the signs and symptoms of low bl ood sugar/glucose (hypoglycemia) and high blood sugar/glucose (hyperglycemia) levels; o Understands and knows how to take or help the student take proper action if the blood sugar/glucose and/or urine ketones are outside the range indicated by the student's diabetes management and treatment plan; o Performs or assists a student with monitoring of blood sugar/glucose using a continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system or a glucose monitor provided by the student's family and/or urine testing strips for ketone ev aluation and recording the results in the designated record; Page 33 of 120 o Knows how to safely and properly administer insulin and glucagon according to the student's diabetes management and treatment plan and individual health plan and knows how to record the action in the designated record; o Knows and recognizes the signs and symptoms and blood sugar/glucose levels that require emergency assistance and knows how to take proper action; o Knows and understands the nutritional needs of students with diabetes, including but n ot limited to, the need for regular meals, how snacks are utilized in the daily regimen of children with diabetes, how exercise affects blood sugar/glucose, and how changes in schedules, such as illness, tests and field trips, can affect children's nutriti onal needs; and o Knows when to call the parent(s), a health care professional and/or 911 for help.

Diabetes Basics 1. a Diabetes is a chronic endocrine disorder that is either the result of having no insulin production (type 1) or limited insulin production and/or impaired use of insulin (type 2) . 2. c The three main types of diabetes are type 1(a condition in which the pancreas no longer secretes insulin), type 2 (a condition in which th e pancreas does not secrete enough insulin or the body fails to utilize the insulin properly), and gestational diabetes (diagnosed during pregnancy in a woman with no diagnosis prior to the pregnancy). There are other types of diabetes, but they account fo r a small percentage of cases. 3. c The pancreas is a gland that produces insulin for glucose (sugar) absorption. Without insulin, glucose remains in the bloodstream and causes elevated glucose values; glucose values that are not in the normal range can c ause damage to major organs and blood vessels. 4. False It is not possible to look at a person with diabetes and tell that they have the disease. The disease is diagnosed by a blood test. 5. True A person with type 1 diabetes (formerly called insulin -dependent diabetes) must take insulin, as their pancreas does not produce insulin. 6. c A person with type 1 diabetes can be any age; while most persons with type 1 diabetes are diagnosed before the age of 19, type 1 diabetes can be diagnosed at any age. 7. True A person with type 2 diabetes may be diet -controlled, may be taking oral medication, or may be on insulin. 8. d How often a person with diabetes checks his/her blood glucose (sugar) will vary depending on many factors: age, number of episodes of hyp oglycemia, stability of blood glucose values during the day, as well as other considerations. A student with diabetes will have an order from a provider that will let school staff knows the frequency with which the student will check his/her blood glucose levels while at school. The number of times and the time frames (e.g., before lunch, after lunch, before physical activity, during physical activity, and after physical activity) should be outlined in the IPA. 9. e Page 55 of 120 Managing diabetes is accomplished by fol lowing a meal plan, knowing which foods elevate blood sugar, taking medications (both oral and injectable) as prescribed, getting physical activity, and seeing a healthcare provider routinely. 10. e The goal of diabetes management is to have acceptable gl ucose values (usually expressed as a range) during the day; other goals include being healt hy overall, and avoiding the co -morbid conditions associated with not being in control. Students with optimal management should participate fully in academic program s and extra -curricular activities. 11. e Students with diabetes involved in physical activity during the school day benefit from the same advantages as anyone that participates in physical activity, such as weight control and cardiovascular fitness. A stu dent with diabetes that exercises may have a decreased need for, or better utilization of insulin. Further, the most common problem encountered during physical activity is hypoglycemia. Diabetes Management 12. True Students with diabetes are expected to h ave an IHP so that school staff can know how to best manage the student during the school day. 13. i The IHP should include a list of all medications the student is taking, including a schedule for when the medications are to be administered, and doses of medications; ranges of acceptable glucose values during the day and what to do when the glucose values are not in that range; when and how often the student will have snacks; and the name and phone number of the treating healthcare provider. 14. d Insuli n is available in vials (for which insulin syringes must be used), in pens, and in cartridges (used in pumps and must be pre -loaded). 15. False A person with diabetes can have foods that contain sugar, such as cookies, some breakfast cereals, and most des serts; a student that consumes sugar -containing foods should know how to count the carbohydrates in those foods and then adjust his/her insulin accordingly. 16. f A student with diabetes must dispose of his/her sharps (including lancets, syringes, empty pens, insulin vials, insulin cartridges, and pump infusion sets) by following the school or district policy related to safe needle disposal and adhering to universal precautions. Some schools will allow a student to take supplies home and dispose of them, with the caveat that he/she must carry sharps in a safe container (such as a little glass jar with a lid or a plastic container with a lid). Some schools may require that a student dispose of sharps daily by taking sharps to the nurse's office or clinic on campus. 17. h Page 56 of 120 Mild to moderate hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) will cause a student to be hungry, dizzy, sweat, tremble, unable to concentrate, confused, and/or have a headache. During mild to moderate episodes of hypoglycemia, a student will be able to s peak; however, the speech may be slurred. 18. a While there are physical symptoms of hypoglycemia (trembling, sweating, confusion), the only way to definitively know if a student has mild to moderate hypoglycemia is to test the blood glucose. Students that can recognize hypoglycemia will probably have a snack. If the IHP requires that if this occurs a student must report this to the school nurse of UDCA, then the student shall tell the appropriate school staff so that the episode can be documented. 19. d Mild to moderate hypoglycemia is treated by eating or having a snack. 20. c Severe hypoglycemia is usually suspected if a student collapses and/or has a seizure. 21. c The goal of reversing severe hypoglycemia is to raise the blood sugar immediately; thi s is accomplished by administering a fast -acting glucose source (if the student can swallow) or by administering glucagon (if the student cannot swallow or is unconscious). 22. d A student with diabetes that participates in physical activity should monitor his/her blood glucose prior to, during, and after exercising. Should the student have an episode of hypoglycemia, the student should have snacks available for moderate hypoglycemia as well as sources of fast -acting glucose in the event of severe hy poglycemia. Insulin doses prior to exercising would need to be adjusted according to the student's IHP. 23. g Symptoms of hyperglycemia include being thirsty, urinating more often, being drowsy, being irritable, having ketones in the urine, and having blu rred vision. 24. b Hyperglycemia, just like hypoglycemia, cannot be ascertained by physical symptoms alone; to determine if blood glucose is elevated, the only way to know is to assess the blood glucose value. 25. d A treatment option to lower blood sugar is by drinking a lot of water. This helps dilute the glucose in the blood. Administering insulin as outlined in the IHP is also a treatment option. Page 57 of 120 J. FOOD ALLERGY AND ANAPHYLAXIS OVERVIEW The following guidelines have been developed to assist public school districts and non-public schools [that are served pursuant to Tennessee Code Annotated Section 49 -5-415 (f)] in effectively preventing and controlling the incidences of life -threatening f ood allergies efficiently and managing the health and safety needs of children with life -threatening allergic conditions. Food is the most common cause of anaphylaxis. However, other causes of anaphylaxis include insect bites, bee stings, natural rubber la tex, and/or medications and even in rare instances exercise. Food allergy is a growing food safety and public health concern in the United States because of the increased prevalence . While these guidelines focus primarily on food allergies they may be appl ied to all sources of anaphylaxis. School settings are faced with major challenges due to students with one or more food allergies. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ; an estimated 4% - 6% [1], [2] of children in the United States are affected . Even small amounts of allergen in food can cause a reaction in individuals who are sensitive to the specific allergen. Strict avoidance of the food allergen is the only remedy to prevent life-threatening food allergy reactions. In some cases, deaths have occurred in schools, resulting from not recognizing symptoms and not responding promptly or effectively. EMERGENCY ALLERGY RESP ONSE PLAN AND ALLERGY ACTION PLAN : Each school district/LEA shall develop a comprehensive program for managing allergies at school. Each school shall have an allergy management team which may include but is not limited to the school nurse, principal, teacher, student, food service director, bus driver, school physician, and counselor. Implementation of health care procedures, guidelines and plans that focus on allergy education, awareness, avoidance and immediate treatment of allergic reactions are cri tical to saving lives. School districts should anticipate the enrollment of students with life -threatening allergies in their schools and hence be prepared to assist these potential individuals when needed. Each s chool district/ LEA shall develop and implem ent an Emergency Allergy Response Plan that focuses on prevention and an appropriate response procedure should an unexpected emergency occur. This plan should be in place before the start of the school year and may be administered and adopted into policy and procedures at the district and local education level. Using the state food allergy guidelines plan as a guide, each school district must develop processes to identify all students with food allergies and develop and implement an Individualized Health Pl an (IHP) with an Allergy Action Plan for each specific student. EMERGENCY ALLERGY RESPONSE PLAN The LEA's system wide policy will outline the requirements of a program to manage students with life-threatening allergies. These more comprehensive and detailed protocols should include measures to reduce exposure to allergens and procedures to treat allergic reactions. There are four s uggested components include: 1. Education and Training All school personnel should have general education on managing life-threatening allergies. [1] Branum AM, Lukacs SL. Food allergy among U.S. children: trends in prevalence and hospitalizations. NCHS Data Brief . 2008;10:1 -8. [2] Liu AH, Jaramillo R, Sicherer SH, et al. National prevalence and risk factors for food allergy and relationship to asthma: results from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2005 -2006. J Allergy Clin Immunol . 2010;126(4):798 -806.e13. Page 58 of 120 Mandatory training requirements include: Scheduling and implementation of the training in collaboration with the LEA administration by the School Nurse (RN) . Annual training at a minimum. Cleaning protocol for classroom and cafeteria (type of cleaners, frequency, etc.). Guidelines for snacks, parties, lunch substitutions based on USDA guidelines. Allergen free tables in cafeterias and classrooms if desired (being careful not to compromise student confidentiality). Students/staff hygiene (frequent hand washing). Field trip management. Bus/transportation management: o Storage of epinephrine auto -injectors. o Instructions for care and use. Emergency response protocol: o Personnel responsibilities. o Communication procedures . o Emergency drills. o Administration/possible repeat administration of epinephrine. o Demonstration and competency checks on administration of the epinephrine auto -injectors. Training in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) based 414 , 49-3-359. 2. Record Keeping/Documentation Initiation and distribution of the IHP with an Allergy Action Plan by the School Nurse (RN) . Copies should be in a clearly designated and readily accessible area at all times and updated as changes occur in the student's health status, including current photo if feasible . Locations of epinephrine auto -injectors and monitoring of expiration dates. Reviews of system wide policies on allergies as needed. Lists of trained personnel and documentation of competency maintained by school administrator or designee. Policies regarding student self-administration of epinephrine, with competency to be evaluated by the School Nurse (RN) twice annually. Identification of students with medical diagnosis or chronic health issues who are at risk for allergies by review of health information by the School Nurse (RN) . 3. Development and Reviews of the Allergy Action Plan The Individualized Health Plan (IHP) with Allergy Action Plan should be based on information provided by the parent, licensed medical provider and School Nurse (RN) . The primary goal of the Allergy Action Plan is to provide direction to the School Nurse (RN) , school personnel, and EMS responders that enable them to react promptly with specific procedures for the particular student. It is important to r evise an IHP as needed based on student's ability to self- administer epinephrine auto -injectors and the health care provider 's statement on their competency . Student should have a minimal bi -annual nursing assessment of competency and proficiency . Page 59 of 120 4. Protocols for Classrooms and Cafeterias that include Strategies to Reduce Exposure to Allergens Plan for activating EMS and notifying the School Nurse (RN) , the parent and school administrators. Functioning communication devices are recommended for personnel use whether on the school campus, field trips, bus routes, or extracurricular events. Examples include but are not limited to intercom systems, telephones, cell phones, and two way radios . Emergency drills. Implement a periodic anaphylaxis drill similar to a fire drill. Communication devices should be tested with emergency drills per LEA policy and malfunctions corrected immediately. Collaboration should occur with local emergency response teams to assure that they will respond to a 911 call with epinephrine. Do not assume that all ambulance services carry it. Include in the Allergy Action Plan steps to notify the School Nurse (RN) and parent immediately of an anaphylactic reaction. Develop a School Crisis Plan. In the event of a fatal reaction, plan to deal with the death of a student. There should be counseling for classmates and the parents. The School Nurse (RN) should maintain open communication with all members of the allergy management team(s), particularly the parent and the health care provider. Special challenges to consider on an individual basis when creating protocols: Religion or ethnic influences. Vending machine options. Home economics/culinary classes/biology labs. Provision for safe art supplies. Outdoor events beyond cell phone coverage area. Emergency crisis plan in the event of a fatal anaphylactic reaction that results in the death of the student; identify crisis team members. Celiac disease could be mistaken as an allergic reaction to food. It should be clearly stated in the IHP of the child with this diagnosis that epinephrine is not the appropriate treatment . Evaluation of the Emergency Allergy Response Plan : A written narrative should document each emergency exposure to allergens. The School Nurse (RN) and the allergy management team should evaluate the cause of the exposure, effectiveness of personal responses and suggestions for improvements. Conduct p ost exposure review to examine any problems with the IHP, then update annually as needed. There should be a minimum of one annual review of system wide policies on allergy management. Review and update of the individual Allergy Action Plan will be conducted as needed. Complete incident reports of anaphylaxis based on LEA policy. Page 60 of 120 ALLERGY ACTION PLAN All students with identified life-threatening allergies should have an Allergy Action Plan with the student's Individual Health Plan (IHP). The RN level school nurse will develop , review and update the plan as needed . The Allergy Action Plan should include the following information: Name of the student and photos (if picture available). The specific offending allergens or generic ingredients that could be identified on labels. Warning signs of allergic reaction. Health care providers and/or allergy specialists with name and phone numbers. Emergency response procedures designating who administers the epinephrine based on the location of the exposure. Where epinephrine auto -injector s and backup auto -injectors will be stored. Once formalized, the Allergy Action Plan will contain a summary of the nursing assessment describing the student's competency to carry and administer his or her own epinephrine auto - injector s. A copy of the Allergy Action Plan will accompany the student to the emergency room. Revise IHP as needed based on student's ability to self-administer epinephrine auto -injector s and the health care provider's statement on their competency . Student s should have a minimal bi - annual nursing assessment of competency and proficiency . Sample IHP and Allergy Action Plan is available in the Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Forms section. FOOD ALLERGY AND ANA PHYLAXIS DESCRIPTION J.1 Food allergy is a distorted response by the immune system to one or more foods that the body identifies as harmful and toxic to the body. Once the ingested food is identified as toxic by the immune system, the immun e system produces specific antibodies to that specific food or foods. The immune system response can produce a series of chemical triggers due to the allergic symptom and in some instances can affect the respiratory system, cardiovascular system, skin and the gastrointestinal tract. Symptoms of the allergic reaction to food may appear in one or several body systems. The signs and symptoms may range from mild to severe and may be life -threatening in some cases, depending on the individual level of dose respo nse and mode of exposure. Presently, there is no cure for food allergy and avoidance is the only remedy to prevent an allergic reaction. Individuals, particularly children, may have life -threatening allergies to one or many groups of food, including fish, fruits, vegetables, and meats. Listed below are most of the commonly known foods to cause allergic reactions in some individuals. 1) Peanuts 2) Tree nuts (walnuts, cashews, pecans, hazelnuts, almonds, coconuts, pistachios, pine nuts, and brazil nuts) 3) Cow's milk 4) Eggs 5) Fish 6) Shellfish 7) Soy 8) Wheat These eight foods are responsible for most food reactions. However, there are other foods that can cause a serious allergic reaction. Nuts generally cause the most severe allergic reactions, and it is estimated that in the United States approximately 90% of fatal and near fatal reactions are due to these foods: peanuts, Page 61 of 120 tree nuts, fish and shellfish . In some cases individuals may have fatal reactions resulting in death if there are no rapid medical interventions . A Food Allergen List giving terms that may indicate the presence of these allergens is available in the Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Forms section . SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Individuals can have an allergic reaction to tactile (touch) exposure or inhalation exposure. It is exceedingly rare for exposure to an allergen via tactile or inhalation to result in severe or life -threatening reactions , unless the individual has also ingested the allergen. Exposure by mouth, nose or eyes is considered to be ingestion and, depending on the dose response of the specific individual, may cause anaphylaxis and trigger an allergic reaction. The level of sensitivity to allergens, types of sympto ms, and the severity of symptoms are dependent on the individual and can range from mild to severe, including the potentially life -threatening condition known as anaphylaxis . Mild symptoms may include one or more of the following: Hives (reddish, swollen, itchy areas on the skin) Eczema (a persistent dry, itchy rash) Redness of the skin or around the eyes Itchy mouth or ear canal Nausea or vomiting Diarrhea Stomach pain Nasal congestion or a runny nose Sneezing Slight, dry cough Odd taste in mouth Uterine contractions Anaphylaxis is a s evere allergic reaction with rapid onset and may cause death . Symptoms occur rapidly after exposure to a likely allergen (minutes to hours) and may include one or more of the following: Nausea, vomiting and diarrhea Abdominal pain and cramping Skin redness Watery eyes Throat tightness/closure Slurred speech Wheezing Abnormal high pitched breathing Anxiety Confusion Cough Difficulty breathing Fainting, dizzines s or lightheadedness Hives, itching Nasal congestion Palpitations or tachycardia Symptoms of allergic reaction to insect sting, latex or food or in some instances caused by exercise sometimes appear to be the same as life-threatening food allergies. Treatment of these serious allergic reactions should be the same, and the use of anaphylaxis management should be encouraged if there is no signed medical provider statements specific to the individual at risk. It is impera tive that the emergency medical system ( EMS ) is activated (dial 911) immediately and stock epinephrine be administered if available. TREATMENT No treatment exists to prevent reactions to food allergies or anaphylaxis. Strict avoidance of the food allergen is the only way to prevent a reaction. However, avoidance is not always easy or possible, and staff in schools must be prepared to deal with al lergic reactions, including anaphylaxis. Early and quick Page 62 of 120 recognition and treatment of allergic reactions that may lead to anaphylaxis can prevent serious health problems or death. Mild to moderate symptoms (e.g., itching, sneezing, hives and rashes) are o ften treated with antihistamines and oral or topical steroids. For students at risk of experiencing a severe reaction (anaphylaxis), epinephrine is prescribed. Epinephrine , also called adrenaline, is naturally produced by the body. When given by injection, it rapidly improves breathing, increases heart rate, and reduces swelling of the face, lips, and throat. Epinephrine is the only medication that can reverse the symptoms of anaphylaxis. It is available in an auto -injector (Auvi -Q, EpiPen\u00ae or Adrenaclick\u00ae ). FOOD ALLERGY AND ANA PHYLAXIS : CARE OF STUDENT J.2 Each student with a diagnosis of a life-threatening allergy should have an individual health plan (IHP) in place with an Allergy Action Plan . It should include the student photo if available, specific offending allergen of reaction and names of the trained staff responsible for administering epinephrine based on the order from the doctor for that specific student. Roles and Responsibilities for Management of Food Allerg ies J.2.a An effective Individual Health Plan (IHP) will include an Allergy Action Plan and requires the cooperation of designated school personnel who are knowledgeable and trained regarding the management of students with life -threatening food allergies. Staff who may be present in the event o f an anaphylactic reaction should be prepared for their responsibilities prior to the emergency. The food allergy management team should include, but is not limited to, the student, School Nurse (RN) , parents, administrators, teachers, counselors, food ser vice directors and personnel, bus/transportation staff, coaches and/or extracurricular advisors. The School Nurse (RN) shall meet with the team annually as a group, but he or she may also meet separately with staff members to ensure their competency in eme rgency response procedures. Responsibilities are shared among all partners to assist the child in food avoidance when there are known allergies. A. STUDENT WITH LIFE -THREATENING ALLERGIES Learn to recognize symptoms and take them seriously in early stages. Take as much responsibility for avoiding allergens as possible, based on developmental level, including participation in planning the Allergy Action Plan . Learn to read food labels. Wearing a medical alert identification tag while in schoo l is strongly advised . Trading or sharing foods is prohibited. Wash hands before and after eating. Promptly inform an adult if he/she suspect s exposure to an allergen. Develop trusting friendships with peers and ask them for help if needed. Report teasing or harassment immediately. Carry own epinephrine auto -injector s and demonstrate competency if age appropriate. If permitted by school authorities and parents, carry a cell phone for emergency use only with parental consent (middle and high school students). Cell phones should not take the place of notifying school personnel. Page 63 of 120 B. PARENT /GUARDIAN Inform the School Nurse (RN) and administrators of your child's allergies prior to the opening of school or as soon as possible after diagnosis. Explain what he or she is allergic to , triggers, warning signs of allergic reaction and emotional responses of your child. Participate in team meetings and development of the IHP or communicate with individual school personnel who will be in contact with your child. Provide the school with emergency contact information (cell phone, work number, beeper) and designate someone to act on your behalf if you are unavailable. Provide a list of foods and ingredients that the child should avoid, as recommended by their health care provider or observe d by the parent. Provide the School Nurse (RN) with medication orders from a health care provider, permission to consult with the provider, and signed consent forms to administer medications and share health information on a need to -know -basis. Provide the school with up -to-date epinephrine auto -injector s (two recommended ) to be stored in secure unlocked locations according to school policy. It is not the school's responsibility to furnish epinephrine auto -injector s for children with known allergy. Communic ate with schools regarding parent participation on school field trips or off -site school sponsored events. Provide the school with updates on the child's allergy status annually and as needed. Provid ing a medical alert identification tag for your child is strongly advised . Advocate for your child regarding the seriousness of allergies and encourage your child to take more responsibility as he/she grows older. C. SCHOOL NURSE (RN) Introduce yourself to the student and orient him/her how to access the nurse and allergy medication if applicable . At the beginning of the school year, meet with the parent of the student with life -threatening allergies or as soon as possible after diagnosis. Obtain and maintain a current knowledge base and update skills and abilities related to the medical management of food allergies in the school -age population. Arrange and convene a food allergy management team meeting to plan and review IHP with special attention to the Allergy Action Plan; encourage parental participati on. Assure that the IHP with the Allergy Action Plan includes the student's name, photo if available, allergens, and symptoms of allergic reaction, risk reduction procedures, emergency responses and required signatures. Monitor that it is filed in the cafe teria and classroom. Regularly review and update the IHP whenever there is a change in medical management or the student's response to care . Establish and maintain a working relationship with the student's parent/guardians and health care provider and ac t as a liaison between the student's authorized health care provider and the school. Document attempts to collaborate with parents who have not participated in the development of the IHP or fail to supply Epi nephrine auto -injectors (letters or phone calls and consequences of lack of cooperation per LEA policy). Familiarize assigned school personnel with the Allergy Action Plan on a need -to-know basis. Coordinate or conduct in -service training and education for appropriate staff per LEA policy. Page 64 of 120 Implement a periodic anaphylaxis drill with the assistance of the school administrator based on local school policy. Make sure there is a contingency plan for substitute School Nurse (RN) . File location of epinephrine auto -injectors in the main office, health clinic, food service area and with all assigned teachers. Check expiration dates and stock up supply per LEA policies. Request a functioning communication device in the health clinic (example: phone system, intercom or two way radios ). Serve as the student's advoc ate. Respect the student's confidentiality and right to privacy. D. SCHOOL ADMINISTRATOR Participate in planning the IHP with an attached Allergy Action Plan as a member of the allergy management team, and support school personnel, the student and parents i n its implementation. Include in the school's emergency response plan a written plan outlining emergency procedures for managing life -threatening allergic reactions. Include district health professional in the development and reviews of health policies and emergency protocols for the LEA's. Monitor overall compliance with the implementation of the Allergy Action Plan. Recommend that communication devices are provided and are in functioning condition in the appropriate location -nurse's clinic, classroom, cafeteria etc. If the school system chooses to have epinephrine on hand for students having a life -threatening or anaphylactic reaction for the first time or when the student's personal auto -injector is not available, pursuant to T.C.A. \u00a7 49-5-415, the sch ool must develop a protocol for administration of epinephrine. Require the completion and documentation of training and education of all involved personnel as set forth in T.C.A. \u00a7 49-5-415 (f). Inform parent/guardian if their student experiences an allergic reaction at school. Monitor strategies to reduce risk of exposure. Communicate in advance with School Nurse (RN) when a field trip or off -site school sponsored event or class party might require additional planning. Provide adequate time for Scho ol Nurse (RN) to train school personnel who volunteer. E. EDUCATIONAL PERSONNEL (TEACHERS, AID ES, COACHES etc.) Participate in team meetings for the student with life -threatening allergies. Be awar e of signs and symptoms of an allergic reaction and follow planned procedur e during and described in the Emergency Response Plan. Be sure volunteers, student teachers, aides, specialists and substitute teachers are informed of the student's food allergies and necessary saf eguards on a need -to-know basis. Request t hat the classroom have a functioning intercom, two way radios or other communication device for communication with the School Nurse (RN) and administrator. Work with the School Nurse (RN) to educate other parents about the presence and needs of the child w ith life -threatening allergies on a need to know basis and with parent's permission. Enlist their help in keeping certain foods out of the classroom. Respect the student's right to confidentiality and privacy. Page 65 of 120 Participate in the planning for student's re -entry to school after an anaphylactic reaction, when possible. Inform parents of any special school events where food will be served. A student with suspected allergic reaction should never be sent to the office alone. Request a teacher's aide or assistant based on the student's IHP. Establish procedures in the classroom to ensure that the student with life -threatening food allergies eats only what he or she brings from home. Prohibit students from sharing or trading snacks. Allow time for proper hand washi ng before and after eating and/or using food products. Consider students' allergies when offering incentives and rewards as well as classroom crafting activities. Communicate and collaborate in advance with School Nurse (RN) about a field trip , off-site school sponsored event or class party. If for safety reasons, medical alert identification needs to be removed during specific activities, the student should be reminded to replace this identification immediately after the activity is completed. Notify substitute teachers of students with allergies and l eave a clear plan of care regarding the special needs of the student. Keep the student's Allergy Action Plan readily accessible in the classroom in an organized format for substitute teachers and for use in emergencies. F. GUIDANCE COUNSELOR While the school counselor and/or social worker may not always have direct contact with the student, they should be aware of the students in their schools who have a seizure disorder and the potential impact it may have on the student's behavior and performance. Communicate with the School Nurse (RN) as needed in the development of the student's IHP and Allergy Action Plan . Monitor anxiety, stress levels, and social development of students with life -threatening allergies and provide interventions as appropriate. Act as a resource to parents and students regarding anxiety, stress and normal development. Educate classmates to avoid endangering, isolating, stigmatizing or harassing students with food allergies (with parental and student's permission) per LEA policy (at a minimum annually ). G. FOOD SERVICE MANAGER /PERSONNEL Set up policies for the cafeteria regarding food allergic students. Communicate as needed with the School Nurse (RN) regarding the development of the food Allergy Action Plan . File the student's Allergy Action Plan with consent of parent(s). Review the legal protections for a student with special health care needs. Read all food labels and re -check routinely for potenti al food allergens ( see Food Allergen List available in the Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Forms section ). This includes new products as well as items with long shelf life. Page 66 of 120 Train all food service staff and their substitutes to read product food labels and recognize food allergens. Train lunchroom monitors on how to recognize signs of an allergic reaction. Re -train all staff annually. Maintain contact information for manufacturers of food products (Consumer Hotline). Review and follo w sound food handling practices to avoid cross -contamination with potential food allergens. Create specific areas that will be allergen safe, if feasible. Enforce strict sanitation with staff using commercial cleaning solutions on tabletops to avoid cross -contamination. After receiving a doctor's order, make appropriate substitutions or modifications for meals served to students with food allergies; consult with the district food service director as needed. Plan ahead to have safe meals for field trips. Recommend that food service personnel wear non latex gloves. Provide advance copies of the menu to parents/guardians when feasible. Have a functioning communication device to support emergencies. H. SCHOOL BUS COMPANY Provide functioning communication devices. Know local emergency medical services procedures. Recommend that there be no consumption of food on school buses unless medically necessary such as students with diabetes. Respect the student's right to confidentiality and privacy. Individual LEA's school bus company should consider receiving training on emergency allergy response epinephrine administration and CPR training. Off-site School Sponsored Event /School Administered Care Programs J.2.b An epinephrine auto -injector must be with the child on all field trips, both long and short trips. No student should be excluded from a field trip or any extracurricular program or activity due to risk of allergen exposure. The parent of the student at risk of anaphylaxis should be allowed to accompany their child on the school trip in addition to the school chaperone. Parents are not required to attend the trip. As a matter of safe practice, school may reasonably require that parents supply an extra set of emergency medication (epinephrine aut o-injector) for availability during extracurricular activities. Before a field trip or extracurricular activity, the school shall: Notify the student's parent(s) in a timely manner in order to prepare for food/snacks/medications. Prohibit sharing or trading food Make certain that an emergency communication device is always present. Minimum of two (2) people with cell phones is recommended. Clearly identify who is responsible for keeping the epinephrine auto -injector , first aid kit and other medication along with a copy of the student Allergy Action Plan . Have the School Nurse (RN) assess if it is appropriate for the student to carry his/her own epinephrine auto -injector. It is recommended that students and staff use hand wipes before and after eating. Page 67 of 120 Maintain records of the names and phone numbers of parent/guardian of the student, the health care provider, and allergist. Be sure that a trained staff person is assigned to stay with the student at all times if emergency medication has been administered. Immediately call an ambulance to transport the student to the nearest hospital when an epinephrine auto -injector is given. Designate someone to call the student's parents with the name and location of the hospital. Communicate in advance with School Nurse (RN) when a field trip or off -site school sponsored event is planned. Train staff in proper separation, storage and distribution of the children's snacks/lunches. Be sure that the bus driver has the emergency route to the hospital if the cell phone cannot make the connection to EMS. Only if EMS cannot be reached should the bus driver take the child to the nearest Emergency Room in the bus. FOOD ALLERGY AND ANAPHYLAXIS MEDICATION ADMINISTRATION J.3 T.C.A . \u00a7 49-5-415 (e) (1): States that a student with anaphylaxis is entitled to possess and self -administer prescription anaphylaxis medication while on school property or at a school -related event or activity if: (A) The prescription anaphylaxis medication has been prescribed for that student as i ndicated by the prescription label on the medication; (B) The self -administration is done in compliance with the prescription or written instructions from the student's physician or other licensed health care provider; and (C) A parent of the student provides to t he school: i. Written authorization, signed by the parent, for the student to self -administer prescription anaphylaxis medication while on school property or at a school -related event or activity; ii. A written statement, signed by the parent, in which the parent releases the school district and its employees and agents from liability for an injury arising from the student's self - administration of prescription anaphylaxis medication while on school property or at a school - related event or activity, except in cases of wanton or willful misconduct; and iii. A written statement from the student's physician or other licensed health care provider, signed by the physician or provider, that: a) Supports a diagnosis of anaphylaxis; b) Identifies any food or other substances to which the student is allergic; c) Describes any prior history of anaphylaxis, if appropriate; d) Lists any medication prescribed for the child for the treatment of anaphylaxis; e) Details emergency treatment procedures in the event of a reaction; f) Lists the signs and symptoms of a reaction; g) Assesses the student's readiness for self -administration of prescription medication; and h) Provides a list of substitute meals that may be offered by school food service personnel . (2) The physician's statement must be kept on file in the office of the school nurse of the school the student attends or, if there is not a school nurse, in the office of the principal of the school the student attends. (3) If a student uses the medication in a manner other than prescribed, the student may be subject to disciplinary action under the school codes. Page 68 of 120 RECOMMENDATIONS FOR SCHOOL DISTRICT/LEA: The school district will share pertinent health information with school staff who have a legitimate educational interest in the student. A current and updat ed list of all students who are carrying their own epinephrine should be placed in the nurse's office. Provide information about students with life-threatening allergies and their photos (if consent is given by parent) to all staff on a need -to-know basis (including bus drivers). The school system shall maintain and make available a list of those school personnel authorized and trained to administer epinephrine by auto -injector. List of all trained personnel should be filed centrally and immediately available in an emergency. Develop a p olicy on student carrying his or her own epinephrine auto -injector. Administration of epinephrine should also be documented in the students' IHP. LEA shall develop a policy for carrying and disposal of the sharps. Periodically check medications for expiration dates and arrange for them to be updated. Review the Allergy Action Plan as described in the IHP, or if a student does not have an IHP, consider initiating one for first time reaction. T.C.A . \u00a7 49-5-415 (f )(3): States that schools, both public and non-public , be prepared to treat allergic reaction in the event a student's personal epinephrine auto -injector is not available or the student is having a reaction for the first time . Each school in an LEA and each non-public school is authorized to maintain at the school in at least two (2) unlocked, secure locations, including, but not limited to, the school office and the school cafeteria, epinephrine auto -injectors so that epinephrine may be administered to any s tudent believed to be having a life -threatening allergic or anaphylactic reaction. A physician may prescribe epinephrine auto -injectors in the name of an LEA or non-public school to be maintained for use in schools when necessary. When a student does not h ave an epinephrine auto - injector or a prescription for an epinephrine auto -injector on file, t he school nurse or other trained school personnel may utilize the school supply to respond to an anaphylactic reaction, under a standing protocol from a physician licensed to practice medic ine in all its branches. If applicable, a t the beginning of the school year, the school should inform parents of its election to maintain epinephrine auto -injectors for use in emergencies . The D istrict's standing protocol is to be followed in those circumstances . If a student is injured or harmed due to th e administration of epinephrine: The physician will not be held responsible for the injury unless the physician issued the prescription or standing protocol with intention al disregard for safety. The school nurse or other trained school personnel will not be held responsible for the injury unless the school nurse or school employee administered the epinephrine injection with an intentional disregard for safety . Epinephrine Auto -Injector Administration J.3.a For students at risk of experiencing a severe reaction (anaphylax is), epinephrine is prescribed. Epinephrine , also called adrenaline, is naturally produced by the body. When given by injection, it rapidly improves breathing, i ncreases heart rate, and reduces swelling of the face, lips, and throat. Epinephrine is the only medication that can reverse the symptoms of anaphylaxis. However, it must be administered Page 69 of 120 promptly during anaphylaxis to be most effective. Delayed use of epin ephrine during an anaphylactic reaction has been associated with deaths. It is available in an auto -injector (Auvi -Q, Epinephrine by auto -injector should be readily accessible and secure at all times during school hours. It may be carried by the student if appropriate. To promote rapid lifesaving steps, emergency medication should be in accessible and \"unlocked, secure locations\" that can be properly supervised by a nurse or other authorized and trained staff member. Key staff members, such as the teacher, principal, and cafeteria staff, should know where the auto -injector is stored even if they are not trained to administer it. All staff trained in use of epinephrine should know exactly where it is located. Identification of the place where the epinephrine is to be stored is selected after considering where students may be most at risk of anaphylaxis and where the school can provide ready and secure access. The epinephrine may be stored at more than one location. The location of the auto -injector and the backup should be written in the student's health care plan. Instruction and Care of the Epinephrine auto -injector: Should only be injected into the anterolateral aspect of the thigh (outer thigh) . Do not inject into the buttock. Do not expose the epinephrine auto -injector to direct sunlight. Store the epinephrine auto -injector in its original packaging. Keep the epinephrine auto -injector at room temperature (do not refrigerate). Do not store in a vehicle during hot weather or extreme cold. Make sure the solution is clear and colorless. If it is brown, replace with a new unit. Give your used epinephrine auto -injector to a healthcare worker for proper disposal. Do not throw away in a regular trash can. (Dispose per your LEA policy.) Accidental injection of epinephrine into the hands or feet may result in a loss of blood flow to the affected area. If this occurs, immediately go to the nearest emergency room for treatment . Available Epinephrine Auto -Injectors: There are a number of epinephrine auto -injectors that have been approved by the FDA and are available, with a prescription. The devices operate in different ways, so it is important to be properly trained to use the device. Below is a list of the devices currently on the market, links to important information about each product, and training videos on how to use them. 1. Auvi -Q It has a retractable needle system and a red safety guard located at the same end as the needle. Activation of the device by removing the outer case initiates an audio voice recording that provides step -by-step instructions and a 5 second countdown during the injection. Detailed information about Auvi -Q is available at www.auvi -q.com . Training Video for Auvi -Q Page 70 of 120 2. EpiPen\u00ae A disposable, prefilled automatic injection device used to treat life - threatening, allergic emergencies including anaphylaxis. EpiPen contains a single dose of epinephrine. Detailed informati on about EpiPen is available at www.epipen.com Training Video for EpiPen 3. Adrenaclick\u00ae An automatic injection device designed for self -administration delivering one dose of epinephrine . The press and hold technique : press hard, hold in the middle of the outer side of the thigh (upper leg) for 10 seconds - is designed to deliver the full dose of epinephrine . Detailed information about Adrenaclick is available at www.adrenaclick.com . Training Video for Adrenaclick When giving Epinephrine: It is very important when giving epinephrine that the emergency medical system (911) be called and the student transported to the nearest hospital emergency room. Even if the symptoms appear to be resolved, the effect of the injection begins to wear off after 10 to 20 minutes or sooner. Remember to call immediately for further evaluation and treatment. In the event an allergic reaction occurs where there is no known allergic history (first time reaction) , the staff should call the School Nurse (RN) and activate the School Emergency Allergy Response Plan. The emergency medical service should be called immediately (911). FOOD ALLERGY AND ANA PHYLAXIS TRAINING J.4 T.C.A . \u00a7 49-5-415(f )(1) states that guidelines should include e ducation and training for school personnel on the management of students with life-threatening food allergies, including training related to the administration of medication with a cartridge injector. Some health care professionals may have little expertise in anaphylaxis education and/or management but provide support to students w ith allergies . Licensed health care professionals employed or contracted by an LEA who will be providing care to a student with known allergies should demonstrate competency for both knowledge and skills on an annual basis . Suggested Strategy A strategy fo r training provided by National Association of School Nurses (NASN) is to offer different levels of training. For example: o Level 1: General training for all school personnel. This training would be required of all school personnel who need to understand the basics in food allergy education, who will be interacting with students with food allergies, and who may be called to assist others in responding to food allergy -related emergencies. o Level 2: In depth training for personnel wit h frequent contact with a student with food allergies. This training would be required for classroom teachers, physical education Page 71 of 120 teachers, coaches, bus drive rs and food service personnel. Level 2 content should include level 1 stra tegies. o Level 3: Special ized training for individuals responsible for the daily medical management of students with food allergies. This training should be required for the school nurse, district nurse, school physician, and health advocate or health consultant. Level 3 content s hould include level 1 and 2 strategies . Suggested Components for Training Curriculum : o Provide overview of food allergies . o Review signs and symptoms of food allergy and anaphylaxis . o Explain medications for food allergy and anaphylaxis . o Discuss best practices for preventing exposure to food allergens . o Review policies on bullying of and discrimination against students with food allergies . o Delineate communication process during medical emergencies including who to contact for help in an emergency. o FERP A privacy and confidentiality and legal rights of students with food allergies . o Provide guidance for the staff team accountable for the student specific Food Allergy Action/Emergency Care Plan . o Review preventing exposure to allergens . o Discuss school wide s taff response to allergen exposure or symptoms of anaphylaxis . o Train and evaluate staff detection of symptoms of anaphylaxis . o Train, practice and evaluate staff administration of epinephrine auto -injector . o Train, practice and evaluate staff in activating e mergency care plan in case of a food allergy emergency . o Document training and evaluation of training . o Periodically provide training updates as needed . o Provide background on the importance of partnering with parents . o Discuss the need to investigate local em ergency medical services carrying of epinephrine . o Describe the team approach for preventing exposures and responding to emergencies, including identifying the school personnel team needed to support the food allergic student . o Educate regarding legal issues related to students with food allergies . o Reinforce the need for ongoing evaluation and documentation of emergency response and staff competence in responding to food allergy emergencies, including debriefing following an exposure or epinephrine administra tion. Sample Training Checklist is available in the Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Forms section. Suggested Training Resources: 1. Get Trained \u00a9 Get Trained is a program intended to be used as a tool and resource for scripted training of unlicensed school staff to administer epinephrine via an auto injector during an anaphylactic emergency. The program recommendations and content are based on best practices. Each school nurse must exercise independent professional judgment when practicing and conducting training. Because nurse practice acts differ from state to state, each school nurse must ensure before presenting the training that it is consistent with applicable state laws and Page 72 of 120 regulations, including those governing delegation, as well as applicable school district policies and procedures. http://www.nasn.org/ToolsResources/Fo odAllergyandAnaphylaxis/GetTrained 2.

Studies show that most allergic individuals can safely eat peanut oil that has been highly refined (not cold pressed, expeller pressed, or extruded peanut oil). Follow your doctor's advice. A study showed that unlike other legumes, there is a strong possibility of cross -reaction between peanuts and lupine. Mandelonas are peanuts soaked in almond flavoring. Arachis oil is peanut oil. Many experts advise patients allergic to peanuts to avoid tree nuts as well. Sunflower seeds are often produced on equipment shared with peanuts. How to Read a Label for a Soy -Free Diet All FDA -regulated manufactured food products that contain soy as an ingredient are required by U.S. law to list the word \"soy\" on the product label. Avoid foods that contain soy or any of these ingredients: edamame soya miso soybean (curd, granules) natto soy protein (concentrate, hydrolyzed, isolate) shoyu soy (soy albumin, soy cheese, soy fiber, soy flour, soy grits, soy ice cream, soy milk, soy nuts, soy sprouts, soy yogurt) soy sauce tamari textured vegetable protein (TVP) tofu Soy is sometimes found in the following: Asian cuisine vegetable gum vegetable broth vegetable starch Keep the following in mind: The FDA exempts highly refined soybean oil from being labeled as an allergen. Studies show most allergic individuals can safely eat soy oil that has been highly refined ( not cold pressed, expeller pressed, or extruded soybean oil). Soy protein may be found in numerous products, such as breads, cookies, crackers, canned broth and soups, canned tuna and meat, breakfast cereals, high -protein energy bars and snacks, low -fat peanut butters, and processed meats. Most individuals allergic to soy can safely e at soy lecithin. Follow your doctor's advice regarding these ingredients.

More than half of all people who are allergic to one type of fish also are allergic to other fish, so allergists often advise their patients to avoid all fish. Finned fish and shellfish do not come from related families of foods, so being allergic to one does not mean that you will not be able to tolerate the other. Be sure to talk to your doctor about which kinds of fish you can eat and which to avoid. The term \"fish\" encompasses all species of finned fish, including (but not limited to) : anchovies haddock pike snapper bass mahi scrod trout flounder perch sole tuna grouper Mollusks are not considered major allergens under food labeling laws and may not be fully disclosed on a product label. Fish is sometimes found in the following: caesar salad/dressing fish oil surimi (artificial or \"sea caponata (Sicilian eggplant relish) fish sauce imitation fish caviar pizza fish gelatin (kosher gelatin, marine gelatin) seafood flavoring shark cartilage, fin sushi worcestershire sauce Keep the following in mind: Some sensitive individuals may react to aerosolized fish protein through cooking vapors. Seafood restaurants are considered high -risk due to the possibility of cross contamination/cross contact, even if you do not order fish. Ethnic restaurants (i.e., Chinese, African, Indonesian, Thai, and Vietnamese) are considered high -risk because of the common use of fish and fish ingredients and the possibility of cross contamination/cross contact, even if you do not order fish.

Page 81 of 120 K. SEIZURE OVERVIEW Tennessee Code Annotated, Section 49 -5-415 (g)(1) states that public and non-public school personnel who volunteer under no duress or pressure and who have been properly trained by a registered nurse employed or contracted by the LEA or governing board for a non-public school may administer anti -seizure medications, including diazepam ge l, to a student in an emergency situation based on that student's IHP; however, if a school nurse is available, on site, and able to reach the student within the time limit for administration specified in the IHP, then the nurse shall provide this service to the student. According to the National Epilepsy Foundation (www.epilepsy.com) a bout 300,000 American children under the age of 15 have epilepsy and 200,000 new cases of epilepsy are diagnosed each year. Often the cause for seizures is not apparent. Due to such a high incidence of seizure activity, most schools will have one or more students who may need care for a seizure problem at school. An LEA shall not assign a student with epilepsy or other seizure disorder to a school other than the school for which the student is zoned or would otherwise regularly attend because the student has a seizure disorder. With the availability of an effective medication which may rapidly stop a seizure, it is important that provis ions are made to provide this medication when a nurse is not available in the school. Therefore, the purpose of T.C.A. \u00a7 49-5-415 is to allow school districts to develop and implement an Emergency Seizure Response Plan that includes training school staff i n the recognition of seizure activity and the administration of anti -seizure medication in the school setting. Using this document as a guide, each school district must develop processes to identity students with seizure conditions that would require diaz epam rectal gel . It is important to note that not all students with seizure problems are treated with diazepam rectal gel . For other students there are different emergency anti -seizure medications that may be used. While these guidelines specifically addre ss using diazepam rectal gel, they could also be used to develop an Emergency Seizure Response Plan for other anti -seizure medications. Trained volunteer school personnel administering emergency anti -seizure medications under subsection 49-5-415(g) (6), any registered nurse who provides training to administer such medications and any local board of education or governing board for a non -public school authorizing the same shall not be liable in any court of law for injury resulting from the reasonable and prudent assistan ce in the administration of such medications, if performed pursuant to the policies and guidelines developed by the Departments of Education and Health and approved by applicable regulatory or governing boards or agencies. Once a child with a seizure diso rder is identified and parents express the desire to have diazepam rectal gel available at school, pursuant to T.C.A. \u00a7 49-5-415 (g )(2), a registered nurse employed or contracted by the LEA shall be responsible for developing, updating and maintaining an Individualized Health Plan (IHP) for each student outlining the response plan for that individual child. The following information is essential in the development of a n IHP for a student diagnosed with epilepsy/seizure disorder : All medical diagnoses that may impact medication administration Known allergies to food or medication Specific seizure history Specific type(s) of seizure(s) Page 82 of 120 Explanation the student's response to any previous administration of emergency anti -seizure medication Frequency of seizure activity Description of the usual type of seizure activity Usual duration of seizure activity Description of usual post seizure activity and plan Medications , especially the ones that may potentiate emergency anti -seizure medication Previous medication history Requirements for reporting administration of emergency anti -seizure medication, prescription medication or over -the-counter medicines that are administered when the student is not present at school. Such notification shall be given after administration of medication, before or at the beginning of the next school day in which the student is in attendance . Sample IHP for a student with seizure disorders is available in the Seizure Forms section. EMERGENCY SEIZURE RESPONSE PLAN: The average convulsive seizure in a child who has epilepsy is not a medical emergency. It usually resolves without problems. It does not require immediate medical attention unless: A child has a seizure and there is no known history of epilepsy. Some other medical problem might be causing the seizure and emergency treatment of that problem might be required. Consciousness does not return after the seizure ends. A second seizure begins shortly after the first one without regaining co nsciousness in between. The seizure shows no sign of ending after 5 minutes. If a child hits his head with force, either during the sei zure or just before it began, and if one or more of the following signs is noted, call for immediate medical attention: Difficulty in rousing Vomiting Complaints of difficulty with vision Persistent headache after a short rest period Unconsciousness with failure to respond Dilation of the pupils of the eye, or if the pupils are unequal in size. If a seizure occurs while swimming, he should be checked by a doctor as soon as possible even if he seems to be fully recovered. DURING SEIZURE ACTIVITY: STAY WITH THE CHILD. If falling or generalized jerking occurs: o Place child on floor . o Gently support head to side position and monitor breathing and pulse . o DO NOT restrain child . o DO NOT try and place anything in child's mouth or between child's teeth . o Protect child by moving items away that may cause injury - e.g. desks, chairs. o Loosen clothing at neck and waist; remove eye glasses (if applicable). o Have another classroom adult remove/direct students from the area. Use watch. TIME THE SEIZURE . Observe pattern of the seizure and be prepared to describe it. CALL 911 if: Page 83 of 120 o Absence of breathing and/or pulse (Start CPR for absenc e of breathing and pulse) . o Seizure of 5 minutes or greater duration . o Two or more consecutive (without a period of consciousness between) seizures which total 5 minutes or greater . o No previous history of seizure activity . o Continued unusually pale or bluish skin/lips or noisy breathing after the seizure has stopped . o Emergency anti -seizure medication is administered . AFTER SEIZURE ACTIVITY: 1) Reorient and reassure child. a. Allow/assist change into clean clothing if necessary. b. Allow child to sleep, as desired, after seizure. c. Allow child to eat, as desired, once fully alert and oriented. 2) A child recovering from a generalized seizure may manifest abnormal behavior such as incoherent speech, extreme restlessness, and confusion. This may last from five minutes to hours. 3) Inform parent immediately of seizure by telephone if: a. Seizure is different from usual type/frequency/has not occurred at school in past month. b. Seizure meets criteria for 91 1 emergency call. c. Child has not returned to \"normal self\" after 30/60 minu tes. 4) It is the parent's responsibility to determine follow -up care with health care provider for symptoms. SEIZURE DESCRIPTION K.1 A seizure happens when the electrical system of the brain malfunctions. Instead of discharging electrical energy in a controlled manner, the brain cells keep firing. Normally the brain sends small electrical impulses from nerve cell to nerve cell to commun icate and process information that controls our day to day bodily functions and activities. The best way to explain what seizures are is to imagine abnormal electrical impulses firing rapidly in one or more parts of the brain. These rapidly firing impulses disrupt the normal electrical operations of the brain and result in altered levels of consciousness, altered sensations, and possibly unusual muscle contractions causing parts of the body to stiffen and convulse. If only part of the brain is affected, i t may cloud awareness, block normal communication, and produce a variety of undirected, uncontrolled, unorganized movements. Most seizures last only a minute or two, although confusion afterwards may last longer. An epilepsy syndrome is defined by a collec tion of similar factors, such as type of seizure, when they developed in life, and response to treatment. Under certain conditions, such as a reaction to medication or during pregnancy, anyone can have a seizure. Seizures are also common in certain illne sses such as when a child has a rapidly rising fever or when a student with diabetes has severely low blood sugar. Most of the time a seizure only lasts for a few seconds. Occasionally they will last for several minutes. When seizures continue for over fiv e minutes, they are considered a medical emergency and require treatment to stop them. Page 84 of 120 TYPES OF SEIZURES There are many different kinds of seizures, and they do not all cause the same symptoms and behaviors. People may experience just one type or more than one. The kind of seizure a person has depends on which part and how much of the brain is affected by the electrical disturbance that produces seizures. Experts divide seizures into generalized seizures (absence, atonic, tonic -clonic, myoclonic), parti al seizures (simple and complex), nonepileptic seizures and status epilepticus. What most people think of when they think of a seizure is what is known as a generalized tonic -clonic seizure. These used to be called grand mal seizures but are now classifie d by the symptoms present during the seizure. Tonic -clonic type seizures are characterized by sudden stiffing of the body, arms, or legs usually lasting several seconds. This stiffing is followed by a rhythmic contraction and relaxation of certain muscle groups causing the body to jerk. At the other end of the seizure spectrum are Absence Seizures, formally called petit mal seizures. When someone has an absence seizure the person might appear as if they are staring off into space or like they temporarily \"z oned out\" for a few seconds. Classification of Epileptic Seizures 1. Primary Generalized Seizures Absence Seizures (formerly called petit mal) : o Typical brief episodes of staring, blinking, being unaware of surroundings; usually last less than 10 seconds but may last up to 20 seconds . o Atypical staring spells lasting between 5 to 30 seconds, eye blinking or slight jerking movement of the lips may occur; partial reduction in responsiveness . Myoclonic: Brief jerks of a muscle or group of muscles; usually in volving the neck, shoulders, and upper arms . Atonic: Sudden loss of muscle strength, eyelids may droop, head may nod, objects may be dropped, or the child may fall to the ground; usually last less than 15 seconds, injury is common; child typically needs to wear a helmet. Clonic: Rhythmic jerking mov ements of the arms and legs, may be generalized Tonic: Sudden stiffening movements of the body, arms, or legs involving both sides of the body; usually last less than 20 seconds . Tonic -Clonic (formerly called grand mal): Convulsive seizures ; body briefly stiffens followed by a jerking motion of the arms and legs; loss of consciousness and falls frequently occur, excessive saliva production may be present, possible loss of bowel and bladder control; usually last a couple of minutes ; the child is often tire d or confused after the seizure and may want to go to sleep. 2. Partial Seizures (seizures originating in specific parts of the brain) Simple Partial (focal seizures) Consciousness not impaired o With motor symptoms Jerking and stiffening o With somatosensory Touch, smell, hearing, taste, and sight symptoms o With autonomic symptoms Heart rate change, internal sensations o With psychic symptoms Dreamy state Complex Partial seizures Consciousness impaired Movements of the mouth and face (e .g., lip smacking, chewing, and swallowing movements), the hands and arms (e.g., fumbling, picking, and tapping movements), Page 85 of 120 vocalizations (e.g., grunts or repetition of words or phrases) Seizure Clustering Repetitive or serial seizures Clustering implies that the occurrence of one seizure may influence the probability of a subsequent seizure. Health care provider will give specific details. EPILEPSY Some people have a condition known as epilepsy in which they have multiple recurrent seizures. The cause for epilepsy is not always known but usually someone with epilepsy will have had an evaluation to try and determine the cause for their seizures. Altho ugh the symptoms of a seizure may affect any part of the body, the electrical events that produce the symptoms occur in the brain. The location of that event, the extent of its reach with the tissue of the brain, and how long it lasts all have profound eff ects. Once they are determined to have epilepsy, treatment is usually initiated with medication, diet, special devices, or even surgery to treat the problem. Classifying epilepsy by seizure type alone leaves out other important information about the patient and the episodes themselves. Classifying into syndromes takes a number of characteristics into account, including the type of seizure; typical EEG recording s; clinical features such as behavior during the seizure; the expected course of the disorder; precipitating features; expected response to treatment; and genetic factors. Caus es of Epilepsy Seizures are symptoms of abnormal brain function. With the exception of very young children and the elderly, the cause of the abnormal brain function is usually not identifiable. In about seven out of ten people with epilepsy, no cause can be found. Among the rest, the cause may be any one of a number of things that can make a difference in the way the brain works. Head injuries or lack of oxygen during birth may damage the delicate electrical system in the brain. Other causes include brain tumors, genetic conditions (such as tuberous sclerosis), lead poisoning, problems in development of the brain before birth, and infections li ke meningitis or encephalitis. A child's brain contains billions of nerve cells. They communicate with each other t hrough tiny electrical charges that fire on and off in a coordinated fashion. When some or all of these cells suddenly begin to fire in a disorganized manner, a wave of electrical energy sweeps through the brain, causing a seizure. Seizures interfere wit h the child's normal brain functions. They produce sudden changes in consciousness, movement, or sensation. Some people use the term \"seizure disorder\" instead of \"epilepsy\" to describe this condition. Both mean the same thing , an underlying tendency to ex perience seizures. Having a single seizure does not mean a child has epilepsy . Epilepsy is the name for seizures that happen more than once without a known treatable cause, such as fever or low blood sugar. While epilepsy can begin at any time , many cases start in early childhood. One reason is that immature brains are more susceptible to seizures from any cause. Pinpointing the cause of epilepsy is difficult at any age. In many cases there is no known cause and they are labeled as having idiopathic epileps y. \"Idiopathic\" is a Latin word meaning \"of unknown cause.\" Genetic Factors Epilepsy is a common disorder and frequently within an extended family more than one person may have Page 86 of 120 seizures. In most cases a specific pattern of inheritance of epilepsy within the family cannot be determined. However, there does appear to be a slightly increased risk of epilepsy in close relatives of individuals with seizures compared to the risk in the general population. Sometimes there is a family history of seizures, includ ing febrile (fever -caused) seizures, epilepsy, or seizures in childhood that later went into remission. Absence and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy are two types of epilepsy that tend to run in families and are thought to have a genetic basis. A lot of researc h is going on now in an effort to find the genetic roots of some forms of epilepsy or the inherited conditions that have seizures as a primary symptom. Seizure Trigg ers Some people who have epilepsy have no special seizure triggers, while others are able to recognize things in their lives that do affect their seizures. Keep in mind, however, that just because two events happen around the same time does not mean that one is the cause of the other. Generally, the most frequent cause of an unexpected seizure is failure to take anti -seizure medication as prescribed. Other factors include ingested substances, hormone fluctuations, stress, altered sleep patterns and photosensitivity. Photosensitive epilepsy is more common in children and adolescents, especially those with generalized epilepsy, in particular juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. It becomes less frequent with age, with relatively few cases i n the mid -twenties . Many people are unaware that they are sensitive to flickering lights or to certain kinds of patterns until they have a seizure. They may never go on to develop epilepsy, which is characterized by recurrent spontaneous seizures, though a seizure may be triggered by certain photic conditions. Many individuals who are disturbed by light exposure do not develop seizures but experience other symptoms such as headache, nausea, dizziness and more. They do not have epilepsy. To help minimize t he risk of photosensitive epilepsy with computer m onitors: Use a flicker free monitor (LCD display or flat screen). Use a monitor glare guard. Wear non glare glasses to reduce glare from the screen. Take frequent breaks from tasks involving the computer. TREATMENT OF SEIZURES There are several possible treatment methods to use to control epilepsy including medication, surgery, a special ketogenic diet, or an implanted magnet that can stimulate the v agus nerve when activated. Of these treatments, drug therapy is by far the most commonly used, and is usually the first to be tried. A number of medications are currently used in the treatment of epilepsy. These medications control different types of seizu res. People who have more than one type of seizure may have to take more than one kind of medication, although physicians try to control seizures with one drug if possible. A seizure preventing drug (also known as an antiepileptic or anticonvulsant drug) w ill not work properly until it reaches a certain level in the body, and that level has to be maintained. The goal is to keep the blood level high enough to prevent seizures, but not so high that it causes excessive sleepiness or other unpleasant side effec ts. However, even with therapeutic levels of anti -seizure medication, sometimes a seizure can still occur. When this happens additional medication is needed to stop the seizure. One such medication that is now commonly used is diazepam (commonly known as Valium). A special formulation of diazepam has been developed that can be administered to an unconscious person during a seizure. This special formulation is administered rectally as a gel, and is known by the trade name Diastat \u00ae. Page 87 of 120 Diazepam rectal gel works to stop seizure activity by acting on brain cell interactions that inhibit the seizure discharges. It is rapidly absorbed from the lining of the rectum and quickly achieves therapeutic levels in the blood. It can be used in both children and adults. SEIZURE : CARE OF STUDENT K.2 The immediate first aid for seizures will be outlined in the IHP/safety plan developed for each child with seizures. Since not all children with seizures have an order for anti -seizure medication at school, it is very important th at school staff understand what first aid response is necessary as well as the appropriate after seizure care. Below are the first aid steps to follow for seizures. This information is also included on the seizure safety plan with additional space to custo mize the plan for each student with a seizure diagnosis. For all Seizures: It is important to respond quickly to assist the student having a seizure. Most seizures last only a short time and may not require diazepam . The initial response for all seizure s involves the following steps: 1) Keep calm ; let seizure run its course. 2) DO NOT attempt to restrain or force objects between teeth. 3) Ease child to floor if possible and remove objects from the immediate area which may cause injury. 4) Turn on side to prevent aspirating saliva. 5) Loosen tight clothing and place something soft and flat under his/her head. 6) Time the seizure and observe the seizure pattern (such as the number of seizures clustered together, nature of movements and level of c onsciousness). 7) All students with seizures will have an IHP with emergency guidelines in place. Roles and Responsibilities for Management of Seizures K.2.a Any member of the school staff could be present while a student is having a seizure. The School Nurse (RN) should provide training , including the emergency response plan, to all school personnel about the nature of epilepsy and seizure disorder, how to recognize them, and what to do in the event that one occurs. When the only symptoms of a seizure disorder are frequent episodes of blank staring and unresponsiveness, the teacher is often the first adult to notice them. All staff should understand that they should call the school nurse as soon as possible in order to evaluate the student after the seizure has subsided and to determine if any further medical attention is needed. When teachers, students and school personnel better understand epilepsy, schools are more equipped to provide the best possible environment for students with seizures. A. STUDENT WITH EPI LEPSY/SEIZURE DISORDERS Learn to recognize symptoms and take them seriously in early stages. Take as much responsibility for avoiding triggers as possibl e, based on developmental level. If age appropriate, participation in development of the seizure health plan. Promptly inform an adult if he/she is aware of an impending seizure. Notify school staff when he/she is not feeling well. Develop trusting friendships with peers and ask them for help if needed. Report teasing or harassment immediately. Wearing a medical alert identification tag while in school is strongly advised . Be aware of and follow any restrictions such as swimming/use of playground equipment . Page 88 of 120 B. PARENT/ GUARDIAN Inform the School Nurse (RN) and administrators of your child's medical condition prior to the opening of school or as soon as possible after diagnosis. Participate in team meetings and development of the IHP or communicate with individual school personnel who will be in contact with your child. Provide the school with emergency conta ct information (cell phone, work number, beeper) and designate someone to act on your behalf if you are unavailable. Provide a written authorization to administer the medication at school with district's release of liability pursuant to T.C.A. \u00a7 49 -5-415. Deliver the medication to the school in an original package with the dosage locked in by the dispensing pharmacy with a prescription label affixed with a valid expiration date. While the parent/guardian is present, the nurse will check to ascertain that t he medication is ready to use per the manufacturer's recommendation (i.e. green ready seal is visible for Diastat\u00ae) otherwise, the parent/guardian should return medication to the pharmacy for correction. Provide and transport to the school all medications, equipment (i.e. protective head gear) and supplies. Replace expired medication prior to the expiration date. If not replaced by parent or guardian, then 911 will be called in the event of a seizure based on criteria for use of the emergency anti - seizure medication. Understand that t he medication order is good for the entire school year unless rescinded in writing. Notify the school administrator or School Nurse (RN ) if emergency anti -seizure medication or any new prescription or over -the-counter medicat ion is given outside of school hours by the next school day. Provide the school with updates on the child's medical status annually and as needed. Provid ing medical alert identification tag for your child is strongly advised . Communicate with schools regarding parent participation on school field trips or off -site school sponsored events. When 911 is called for treatment of seizures, it is at the parent or guardian's expense. C. SCHOOL NURSE (RN) Introduce yourself to the student and orient him/her how to access the nurse. At the beginning of the school year, meet with the parent of the student with a seizure disorder or as soon as possible after diagnosis. Obtain and maintain a current knowledge base and update skills and abilities related to the medical management of seizures. Organize and facilitate planning meetings with the student's parent/guardian and other key school staff to discuss planning and implementation of the student's IHP. Develop an IHP in cooperation with the student, the parent s/guardians, the health care provider, and other school -based staff. Regularly review and update the IHP whenever there is a change in medical management or the student's response to care. Establish and maintain a working relationship with the student's parent/guardians and health care provider and act as a liaison between the student's authorized health care provider and the school. Page 89 of 120 Coordinate or conduct child specific training to all school -based personnel who will have direct contact with the student on how to respond in an emergency per LEA policy. Make sure there is a contingency plan for substitute School Nurse (RN) . Describe the established method of communication for the student /nurse/volunteer/witness to facilitate a rapid response in the event of a seizure. Require notification of the administration of emergency anti -seizure medication or over the counter non -prescription medication outside of school hours with instructions to return to the School Nurse (RN) or school administrator the next school day that student attends. Check to verify that the correct dose of medication is ready to use per the manufacturer's recommendation (i.e. green ready seal is visible for Diastat\u00ae) otherwise, the parent/guardian should return medication to the pharmacy for correction. Identify the location of the medication in the school. Identify any specific storage and handling required for the medication. Determine the plan for anti -seizure medication that is transported daily to and from school. Indicate the specific time frame for administration of emergency anti -seizure medication intervention. School administrator/ School Nurse (RN) shall check monthly, and document, the expiration dates for each anti -seizure emergency medic ation in possession of the school. At least one (1) month prior to the expiration date of each medication, the School Nurse (RN) or administrator shall inform the student's parent or guardian of the expiration date and the need for replacement medication . Request a functioning communicati on device in the health clinic (example: phone system, intercom or two way radios ). Serve as the student's advocate. Respect the student's confidentiality and right to privacy. D. SCHOOL ADMINISTRATOR Participate in planning the IHP as a member of the management team, and support school personnel, the student and parents in its implementation. Include in the school's emergency response plan a written plan outlining emergency procedures for managing seizures . Include district health professional in the development and reviews of health policies and emergency protocols for the LEA's. Monitor overall compliance with the implementation of the Emergency Response Plan. Recommend that communication devices are provided and a re in functioning condit ion in the appropriate location ( nurse's clinic, classroom, cafeteria etc .) Require that training and education of all involved personnel is completed and documented . Inform parent/guardia n if any student experiences a seizure at school. School administrator/ School Nurse (RN) shall check monthly, and document, the expiration dates for each anti -seizure emergency medication in possession of the school. At least one (1) month prior to the expiration date of each medication, the Scho ol Nurse (RN) or administrator shall inform the student's parent or guardian of the expiration date and the need for replacement medication . Communicate in advance with School Nurse (RN) to review field trip plans and emergency care. Provide adequate time for School Nurse (RN) to train school personnel who volunteer. Page 90 of 120 E. EDUCATIONAL PERSONNEL (TEACHERS, AID ES, COACHES etc.) Participate in team meetings for the student with epilepsy/seizure disorders. Be aware of signs and symptoms of a seizure and to follow planned procedure during and after a seizure as described in the Emergency Response Plan. Be sure volunteers, student teachers, aides, specialists and substitute teachers are informed of the student's diagnosis and necessary safe guards on a need -to-know ba sis. Request that the classroom have a functioning intercom, two way radios or other communication device for communication with the School Nurse (RN) and administrator. Work with the School Nurse (RN) to educate other parents about the presence and needs of the child with epilepsy/seizure disorders on a need to know basis and with parent's permission. Respect the student's right to confidentiality and privacy. Participate in the planning for stude nt's re -entry to school after a seizure has occurred , when possible. Communicate and collaborate in advance with the School Nurse (RN) to review field trip plans and emergency care. If for safety reasons, medical alert identification needs to be removed during specific activities, the student should be reminded to replace this identification immediately after the activity is completed. Notify substitute teachers of students with epilepsy/seizure disorders and l eave a clear plan of care regarding the special needs of the student. Keep the student's Emergency Respon se Plan for Seizures readily accessible in the classroom in an organized format for substitute teachers and for use in emergencies. F. GUIDANCE COUNSELOR While the school counselor and/or social worker may not always have direct contact with the student, the y should be aware of the students in their schools who have a seizure disorder and the potential impact it may have on the student's behavior and performance. Communicate with the School Nurse (RN) as needed in the development of the student's IHP. Monitor anxiety, stress levels, and social development of students with seizure disorders and provide interventions as appropriate. Act as a resource to parents and students regarding anxiety, stress and normal development. Educate classmates to avoid enda ngering, isolating, stigmatizing or harassing students with epilepsy/seizure disorders (with parental and student's permission) per LEA policy (at a minimum annually ). When an episode of automatic behavior or a convulsion occurs in the classroom, the whole class is affected. Provide interventions as appropriate. G. FOOD SERVICE MANAGER /PERSONNEL Be aware of special dietary requirements i.e. ketogenic diet. Be able to identify signs and symptoms of student distress. Should be knowledgeable about activation of emergency services. Have a functioning communication device to support emergencies. Page 91 of 120 H. SCHOOL BUS COMPANY Provide functioning communication devices. Know local emergency medical services procedures. Respect the student's right to confidentiality and privac y. Individual LEA's school bus company should consider receiving CPR training. Off-site School Sponsored Event/School Administered Care Programs K.2.b No student should be excluded from a field trip or any extracurricular program or activity due to seizure diso rders. The parent of the student should be allowed to accompany their child on the school trip in addition to the school chaperone. Parents are not required to attend the trip. The teacher requesting/organizing the field trip will coordinate with the principal, school RN or designee to meet the student's health care needs. As a matter of safe practice, the school may reasonably require that parents supply an extra set of emergency anti -seizure medication for availability during extracurricular activities. Before a field trip or extracurricular activity, the school shall: Notify the parent(s) of the student with epilepsy/seizure disorders in a timely manner in order to prepare for medications. Plan activities that take into account students with epilepsy/seizure disorders who are participating. Train participating school staff in emergency responses relative to student's needs to include administration of student's emergency medications. Make certain that an emergency communication device is always present. Minimum of two (2) people with cell phones is recommended. Maintain records of the names and phone numbers of parent/guardian of the student and the health care provider . Designate someone to call the student's parents with the name and location of the hospital. Be sure that the bus driver has the emergency route to the hospital if the cell phone cannot make the connection to EMS. Only if EMS cannot be reached should the bus driver take the child to the nearest Emergency Room in the bus. SEIZURE MEDICATION ADMINISTRATION K.3 T.C.A . \u00a7 49-5-415 (g ) addresses the administration of anti -seizure medications in school settings in emergency situations. This statute establishes procedures for all Local Education Agencies (LEAs) and the governing boards of non -public schools that choose to allow volunteer school per sonnel to administer anti - seizure medication. School personnel in both public and non -public schools who volunteer under no duress or pressure and who have been properly trained by a registered nurse employed or contracted by the LEA or governing board fo r a non -public school may administer emergency anti -seizure medications, including diazepam gel, to a student in an emergency situation based on that student's Individualized Health Plan (IHP). At least one (1) school employee is to serve as a witness on any occasion a volunteer administers emergency anti -seizure medication during an emergency situation, unless a witness is not available within the time limit for administration specified in the IHP. Page 92 of 120 Training shall be conducted as soon as volunteer staff h as been determined, and shall be repeated annually thereafter. In addition, competencies to administer emergency anti -seizure medications shall be documented in the personnel file of all volunteer school personnel. All volunteers trained to administer eme rgency anti -seizure medications shall also be trained in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) consistent with guidelines of the American Heart Association prior to anti -seizure medication training. When a trained volunteer determines the administration of diazepam gel is necessary, school officials shall immediately summon local emergency medical services to the school to provide necessary monitoring or transport to safeguard the health and condition of the student. Trained volunteer school personnel admin istering a nti-seizure medications , any registered nurse who provides training to administer such medications and any local board of education or governing board for a non-public school authorizing the same shall not be liable in any court of law for injury resulting from the reasonable and prudent assistance in the administration of such medications, if performed pursuant to the policies and guidelines developed by the Department s of Health and Education and approved by applicable regulatory or governing boards or agencies. Prior to the administration of any emergency anti -seizure medication by a volunteer or a school nurse it is essential that the proper documentation be in place and the appropriate forms be correctly completed and authorized. Each LEA currently has proprietary medication administration forms that are used in their district for the authorization of medication at school. These forms can still be used by school dist ricts as their written authorization to administer anti -seizure medication including diazepam rectal gel . The student's parent or guardian shall provide: A written authorization to administer the medication at school . A written statement from the student's health care practitioner that includes the following information: o the student's name o name and purpose of the medication o prescribed dosage o route of administration o the frequency that the medication may be administe red o detailed circumstances under which the medication may be administered o a list of other medications student is taking, with emphasis on any medication that could increase or change the effects of diazepam The written authorization to administer emerge ncy anti -seizure medication shall be kept on file in the office of the school nurse or school administrator. Unless subsequently rescinded in writing, such authorization shall be effective for the entirety of the school year in which it is granted. New aut horization must be obtained each school year. The completed medication administration form must be supplied to the school by the child's parent or guardian along with the medication prescribed. The prescribed medication must be in the original package with the dosage locked in by the dispensing pharmacy with a prescription label affixed with a valid expiration date. A student's parent or guardian, who has given the student's school written authorization to administer emergency anti -seizure medication, sha ll, in accordance with the student's IHP, notify the school Page 93 of 120 administrator or school nurse if emergency anti -seizure medication or prescription or over -the-counter medicines are administered to the student at a time at which the stu dent is not present at school. Diazepam Gel Administration K.3.a Diazepam is a benzodiazepine class medication (Valium) used to stop prolonged seizures. In the rectal gel preparation, it is more convenient to administer to patients who cannot swallow during or after seizures. It is supplied in a syringe like container and has a small plastic applicator tip that is inserted just inside the rectum. The dose is predetermined by child's age and weight, and is delivered in pre set dosages. The most common side effect of diazepam is sedation. This sedation is more likely to occur at higher dosages or if the medication has previously been given within the past eight hours. Therefore it is critical for school personnel to know about same day use of diazepam prior to school. Diazepam rectal gel is not to be used more than 5 times a month and/or more than once in 5 days. It is also important for school personnel to be informed by the health care provider of any interactions between diazepam rectal gel and other medication the student ma y be taking that could possibly potentiate the sedative effect. The dosage will be predetermined by the child's health care provider and that specific dose will be loaded into the delivery container (i.e. Diastat\u00ae AcuDial) and locked by the pharmacy. It i s not necessary for school personnel to calculate the dos e to be administered at school. Prior to Administration: The following must be in place to enable procedure to be performed at school. Medication Authorization form completed by health care provider and signed by parent, including indications/contraindications and follow -up plan. Individualized Health Plan (IHP) or Individualized Education Plan (IEP) or other written instructions for adm inistration of this medication. Properly labeled pharmaceutical container with medication dosage locked with the ready seal visible (green in color for Diastat\u00ae) and specific instructions noted. Prior to storing the medication for future use, the School N urse (RN) must verify the correct dosage has been dialed and locked by the pharmacy with the ready seal visible, check ti p for cracks, and document on the Emergency Medication Log. Rectal diazepam medication should be stored in a secure and readily accessible place at school. Ideally a separate dose of the medication can be kept at the school at all times to avoid the possibility of leaving the medication at home when the device is transported back and forth each day. If this is not possible, other plans for storage and transport of medication will be outlined in the child's IHP. The volunteer trained to administer rectal diazepam must have current certification in CPR. Instructions and health care provider's orders for rectal diazepam administration will be in the IHP in a predetermined location along with supplies necessary for administration and communicat ion with EMS/parent . Knowledge by the nurse and/or properly trained volunteer on what type of seizure activity this medication is to be administered for and how many minutes into the seizure it is to be given, as describ ed by the heal th care provider. Medication administration log. Seizure Report. A sample seizure observation r eport is available in the Seizure Forms section. Check expiration date and ensure that protective cap is removed with the seal pin intact prior to administration. Page 94 of 120 Make sure the correct dose appears through the dose display window. Th is is a visual indication that the barrel of the delivery container (i.e. Diastat \u00ae AcuDial ) is in the correct position for the desired dose. o Ensure that the locking ring is engaged. o The \"READY\" band (green in color for Diastat\u00ae) will be revealed at the base of the barrel. This allows you to see that the unit has been locked. o Repeat these steps for each dose administered. Administer rectal diazepam as directed by health care provider's orders designating number of minutes to be given into the seizure. Review manufacturer's procedure for Diastat\u00ae AcuDial a dministration : http://diastat.valeantonline.com/how -to-administer Rectal diazepam orders must include the following information: o Duration and type of seizure activity before rectal diazepam is administe red. Volunteer must be trained by registered nurse on exact conditions when to treat with rectal diazepam per health care provider's order. o Any contraindications to the rectal diazep am (e.g., fever, respiratory infections, etc.). o Exact dose of the drug. School Nurse (RN) , or volunteer in lieu of nurse, must verify the dosage received matches the healthcare provider's order and document this on the Medication Log. Always call 911 and communicate the following: o Time of seizure onset o Description of seizure activity o Time seizure ended o Time rectal diazepam dosage given o Who administered rectal diazepam Afte r administering rectal diazepam, the school n urse/trained volunteer will be responsible for monitoring until EMS arrives. Document seizure activity and administration of medication . Notif ication system for parent/guardian. Steps for Administering Diazepam Rectal Gel : 1. Put student on their side where they can't fall . 2. Get the medication. 3. Get Syringe. Note: seal pin is attached to the cap. 4. Push up with thumb and pull to remove cap from syringe. Be sure seal pin is removed with the cap. 5. Lubricate rectal tip with lubricating jelly. 6. Turn person on sid e facing you and remove clothing 7. Bend upper leg forward to expose rectum. 8.

Page 95 of 120 SEIZURE TRAINING K.4 Tennessee Code Annotated, Section 49 -5-415(g)(4) provides that o nce a public or private school has determined to allow volunteer staff to administer anti -seizure medication in an emergency situation, the training referenced in subdivision (g)(3) shall be conducted as soon as possible, and shall be repeated annually thereafter. In addition, competencies to administer anti -seizure medications shall be documented in the personnel file of all volunteer school personnel. All volunteers trained to administer anti -seizure medications shall also be trained in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Some health care professional s may have little expertise in seizure education and/or management but provide support to a student with a seizure disorder . Licensed health care professionals employed or contracted by an LEA who will be providing care to a student with a seizure disorder should demonstrate competency for both knowledge and skills on an annual basis . The curriculum for training includes: 1) General education about seizures and epilepsy. 2) The recognition of prolonged seizure activity requiring intervention. 3) Immediate first a id techniques including cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) for the management of seizures. 4) Protocol and proper technique for the administration of emergency anti -seizure medication. 5) Appropriate post seizure aftercare. An LEA that chooses to allow school personnel volunteers to be trained to administer emergency anti -seizure medication in an emergency situation will provide the following: o School personnel who volunteer under no duress will be trained in the administration of an emergency anti -seizu re medication. o Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), consistent with guidelines of the American Heart Association, will be taught to any school personnel volunteer prior to receiving emergency anti - seizure medication training. The minimum training should b e equivalent to the American Heart Association's Family and Friends curriculum. o If the School Nurse (RN) or school personnel volunteer is not available or is unable to administer emergency anti -seizure medication, 911 will be called, in accordance with the Individualized Health Plan (IHP) . o School Administrator/ School Nurse (RN) will conduct a monthly check of each anti -seizure medication in possession of the school and notify the parent/guardian one (1) month prior to the medication expiration date. o The L EA will maintain CPR training and emergency anti -seizure medication training documentation in the school personnel volunteer's personnel file. o Upon administration of emergency anti -seizure medication, the school officials will call 911. o LEA shall not assign a student to a school other than the one to which the student is zoned or would otherwise regularly attend because the student has a seizure disorder. School Nurse Training Responsibilities: o Conduct an assessment and document the volu nteer's competency in understanding seizures, the medication, method of administration and all tasks required to carry out the specific guidelines for administration of emergency anti -seizure medication. The School Nurse (RN) will Page 96 of 120 determine the competency of the volunteer to administer the emergency anti -seizure medication. o Verify that the CPR status of the volunteer is current and consistent with guidelines of the American Heart Association prior to anti -seizure emergency medi cation training , and place certification of training in the personnel or other appropriate school file. o Provide volunteer school personnel training in the recognition of seizures and especially prolonged seizure activity that may require rapid administration of emergency anti -seizure medication in the school setting. Suggested Components for Training Curriculum: The participant(s) will demonstrate and/or verbalize the following competencies: o Know which authorization forms are required to be completed for students with conditions requiring the emergency administration of emergency anti -seizure medication (including diazepam rectal gel) in accordance with school district policy and requirements. o Have a ba sic understanding of seizures and the different types and characteristics of each type of seizure. o Develop an understanding of how to manage seizures during the school day based upon health care provider's seizure authorization, including immediate first aid for seizures and techniques for CPR. o Know the five rights (5 R's) of medication administration. o Read medication label and know how to correctly follow directions on medication label. o Proper storage of prescription medication. o Know h ow to appropriately administer diazepam rectal gel . o Know the s teps to follow after administering diazepam rectal gel . o Know w hen to call EMS (911). o How to dispose of unused emergency anti -seizure medication/delivery device. o Both a written test and a skills check should be included, and the learner must demonstrate competency on both .

Reduced BP or associated symptom s (collapse, syncope, incontinence) 4. Persistent GI symptoms (cramping abdominal pain, vomiting) Anaphylaxis may be fatal, in particular if not treated promptly with epinephrine. Q. Is anaphylaxis a medical emergency? A. YES, anaphylaxis requires immediate attention because death may occur within minutes. Page 111 of 120 Q. What are some of the causes of anaphylaxis? A. Foods - milk, eggs, fish, seafood, shellfish, food additives, yeast, gluten , peanuts, peanut oil, peanut produ cts, soy, wheat, tree nuts (walnuts, cashews, pecans, hazelnuts, almonds). Medication - antibiotics (penicillin), seizure medication, muscle relaxants, aspirin. Latex - elastic waistbands, kitchen gloves, balloons, other household items. Exercise - rare Insect Stings However, individuals can be allergic to any food and some children may be allergic to more than one food. Some anaphylactic reactions have no known cause. Q. Who gets anaphylaxis? A. Anyone can experience an anaphylactic reaction, not just those with known allergies. Q. How can I prevent anaphylaxis? A. Strict avoidance of substances and situations known to trigger severe allergic reactions in an individual. Read labels of all foods, and if a label contains unfamiliar terms, do not offer or permit consumption of the food to a student with known allergens. However, it is challenging to avoid all allergens completely all the time and accidental ingestions occur approximately every 3 -5 years on average . Q. What is the difference between Epi-Pen and Jr.? A. Epi-Pen containing 0.3 mg single dose of epinephrine is prescribed for individuals weighing 66 pounds or more. Jr. contains 0.15 mg single dose of epinephrine and is for individuals weighing between 33 and 66 pounds. Sometimes a single dose of epinephrine is not enough to reverse the symptom of anaphylaxis, so the doctor may prescribe more than one auto -injector and this practice is consistent with updated guidelines . Q. What are some of the common signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis? A. These symptoms may include ONE or MORE of the following: Difficulty breathing Itching (of any body part) Coughing Difficulty swallowing Flushed or pale skin Hives Red, watery eyes Shortness of breath Swelling of lips, tongue, and throat Wheezing Vomiting Dizziness or faintness Q. How do I respond to anaphylaxis? A. Giving epinephrine by auto injector immediately. No matter what the cause is, whether it is food, latex, insect sting, or exercise induced, epinephrine is the first medication that should be used in the emergency management of anaphylaxis . It is the only medication that has been proven to be lifesaving in the treatment of anaphylaxis. As a second line therapy , antihistamines should be used in conjunction with epinephrine. Antihistamines should never be used alone . If in doubt it is better to give the epinephrine and seek medical care. Fatalities occur when epinephrine is withheld . Q. Who can administer an epinephrine auto -injector in a school setting? A. In the absence of the school nurse, the following people who have been properly trained may administer an epinephrine auto -injector to a specific student with life-threatening Teachers , aides , volunteers , paraprofessionals , parents of the student , food service personnel, transportation personnel, custodial staff, principals, occupational therapists and physical therapists - all on a voluntary basis. In the case of an emergency, trained personnel should only administer epinephrine auto -injectors according to the district's developed standard protocol. Page 112 of 120 Q. Who conducts training? A. An LEA should provide training under the direction of a school registered nurse . Training should and includes prevent ion and management of allergic reaction. Q. How often should staff be trained? A. Recommended a minimum of once a year for all personnel. It is recommended that there be a minimum of three to five staff members trained at a school to ensure adequate provision for emergency situations, and additional staff for every 100 students. Q. Is a photo needed with a student's Allergy Action Plan ? A. YES, recommended if available, with the parents'/guardian's consent. Q. How does epinephrine work? A. It is the treatment of choice for allergic emergencies because it quickly constricts blood vessels, relaxes smooth muscles in the lungs to improve breathing, stimulates the heartbeat, and works to reverse hives and swelling around the face and lips. Q. Which foods are children commonly allergic to? A. Eggs, milk, and peanuts. Some of the most common food allergies in adults are shellfish, shrimp, and crayfish, lobster, crab, peanuts, fish, and tree nuts. Adults usually keep their allergies for a lifetime, but children sometimes outgrow them. However, both children and adults could be allergic to items on both lists. Q. What happens when a child goes on a field trip? Are schools and school systems required to make accommodations for field trips? A. Allergy Action Plan requires that the teacher notify parents, cafeteria staff and school nurse in advance of upcoming trips, providing time to plan for meals and snacks. The child should be assigned to an adult who is trained in epinephrine auto -injector administration. An adult should remain with the child at all times during transport and throughout the trip. A parent can volunteer to chaperone but their attendance should never be required. A copy of the child's Allergy Action Plan goes with the child along with all emergency information and contact numbers. FAQ'S ABOUT SEIZURES L.6 Q. Can anyone have epilepsy? A. Virtually everyone can have a seizure under the right circumstances. Each of us has a brain seizure threshold which makes us more or less resistant to seizures. Seizures can have many causes, including brain injury, poisoning, head trauma, or stroke; and these factors are not restricted to any age group, sex, or race and neither is epilepsy. Q. Do seizures cause brain damage? A. Single brie f seizures do not cause brain damage. Although tonic -clonic (grand mal) seizures, lasting longer than 20 minutes may injure the brain, there is no evidence that shorter seizures, lasting less than 20 minutes, cause permanent injury to the brain. Q. Can f evers cause seizures in children? A. In children under the age of 5 years, fever from any cause may sometimes initiate a generalized seizure, causing great alarm. These \"febrile convulsions\" are similar to tonic -clonic seizures, but are much briefer. The t endency seems to run in families. Page 113 of 120 Q. Who should be trained to administer diazepam in a life-threatening situation? A. In the absence of the school nurse, the following people who have been properly trained may administer diazepam to a specific student with a seizure disorder : Teachers , aides , volunteers , paraprofessionals , parents of the student , food service personnel, transportation personnel, custodial staff, principals, occupational therapists and physical therapists - all on a voluntary basis.
