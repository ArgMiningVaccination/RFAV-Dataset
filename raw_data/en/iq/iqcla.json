The causes of iron deficiency are low iron intake, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), blood loss because of heavy periods, or even internal bleeding.

The body needs iron to make haemoglobin, which is a protein present in red blood cells enabling the cells to carry oxygen throughout the body. If the haemoglobin is low in the body, then the tissues and muscles won't get enough oxygen to be able to function effectively and this can be termed anaemia. Are you aware? Anaemia imbalances the Agni of the body. Anaemia is called PANDU in Ayurveda. It can drop your haemoglobin count too. You will be shocked to know that not treating anaemia on time can lead to [complications](https://www.thehealthsite.com/photo-gallery/here-is-how-iron-deficiency-can-impact-your-health-673112/iron--673117/) that impact the heart and the lungs.
