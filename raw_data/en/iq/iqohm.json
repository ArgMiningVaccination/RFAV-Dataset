OSSE has also increasingly interfaced with District agencies such as the DC Public Charter School Board and the Deputy Mayor for Education to craft data- driven policies. Existing data systems are old and obsolete. As OSSE expands the scope of the Student Longitudinal Education Database (SLED) to include additional data, the need for enhancement in both SLED and the source data syst ems has become a critical area for improvement for the District as a whole. OSSE has several applications for mandated activities (e.g., teacher licensure and childcare licensure) that are not technologically sufficient for the needs of their users. With t hese issues corrected, OSSE would be in a unique position to steer future analysis of and publish key findings regarding the early childhood to career pathways for District residents.

The common lottery application serves 240 schools and more than 35,000 District residents annually and OCTO has developed it for over a decade. The decade old system must be modernized in order to accommodate and execute policy changes for student enrollment in the city. More than 75% of DC's public school students have used the common lottery system at some point in their enrollment. As the use of smartphones, tablets, and different browsers has risen when using the common lottery application, the need to modernize the system has equally risen. Students a nd schools alike benefit from timely, accurate, and transparent results in the system. Estimated Cost: $1,094,000 Expenditures is identifying whether to work with OCTO or issue a large RFP. Delay: No Project: ATCGIC - CTE Advanced Technical Center (ATC) Project Description: The Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) Career and Technical Education (CTE) team is establishing an Advanced Technical Center (ATC).

(c) List and des cribe each allegation received by the agency in fiscal year 2021 and Fiscal Year 2022 (through January 31) and the resolution of each as of the date of your answer. (a) Agency's procedures for investigating allegations of sexual harassment. OSSE takes claim s of sexual harassment or misconduct very seriously. OSSE's procedures for investigating allegations of sexual harassment, or misconduct committed by or against its employees are consistent with the procedures set forth in Mayor's Order 2017- 313, dated December 18, 2017. In cases where claims are substantiated in part or in whole, OSSE will issue and implement a formal plan of action, which could result in disciplinary action up to and including adverse action and/or removal. When an allegation of sexual harassment or misconduct is made, the Sexual Harassment Officer (SHO) or alternative Sexual Harassment Officer (ASHO) is tasked with reviewing the allegation and determining a plan of action. Depending on the nature of the complaint, immediate action may be required, such as separating the alleged harasser from the complainant. If immediate action is not required, the SHO or ASHO must move on to interviewing the complainant, harasser, and witnesses. If any follow -up interviews are required, those i nterviews are scheduled accordingly. The SHO or ASHO will gather all evidence for evaluation, document the investigation, and then report their findings to the agency General Counsel. If further action is required against any individual based on the findi ngs, the agency General Counsel will provide the report to agency leadership and the Mayor's Office of Legal Counsel (MOLC). (b) Procedures for investigating allegations of misconduct . Where there is an allegation of criminal misconduct, including for example, sexual assault, kidnapping, stalking, and threats to do bodily harm, OSSE may, after consulting its General Counsel, place the victim and/or the alleged harasser on administrative leave with pay pending final administrative resolution of the complaint or any criminal proceeding.

What efforts has your agency made in the past year to increase transparency? Explain. Consistent with OSSE's core value of partnership, we strive to understand the needs and perspectives of our stakeholders, and we work collaboratively with many others to support DC students and families. We are committed to transparency, and we are mindful of the trust placed in us to administer services fairly and honestly and operate with the highest standards of integrity and professionalism. OSSE consistently engages and communicates with leadership and personnel in our local education agencies (LEAs), community -based organizations (CBOs), schools, child care facilities and partner organizations , and we have built robust communications systems to support this effort. These communications systems with our partners have been exceptionally important as we continue to respond to the COVID -19 pandemic. OSSE keeps partners informed through various emails going out weekly to education leaders and through the LEA Look Forward, a weekly publication from OSSE that provides information to LEAs on trainings, policy guidance, and opportunities for policy engagement. We continue to meet with leaders and staff of LEAs and CBOs on a consistent basis. Specifically, every month the Superintendent holds meetings with all heads of schools across all LEAs. Further, each division at OSSE conducts regular meetings with key stakeholder groups to share programmatic updates and receive feedback. OSSE provides LEA staff with routine virtual meetings covering topics related to health guidance and strategies pertaining to COVID -19. A few examples of key stakeholders include: child car e providers, teachers, principals, teacher preparation programs, and data managers. We host bi -weekly early childhood stakeholder calls with child care providers to explain and obtain feedback from them on our policies. Further, OSSE receives numerous cons tituent inquiries from parents and community members who email with questions or concerns related to COVID -19; OSSE is committed to providing direct and clear responses to these requests. OSSE meet s with our Teacher Advisor y Council and Principal Advisory Council quarterly to share programmatic information and obtain their feedback. We conduct calls with LEA Data Managers on a routine basis to explain policies and procedures and obtain feedback. OSSE regularly engages with the State Board of Education in their public and working sessions on matters related to joint functions, and the Superintendent meets monthly with leadership from the Board to ensure communication flow on policy matters. The Division of Early Learning has implemented several strategies to increase support and transparency for childcare providers and families. The Division of Early Learning continues to host biweekly stakeholder calls with child care providers and representatives from OSSE and DC Health. The purpose of these calls is to provide information on health and safety guidance, payment policies, financial supports, and other efforts that aim to help providers respond to impacts of COVID -19 and operate safely during the District's recovery, OSSE will continue these calls for as lo ng as child care providers have a need for real time updates on health and safety information. The Division of Early Learning also stood up a stakeholder working group to FY 2021 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 92 help inform the childcare recovery and reopening plan. This working group continues t o convene monthly as an informal advisory group that helps OSSE obtain child care program leader perspectives on a wide range of topics prior to implementing programs or policies. The sharing and use of actionable data is foundational to OSSE's work. We c ollect and share reliable and actionable data to inform policy decisions, empower our partners to improve, and build community understanding. Despite the pandemic, we maintained our data and reporting practices while accommodating the operational shifts ne cessary to implement remote work and learning. OSSE modified student attendance policies to accommodate distance learning, so stakeholders would have important information on student attendance during these challenging times. We updated the DC School Repor t Card, so stakeholders would still have access to data that empowers their decision -making. OSSE provides weekly data on its school -based asymptomatic and symptomatic testing program. As part of the commitment, OSSE made in our strategic plan to help ac celerate outcomes for students with disabilities, OSSE developed a comprehensive landscape analysis in order to build a shared understanding of the District's students with disabilities and a sense of urgency in better meeting their educational needs in the city. The findings of the landscape analysis were based on focus groups and interviews with special education staff and leaders, and highlighted core barriers to overcome. Those findings and input were reflected in our Roadmap to Accelerating Outcomes fo r Students with Disabilities. Both the landscape analysis and the roadmap were shared with the public. OSSE continues to work on a rewrite of regulations pertaining to Special Education. As with all our proposed regulations, OSSE made these regulations available for public comment and held two public hearings on the regulation. OSSE also updated its Special Education Resource Hub for the start of the 2021 -22 school year which provides families and students with important information. OSSE has continued t o publish data regularly and transparently on its website and on the DC School Report Card, and OSSE supported the process to select a partner for the Research Practice Partnership. Further, despite the District suspending statewide assessments in 2020 and 2021, OSSE expressed a commitment to collect local assessment summaries from every school in the District. OSSE published a report on that collection and data files on that collection. The purpose of this collection was to obtain some sense of student lea rning over the past academic year. FY 2021 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 93 33. What efforts will your agency be making to increase transparency? Explain. OSSE has operationalized the steps described in Q32, and we will continue to utilize them in the future. OSSE remains committed to transparency by forming strong partnerships with its stakeholders and ensuring that the public has access to accurate and actionable data on the performa nce of the District's schools and LEAs. We will continue publications like the LEA Look Forward and meet routinely through our established channels with child care operators, LEA leaders, LEA data managers, and members of the State Board of Education (SBOE ). OSSE will continue to publish data and reports on the performance of LEAs and schools on topics including, but not limited to, attendance, discipline, enrollment, and academic achievement. OSSE is particularly pleased to have released its one- pager on the Educator Workforce which includes data on teacher and principal retention. In response to the public's request for more data on the educator workforce, OSSE will release an educator workforce report in May that will include data on educator diversity, effectiveness, retention, and supply and demand. For the first time, OSSE will also publish downloadable files with this data. OSSE also looks forward to engagement with LEA stakeholders and the State Board of Education on revisions to the statewide accou ntability system.

FY 2021 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 110 41. What are your top five priorities for the agency? Please provide a detailed explanation for how the agency achieved or worked toward these priorities in fiscal years 2021 and 2022. Priority 1: Education Recovery and Continuous Education Description : Support local education agencies (LEAs), schools, educators, and families in navigating distance learning by requiring continuous education plans from all LEAs, publishing them on OSSE's website, providing policy guidance, and providing technical assistance and supports to help address gaps. Achievements : At the end of the 2019- 20 school year, public schools in the District faced significant uncertainty due to the COVID -19 public health emergency. The pandemic created unprecedented challenges for public schools. In both the 2020- 21 and 2021- 22 school years, schools had to shift instruction to accommodate both in- person and distance l earning. In response to this challenge, OSSE oversaw nearly $600 million in Elementary and Secondary School Education Relief Funds; 90% of those funds were awarded to local education agencies with the remaining 10% reserved for state level use. After ex tensive review, OSSE approved and published 70 District local education agency (LEA) continuous education plans outlining LEA plans for the re -opening of in- person school for the 2021- 22 school year. These plans were based on OSSE's Continuous Education Pr inciples , which aimed to provide local education agencies (LEAs) and families with clear and consistent expectations for continuous education as the District responded to the pandemic. The principles were intended to help LEAs develop effective and equitable continuous education plans that strive to meet the needs of all students and are developed in partnership with families. These guiding principles also sought to help families understand what they should expect for their students and the two- way communic ation that schools should establish with them. OSSE made these plans publicly available on its website and compiled a summary of model responses. Additionally, OSSE curated a list of internal and external resources to aid LEAs in the implementation of the guiding principles. The US Department of Education approved the District's American Rescue Plan State Plan , which outlined a robust approach for using the state set -aside funds to support our recovery priorities of safe re -entry, student and staff wellbeing, and accelerated learning. The distribution of funds and resources to LEAs directly impacted their ability to re -open their campuses for in- person learning, increasing the safety of our school buildings, while expanding access to mental health resourc es and high -quality instructional materials. All LEAs resumed in -person instruction in FY21. FY 2021 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 111 Priority 2: COVID Response Description : Offer timely guidance, actionable resources, and promising practices to help LEAs respond effectively to the public health crisis. Achievements : DC Health provided public health guidance for schools and childcare centers as the District responded to the COVID -19 pandemic. Schools and childcare centers needed technical support and assistance to operationalize that guidance. OSSE's Division of Health and Wellness (H&W) provided an array of technical support resources to help ensure that staff and students returned to, and remain safe in, school. H&W provided and supported the expansion of health and safety activities including direct operational support of the teacher and educator vaccine in January 2021, ongoing COVID- 19 vaccine promotion, contact tracing supports, expansion of asymptomatic and symptomatic testing, establishment of a complaint process for out of complia nce LEAs and schools, a review of over 90 Health and Safety Plans, publication of multiple health and safety guidance documents related to schools and childcare, a continuation of bi -weekly school and childcare technical assistance calls, and communities o f practice to support school leaders and COVID response staff. These activities have supported the implementation of DC Health Guidance in schools and ensured appropriate health and safety protocols are in place. The efforts contributed to the full re - opening of schools in fall 2021 and will continue to help ensure that staff and students remain safe at school. Sine this fall, OSSE has provided timely and extensive symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID -19 testing to 33 LEAs through OSSE's centralized testing program, and since December 2021 has distributed more than 120,000 COVID- 19 rapid antigen testing kits to public charter LEAs for all LEA staff and for children ineligible for the vaccine (grades kindergarten and Pre -K). Priority 3: Stabilizing and Strengthening the Early Childhood Sector Description : Increase access to quality , affordable child care for District children and families through continued financial support, guidance, and technical assistance to maintain the supply of high quality seats. Achievements : In the fall of 2021, OSSE distribute d $8.6 million to over 80 percent of providers through the D.C. Child Care Provider Relief Fund II. Further, OSSE partnered with the Office of the Deputy Mayor for Planning and Economic Development and the Washington Area Community Investment Fund ( Wacif ) to distribute D.C. Child Care Provider Relief Funds to 90+% of child care facilities. OSSE also implemented the Public Health Emergency Rate, distributed the Low -Income Investment Fund Road to Recovery fund grants to 218 providers (263 facilities), and imp lemented the Enhanced Building & Sustaining Quality grant to expand the Shared Services Business Alliance. FY 2021 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 112 These efforts helped ensure that families continued to have access to safe and affordable child care throughout the pandemic. The efforts made a meaningful impact on provider operations as fewer child development facilities permanently closed in FY21 than in FY19. In September 2020, 241 child development facilities were open and operating. By September 2021, 443 facilities were open, representing more than 90 percent of licensed child development facilities in the District. Total licensed capacity has been largely stable, with a slight increase during the public health emergency to 27,047 seats in July 2021. Funds were used to keep child development c enters open during the pandemic (keeping childcare professionals employed and students enrolled), provide deep cleaning services to child care, and enhance data on child care capacity and vacancies. OSSE continued to make personal protective equipment (PPE ) available to any child care facility in the District to ensure the health and safety of staff, children and families. OSSE continues to play a constructive role in the Council's taskforce addressing wages in the child care labor force. On November 2nd, 2021, OSSE's Division of Early Learning (DEL) published the Compensation Scale for the DC Child Care Workforce report. The report presents compensation scales for in fant and toddler teachers and teacher assistants in early child development centers that reflect parity, defined by the Birth- to-Three Act as \"compensation equivalent to an elementary school teacher employed by the District of Columbia Public Schools (DCPS ) with the equivalent role, credentials, and experience.\" OSSE has worked with the Council to authorize a vendor or grantee to distribute over $50 million for the purpose of increasing wages in the childcare sector. Priority 4: Special Education Descrip tion: Strengthen academic outcomes for students with disabilities by implementing year one of OSSE's special education roadmap and establishing a shared set of commitments with the education cluster agencies while enhancing internal coordination to sustain this work in the long run. Achievements : Released in October 2020, OSSE's Roadmap for Acce lerating Outcomes for Students with Disabilities outlined the strategic direction and core priorities for accelerating academic progress for students with disabilities across the District. In FY21, OSSE implemented year one of the roadmap. OSSE partnered with families, organizations across DC and national experts in 2020 to launch a new online Special Education Resource Hub before the start of the 2020- 21 school year to help ensure families of students with disabilities feel equipped and empowered to support their child, in partnership with their child's school. The resource hub provides students and families with answers to common questions around what to expect this school year and information on how parents and family members can best support their students. Translated into multiple languages, the resources hub is simple and accessible, offering multiple pathways for finding answers. We then updated this hub in advance of the 2021- 22 school year to ensure that all content continued to be relevant and up to date. The hub includes parent friendly response s to foundational questions on special education pertaining to evaluation, the delivery of services, changes in a child's needs, and post -secondary transition. FY 2021 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 113 OSSE developed our first micro- credential, Special Education Foundations, to train educators in skills essential to serving students with disabilities. Seventy -five educators and leaders piloted the micro -credential in fall 2021, and OSSE is standing up additional micro- credentials in the coming year. OSSE also procured a new vendor to redesign and integrate our Part C and Part B special education data systems (SEDs ), and is moving forward aggressively in the development of the Part C system. OSSE continues to make progress on updating special education regulations. After extensive stakeholder enga gement and revision in response to public input, OSSE has completed a second proposed rulemaking. and looks forward to moving to a final rulemaking. The rulemaking will strengthen outcomes for students with disabilities by providing clarity to practitioner s on their obligations and legal expectations . OSSE plans for regulations to be effective at the start of the 2022- 23 school year and will support LEAs to understand and implement the new requirements by providing training and professional development star ting in summer 2022. Lastly, OSSE rolled out a number of new resources and supports last year to help schools navigate special education delivery in a virtual setting including our LEA Toolkit: Serving Students with Disabilities During Periods of Remote and Blended Learning . We also stood up a community of practice for LEAs to support real -time problem solving for common challenges. Based on the success of that, we are now in the process of standing up an external resource that will offer consultative supports to LEAs on issues of practice or compliance. Priority 5: Data Vision Description : Continue improvements to OSSE's data infrastructure by building a foundation that supports the transformation from the current state to a seamless and user -friendly process that improves responsiveness to stakeholders, drives program, policy, and practic e improvements, and enables the agency to realize its mission and goals more fully . Achievements : In FY21, OSSE finalized the detailed implementation plan for the data modernization initiative, hired key members of the technical team to implement the p lan and began and completed work on the Agency- wide Self -Service Data Access Portal and associated policies. OSSE completed Business Process Reengineering for four key \"as is\" processes: Mayor's Scholars, DC ReEngagement Center, DC CATs, and the Alternative Populations and Medicaid Reimbursement Tool. Development of the Integrated Data Submission Tool also continues. Each year, OSSE collects more than 108 million data points, completes more than 700 pages of required reporting to Council, submits 200 plus reports to the U.S. Department of Education, fulfills hundreds of data requests, and executes nearly 100 external data sharing agreements. Investments in data infrastructure such as the ones described above are critical to improve data management practices that have not kept pace with the agency's growth and introduce the potential for errors and burden staff. This work will continue through the next several fiscal years and ultimately result in more modern, user -friendly, and efficient services. FY 2021 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 114 This wor k greatly benefits all our stakeholders. It means less administrative burden and more access to data to guide decision making and intervention for LEA and school staff, OSSE has meaningfully responded to public feedback for more data on the educator workforce and at the course level. OSSE overhauled and centralized its educator workforce data collection and has already begun to provide important information on educator retention this winter with more coming in the spring. OSSE began its work to plan and de velop for a course coding system which is foundational to providing more comprehensive data on student outcomes like course enrollment and grades in the future. These improvements will provide more information to the public on the performance of our school s and be helpful in grounding our conversations on school improvement and student achievement.

As of Feb. 7, 2022, OSSE has 5 foster children on record as enrolled in out -of-District Psychiatric Residential Treatment Facilities. (i) How does OSSE ensure that students with disabilities in foster care are receiving FAPE when placed in Maryland? How does OSSE ensure that student records and credits will follow students if they transfer back to a DC scho ol? As noted above in subpart (a); OSSE, the District of Columbia Public Schools (DCPS), and CFSA entered into an MOA to address specialized education services for children and youth placed in out of state placements by CFSA. This includes students placed by C FSA into foster care homes in Maryland where the student's team made a best interest determination to enroll the student in a Maryland LEA. Per the MOA, OSSE ensures a free appropriate public education (FAPE) is provided to children/youth with disabilities who are CFSA wards and placed outside of the District of Columbia by contracting with DCPS as the entity to provide oversight on behalf of OSSE. OSSE additionally schedules meetings with DCPS and CFSA not less than once a year, and more often as needed, t o discuss the delivery of educational services and coordination of activities consistent with this MOA. OSSE takes appropriate action, as needed, when issues arise about the service delivery at a school outside the District of Columbia that DCPS has not resolved. OSSE action may include engaging CFSA, as needed, to resolve the matter. OSSE is responsible for paying authorized tuition service fees upon CFSA's verification of ward status for each billing period. Additionally, OSSE and CFSA entered into an MOA with Prince George's County Public Schools (PGCPS) to ensure DCPS has access to student records to complete oversight activities. The OSSE/DCPS/CFSA MOA has additional provisions for annual transcript review for students placed out of state by CFSA whe n DCPS is the LEA. For students placed by CFSA in another state who are returning to the district when DCPS is not the LEA, the new LEA of enrollment is responsible for compliance OSSE's Individualized Education Program (IEP) Implementation for Transfer St udents Policy. These obligations include ensuring that the LEA has student records and conducts a transcript analysis in accordance with the District's and their LEA's graduation requirements. Additionally, per the MOA, CFSA must notify DCPS and OSSE befor e a student will be returning to the District, if assistance is needed in identifying an appropriate school placement , or if they encounter any barriers to a student's enrollment and need assistance in resolving the issue. FY 2021 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 126 49. Question #49 (a) For fiscal years 2021 and 2022 (through January 31), how many non - residency tips did OSSE: (1) receive?; and (2) investigate? (b) How many non -residency cases were substantiated in fiscal year 2020? Please breakdown the data by sector? (c) Of the cases that were substantiated in fiscal year 2020, what actions did OSSE take to remediate them? (d) What efforts did OSSE take to strengthen its non -residency program in fiscal years 2020 and 2021? Include in your response what steps OSSE has taken to ensure that each family receives adequate due process and notice. (a) Non-residency tips for FY21- 22 (to date). Investigations of non- residency allegations can be initiated by any person submitting a tip through the OSSE tip hotline, both online and via telephone, through partner agencies investigating individuals for other fraud matters (e.g., Medicaid fraud), by sharing complaints received from the public relating to student residency, and by other mediums such as the mail, email, or in -person communications with OSSE's Office of Enrollme nt & Residency. The overall number of tips received by OSSE is greater than the number of cases investigated by OSSE. This is primarily due to duplicate tips ( e.g., a tip for the same family submitted multiple times) or tips submitted without sufficient in formation for OSSE to investigate. Please note that OSSE tracks cases on a school year (SY) rather than fiscal year (FY) basis and the table below reflects that practice. SY20 -21 & SY 21- 22 (as of 2/1 7/2022) Non-Residency Tips Received Year Non-Residency Tips Received SY20 -21 7/1/2020 - 6/30/2021 86 SY21 -22 to date 7/1/2021 - 2/17/2022 86 Upon receiving a tip, OSSE merges duplicate tips or sibling tips and then reviews for sufficiency of information provided. For example, some tips come in without sufficient information to begin an investigation (e.g., providing a first name but no last nam e). If a tip has sufficient information to move forward, it will be assigned to an investigator for investigation. In addition, investigation referrals can also come from the Enrollment Audit. Auditors flag documents that appear altered or suspect and are further examined by investigators within OSSE's Office of Enrollment and Residency. FY 2021 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 127 The table below provides the number of cases OSSE is currently investigating or has investigated to date. A single case involving related students can be counted as both a DC Public Schools case and a Public Charter Schools case if the students are attending schools in both sectors. This crossover is why a total case count is not always the sum of cases in both sectors. SY 20 -21 & SY 21- 22 (as of 2/1 7/2022) Non-Residen cy Cases Investigated School Year DC Public Schools Cases Public Charter Schools Cases SY20 -21 7/1/2020 - 6/30/2021 56 47 SY21 -22 to date 7/1/2020 - 2/17/2022 59 50 (b) Substantiated non- residency cases in FY2 1. OSSE's non- residency investigations typically begin with a submitted tip or finding from the annual enrollment audit. Referrals from the annual enrollment audit and tips with sufficient information to identify the student are turned into cases and assigned an investigator. These cases are considered 'open' until a determination of resident has been made, or, in the case of a potential non- resident, substantiated after all notifications and administrative proceedings have concluded. For cases where a student is initially determined to be a non -resident, OSSE will issue a Finding of Non- residency to the family. The family can either contest or accept the finding. If the family accepts, the finding becomes final and substantiated, and the parties enter into an agreement for tuition. OSSE will notify the LEA that the student is a non- resident and ineligible to remain enrolled if the original enrollment was not in compliance. Continued enrollment at the LEA may require re -application, payment of owed tuition, and completion of a valid tuition agreement. If the family contests the Finding of Non- residency, OSSE will file the request for an appeal at the Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH) and proceed with a mediation and continue with a hearing if the mediati on is unsuccessful. The outcome at OAH will either be a concession from the family substantiating the finding of non- residency, a reversal of OSSE's initial finding of non-residency and a closing of the case, or a substantiation of its finding of non- resid ency through an OAH judgement.

When appealed, these cases are referred to OAH. These cases will cont inue through the administrative process with the OAH for formal mediation and hearing. 3Closed - Residency verified during investigation : These cases were investigated, and student determined to be eligible to attend as a resident. 4Closed - Residency determined through Administrative Review : These cases were initially determined to be non- residents, but the determination was changed through the OAH mediation and hearing process. 5Substantiated - Concede: These cases are where OSSE issued a Notice of Finding of Non- Residency and the family conceded they were non -residents. 6Substantiated - Uncontested : These cases are where OSSE issued a Notice of Finding of Non- Residency and the family failed to contest the finding within the provided timeframe. Because they did not contest the finding in the notice, OSSE's initial determination became the final decision, and these families are non -residents. If the students were still enrolled, these students were subsequently unenrolled from school. They were also issued tuition payment agreements for the relevant school year(s). 7Substantiated - OAH Decision : These cases are where OSSE issued a Notice o f Finding and the family appealed the finding. Neither OSSE nor the family came to an agreement during the mediation process and the case was decided through a formal hearing. 8Withdrawn: These cases involve students enrolled for very short periods of time and withdrew before an investigation could be conducted. 9Duplicate : These cases were submitted more than once in the same school year. Information is consolidated and one case is moved forward while the other is closed. FY 2021 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 129 *A single case involving related s tudents can be counted as both a DC Public Schools case and a Public Charter Schools case if the students are attending schools in both sectors. This crossover is why a total case count is not always the sum of cases in both sectors. (c) Actions taken to rem ediate FY2 0 substantiated cases. All findings of non- residency are referred to the Office of the Attorney General. The prosecution of fraud, the pursuit of a False Claims Act case, or other civil remedies lies with the Office of the Attorney General or the United States Attorney. (d) Agency's efforts to strengthen its residency fraud program in FY20 and FY21. Strengthening the Non- Residency Program OSSE is committed to ensuring District schools remain accessible first and foremost to Washi ngton, DC residents. This requires a robust system of compliance and enforcement to ensure that public schools in the District, including DC Public Schools (DCPS) and public charter schools, are available, first and foremost, to bona fide residents of the District. For tuition collection, OSSE continues to mandate electronic agreements for all tuition -paying non-resident students. This process allows for quicker processing of agreements and ensures that all payments and agreements are made prior to the s tart of school. In FY19, OSSE established a partnership with the Office of the Chief Financial Officer to ensure clear enforcement of significantly delinquent payments through referral to their Central Collections Unit (OCFO - CCU). To date, OSSE has referre d $782,688.80 in outstanding debt for follow -up collection. OSSE continued its public information campaign to assist District residents with understanding the enrollment and residency process by developing a non- resident tuition guide for LEAs, updating the DC residency verification form, and continuing an outreach campaign that notifies the general public on how to report potential non- residents. OSSE continued to run digital ads two times during the year - during the release of the common lottery resul ts and the start of school. These ads not only targeted to District residents, but also residents in surrounding counties. Lastly, in September 2021, OSSE hired a new Lead Investigator. The position had been vacant since December 2019. The non- residency investigation team is now operating at full capacity. The enrollment and residency process must balance ease for families and LEAs and support for our most vulnerable families, with enforcing District laws and regulations that ensure residents have access to a free, public education. OSSE remains committed to ensuring District schools remain accessible first and foremost to Washington, DC residents. We will continue to take steps to improve our practice, and look forward to working with schools, fami lies, and the community to further improve our residency efforts. FY 2021 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 130 Ensuring Due Process When OSSE conducts a residency investigation, if it is not clear from the initial review of records that the student is a DC resident, and prior to issuing a determi nation of non- residency, OSSE contacts the family to gather additional information. An OSSE investigator will set up a time either over the phone or in- person to talk with the enrolling person about any questions OSSE has regarding the persons residency cl aim. This also allows the family to help the investigation understand complex and unique circumstances that some of our District resident's experience. In some cases, the additional information and context provided by a family does not verify District r esidency, and in those cases, OSSE will make a determination that the student is not a resident of the District. When a determination of non- residency is made, a detailed notice letter is sent to the parent, guardian, other primary caregiver or adult stude nt by mail and email, if known. The detailed notice letter helps families understand why OSSE's investigation led to a finding of non- residency and explains the next steps and timeline for the administrative review process. Specifically, the detailed n otice letter includes the following information: The basis of the non- resident finding; An option to request an administrative review within 10 business days; An explanation that the student may remain enrolled until a final administrative decision is made; An explanation that if a request for administrative review is not received within 10 business days, then the non- resident finding will be the final administrative decision; and An explanation of the tuition owed in the event of a final administrat ive decision of non- residency and that the tuition is prorated on the time the student spent enrolled in a DC public school as a non- resident. If an administrative review is requested, OSSE will refer the request for review to the Office of Administrativ e Hearings. The purpose of administrative review is to provide families with an additional opportunity to tell their story and present evidence that proves they are a resident. First, OAH will schedule a mediation session between the two parties. In mediation, a specially trained neutral mediator meets with the parties (the family and OSSE) and assists them to state their positions and to explore options to resolve the case without going to an actual evidentiary hearing. The mediator helps the parties to re ach a mutually acceptable settlement of the case. All judges are qualified to mediate any case before the Office of Administrative Hearings. If, during mediation, OSSE agrees that the documents and information presented in mediation are sufficient to es tablish a student's status as a District resident, OSSE will withdraw the finding of non- residency and take no further action. If a family concedes that a student is not a resident, the non- residency finding becomes final and the parties will enter into a settlement agreement for tuition. If mediation is not successful, the matter will proceed to a full evidentiary hearing where the Administrative Law Judge will issue a final decision, which will be the final administrative FY 2021 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 131 decision of OSSE. The final decis ion that is provided by the judge will also include the statement of appeal rights. As stated in the appeal rights, if a party wishes to contest the decision of the judge, they have 30 calendar days from the date the decision was issued to file an appeal t o the DC Superior Court. Collectively, these efforts have been sustained into FY21 and to present. FY 2021 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 132 50.

Every year OSSE releases \"State of Discipline\" for the previous school year, pursuant to data collection and reporting requirements under the Student Fair Access to School Amendment Act of 2018 (\"SFASAA\"). Please provide an update on how these reports have been used to inform/revise OSSE di scipline policies, procedures, and practices, including OSSE guidance to LEAs and schools, and any other supports OSSE provides to LEAs and schools to address positive school climate and behavioral supports for students. Through the annual report on the State of Discipline, OSSE fulfills local reporting requirements and provides the public important information on school discipline. The report provides analysis and insights into the statewide discipline data reported on the DC School Report Card. This data includes in- school suspensions, out -of-school suspensions, expulsions, school -related arrests, referrals to law enforcement, and incidences of violence, including bullying and harassment. That data is also available by st udent group. Over the past several years, OSSE has done meaningful analysis into school discipline through these reports, and those findings have impacted our work. The 2019- 20 discipline report examined disproportionate exclusionary discipline rates among students with disabilities specifically. The analysis found that among students with disabilities, students whose primary disability is emotional disturbance are more likely to be suspended than other students with disabilities. These findings motivated OSSE's work focusing on special education and our Roadmap to Accelerating Outcomes for Student with Disabilities, for example, establishing our work on micro credentials to enhance classroom practices. Our efforts to improve classroom practices for our ed ucators is important to reducing a reliance on exclusionary discipline in our classrooms. Recent discipline reports have consistently shown that disruptive/reckless behavior and fighting are the most frequent reasons for disciplinary actions. To support improved school climate and culture, OSSE offers trainings, resources, and technical assistance in the following focus areas: trauma -informed approaches, restorative justice, positive behavioral interventions and supports, social emotional learning, and equity. Our trainings are for classroom teachers, student support teams, and administrators who want to improve school climate. More information on OSSE's programming related to these topics can be found here. The 2020- 21 school year was different in many ways due to schools' reliance on distance learning; this required schools to rethink their discipline policies and practices. OSSE supported LEAs with their discipline practices as they transitioned to remote instruction in response to COVID- 19. OSSE needed to understand the new context for the data it was collecting and therefore required all LEAs to submit continuous education plans (CEPs) detailing operational and instructional changes to promote student safety as well as to support students' social - emotional and mental health needs. In their CEPs, LEAs also outlined how they would monitor student behavior during remote instruction and comply with local and federal laws pertaining to exclusionary discipline. COVID- 19 challenged school communities' understanding and use of traditional disciplinary approaches, leading LEAs to adapt their plans for monitoring and responding to student behavior FY 2021 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 141 in distance learning. Expectations of students changed to include behaviors unique to distance learning. For example, the disruptive behavior colloquially referred to as 'Zoom bombing' which typically involves a disruption that interrupts a remote lesson, became a concern. In addition to new student be haviors that presented challenges during distance learning, many LEAs also identified disciplinary actions that reflect a new era of discipline approaches. Many LEAs also acknowledged the unique stressors on students during the global health crisis and indicated a desire to ensure students have continuous access not only to education but also social -emotional supports. Upon review of LEA's continuous education plans, we found that few LEAs planned to use traditional approaches to disciplinary action, for example, a suspension and expulsion, during SY 2020- 21. These approaches were reflected in the data; disciplinary incident records declined significantly during this period. LEAs responded to disciplinary incidents in different ways, including assigning st udents to asynchronous learning and adjusting students' audio, video, or chat privileges. Willful defiance and disruptive behavior were the primary reasons why students received disciplinary actions in the 2020- 21 school year, which reflected a shift from prior years, where incidents of a physical nature were more prevalent. As schools rely on distance learning situationally in the future, OSSE's discipline collection efforts will reflect the changing nature of disciplinary incidents and responses. Further, the Student Fair Access to School Act aims to ensure that students are not excluded from education even when they have a disciplinary challenge; it is important to ensure that this law applies in both in -person and distance learning settings. OSSE will co ntinue to be mindful of these changes as it continues its discipline collection efforts. OSSE continues to provide an expansive array of supports to address school discipline. Broadly, topics include restorative justice, school culture and climate, social emotional learning, and trauma informed supports. These supports are advertised to LEAs and schools through OSSE's monthly Teaching and Learning Bulletin . The supports provided are grounded in the data from the discipline collection and the discipline report. FY 2021 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 142 53. Describe OSSE's protocol to ensure that student data is protected and how this impacts responses to Freedom of Information Act requests or research requests . OSSE's policies and procedures to protect student data OSSE is committed to protecting student privacy and takes its responsibilities as the state education agency under local and federal privacy laws seriously. At the same time, OSSE is committed to facilitating access to and use of education data so that education stakeholders have high- quality information for decision- making. To meet both of these goals, OSSE has taken a robust approach to codifying policies and procedures to ensure the protection of student information, and to build the agency's capacity around data privacy, security, and confidentiality. Dedicating resources and supporting ongoing efforts OSSE has a data governance and privacy team within the Division of Data, Assessment, and Research that is charged with overseeing policies, procedures, and structures that govern and protect student data. To meet this charge, the data governance and privacy team collaborates with OSSE's Office of General Counsel to develop poli cies and ensure compliance. Additionally, data sharing agreements are critical legal vehicles needed to share student information with third parties, while holding them accountable for keeping that information private, secure, and confidential. OSSE ensur es that all contracts and data sharing agreements comply with the federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and include additional protections for sensitive data. OSSE has created an internal tracking system for data sharing agreements and been featured nationally for this work in accordance with FERPA. OSSE requires all third parties that receive personally identifiable information (PII) to complete a data destruction form that describes how the data received from OSSE has been destroyed, and third parties are required to certify that the destruction occurred after the data sharing agreement has ended, in accordance with OSSE's Data Destruction Policy . As part of continuous improvement and in an effort to better balance privacy and public transparency, OSSE adopted a Student Privacy and Data Suppression Policy in November 2020. Under the policy, OSSE can r eport more data to the public transparently, while still rigorously protecting student privacy. This is accomplished by setting the rules for suppression of affected datasets based on the potential risk of identifying individual students. For bigger popula tions, there is lower risk to individual privacy, so less suppression is needed. For smaller populations, more data is suppressed to ensure individuals are protected. This population- based approach is ultimately more transparent than having absolute suppre ssion rules for all files, without sacrificing student privacy. More specific information about the policy, including an example illustrating it, is available on OS SE's website . In early 2022, OSSE published a complementary policy to inform the public about how OSSE protects data about the educational workforce (faculty, teachers, staff, etc.). FY 2021 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 143 Training staff on protecting student data As cited in a recent report by the National Association of State Boards of Education , human error is a factor in 95 percent of all data security incidents. To address this, OSSE has continued to implement its data privacy training policy that includes two (2) primary components: Data Privacy Training All new employees and on- site contractors at OSSE must complete data privacy training within 30 days of their start date. All current employees and on- site contractors must complete data privacy training once every fiscal year. Non-Disclosure Agreement All new employees and on- site contractors at OSSE must sign a data non -disclosure agreement upon start ing work with the organization. OSSE's human resources team ensures all current employees and on- site contractors have a non- disclosure agreement on file. In consultation with national experts, OSSE has developed a robust training curriculum on the basics of student privacy that is used with all employees annually and has been shared with LEAs and other states. Every year since 2018, OSSE has released an online data privacy training module that includes real life examples of data incidents and requires all staff to complete a data privacy quiz upon completion. This year's new content is about best practices from the updated Data Incident Response Plan and tips for protecting privacy while in a hybrid work posture (some telework and some in- office work). Regarding non- disclosure agreements (NDAs), all current employees and on- site cont ractors signed and returned NDAs, affirming their commitment to protecting confidential information. OSSE's Human Resources Division is required to ensure all current employees and on- site contractors have a non -disclosure agreement on file. OSSE has a robust data destruction policy , which is enforced when data sharing agreements end. Stakeholders that receiv e individual -level data under written data sharing agreements are required to submit a certificate attesting that they have destroyed data OSSE provided. In addition, OSSE's data incident response plan provides guidance and best practices for staff to report potential data incidents and how OSSE might investigate and propose mitigation and other next steps. As a result of increasing global threats to data security and privacy ( especially given increased reliance on technology during the global pandemic), OS SE updated this protocol in early 2022 to reflect these emerging cybersecurity threats impacting computer systems across the world. FY 2021 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 144 OSSE's policies and procedures to respond to data and FOIA requests OSSE has protocols in place for sharing of data as permissible by law. The release of student records/data is prohibited under D.C. Code \u00a7 2-534 (a)(2) and \u00a7 2- 534 (a)(6). OSSE does not fulfill requests for student data through FOIA. Student data is protected through FERPA and may only be released if it meets one of the statutory release exemptions. OSSE believes in transparency , in accordance with FOIA, but student records have heightened statutory standards under FERPA and applicable local laws. This section outlines OSSE's procedures for reviewing and complying with requests for records including student records when permissible by the relevant laws. General data requests The OSSE Data Request Portal serves as a centralized intake and tracking system for all requesters. In general, regardless of the type of request or requester, data request fulfillments go through a minimum of three (3) stages of quality assurance and security checks, including: Peer review in OSSE's Division of Data, Assessment and Research (DAR), where analysts review data pulled together by other analysts and ensure it meets the relevant standards, requirements, and limitations; Review and approval from DAR's Director of Data Gove rnance and Privacy and Assistant Superintendent, who check data for proper suppression and alignment with data sharing agreement(s); and Final approval from the Superintendent. Data requests for student records Under FERPA, parents (and guardians) and adult students have the right to request their child's education records and their own, whether for themselves or for a third party (such as an attorney). These requests are most often and appropriately directed to schools, so OSSE redirects requesters to LE As, as they are the original source of the information shared with OSSE. If LEAs are unable to respond to the request, OSSE will periodically accept and fulfill student records requests, as deemed legally appropriate and authorized under FERPA. These req uests are also entered and tracked in OSSE's data request portal and handled by a designated staff person in CIO. Prior to receiving data, requestors are required to verify their identity in -person to ensure the person is entitled to this information. Records are also reviewed by DAR's Director of Data Governance and Privacy to ensure privacy and proper redaction, as required. Data requests for research and evaluation OSSE staff ensures that data requests that include a student's personally identifiable information (or other confidential information) require signed data sharing agreements outlining legal responsibilities for requesters and OSSE regarding data sharing, use, re -disclosure, protections, FY 2021 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 145 and destruction. Entities must agree to wr itten data sharing agreements and demonstrate compliance with these agreements. If they do not, an entity may be subject to compliance monitoring and required corrective actions. Data sharing under FERPA is permissive, not mandatory; FERPA provides discret ion to the state education agency with regard to whether to prohibit non- compliant entities from receiving data. The US Department of Education has enforcement authority and may also unilaterally impose 5- year ban on data sharing with non- compliant entitie s. See 20 U.S. Code \u00a7 1232g(b)(4)(B) and 34 CFR 99.67. Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests OSSE's Office of the General Counsel ensures compliance with the District of Columbia Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) (D.C. Code \u00a7\u00a7 2- 531-540) statute and has developed a system for processing FOIA requests that increase transparency, communication, and timeliness while safeguarding student data. This system encompasses robust coordination between the agency FOIA officer and points of contact within OSSE di visions to identify and gather responsive documents in a timely manner. The FOIA officer is responsible for review and redaction of all responsive records in compliance with the D.C. FOIA statute to ensure protection of student information. Each FOIA reque st is subject to a four -tier review process including: initial review and redaction by the FOIA officer, review by the programmatic lead in the relevant OSSE division, final legal sufficiency review by the General Counsel, and technical security check by t he Chief Information Officer. OSSE has adopted the FOIAXPress tool that allows for centralized submission and tracking of all FOIA requests. FY 2021 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 146 54. Provide the findings from the testing integrity investigations for School Year 2018- 2019 and the status of the investigation reports for School Year 2019- 2020. Documentation on OSSE's test security and integrity processes, requirements, and templates as well as the test security investigations process can be found on the OSSE's website . Following the test integrity investigations of SY 17 -18 and SY18- 19, there were no substantiated findings that resulted in official OSSE sanctions. Due to the coronavirus pandemic, OSSE announced the ca ncellation of statewide summative assessments for students in spring 2020 and 2021. This impacted the PARCC, DC Science, Multi- State Alternate Assessments (MSAA), Dynamic Learning Maps (DLM), and all the remaining ACCESS for ELLs 2.0 and Alternate ACCESS assessments. As a result, there were no test integrity investigations. FY 2021 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 147 Childcare and Early Learning 55. Provide a detailed description of the childcare sector in the District for fiscal years 2020, 2021, and 2022 (through January 31). Include in that discussion: (a) Data on the capacity, subsidy enrollment, and subsidy utilization of all infant, toddler, and preschool age and school age licensed capacity child care programs in the District) broken down by ward and program type (i.e. center, home, or LEA). (b) Number of infants and toddlers (0 -3) residing in the District by ward. (c) Number and percentage of facilities that have closed. (d) Amount paid to child development care providers who provided subsidized care; and (e) A list of the childcare facilities that wer e newly licensed during that fiscal year. ATTACHMENT: Q55 - Childcare.xlsx Early Childhood Education in the District of Columbia is delivered through a mixed delivery system that includes child development homes (105); child development centers (365) operated by independent businesses, non- profits, and faith- based organizations; and pre -k and afterschool programs operated by District of Columbia Public Schools and charter LEAs. This mixed delivery system provides a range of options for families. To ass ist families with the costs of care, the District of Columbia funds child care subsidies for low-income and working families, which follow children to the care their families choose. Roughly 55% of the District's licensed child care facilities participate in the subsidy system. Child care facilities that participate in Early Head Start, Head Start, or the District's publicly funded pre -k program also receive public funding through these programs, but the majority of child care funding in the District comes from tuition payments made by parents. The District's 470 licensed child development facilities have licensed capacity to serve 26,958 children ages 6 weeks through 13 years old, although the number of children that providers are able to serve is currentl y reduced as a result of COVID health and safety guidance. In FY19, FY20, and FY21, the District worked to enhance access to, quality of, and affordability of child care through a variety of strategies. In FY19, a historic investment in child care subsidie s allowed the District to increase payment rates for subsidy child care providers to reflect the cost of quality, and from FY18 through FY20 the District invested $9M to create and sustain the supply of quality infant and toddler child care slots through t he Access to Quality grant program. The public health emergency declared in March 2020 has had a substantial effect on the District's child care sector in FY20, FY21 and FY22 to date. In March 2020, 88% of child care facilities \u2014like most District business es\u2014closed in response to stay- at-home orders. As the District entered the recovery phases in Summer 2020, child care providers began to reopen, and FY 2021 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 148 today over 90% of facilities have reopened. However, health and safety guidance limited child care group sizes through May 2021. Although DC Health guidance has allowed child development facilities to return to the group sizes and ratios established in child care licensing regulations, many facilities continue to operate at reduced enrollment as a result of staf fing challenges, variation in family demand for child care, or for other pandemic -related factors. In addition, child development facilities continue to experience decreased attendance because of quarantine/isolation requirements for children and staff due to COVID symptoms, exposure, or positive COVID tests. As a result, District child care facilities have experienced significant revenue losses during the public health emergency, even as they face increased operating costs for staff, cleaning, and material s and supplies. The District has taken a variety of steps to support child care providers during the public health emergency, including: Providing health and safety guidance, technical assistance, and personal protective equipment (PPE) to support child care providers to operate safely during the public health emergency . Funding $5 million in emergency relief grants for child care in FY20 through the D.C. Child Care Relief Fund, which reached nearly all licensed providers . Providing $400,000 in Access to Quality Emergency grants to child care providers who previously received funding through the Access to Quality grant program, to support newly licensed or expanded providers to maintain the supply of infant and toddler care. Funding $10.7 million in emergency relief grants for child care in FY21 through the D.C. Child Care Relief Fund II, which was funded with federal Coronavirus Relief and Response Supple mental Appropriations Act funds, and reached 428 licensed facilities, and $5.8 million in emergency relief grants through the D.C. Child Care Road to Recovery Fund, which was funded with federal CARES Act and local funds and reached 213 licensed facilities . Paying child care subsidy providers based on enrollment from March through October 2020. Implementing a Public Health Emergency subsidy rate from December 2020 through September 2021 which increased payments to subsidy providers in recognition of the increased costs of delivering child care during the public health emergency. Expanding the Shared Service Business Alliance (SSBA) to enhance the financial well - being of child development homes and small centers by making the efficiencies and business supports that the SSBA provides available to any child development home or Level II child development center that chooses to participate, at no cost to providers, and providing access to deep cleaning services for child development facilities . Utilizing $6 million in federal CARES Act funding for child care to support the child care sector during the public health emergency, including through: o $1.4 million to provide emergency child care for essential workers during periods when many child care p roviders were closed in FY20; o $1.7 million to cover increased costs of continuing enrollment -based subsidy payments to child care providers from April -September 2020; and FY 2021 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 149 o $2.8 million for the District Road to Recovery Fund, which will provide additional em ergency relief grants to child care providers with demonstrated need who meet additional priorities. As a result of these efforts, the licensed capacity of child care facilities has actually increased from the start of the public health emergency through December 2021. The Division of Early Learning continues working, in partnership with child care providers, other District agencies, and other stakeholders, to support the child care sector through the public health emergency and prepare to facilitate and accelerate the sector's recovery in service of the District's economic recovery as the public health emergency resolves. In FY22, we anticipate delivery of significant financial relief to child development facilities through the following grant programs : $38.9 million in D.C. Child Care Stabilization Grants, funded through federal American Rescue Plan funds, which will be available to nearly all licensed child development facilities that are not local education agencies (LEAs) . $3 million in D.C. Child C are Road to Recovery Fund II grants, funded through CRRSA funds, to support the increased costs incurred by facilities serving medically fragile children during the COVID pandemic and offset reduced revenues experienced by some child care subsidy providers in FY21 as a result of reduced attendance due to COVID -19.

Please describe how OSSE is supporting the early childcare education workforce in meeting the enhanced educational requirements. OSSE's child development facility licensing regulations, 5A DCMR \u00a7\u00a7100 -199 (effective Dec. 2, 2016) seek to improve the quality of the early care and education workforce by e nsuring that staff have the necessary qualifications and credentials to educate and care for young children. In June 2018, OSSE extended the deadline for meeting the qualifications for various child development facility positions. In Dec. 2020, in order t o support child care providers who are experiencing challenges recruiting and retaining adequate staff as a result of the public health emergency, OSSE promulgated emergency and proposed rulemaking (posted on Dec. 11, 2020) to extend the deadline for teach ing assistants and home -based child care providers to obtain a Child Development Associate (CDA) to Dec. 2023. OSSE has determined that some staff in child development facilities will need more time to reach the minimum education requirements deadline due to the unforeseen hurdles that were caused directly (or in part) by the public health crisis due to the novel coronavirus pandemic (or COVID- 19). The table below reflects all the aforementioned deadline extensions for each position and their required cr edential type. Position Minimum Education Credential Required Compliance Date Center Director Bachelor's degree (BA) in early childhood education (including early childhood development, early childhood education, elementary education, or early special education) or a bachelor's degree in any subject area with at least 15 semester credit hours in early childhood education. Dec. 2, 2022 Teacher Associate degree (AA) in early childhood education (or early childhood development, child and family st udies, or a closely related field) or an associate degree (or higher) in any subject area with at least 24 semester credit hours in early childhood. Dec. 2, 2023 Assistant Teacher Child Development Associate (CDA) or an associate degree (or higher) in any subject area Dec. 2, 2023 Expanded Home Caregiver Associate degree in early childhood education (or early childhood development, child and family studies or a closely related field) or an associate degree (or higher) in any subject area with at least 24 semester credit hours in early childhood. Dec. 2, 2023 Home Caregiver and Associate Home Caregiver Child Development Associate (CDA) Dec. 2, 2023 FY 2021 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 154 OSSE has taken numerous steps to ensure that the early care and education workforce meets the enhanced educational requirements. The list below summarizes some highlights of these efforts. ECE Resources Webpage Launched in July 2017, the ECE resources webpage provides position- specific information on the new education requirements, as well as programs and resources available to help the workforce meet the new requirements. Early Childhood Education (ECE) Help Desk In Fall 2017, OSSE launched the ECE Help Desk to provide individualized support and address specific questions about the new education requirements. Child care professionals can contact the help desk at ECEhelpdesk@dc.gov or (202) 478- 5903 and will receive a response immediately or within 24 hour s. College Fairs OSSE's Division of Early Learning, in partnership with OSSE's Division of Postsecondary and Career Education, facilitates the Adult College Completion Fairs: Early Childhood Educators Edition. This initiative provides focused support to D C's early childhood education workforce in learning about programs and resources to help gain their respective education credential s. Due to the public health emergency caused by COVID -19, this workforce initiative has been modified. OSSE held a virtual co llege fair in FY2021 and will hold a virtual college fair in FY2022 as well. Quorum Online Learning In May 2017, OSSE introduced an online training platform through Quorum. The platform allows child development staff unlimited, 24/7 access to a catalogue of engaging and interactive training courses, including those required for obtaining a Child Development Associate (CDA) credential. Continued Education Scholarships and Incentives Program OSSE also supports the early learning workforce by providing fundi ng for workers to obtain higher education credentials. There are three avenues of support: (1) Child Development Associate (CDA) grants; (2) associate and bachelor's degree scholarships; and (3) First Step program for high school students (see below for information) . Additionally, for the first time in FY2022, OSSE is funding a workforce incentive program to recognize educators already meeting the minimum education requirements and to support educator retention. Child Development Associate (CDA) Grants OSSE funds two grantees, CentroNia and Southeast Children's Fund, to provide scholarships and supports through their CDA programs, which are offered in English, Spanish and Amharic. The grantees also provide scholarship funding to cover the CDA application fe e for those who obtain the required instructional hours outside of the grantees' programs, including via Quorum. FY 2021 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 155 Workforce Development Program The Workforce Development Program is a new grant program that is supporting associate and bachelor's degree att ainment, as well as a workforce incentive program for continuing education for educators who are already meeting the minimum education requirements. This grant is new in FY2022 and significantly increases the funding available for scholarships. The Teacher Education and Compensation Helps (T.E.A.C.H.) D.C. program is in the process of sunsetting and will formally end at the end of FY2022. Scholars participating in T.E.A.C.H. D.C. will transition to the Workforce Development Program. The National Black Child Development Institute (NBCDI) administers the T.E.A.C.H D.C. program. In FY2021, there were 139 unique scholars (i.e., assistant teachers, teachers, directors or expanded home caregivers) in the T.E.A.C.H. D.C. program working on either an associate or bachelor's degree. First Step OSSE piloted the First Step CDA Career and Techn ical Education (CTE) program in FY17, which provides high school students the opportunity to work towards earning their CDA credential and high school diploma at the same time. In the 2020- 21 school year, 144 students were served in the First Step CDA Prog ram across three DC Public Schools and one DC Public Charter School high school site. In the 2021- 22 school year, there are currently 158 students participating. This includes students from the previous school year who are in their second year of the progr am. In the 2021- 22 school year, DCPS began funding and paying for their program directly Continuous Service Waiver OSSE recognizes the value of experience in the field. Facilities can apply for waivers from education/credential requirements for center d irectors, teachers and expanded home caregivers who have demonstrated at least 10 years of continuous service in early childhood education. Further information on the waiver application process is available on OSSE's website. FY 2021 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 156 57. Describe the professional development opportunities OSSE provided/offered to child development centers and early care staff in fiscal years 2020 and 2021. Include in the description the formats in which the opportunities were offered ( e.g., face -to- face or online). Ple ase describe to what extent this work has been impacted by the COVID- 19 pandemic. OSSE continues to provide robust professional development and support for child development centers and early child care staff. Trainings are delivered by OSSE's Division of Early Learning (DEL), contractors, inter -governmental partners, external partners and a cohort of OSSE -certified trainers. In response to the COVID -19 pandemic, OSSE, our contractors, grantees, and intergovernmental partners modified delivery of in -perso n trainings to synchronous online trainings while continuing to make asynchronous online course offerings available. This shift has allowed OSSE to reach more child development facilities and staff with helpful content to better serve children in their car e. OSSE makes training available to the early childhood workforce through the Professional Development Information System, (PDIS), OSSE's workforce registry and professional development tracking system, as well as OSSE -certified trainers offering trainin gs outside of PDIS. Through these delivery mechanisms, OSSE provided approximately 847 face -to-face and synchronous online training opportunities for approximately 22,048 participants in FY21. Note that this number is not unique individuals, but the total number of participants. Compared to FY20 numbers (794 trainings and 26,419 participants), there was a 7 percent increase in trainings but a 17 percent decrease in participants in FY21. OSSE also uses Quorum, an online professional development platform of asynchronous courses, for the early childhood education workforce. As of January 12, 2022, a total of 534 facilities were registered for Quorum, including 418 centers/schools/programs and 114 child development homes/expanded homes. A total of 7,247 individual active users were registered in the online e - learning system. Once each course is completed, educators earn a certificate. A total of 162,038 courses have been completed from May 2017 to Dec. 31, 2021. OSSE leveraged professional development platf orms to shift delivery of professional development from in- person trainings to synchronous online trainings during the COVID -19 pandemic, with great success. The number of PDIS trainings held increased 26 percent from FY19 to FY20 (from 242 to 304) and inc reased from 39 percent from FY20 to FY21 (from 304 to 424), facilitated in part by increased use of online delivery modalities. The total number of participants increased 457 from FY19 to FY20 (from 2,861 to 15,937). Although the number of participants dec reased by 12 percent ( from 15,937 to 13,945) from FY20 to 21, this was still a 387 percent increase over FY19. (Note that these numbers do not reflect unique individuals, but the total number of participants.) From FY19 to FY20, Quorum course completions also increased by 86 percent (29,859 to 55,492). From FY2020 to FY2021, course completions decreased by 46 percent (55,492 to 29,836), returning to levels comparable to FY19. FY 2021 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 157 One potential explanation for trends in PDIS participation and Quorum course c ompletion over the past three years is that the workforce had more time to pursue the easily accessible online professional development opportunities while many child development facilities were closed in 2020, but as facilities reopened, the workforce had less time to attend trainings. Experience during the pandemic, including the higher rate of PDIS participation sustained into FY21, suggests that the PDIS and Quorum are effective in reaching more of the childcare workforce to take advantage of these tr ainings due to online and more flexible delivery. As the District moves to and through recovery from the COVID -19 pandemic, OSSE and our partners are working to resume delivery of in- person professional development for the child care workforce, while continuing to offer a robust array of synchronous and asynchronous online and hybrid learning opportunities to meet the diverse needs of the District's early educators. The chart below outlines the continuing education topics required of all staff working in a licensed child development facility, per 5 -A DCMR Chapter 1. This table includes in- person and synchronous online course offerings, as well as courses available through the online Quorum professional development system.

Provide a narrative update of OSSE's oversight of the Early Head Start program in the District. Include the number of children enrolled in the District's early head start program through January 31, 2022 and the location of each individual program in the District . The federal U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Administration for Children and Families (ACF), Office of Head Start (OHS) provides grants directly to local public and private non-profit and for -profit agencies to provide Head Start and Early Hea d Start services in the District. OSSE is one of the District's recipients of these grants. OSSE leveraged its grants to develop the Quality Improvement Network (QIN), which is discussed below. OSSE does not provide direct oversight to Head Start programs in the District. OSSE's role in Head Start programs include the following: (1) Leading the District's Head Start State Collaboration Office (HSSCO); (2) Administering the Early Head Start- Child Care Partnership (EHS -CCP) Grants that are part of the QIN; and (3) Coordinating with Local Education Agencies. Head Start State Collaboration Office (HSSCO) OSSE receives the Head Start State Collaboration grant from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Administration for Children and Families (ACF), Office o f Head Start (OHS) and leads the Head Start State Collaboration Office (HSSCO) , which works to enhance state coordination and partnerships to meet the unique needs and challenges of low -income children and families in the District. The HSSCO supports ongoi ng collaboration on crucial issues, such as family and community engagement, continuity of care for children, comprehensive services and supports , and ongoing professional development for early learning professionals. Additionally, the HSSCO works in colla boration with the District's State Early Childhood Development Coordinating Council (SECDCC) to address gaps in early care and education service delivery, improve the overall quality of delivery services to low -income children and their families, and impro ve coordination of services and information exchange between various programs within the early care and education system. Administering the Early Head Start- Child Care Partnership Grants In 2015, OSSE was awarded the Early Head Start -Child Care Partnershi p (EHS -CCP) grant and used the funds to develop a neighborhood- based Quality Improvement Network (QIN) to build capacity, increase access , and enhance the quality of care for infants and toddlers. The QIN is comprised of two hubs - United Planning Organiza tion (UPO) and Easterseals DC MD V A. All services provided through this initiative are full -day and full -year. All facilities that participate in the QIN are required to meet the Head Start Program Performance Standards (HSPPS ). In addition, OSSE received a federal expansion grant to support an additional 166 EHS -eligible children in March 2019. Accordingly, OSSE is maximizing the impact of the QIN by leveraging local, and federal funding to increase the number of children from birth to three years old receiving an EHS quality experience. FY 2021 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 183 Coordinating with Local Education Agencies: The Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) emphasizes coordination and quality of Head Start programs. Local educational agencies (LEAs) receiving Title I funds must develop a writt en Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with Head Start programs, and other early learning programs if feasible, on records, parent communication, staff training, student needs, transition, and services (ESSA Sec. 1119). OSSE had an ESSA Working Group to coordina te and collaborate with the DC Head Start Association (DCHSA) and interested LEAs. The goal of the working group was to draft a model citywide MOA that outlines how LEAs will work with Head Start and other early childhood programs. LEAs applying for Title I funds and serving pre -K or kindergarten signed an MOA with HSAs as part of their Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) annual application to OSSE for federal funds. The working group provided a model, citywide MOA to ease the challenges of coordi nating with the Head Start providers. LEAs had the option to sign the citywide MOA or sign individual MOAs with all District Head Start agencies sending students to their LEA. The final citywide MOA and supporting documents are posted here . The District of Columbia has expanded and aligned efforts of both Early Head Start and Head Start programs to bet ter meet the needs of children from infancy through preschool age. Through this continuum of support, the District is focused on providing more young children access to high- quality early learning opportunities needed to succeed in school and beyond.

FY 2021 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 198 62. What progress h as early intervention made in implementing the Natural Learning Environment Practices (NLEP) and what changes has OSSE seen as a result? The District of Columbia Early Intervention Program (DC EIP), Strong Start, supports and complies with the federal la w and regulations that require early intervention services to be family -centered, community- based, and provided in the natural environment, to the maximum extent appropriate. Research shows that children learn best when they are participating in these naturally occurring learning opportunities that are a part of everyday routines and activities within the real life of the child and family. Evidence -based natural learning environment practices (NLEP) start with looking at the activities infants and toddlers participate in during their everyday life at home and in the community; these everyday activities provide learning opportunities which, in turn, can lead to increased participation and skill development for the child. Natural learning environment practices also focus on child interests to increase participation, as well as parent responsiveness to the child through the use of strategies that support child learning and development. Consistent with the NLEP approach, Strong Start's work does not just provide services to children but supports parents and other adults in a child's daily life to build adult s' capacity to promote children's development and learning in the natural learning environment. Since 2017, Strong Start has made tremendous progress in imple menting the NLEP framework, and in FY21, Strong Start completed implementation of the final components of the NLEP framework with the selection and assignment of a primary service provider (PSP), introduction of formal teaming meetings and joint visits. Th ese components are described in more detail below. Using a primary service provider approach As part of the NLEP framework, the PSP model is used to support families of infants and toddlers in reaching the goals in their Individualized Family Service Plan (IFSP). Using this approach, a team of professionals works together to support children, families and caregivers. One member of the team, serving as the PSP, functions as the primary liaison between the family and other team members. Using a coaching inte raction style, the PSP receives consultation from the other team members and interacts with and coaches other team members, the family and caregivers. The PSP approach provides families the opportunity to build an ongoing reciprocal relationship with a provider that will support them as they help their child meet developmental milestones. Over the course of FY21, Strong Start fully implemented the PSP and teaming approach through the following steps: Between December of 2020 and February of 2021, Strong S tart conducted a series of townhalls (English and Spanish) in which families in the program were invited to learn and ask questions about the PSP and teaming approach. A Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) document was developed for current families explaining the change, the impact on the current services and what to expect. A one pager for new families was also created explaining the approach and how a PSP is selected. FY 2021 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 199 Between January and April of 2021, all vendor agencies conducted their own book study gr oups with all their early interventionists to ensure the foundational knowledge of coaching, PSP and teaming approach among all service providers. Over 120 early interventionists in the system participated in the trainings. In September of 2021, Strong Start officially introduced the use of the PSP and teaming approach to service delivery in early intervention in the District. PSP selection results in families being paired with an early interventionist using an individualiz ed process that takes into account their unique family needs. When selecting the appropriate PSP, many factors must be considered, such as expertise, skill, availability and family preference. During the selection process, the Strong Start service coordina tor engages the team with knowledge obtained in the family interview with the team and child outcomes to come to a determination as to who is the best provider to support that family. As a result of the implementation of the PSP: A team of individuals f rom multiple disciplines is assigned to each family in the program. One team member serves as the primary liaison between the family and other team members. The PSP receives coaching and support to build on their expertise from other team members through ongoing interactions. Teaming Meetings Teaming meetings are a way for a child's primary service provider to get support from members on the four core disciplines: speech -language pathology, occupational therapy, physical therapy and developmental therapy. This support is offered in the form of coaching, where the team asks reflective questions in order for the primary service provider s to come to their own conclusions and create new ideas based on what they have done, what they have tried, and what they may want to try in upcoming sessions to further support the family. In April of 2021, vendor agencies began to hold mandatory monthly tea ming meetings. Strong Start vendor agencies are required to hold teaming meetings at least once per month, prepare an agenda and invite the service coordinators and manage d care organization (MCOs) case managers, and document a summary of the meeting on ea ch child's record in the Strong Start Child and Family Data System (SSCFDS). As a result of formal teaming meetings: PSPs have increased their knowledge and expertise and are better able to coach parents to support their children. Interventionists are understanding now that every team member is responsible for every child and family in their team and not just those families for whom they serve as the PSP. Service coordinators and MCO case managers are invited to the teaming meetings. This has resulted in increased collaboration and ability to ensure that the necessary supports are provided right away rather than wait ing for periodic formal IFSP reviews. FY 2021 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 200 Joint Visits In July of 2021, joint visits were introduced as the next component of the NLEP initiat ive. Joint visits are an additional means of support for the PSP or the child's care provider offered by a member of the child's team or secondary service provider (SSP). After the child has had a teaming meeting, the team may decide that more direct suppo rt is needed for the PSP in the form of a joint visit. During this visit, the SSP lends support to the PSP by building their capacity in areas that would help the child and the family. As a result of the implementation of joint visits PSPs are supporting families more efficiently by addressing their concerns in other areas of development right away, helping families to meet their IFSP outcomes, and PSPs are more empowered to work across disciplines. Parents are able to understand how their child's team works, to work more closely with other members of their child's team, and to have direct access to disciplines of team members other than the designated PSP. Professional Development The Strong Start Reflection Group is an initiative created in 2019, where providers in the DC early intervention community can come together monthly to discuss issues related to using a coaching interaction style, family -related challenges , and challenges related to delivery of early intervention services in child development centers. The group also presents an opportunity to reflect on what providers have been doing to support families in early intervention and to engage in peer coaching opportunities with current providers in the DC early intervention system. In FY2021, Strong Start reflection groups engaged providers on a monthly basis in the following provider suggested topics: implicit bias, building relationships through empathy, coaching case studies, how to have a family centered evaluation, writing outcomes, choos ing the PSP, support for returning to in- person visits and balancing hybrid schedules. Reflection groups had an average of 13 providers over 11 sessions held this year. 100% of the respondents to the Reflection Group Survey rated the Strong Start initiative as Effective or Highly Effective in enhancing their knowledge of effective teaming and NLEP implementation. Additionally, 90% of respondents rated the groups as Effective or Highly Effective in providing opportunities for them to address case -specifi c barriers to implementing the coaching interaction style and teaming approach to service delivery. FY 2021 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 201 63. Describe what OSSE has done in fiscal year 2021 to increase the number of infants and toddlers receiving Early Intervention services, as mandated by Part C of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). In your responses, please explain the following: (a) What OSSE is doing or planning to do to address the gaps in evaluation completion and participation for children in Wards 5, 7, and 8 and for children on Medicaid. (b) If OSSE has experienced a decline in referrals or in number of children sent to providers for evaluation, please quantify, provide analysis of reasons, and describe what is OSSE doing to reverse that trend. (c) Please describ e any protocol or process changes due to the COVID -19 public health emergency that have been undertake by OSSE to ensure continued outreach to parents of infants and toddlers, healthcare providers, and educators to ensure timely referrals as mandated under Part C of IDEA. (d) Please describe any other ways in which this work has been impacted by the COVID- 19 pandemic. (a) How OSSE is/planning to address evaluation completion gaps in Ward 5, 7, and 8 children. Strong Start continues working through a variety of s trategies to increase evaluation completion rates for children in Wards 5, 7 and 8. Strong Start's long effort to have a physical location in Wards 7 or 8 came to fruition and a new location in Ward 7 was delivered in Dec. 2020. Due to the pandemic, we hav e not yet been able to invite the community into the new facilities for new in-person engagement activities. Strong Start is hopeful that in FY22 we will be able to host different activities in the office including but not limited to initial family interviews, eligibility evaluations, parent workshops and playgroups. These activities will allow the program to engage actively and effectively with the community in Wards 7 and 8 to increase the rate that evaluations are completed in these Wards. In FY22 Strong Start will resume efforts with Children's National Medical Center (CNMC) at Anacostia and the Child and Family Services Administration (CFSA) Health Horizons Assessment Center to conduct onsite evaluations for families right at the time that they visit the center. The pilot plan includes having an evaluation team on a site schedule perform eligibility evaluations while the family is available and ready to move with the referral. Providing evaluations at these sites should increase the percentage of referr als from these sources who complete the full evaluation process. Strong Start's implementation of the primary service provider and teaming approach has significantly increased collaboration among all team members. Case managers from the Medicaid Managed Care Organizations (MCOs) and Strong Start service coordinators are working more closely to follow up with referred families that have an MCO assigned and that have issues with unsuccessful engagement attempts to participate in the program. FY 2021 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 202 (b) Decli ne in evaluation referrals . OSSE has not experienced a decline in referrals or number of children sent to providers. The number of unduplicated referrals from FY20 to FY21 increased by 21% (from 1804 in FY20 to 2189 in FY21) and the number of children sent to providers for evaluation increased by 16% (from 1149 in FY20 to 1330 in FY21). (c) OSSE's COVID- 19 protocol changes for outreach and timely referrals. The public health emergency due to COVID -19 required OSSE to transition to telehealth to provide Strong Start services in Spring 2020. However, OSSE has continued to conduct outreach, accept referrals and conduct evaluations for Strong Start throughout the COVID -19 pandemic, including both in- person and virtual approaches in FY21. To support timely outreach and referrals during the pandemic, Strong Start emphasized the Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ) and provided additional support to child development facilities to use the ASQ online. This online system is used to complete all development al screenings required by IDEA Part C and allows screening to be completed by Strong Start's child find unit, child development facility staff, health providers or the child's own family. Strong Start continued the option for in- person screenings for chil d find purposes as long as health and safety guidelines were followed; however, most families supported the easy and convenient access that the ASQ online system provided. Part C partnered with DC Health and the Division of Early Learning (DEL) Quality Improvement Network (QIN) centers on piloting the use of the ASQ Online database for universal screening of children in participating QIN centers/DC Health programs. The technical assistance provided by Part C on developmental screening was highly attended. As one of the main primary referral agencies for Part C, CFSA maintains a strong screening - referral relationship and that did not change in FY21. At the beginning of the year, screening requests sent to Part C from CFSA were lower than normal. However, as the year progressed and families started to know more about our virtual screening options the screening requests increased. We also saw an increase in overall family communication availability. Part C continued with the standing agreement with DC Public Libraries (DCPL), to include multiple virtual professional development opportunities for DCPL staff and families focused on infant -toddler development and screening. In- person playgroups were paused due to COVID -19, but DCPL was able incorporate li ve Part C trainings/workshops into their online Facebook platform for universal access to families. In partnership with DCPL, OSSE plans to resume in- person playgroups in FY22 when public health conditions enable us to do so safely. Lastly, Part C introduced a new online referral system in Sept. 2021, which made it easier for families and community stakeholders to make referrals to Strong Start . Referral sources now can submit a referral online and receive a confirmation email that the referral has b een submitted. Information about how to access this new link was included in all Strong Start outreach, training, FY 2021 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 203 engagement, and communication efforts/events and integrated into broader OSSE and Division of Early Learning Communications. (d) Other COVID -19 impacts. The public health emergency due to COVID -19 required OSSE to transition to telehealth to provide Strong Start services in Spring 2020. On November 1, 2020, Strong Start moved to stage 1 of the reopening plan allowing in- person eligibility evaluat ions when an evaluation cannot be conducted virtually due to the family's lack of resources to participate in a virtual visit. On June 14, 2021, Strong Start moved to stage 2 of the reopening plan allowing families to request in- person visits, continue wit h visits via telehealth or a hybrid for service delivery. On July 12, 2021, Strong Start moved to stage 3 of the reopening plan. In addition to face -to-face visits for service delivery as delineated in stage 2, families may request in -person service coordi nation for initial intake and Individualized Family Service Plan (IFSP) meetings or continue to conduct meetings virtually. During FY21, COVID -19 has not had an impact on Strong Start's ability to perform evaluations. During FY21, Strong Start has been able to provide services to an average of 85 percent of the children with an IFSP. Since Strong Start moved to stage 2 of t he reopening plan more families are receiving services in-person. Below is the percentage of services delivered in -person opportunities across the District have been limited during the public health emergency, as fewer organizations are hosting the type of large group gatherings that have created opportunities for outreach in the past, and families are less comfortable attending in - person events. The pandemic has also affected opportunities for engagement and outreach through DC Public Libraries and DC Child Development Centers due to public health and safety procedures in these locations. As an alternative, OSSE focused energy on virtual professional development and parent workshops, which were made available through both OSSE's Professional Development Information System (PDIS) for child development facilities as w ell as DCPL's Facebook platform for families. Although trainings offered through PDIS continued to attract significant participation, we recognize that online outreach modalities have some weaknesses and are looking forward to being able to resume more in- person engagement in FY22 as the public health situation improves.

For children transitioning from Part C Early Intervention/Strong Start to Part B special education services, how has OSSE ensured that children are receiving all special education and related services by the child's third birthday? (a) Specifically, how has OSSE begun collecting accurate, reliable, and timely data to indicate when all services have begun, not just related services, and the reasons for any delays? (b) Please describe to what extent this work has been impacted by the COVID -19 pandemic and the transition to distance learning. (a) OSSE's data collection. The District is required by the U.S. District Court in DL v. DC , to record and track when children receive the initial provision of specialized instruction and related services by the child's third birthday for all children transitioning from IDEA Part C Early Intervention Services to IDEA Part B special education. Beginning in the 2019- 20 school year, OSSE require s all LEAs serving three through five -year-olds to document the initial provision of specialized instruction for all transitioning students in the OSSE Special Education Data System (SEDS). LEAs meet the requirement to document the initial provision of rel ated services through existing related services tracking and documentation of service delivery in SEDS. LEAs are required to document the initial provision of specialized instruction and related services in student records in SEDS within five business days of the provision of services, in accordance with the OSSE LEA Data Management Po licy. OSSE provides LEAs training on the requirement for timely provision and documentation of these services at the beginning of each school year. LEAs provide information on the reason for any delay in initial service provision by completing a \"Provision of Specialized Instruction Form\" in the student's SEDS record, including inf ormation on attempted but undelivered services. (b) COVID- 19 impacts. The public health emergency presented significant challenges to the delivery of services to all students with disabilities, including students ages three through- five-years old who transit ioned into IDEA Part B services. During virtual and hybrid learning, LEAs made the initial provision of specialized instruction and related services available to students through synchronous and asynchronous learning opportunities and virtual related servi ces delivery to the greatest extent possible. OSSE review of student -level data reveals that LEAs experienced difficulty reaching early learners through virtual learning. For this reason, LEAs prioritized the return of students ages three through five -years-old to in- person learning in Summer 2021 and the start of the 2021- 22 school. Prioritizing the return of this student population provided LEAs an opportunity to address delayed initial provision of services through accelerated learning strategies and in- person delivery of make -up related services. The District's LEAs continue to modify practice to ensure that students experiencing quarantine or school closure receive timely initial provision of services.

The public health emergency required OSSE to transition to telehealth to provide Strong Start services in Spring 2020. Over the course of FY21, Strong Start resumed delivery of in- person services in three stages, as described in our response to Question 63. In November 2020, OSSE began in- person eligibility evaluations when an evaluation cannot be conducted virtually due to the family's lack of resources to participat e in a virtual visit, and in July OSSE resumed in- person service delivery, while maintaining an option for families to continue visits via telehealth or hybrid service delivery During FY21, Strong Start continued to conduct evaluation assessments for eligibility and transition to Part B. Strong Start has not had any impact in the ability to perform evaluations due to COVID- 19. During FY21, Strong Start continued to work closely with DCPS Early Stages to ensure that their evaluation teams have the most updated information for them to be able to determine Part B eligibility. Strong Start continues to hold timely transition conference meetings before the child turns 2 years 9 months as demonstrated in the most recent Annual Performance Report Federal Fiscal Year FFY2019 submitted to USED (see previous note on FFY timing; FFY19 is the most recent year for which data is available), and by providing access to Part C records including the sharing of intervention log notes. Strong Start has not seen any cha llenges in allowing families to access the extended IFSP option after their child has been determine eligible for Part B and before the child turns 3. Even though services continued to be provided for children over 3 years, the unavailability of safe in -person assessments has delayed the Part B service eligibility process. Now that DCPS Early Stages has started to offer limited in -person evaluations and Part C has resumed, Early Stages' use of the BDI -2U, a standardized assessment tool, will support the Di strict to decrease FY 2021 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 209 the backlog for Part B eligibility determination. OSSE continues to monitor DCPS' activities to scale- up in- person assessment activities to address this backlog of delayed evaluations, and OSSE confirmed as of the date of this submission that all families have been offered the opportunity to complete assessment activities. OSSE continues to provide DCPS with supports necessary to continue addressing delayed initial evaluation activities. FY 2021 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 210 66. Describe OSSE's Child Find process including ef forts to identify students in need of special education services in early grades and in private school settings. IDEA requires states and LEAs to conduct Child Find activities through a set of policies, procedures, and public awareness activities designe d to locate, identify, and evaluate children who may require special education and related services. OSSE has published child find policies and guidance designed to support LEAs in establishing child find procedures and completing public awareness activities. LEAs are required to have in effect a policy that describes the LEA's efforts related to Child Find. OSSE makes available a model policy on its website to LEAs. OSSE additionally provides LEAs annual training on child find requirements to ensure field readiness, including special focus on child find activities to identify students in early grades. OSSE continues to maintain an FTE dedicated to addressing child find activities for students three through five -years -old.

FY 2021 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 213 Teaching and Learning 68. Describe OSSE's efforts to monitor and provide support to LEAs with regard to the student achievement for English Language Learners in fiscal years 2020 and 2021. Please also describe OSSE's efforts to monitor and provide support to LEAs regarding language access responsibilities under the DC Language Access Act and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act. OSSE provides guidance to school leaders and teachers around maintaining a language instruction educational program for English learners that is rooted in federal and local regulations. OSSE does this through Title III, Part A monitoring, policy guidance, professional development, technical assistance, and program supports. The DC Language Access Act obligates the DC government to provide equal access and participation in public services, programs, and activities for residents of the District of Columbia who cannot (or have limited capacity to) speak, read, or write English. Monitoring of the DC Language Act is conducted by the Office of Human Rights and only pertains to DC government entities. Title III, Part A Monitoring In early spring 2020, OSSE conducted on- site monitoring of selected LEAs receiving federal funding in FY20 for English Learners under Title III, Part A grants, including a program and fiscal review. With the onset of the pandemic, OSSE pivoted to a similar virtual monitoring process and continued this virtual monitoring process in the spring and summer 2021 for selected LEAs who received Title III, Part A funding in FY21. Monitoring was cond ucted through OSSE's risk -based monitoring framework to help reduce burden on LEAs and to focus OSSE's onsite monitoring efforts on the highest -risk grantees across all federal grants. Under the Coordinated Risk- Based Monitoring framework, OSSE evaluated L EAs' compliance with fiscal and programmatic requirements under Title III , and LEAs were given one of three designations: low-risk, medium -risk, or high- risk. High- risk grantees received an onsite monitoring review. Each LEA participated in an on -site mon itoring review of indicators and alignment of required activities required by Title III, Part A. After each visit, participating LEAs received findings of non-compliance in each applicable area and targeted technical assistance to develop a corrective action plan and improve the English Learner program. Supporting English Learners: Policy, Program, and Instructional Supports During FY21, OSSE's Division of Teaching and Learning provided responsive supports for English learner (EL) students' achievement in these key areas: (1) maintaining up -to-date EL policy and guidance, (2) providing timely policy and guidance on serving ELs during the public health emergency, (3) engaging stakeholders in policy and guidance input, (4) publishing the dual l anguage roadmap, (5) building LEAs' capacity to use data to improve EL programs, and (6) providing virtual EL and dual language professional development. During the ongoing global public health emergency (PHE), OSSE's EL supports continued to respond to the needs of EL FY 2021 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 214 students, teachers, schools, and LEAs and develop timely and relevant policy, guidance, and training. Maintained Up- to-Date EL Policy and Program Guidance OSSE made minor updates to the OSSE EL policies and procedures document , which is the main policy and guidance document OSSE maintains to guide LEAs in serving ELs. The updates included clarification on EL age and eligi bility, updated resources and guidance on EL identification, and smaller edits, such as adding citations and making stylistic edits. To address misunderstandings about the age a student may be eligible for EL services, the EL policies and procedures docume nt now states that OSSE uses the student's age on Sept. 30 of the given school year as the age for qualifying for EL services for the school year. In line with information from the state's English language proficiency assessment developer, WIDA, the EL pol icies and procedures document informs readers of resources related to accommodations for EL screening, the newly released WIDA screener for kindergarten, and the retiring of the K -WAPT kindergarten screener. Provided Timely Policy and Guidance on Serving ELs During the PHE In anticipation of the need for continued distance learning in limited scenarios, and given the lack of remote EL identification assessments for grades K -12, OSSE released an update to its provisional EL identification procedure, English Learner Identification in the 2021- 22 School Year , to ensure that EL identification could occur and needed EL service could begin during the ongoing PHE for students who have a COVID -19 Medical Consent & Certification for Distance Learning. OSSE included ELs specifically in its 2021- 22 Guiding Principles for Continuous Education , which set a target for success for LEAs during the return to in- person learning. OSSE developed LEA English Learner Program Improvement Strategies for the 2021- 22 School Year , a guide organizing twelve strategies around OSSE's four f oundational principles f or serving ELs that provides concrete program -level strategies for LEAs to take, and tools, examples, and resources to support them in implementing these key strategies. Engaged Stakeholders in Policy and Guidance Input OSSE convened five meetings of the State Title III Advisory Committee to provide input on key policy and guidance considerations, including state -level supports for ELs during distance learning, the English learner and dual language chapters of the District's new Comprehensi ve Literacy Plan , and the dual language roadmap.. Published a dual language roadmap During the 2020- 21 school year the dual language roadmap report was presented to the State Title III Advisory Committee, OSSE's English Learner Working Group, staff within OSSE's Division of Teaching and Learning, and the DC Public Charter School Board's English Learner Professional Learning Community to receive feedback and explore opportunities to strengthen the implementation of dual language programs in the District. The dual language roadmap report served as a baseline to identify data gaps regarding FY 2021 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 215 dual language students' outcomes and staff providing educational services in two languages. The associated technical assistance and professional development focused on four key areas: o DC Educators Credentialing for Foreign Prepared Educators o Dual Language Programing o Research -based Practices to Develop Biliteracy Skills o Improving Communication and Engagement Between School and Multilingual Families Built LEAs' Capacity to Use Data to Improve EL Programs and Services OSSE released English Learners in DC (2019- 20 and 2020- 21 School Year Data) based on the state -level and LEA -level analysis of ELs' academic and English language growth. The data presented represents the available data for the 2019- 20 and 2020 -21 school years to help LEAs analyze programs for supporting the success of their ELs. OSSE provided technical assistance to those LEAs demonstrating a need for support in their responses to the Continuous Educations P lans they submitted in preparation for both the 2020- 21 and 2021- 22 school years. OSSE supported these LEAs in strengthening their ability to identify potential ELs, implement their EL programs with fidelity across learning environments, and communicate wi th families in a language they understand, to the extent practicable, in compliance with Title I and the Language Access Act. To build upon the agency's prior training initiatives to increase LEAs' data literacy and usage of EL-data to improve their progra mming for EL students, OSSE released a new web training designed to inform users of the Early Access to English Learner (EL) Data Qlik application to understand how to use its new features to enhance EL program planning and supports in the 2021- 22 school year. The training aimed to inform potential users of the app's enhancement, the Initial EL Screening sheet, and to identify how data from the enhancement can be used to self -monitor compliance with state and federal regulations to timely screen eligible students for EL program eligibility. OSSE provided interested LEAs with licenses for WIDA's MODEL benchmark assessment of English language proficiency (ELP) in order to measure progress in ELs' English language development in the absence of data from the WID A ACCESS for ELs annual ELP assessment due to the inability to administer the assessment during mandatory school closures. Provided Virtual EL and Dual Language Professional Development EL-focused professional development in FY21 and FY22 to date consiste d of (1) virtual training workshops, (2) Start of School virtual trainings designed for educators and school leaders to address specific strategies for supporting EL student achievement, and (3) the 2021 Multilingual Learner Conference (two -day virtual convening). For the second consecutive year, EL supports were expanded to include new professional development geared specifically to dual language teachers and school leaders. OSSE offered a robust menu of virtual professional learning opportunities, including several multi- session workshop series and cohort series.

OSSE's offerings to ready LEAs to effectively serve ELs on the first day of the 2021- 22 school year included: English Learners and the Continuous Education Guiding Principles and LEA Plans English Learner Identification and Data LEA Implementation of the WIDA English Language Development Standards Going Deeper with LEA Implementation of the WIDA English Language Development Standards thre e-part series New LEA EL Coordinator Orientation Building on the success of its first -ever LEA EL Coordinator Meeting in January 2020, OSSE hosted two additional meetings in FY21 for LEA EL Coordinators which focused on policy and practice topics that are key to supporting ELs effectively. The November 2020 meeting focused LEAs' current implementation and goals around OSSE's prior publication, Eleven Actionable Strategies for LEAs to Support English Learners' Success During the 2020 -21 School Year . The September 2021 meeting focused on OSSE's recently released guide LEA English Learner Program Improvement Strategies for the 2021- 22 School Year and sharing best practices, successes, challenge and potential solutions among peers. Additional LEA EL Coordinator meetings were held in summer 2021 as part of the 2021 Start of School training series. In May 2021, OSSE convened the Dis trict's educators for its second Multilingual Learner Conference, entitled Strengthening Teaching Practices for Multilingual Learners Together. The two-day virtual event highlighted the innovative and creative techniques educators have used to meet the ac ademic and social emotional needs of English learners, and all students, during the 2020- 21 school year. Seven breakout sessions, facilitated by DC educators with content target ed specifically for DC educators, reached 290 attendees. FY 2021 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 218 Support to LEAs for Language Access Responsibilities The Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) Title I, Part A and Title III, Part A grants require communications from schools regarding parent engagement activities and student academic progress be provided in a forma t that is understandable by Limited English Proficiency (LEP) parents. To meet this requirement, LEAs provide communications in a language that is accessible to parents of English learners. When OSSE monitors LEAs that receive Title I, Part A and/or Title III, Part A grants, LEA staff are required to provide evidence relating to parent communication activities that demonstrate that they have fulfilled this requirement (e.g. providing translated notices and interpretation services for families). OSSE provides guidance to LEAs on their obligation to communicate information to Limited English Proficient (LEP) families in a language they can understand. This guidance, provided through printed resources and professional development sessions, is framed around one of OSSE's Foundational Principles for EL Policy and Programs , \"Partner with fam ilies, educators, system leaders, and communities to nurture EL students' linguistic, academic, social, and emotional development.\" Printed Resources OSSE added the resource, Guide to Developing a Language Access Plan , to the EL Policy and Programs webpage. Additionally, Chapter 10: from the US Department of Education's Englis h Learner Toolkit, was added to the EL Instructional Resources webpage . Family Tools: Effective School -Home Communication is available in the top six languages as a resource to improve the communication between schools and multilingual communities. Professional Development Professional development opportunities during SY20- 21 and SY21- 22 on language access responsibilities included the following: Serving English Learners: What New LEAs Need To Know New LEA Onboarding School Year 2021- 22: English Learners and Students Experiencing Homelessness LEA EL Coordinator Discussion: Effective Systems for Providing Language Access to All Families DC Public Schools Pre -Service Week: Strategies for ELs Improvements SY 21 -22 LEA English Learner Coordinator Meeting English Learners and the Continuous Education Guiding Principles and LEA Plans English Learner (EL) Identification and Data New LEA English Learner Coordinator Orientation Additionally, the DC Language Access Act obligates the DC government to provide equal access and participation in public servic es, programs, and activities for residents of the District of Columbia who cannot (or have limited capacity to) speak, read, or write English. Monitoring of the DC Language Act is conducted by the Office of Human Rights and only pertains to DC government e ntities.

FY 2021 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 224 72. Has OSSE identified the number of students who were at Youth YSC and the DC Jail during the pandemic? (a) Has OSSE met with DCPS about providing compensatory services to these students? If not, when will those conversations begin? (b) Has OSSE begun outreach to students who were at YSC and DC Jail to schedule meetings regarding compensatory education? (c) What mechanisms is OSSE using to monitor and superv ise the provision of special education to students at YSC and the DC Jail? How is OSSE reporting this information to the public? (a) OSSEs progress with meeting with DCPS about compensatory services OSSE maintains enrollment and attendance data for all students enrolled in District LEAs, including students who attend DYRS -Youth Service Center (YSC) and the Maya Angelou PCS Academy at the DC Jail (formerly the DOC - DCPS Inspiring Youth Program (IYP)). Note that educational services were provided by DCPS through the end of FY21. OSSE continues to provide DCPS technical assistance to support the identification and the engagement of families in determining compensatory education, as appropriate, to student s with disabilities who attended these programs during the public emergency while DCPS remained the education service provider at the facility. Under the IDEA, it is the obligation of the LEA responsible for providing FAPE to also provide compensatory educ ation when there has been a denial of FAPE. (b) OSSE's outreach to students at YSC and DC Jail Pursuant to SEA obligations under IDEA, OSSE monitors the delivery of special education at juvenile and adult correctional facilities through on- site monitoring of all facilities on an annual basis and desktop review of student files for compliance with IDEA requirements on at least an annual basis. The LEA, or public agency with educational responsibility, is required to correct any findings of noncompliance with t he requirements of IDEA. OSSE provides ongoing technical assistance and supports to the public agency and LEA throughout the year to improve system -wide implementation of IDEA. Under IDEA, it is the responsibility of the IEP Teams to make individualized de cisions about each child's present levels of academic achievement and functional performance and determine whether, and to what extent, compensatory services may be necessary to mitigate the impact of the COVID -19 pandemic on the child's receipt of appropriate services. OSSE has provided guidance on the obligation of LEAs to determine appropriate compensatory education, including to students who were, or who are currently at, YSC and DC Jail. In FY21, OSSE modified monitoring activities to address the inability to enter these facilities and schools across the District due to COVID -19. In lieu of on -site monitoring activities, OSSE conducted virtual visits to each facility and completed desktop file reviews consistent with annual monitoring activities in previous years. In FY22, OSSE is conducting in- person on site visits at all facilities and will continue desktop student file review activities. As of September 2021, OSSE completes a monthly review of the delivery of special educatio n and related services at the DOC - Maya Angelou PCS Academy at the DC Jail. FY 2021 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 225 (c) OSSE's monitoring and supervision of special education as YSC and DC Jail OSSE provides information to the public on IDEA monitoring, including the monitoring of correctional fa cilities, on its website . OSSE publicly posts guidance and training to LEAs, and the tool used to review LEA or public agency compliance with IDEA requirements. OSSE reviews student -level data, including the LEA's compliance with IEP process and service delivery requiremen ts.

Describe the training, support and oversight provided by OSSE during School Year 2020- 2021 to ensure that LEA's are appropriately serving students with disabilities in the least restrictive environment. (a) For each training/support offered, provide the list of participating LEAs. (b) Please describe to what extent these trainings have been impacted by the COVID- 19 pandemic. (a) SY20 -21 Training, support, and oversight over LEAs serving students with disabilities in the least restrictive environment with a list of participating LEAs The least restrictive environment (LRE) is a legal term found within the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), which states that students with disabilities must be educated with students who are not disable d, to the maximum extent appropriate. This means that a student with a disability should only be removed from the general education classroom to receive services when that student's disability is so severe that supplementary aids and services accessible wi thin the general education classroom cannot provide that student a free and appropriate public education. To fulfill this mandate, schools must follow the principle of inclusion and use inclusive practices across all classrooms. In the District, most stude nts with disabilities spend the majority of their school day in general education settings. OSSE supports LEAs and schools in this LRE mandate by providing a framework of professional learning, resources and supports centered on inclusive practices and evi dence- based strategies. In the 2020- 2021 school year, this framework included: Landscape Analysis: Students with Disabilities in the District of Columbia; Foundational professional development trainings made available to leaders and educators across all LEAs which focused on evidence- based practices for instruction and behavior support; Trainings, convenings and communities of practice focused on the succes sful postsecondary transition of students with disabilities; Monthly trainings for LEA Special Education Points of Contact; The Special Education Enhancement Fund (SEEF) grant opportunity; and A robust nonpublic placement oversight process. Students wi th Disabilities in the District of Columbia Landscape Analysis As part of the commitment OSSE made in its strategic plan to help accelerate academic outcomes for students with disabilities, OSSE developed a comprehensive landscape analysis to help establ ish a shared understanding of the current state of students with disabilities in the District. Drawing from in -depth data analysis, focus groups and interviews as well as online research, this landscape analysis examines who these students are, where they live and attend school, their current outcomes, their rates of identification and exit, key barriers hindering their progress, lessons learned from other states, and initial recommendations for what OSSE as the state education agency can do to address thes e barriers. The report includes national benchmarks and comparisons to other states and urban districts where possible. OSSE believes that sharing this comprehensive fact base is an important first step toward developing a shared, citywide FY 2021 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 248 agenda to accelerate academic outcomes for students with disabilities. Access the full landscape analysis here on the OSSE website. In SY20- 21 OSSE developed a comprehensi ve professional learning framework in response to the landscape analysis. The goal of this framework is to align leader and teacher supports to develop capacity and skills within our workforce to create a system of teaching and learning that achieves equi table outcomes for students with disabilities. In SY20 -21, OSSE did the foundational work to support the launch of this framework, including conducting pre - procurement work for a unified Learning Management System (LMS), creating a scope and sequence for a suite of complimentary teacher and leader content pathways and associated micro -credentials focused on improving implementation of evidence -based inclusive practices within an MTSS framework. Foundational Professional Development Training Opportunities During SY20- 21, the provided a robust calendar of professional development (PD) trainings which focused on evidence -based instructional practices and behavior support strategies to support all students, especially students with disabilities. The target audience for these trainings included not just special educators, but also school leaders, general educators, and support staff, who can all register via a first -come- first-served basis. The OSSE TAL PD Team advertised current PD offerings via a TAL PD training calendar, which was updated each month via the TAL PD Bulletin, a monthly newsletter with a current subscribership of over 1,400 District educators. View all archived SY20 -21 editions of the bulletin here. TAL PD offerings were also promoted each week in OSSE's LEA Look Forward Newsletter, and through other outlets, such as the PCSB Wednesday Bulletin. More information about the OSSE TAL PD team can be found on OSSE's website. In response to the continued public health emergency, OSSE continued to offer its professional learning opportunities as online virtual learning experiences in order to support educators during this pivotal time. All PD trainings provided in SY20- 21 were held in virtual training platforms. To date, the OSSE TAL PD team continues to provide a robust menu of virtual PD trainings for all District educators, including both synchronous live virtual trainings sessions as well as asynchronous, self -paced learning modules. Examples of OSSE TAL PD trainings offered in SY20- 21 and centered on inclusive practices and evidence -based strategies to support serving students in their least restrictive environments include the following: Using Data to Develop High -quality IEP Training Series This four -part series provides special education leaders and staff with an overview of the Supreme Court's decision and its impact on the free appropriate public education (FAPE) requirements in the IDEA. Additionally, the series supports special education school leaders to develop capacity among their special education staff to meet the more rigorous standard for IEP quality set forth by Endrew F . FY 2021 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 249 In SY20- 21, OSSE staff continued to work cross -collaboratively to make updates to training materials, such as adapting the tools, guidance, and resources to be applicable across remote, blended, and in- person contexts and delivering the content using an online learning platform. In SY20 -21, the content in the Using Data to Develop High- quality IEPs series was delivered to 76 participants representing 29 LEAs.

In SY20- 21, OSSE staff continued to work cross -collaboratively to make updates to training materials, such as adapting the tools, guidance, and resources to be applicable across remote, blended, and in- person contexts and delivering the content using an online learning platform. During SY20- 21, TAL PD team specialists delivered the following four modules to 23 participants representing 9 LEAs: HLP Introductory Series Part 1: Collaboration HLP Introductory Series Part 2: Assessment FY 2021 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 250 HLP Introductory Series Part 3: Social -emotional Learning HLP Introductory Series Part 4: Instruction This training series provides guided opportunities to: Identify the key skills and structures that support efficient, effective collaboration between general education teachers, special education teachers, paraprofessionals, and support staff; Discuss evidence -based principles for fostering positive relationships between educators and families; Identify formal and informal assessment tools and strategies used to collect information on student's present levels of academic and functional performance and identify their strengths and needs for support; Identify routines and procedures that support the development of a respectful, consistent, positive classroom environment that empowers stude nts to take ownership of their learning; Identify the key elements ofspecially designedinstruction, including instructional strategies that support metacognition; and Work collaboratively to develop a shared library of resources that support impleme ntation of high- leverage practices.

FY 2021 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 264 All SEEF recipients partnered w ith targeted school(s) at one or more LEAs and will continue implementation through Sept. 30, 2022. In FY21, OSSE also granted a total of $2,000,000 in continuation awards to six LEAs, in their last year of funding. These LEAs include: Bridges PCS - Awarded $385,737.45 DC Preparatory PCS - Awarded $385,737.45 EL Haynes PCS - Awarded $385,737.45 Eagle Academy PCS - Awarded $385,737.45 Meridian PCS - Awarded $255,607.73 Monument Academy PCS - Awarded $231,442.47 The purpose of this funding was to: Addr ess barriers to the delivery of a continuum of public placements, ensure students receive a smooth and effective transition to special education from early intervention services, timely evaluations, and improve graduation and post -secondary outcomes for students with disabilities; and Accelerate student achievement for students with disabilities by using research -based interventions. Placement Oversight Process Read more about OSSE's placement oversight process in the response to Q98. (b) COVID- 19 impact on trainings. COVID- 19 has impacted OSSE TAL's ability to deliver in -person trainings. However, TAL has been able to continue delivering virtual online training sessions throughout the pandemic. Training sessions that were historically delivered as full-day workshops prior to the pandemic are now offered as a series of shorter virtual training sessions. Presenters and participants alike have learned to maximize the virtual training space to deliver content, share strategies and best practices, netwo rk, and build professional learning communities. A significant negative impact of the COVID -19 pandemic has been the increased stress and demands placed on educators, which in turn has impacted OSSE's trainings. Anecdotally, OSSE has heard from a large number of educators that it has been difficult to carve out time for professional learning when so many increased demands are already placed on them within their school buildings, and in supporting students during the pandemic. The OSSE TAL Division has seen the effects of this in noticeably lower registration numbers for our professional learning training opportunities, compared to previous, non- pandemic school years. The TAL Division has responded to this decrease in training registration by offering more trainings during non- instructional times of the day (e.g., 4- 6 p.m. on weekdays, Saturday sessions, lunchtime one -hour sessions, etc.) and by also increasing the variety of professional learning opportunities that can be done asynchronously on a self -paced schedule, or in a hybrid manner with some synchronous sessions coupled with asynchronous work. FY 2021 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 265 79. LEAs that do not meet targets on the Office of Special Education Programs monitoring indicators must complete self -studies and develop Continuous Improvement Plans. How many LEAs completed self -studies in fiscal years 2021 and 2022 (through January 31)? Identify which LEAs completed their self -studies and detail what actions are included in the Continuous Improvement Plans. Under the federal Individuals wit h Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), LEAs may be identified for two reasons. First, the LEA could have a \"significant discrepancy ,\" which means the LEA's data shows it is disciplining special education students and/or students of specific racial and ethnic groups more than general education students and/or other racial and ethnic groups. Second, the LEA could be potentially identified as having \"disproportionate representation\" of racial and ethnic groups in special education and related services that is th e result of inappropriate identification. If identified, LEAs must complete a review of policies and procedures to assess whether this rate of representation was due to policies and procedures that do not comply with regulatory requirements. OSSE then revi ews the LEA's self -assessment and underlying documentation to make a final determination regarding compliance. If the LEA is found to have noncompliance, OSSE will issue a finding and require an improvement plan. In SY 20- 21 (FY21), there were six (6) LE As flagged for disproportionate representation review and three (3) flagged for significant discrepancy. Each LEA submitted its self -assessment for OSSE to review. The following LEAs submitted a self -study: DC International (significant discrepancy) DCPS (disproportionate representation) IDEA (disproportionate representation) Kingsman (disproportionate representation) KIPP (significant discrepancy) Maya Angelou (disproportionate representation) Monument Academy (disproportionate representation) SEED (significant discrepancy) Children's Guild (disproportionate representation) Upon completion of the review, OSSE determined that 1 LEA, DCPS, had a disproportionate representation in a specific disability category due to inappropriate policies, procedures, and practices. The LEA was issued a finding and is required to create and implement a Continuous Improvement Plan (CIP) to address systemic areas of noncompliance. Systemic areas to be addressed in DCPS's CIP (as determined by th e policy and self -study review) include the following: ensure that children underwent a full and individual initial evaluation prior to being identified to receive special education and related services; utilize technically sound instruments to assess the relative contribution of cognitive and behavioral factors, in addition to physical or developmental factors; FY 2021 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 266 select and administer assessments that accurately measure the area the test purports to measure, rather than reflecting the children's impaired sen sory, manual, or speaking skills; consider whether lack of appropriate instruction in reading and/or math contributed to children's identified concerns prior to determining them eligible as a child with a disability; and ensure a group of qualified profe ssionals and the parent determined that the child was a child with a disability. No LEAs were found to have a significant discrepancy due to inappropriate policies, procedures and practices. FY 2021 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 267 80.

SAPSE Recommendation: SAPSE recommended that OSSE use direct text messaging to parents of students with disabilities to disseminate the 2020- 21 IDEA Parent Survey. Direct text mess aging is a strategy frequently used by schools, LEAs, and agencies to communicate quickly and effectively with parents during the COVID -19 public health emergency and provides parents with easily accessible information. As a result of this recommendation, OSSE used cellular telephone numbers provided by LEAs within the State Longitudinal Educational Database (SLED), OSSE sent direct text messages to parents of students with disabilities with a link to the 2020- 21 IDEA Parent Survey. As a result, the Distric t received over double the number of responses to the annual survey than was received in any prior year. FY 2021 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 268 Proposed Special Education Regulations : On September 3, 2021, OSSE posted a Notice of Second Proposed Rulemaking in the D.C. Register (68 DCR 009091) proposing amendments to Chapter 30 of Title 5- A in the District of Columbia Municipal Regulations (currently found at 5 DCMR \u00a7E -3000- 3036) governing the education of students with disabilities. SAPSE members attended public hearings and submitted writte n public comment responsive to the proposed regulations on October 4, 2021. SAPSE/ OSSE Liaison Meetings : To ensure that disability -related policies, regulations and guidelines are developed with input from SAPSE, OSSE continually met with an identified policy liaison on a monthly basis to discuss any upcoming policy changes in order to ensure the SAPSE has an opportunity to authentically engage in State education policy work led by OSSE. During these meetings, existing and proposed policy are discussed upon request. OSSE also encourages the SAPSE to comment publicly on any rule or regulation proposed by the State regarding the education of children with disabilities. FY 2021 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 269 81. How many due process hearings and state complaints did OSSE issue final orders for in fiscal years 2020, 2021, and 2022 (through January 31)? Please identify answers with school type, reporting concern type (5 options), and LEA where possible. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) allows a claim on any allegation o f a failure to implement the requirements of the law. Concern types range from child find, to individual education program (IEP) implementation, to evaluations. They do not fall into five predetermined categories. Further due process and state complaints are filed against LEAs and other public agencies responsible for the education of students, not individual schools. The table below shows due process hearings that resulted in final order issued from FY20 to FY22 to date. The table also shows the number of decisions issued against LEAs or SEAs or parents .

FY 2021 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 270 82. Provide an update of how OSSE is providing support to schools in the bottom five percent of schools in the STAR Framework. OSSE is investing $11 million in federal funding to the schools that were first identified as Comprehensive Support (CS1) in Dec. 2018 for being in the bottom five percent of DC's statewide accountability system. After identification, schools worked with t heir LEAs and communities to conduct needs assessments and design multi -year school improvement plans that are available on the Investment in Schools webpage . In year two (SY 2019- 20), eight CS1 schools received approximately $4.86 million to implement their school improvement plans. Note that two public charter schools were initial identified as CS1 schools, but those schools closed at the end of 2018- 19 school year. OSSE and DCPS met monthly for grant oversight and reviewed evidence of CS1 schools' progress against their planned approaches in January 2020. Prior to the year three grant application cycle, CS1 schools and LEA leaders shared their progress to date with OSSE and DME and shared plans for continuous improvement in the 2020- 21 school year. Although the District suspended statewide assessments in 2020 and 2021, some CS1 schools did show significant improvements from 2018 to 2019 including Moten Elementary, Langley Elementary, Sousa Middle, and Eliot -Hine Middle. OSSE has continued to monitor progress across available data and metrics in school's improvement plans in alignment with federal requirements For year three (SY2020- 21), CS1 schools received approximately $3.36 million to continue implementation of their school improvement plans, with modifications as needed based on lessons learned and ongoing stakeholder engagement. OSSE reviewed evidence of progress through a data review, school and LEA presentation and discussion as well as a desktop audit in August 2021 and will continue to support LEA grant oversight through monthly touchpoints. Due to the pandemic in March 2020, and again in April 2021, OSSE was granted waivers for statewide assessments and certain a ccountability provisions of the federal Every Students Succeeds Act from the US Department of Education (ED). This meant that the District did not run its statewide accountability system, and no STAR Ratings were given to schools. As a part of these waiver s, schools designated as CS1 schools were required to remain in that same designation for the next school year, and OSSE continues to support these schools in FY2022. Through additional flexibilities made available from USED, OSSE is applying to extend the exit timeline forward, reflecting the two years of waivers, making the new targeted exit year 2023. Based on the conditions and assurances within the 2021 a ccountability waiver, OSSE will be required to make additional designations and identify schools performing in the bottom five percent of available metrics as well as those who have historically underperformed. Additional details for these identifications will be outlined in and depend upon the approval of the 2022 ESSA Accountability Addendum submi to ED. FY 2021 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 271 83. Please describe any plans OSSE has made to address learning loss by: (1) students overall; (2) students who are defined as at -risk; and (3) students with special needs. Include in your response what supports OSSE will provide to LEAs to address the academic recovery of each group of students . As the state education agency for the District of Columbia, OSSE sets high standards, provides oversight, supports LEAs with grants and technical assistance to address their needs, and strategically invests statewide resources to improve instructional outcomes. We will continue to take these steps to address learning loss experienced because of the pandemic. In the first year of the pandemic, OSSE believed it was important to lay a foundation for high- quality virtual learning and hybrid learning. Through our Guiding Princi ples for Continuous Education , first published in July 2020, OSSE provided LEAs with clear and high expectations ahead of the 2020- 21 school year for what constitutes quality, continuous education for all students. The Continuous Education principles and t he associated plans required LEAs to describe the steps that they will take to support the social -emotional needs of students, support students who are academically behind, and address the needs of specific groups of students including those that are homel ess, English language learners, or with disabilities. Following the 2020- 21 school year, OSSE revisited these principles with our stakeholders, and revised the guiding principles in its 2021- 22 edition to focus on accelerating unfinished learning. OSSE published the 2021- 22 Guiding Principles for Continuous Education in July 2021, where accelerated learning is named as one of three major recovery pr iorities. OSSE encouraged LEAs to provide accelerated learning for all students, especially those most affected by the pandemic. The interrupted instruction that has occurred during the pandemic is unprecedented for our students and school communities. Thus, traditional approaches to helping students \"catch up\" through remedial education\u2014or focusing exclusively on concepts better suited for earlier grade levels \u2014are insufficient to ensure full recovery from interrupted instruction. In fact, a focus on remed ial learning could worsen existing educational inequities, as schools are likely to disproportionately select students furthest from opportunity to receive remedial instruction. Accelerated learning \u2014 in which educators place unfinished learning in the cont ext of new learning, integrating both new information and the needed prior knowledge at the same time \u2014is better suited to support all students to recover from interrupted instruction. Ahead of the 2021- 22 school year, OSSE provided extensive resources to support District LEAs in developing their Continuous Education Plans (CEPs), where LEAs reported multiple strategies to accelerate learning. An analysis of the plans revealed that all LEAs planned to implement strategies to support acceleration, with the most common strategies being summer programming, additional staff, new professional development, new i ntervention programs, and high- impact tutoring. FY 2021 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 272 At the state level, OSSE recognizes the extraordinary opportunity to address the disproportionate impact of the COVID -19 pandemic on underserved students through the American Rescue Plan Act's require State set -asides to address the academic impact of lost instructional time, and to accelerate learning. OSSE is leveraging $19 million of its state reserve ESSER III funds to address learning loss and to accelerate learning (more information is provided below). By leveraging its state set- aside funds, OSSE began employing a variety of approaches and evidence -based interventions to help LEAs develop their Continuous Education Plans and to accelerate learning. Ahead of the 2021- 22 school year, OSSE partnered with third -party vendors to provide these supports to LEAs : Consultative supports to offer guidance, strategy and professional development training for school and system level instructional leaders, and their educator workforces, to walk them through the critic al steps for planning to restart school and accelerate student learning, including transitioning back to in- person learning and/or hybrid models of instructions, critical summer preparation periods, shifting talent needs, multi- tiered systems of support, f amily and community engagement, and ensuring equity throughout. This support included direct support to LEA leaders as they drafted their 2021- 22 Continuous Education Plans (CEPs). Implementation of a 1:1 virtual coaching program in spring and summer 2021 for school and instructional leaders using a \"coach the coach\" model. This program is continuing during the 2021- 22 school year. The purchase of an evidence -based, high- quality digital K -8 mathematics curriculum for all interested schools and LEAs that is aligned to state learning standards and is research - proven to support learning acceleration. OSSE plans to continue supplying this curriculum to interested LEAs through the 2024- 2025 school year. Partnerships to build awareness of the importance and charac teristics of high -quality English language arts (ELA) materials, and to support professional development for a group of LEAs currently adopting high- quality ELA materials. In addition to the above -named strategies that occurred in FY21, OSSE is in the process of implementing the additional learning acceleration strategies that are named in OSSE's State Plan for the ARP ESSER Fund , submitted to the U.S. Department of Education on June 7, 2021: Support high- impact tutoring (H IT) across the District : Invest in infrastructure supports such as citywide standards and foundational training for tutors to help ensure high- quality implementation of H IT as well as grants to schools and/or tutoring organizations to help scale high- impact tutoring models that meet OSSE's standards, particularly in high need areas where there is currently very limited supply (e.g., m iddle school math) and for populations who have experienced significant disruption due to COVID (e.g., at -risk students). For the initiative, w e identified approximately 75 schools as \"priority schools ,\" defined as schools where 70% or more of their popula tion identified as at risk , for the initiative , and set a goal to support 90% of these schools to offer HIT programming. Please see OSSE's response to Question 84 on High Impact Tutoring for more details. Scale the use of high -quality literacy curricula and instructional strategies : Conduct a citywide audit of current literacy curricula and provide professional development and training on FY 2021 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 273 the science of reading while making available high -quality literacy curricula for schools and LEAs to adopt. OSSE will also consider how such curricula could be leveraged in support of efforts to scale high- impact tutoring across the city. Scale the use of high -quality mathematics curricula : Conduct a citywide audit of current mathematics curricula and provide professi onal development and training on what constitutes high- quality curricula for schools and LEAs to adopt, and considerations for adoption and implementation. OSSE will also consider how such curricula could be leveraged in support of efforts to scale high- impact tutoring across the city. Make targeted investments to support accelerated learning for students with disabilities (SWDs): The District of Columbia has been clear about the significant inequities in educational outcomes for students with disabilities when compared to their peers without disabilities. OSSE has placed special emphasis on accelerating progress for students with disabilities in its most recent strategic plan and developed a corresponding Special Education Roadmap that outlines the agency's approach to this goal in more detail. We have leveraged our federal stimulus dollars to help us implement this roadmap in support of recovery. These efforts include the following initiatives focused on accelerated learning: An inclusive leade r cohort to help school leaders build systems that boost academic achievement of SWDs and sustain them over time; A suite of micro -credentials for special education and general education teachers to establish a shared foundation of knowledge and skills tha t help them create inclusive learning environments and set up all children to succeed; A Family Resource Center for Students with Disabilities, which will be housed at the Office of the Ombudsman and will expand upon the resource hub developed by OSSE to include multimod al supports (e.g. website, hotline, in- person support) to help the families of students with disabilities access the information and resources they need to navigate the special education system; Targeted recovery supports, including an LEA Toolkit for Serving Students with Disabilities during Periods of Remote or Blended Learning. The purpose of this toolkit is to provide foundational guidance and concrete, actionable resources for LEAs as they establish and implement policies and procedures for remote and/or blended learning contexts that are consistent with the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) requirements. The toolkit includes videos and other templates, for example, a service adaptation worksheet, accommodation adapt ation matrix, and a student data tool. OSSE hosted webinars on the toolkit and provided a deep dive technical assistance series that covered Balancing LEA Discretion and Flexibility, Ensuring Transparency and Collaboration, and Data -driven Supports. Make targeted investments to support accelerated learning for English learners : The COVID- 19 pandemic revealed substantial inequities in English learners' educational access and opportunity, described in detail in CCSSO's state leader guidance. OSSE has planned supports for LEAs to prioritize English learners. Given the newly updated WIDA English Language Development (ELD) standards framework, used by DC as the state ELD standards, we will assess LEA's current implementation strengths and weaknesses, and then pr ovide tailored consultative supports to LEAs to help them improve their programs. In addition, the majority of FY 2021 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 274 DC students will lack two consecutive years of summative English proficiency test data due to school closures and distance learning. Therefore, LEAs need to ensure that English learners are moving forward in developing proficiency in English, and seek valid, reliable, WIDA aligned assessments to conduct interim assessments during the school year in order to monitor students' progress and adjust ins truction accordingly. OSSE will provide LEAs an English proficiency benchmark assessment to increase data- driven instruction and help educators move students forward towards their language goals and timely exit from English learner status. Please see OSSE' s response to Question 68 for more details about LEA supports for ELs. FY 2021 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 275 84. OSSE allocated roughly $10 million from the State and Local Recovery Fund in the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 to address High Impact Tutoring in fiscal year 2022. The ESSER spending plan also allocated $3 million to support \"high -dosage tutoring.\" How has OSSE used this funding for the purpose of high dosage tutoring? Please list grant amounts and grantees for fiscal year 2022 (through January 31). To date in FY22, OSSE ha s worked with the Office of Out of School Time and Youth Outcomes (OST) to award $3,192,464 in grants to 8 community- based organizations (CBOs) to provide high- impact tutoring (HIT). This grant competition was launched in June 2021, grants were awarded in December 2021, and tutoring commenced in January 2022. The CBOs will collectively provide tutoring to 1,665 students at 46 schools and 2 non- school community sites across DC through the end of the 2021- 22 school year. Please see the table below for inform ation on the grantees: Grantee Award Amount AARP Kid Lab $750,000.00 Partners $750,000.00 Springboard Collaborative $371,333.00 The House Inc. $220,000.00 Total $3,192,464.00 For the rest of the yet -unspent FY21 and FY22 funds, OSSE will award the bulk in May 2022 via a large, multi- year grant for tutoring organizations. We plan to award approximately $20 million in grants in May 2022 that will be expended in the 28- month perio d from May 2022 through September 2024. The grant will support existing successful evidence -based tutoring programs to scale; support experienced evidence -based tutoring programs that can demonstrate the ability to deliver a new tutoring program to serve s tudents in grades pre -K-12 and provide funding to organizations delivering strategic program supports and program evaluation services for high- impact tutoring. OSSE is also working to procure a vendor to provide intensive supports to LEAs looking to set up tutoring programs beginning in March 2022, as well as working with two other DC agencies to set up MOUs to fund high- quality, evidence -based tutoring activities. Additionally, the high- impact tutoring initiative has accomplished the following since July of 2021: Finalized 3 -year strategy in September 2021 for expanding access to HIT for DC students, including identifying approximately 75 schools as \"priority schools,\" defined as schools where 70% or more of their population identified as at ris k, for the initiative, and set a goal to support 90% of these schools to offer HIT programming. FY 2021 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 276 Hired full- time HIT program manager in October 2021, with two additional team members onboarding in February and April 2022 to round out the team .

(c) List, in descending order, the 10 largest COV ID relief needs addressed by ESSER transfers. (a) ESSER funds decision- making pertaining to COVID -19 In total, OSSE has received approximately $600M in ESSER stimulus funds. Per federal law, 90% must be subgranted to local education agencies (LEAs) eligible to receive Title I -A funding. As with all federal grant programs, LEAs receive funds on a reimbursement basis after their grant application has been approved. As of November 2021, all eligible LEAs have been able to access their funding across all three g rant programs. Grant State Allocation State Set Aside were required to submit a separate application for each of the three grants with a detailed budget of how they intended to use the funding from each grant. All applications underwent three reviews from OSSE staff members to ensure that LEAs budget ite ms were allowable per the grant requirements and aligned to the federally defined grant goals to support LEAs in preparing for and responding to the pandemic. LEAs may also amend their budgets as the on- going conditions of the pandemic change and along wit h the needs of their students and staff. Any budget amendments also must be reviewed and approved by OSSE. All applications and amendments are maintained the Enterprise Grant Management System. In parallel to submitting applications in summer 2021, LEAs w ere also required to complete and submit Continuous Education Plans and Health and Safety Plans for the 2021- 2022 school year. While developing their plans, LEAs were required to engage stakeholders such as students, families, school and central office staff, civil rights organizations, and those representing the interests of children with disabilities, English learners, children experiencing homelessness, children in foster care, migratory students, children who are incarcerated, and other underserved students. LEA's plans are posted publicly both on OSSE's website and on the respective websites of each LEA. In these plans LEAs were required to describe their plans for a safe reopening FY 2021 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 278 (e.g., mitigation strategies), supporting student and staff well - being, and accelerated learning strategies to address unfinished learning. LEAs receiving ESSER funding also had to provide a written plan for how they intended to use ESSER III -ARP funding, including how they would meet the requirement to spend a minimum of 20% of that grant on evidence -based interventions which address the academic, social and emotional needs of students most disproportionately impacted by the pandemic. In developing their ESSER III- ARP plan, OSSE submitted the first round of reporting FY20 expenditures of ESSER grants to the U.S. Department of Education in February 2021. That report included a table of how LEA expended their ESSER I -CARES funds between March 13, 2020, and September 30, 2020 and is posted publicly on the Education Stabilization Fund Transparency Portal .

OSSE has begun creating the infrastructure needed to collect the required data and information from LEAs to meet this deadline. (b) ESSER funds guidelines regarding prioritization ESSER subgrants to LEAs are designed to provide LEAs with the flexibility needed to respond to the impacts of the pandemic for their specific community and USED has stated that ESSER funds can be used on any allowable activity permi ssible under an existing federal education program (e.g., Title I, Part A, McKinney Vento) and to cover costs of needs arising from the pandemic. As the state education agency (SEA), OSSE does not have the authority to determine how LEAs use funds outside of ensuring costs are allowable. For example, the use of ESSER FY 2021 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 282 funds includes, but is not limited to, enhanced sanitation protocols, PPE, academic interventions, social emotional supports, family engagement strategies, and afterschool programming. Additionally, for the ESSER III- ARP grant program, LEAs are required to use at minimum 20% of their total allocation on evidence -based interventions that address learning loss and ensure that those interventions respond to students' social, emotional, and academic needs and address the disproportionate impact of COVID -19 on underrepresented student subgroups. In alignment with US Department of Education (USED) priorities, OSSE has encouraged LEAs to use these emergency funds to safely reopen schools, address learni ng loss, provide mental health supports for student and staff, and ensure student access to technology (e.g. laptops, hot spots). OSSE also provided LEAs with application- focused technical assistance materials and routine technical assistance calls with th eir OSSE grant manager to support them to develop ESSER program applications that reflect their needs for pandemic recovery. To assist LEAs in developing their ESSER budgets, OSSE has provided the following resources and supports: Funding strategy guide and allowable uses documents to support LEAs in developing their budgets A series of live webinars including topics such as grant and application requirements which were recorded and posted online for viewing at any time Weekly virtual drop -in office hours during August and September An ESSER grant manager for each LEA to receive dedicated one on one support and assistance Individual LEA allocations and allowable uses of funds, along with resources produced by OSSE to support LEAs in accessing and using their funds can be found here . (c) Largest COVID -19 relief needs addressed by ESSER transfers To date, LEAs have reimbursed for a total of $81.5M, of which $76.2M was in FY21. OSSE will be providing a comprehensive report on how LEAs have utilized stimulus funds in FY21 (Oct 1, 2020, to Sept 30, 2021) to the US Department of Education this summer. Based on internal tracking of reimbursements requests submitted by LEAs, over 50% of FY21 expenses have been for laptops, hotspots and internet services to support distance learning. Aside from technology, the other two primary uses of funds include: Ensur ing and maintaining a safe return to school through equipment to improve air quality, PPE, sanitation services, operational staff to implement new safety protocols and reconfiguration of outdoor spaces (approximately 20% of FY21 expenses) Addressing learni ng loss through additional instructional staff (e.g. co- teachers, assistant teachers, coaches/interventionists), curriculum and implementing interventions (approximately 17% of FY21 expenses) FY 2021 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 283 Below are the 10 largest COVID relief needs indicated by LEAs ' FY21 -ARP 1 Devices (e.g., laptops) Devices ( e.g., laptops) Air Quality 2 Non-instructional staff (e.g., counselors, food service) Instructional Staff Devices (e.g., laptops) 3 Internet Access Internet Access Transportation 4 Tech Support Facilities and Outdoor Modifications Instructional Staff 5 Instructional Staff Work From Home Supports (e.g., internet stipends) Operational Staff 6 Sanitation Curriculum Professional Development 7 Operational Staff Operational Staff Tutoring 8 Supports for Students with Disabilities Intervention Programs Intervention Programs 9 Professional Development Sanitation Services Summer Programs 10 Mental Health Supports Air Quality Internet Access FY 2021 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 284 86.

Describe any technology upgrades OSSE's Department of Transportation (OSSE - DOT) has taken in fiscal years 2021 and 2022 (through January 31) to improve the tracking of buses and to communicate with parents and schools regarding arrivals and pick- ups. In FY21, OSSE DOT continued providing the Transportation Online Tool for Education (TOTE) refresher training. This training helps to ensure transportation information for student routing is accurately entered into the system. As OSSE DOT began transitioning back to an in- person school year in SY 2021- 22, OSSE DOT continued to make several enhancements to support moving between a hybrid and non- hybrid posture. These enhancements include improving the contact management process used by our dispatchers, updating several report s used by internal and external stakeholders, and making additional updates to the transportation request process and calendars. These changes to the TOTE application enabled OSSE DOT to implement some of the programmatic changes needed for the new upcoming routing, scheduling and student tracking system. Additionally, OSSE DOT deployed a new call center system, via Amazon Web Services (AWS). This phone system is used by the Customer Engagement team to support parents and enhance customer related intera ctions. The system allows for real time access to calls made to the contact center, enhanced reporting and the ability to pivot between remote and in office work with any configuration or system changes. OSSE DOT also deployed over 600 mobile phones/r adios with push to talk capability on the FirstNet network, to improve the communication with staff on the road. The phones also allow front line staff to manage their time and attendance utilizing the Kronos application. The new technology places staff on a priority network in order to support day- to-day operations and special projects in case of an emergency. In FY21, OSSE DOT completed the implementation process and began piloting for a more reliable, efficient, and user -friendly comprehensive transpor tation system which will include, routing and scheduling, the parent notification system, student ridership tracking and GPS, which will better meet the operational needs of the division. This new system will enhance routing and reporting for all stops in a bus journey (arriving/ departing homes, schools, terminals), make the routes traceable, and allow for parent tracking while easing the existing burden of utilizing multiple systems. The system will also enhance and improve data collection, data flow, dat a synchronization, system cohesion, and agency responsiveness, as well as eliminate redundancy across multiple system solutions. In FY22, OSSE DOT will continue the pilot program for a more reliable, efficient, and user - friendly comprehensive transportat ion system and complete additional training for team members in preparation for implementation. OSSE DOT also plans to establish an online portal/application for parents to securely and in real time receive and track their student(s) bus schedule informati on. The parent portal will keep parents apprised of when bus es are scheduled to arrive for pick up, as well as when student s are expected to arrive at school or home at the start or end of the school day.

Average Number of Drivers /Attendants Needed: This average takes the number of prescribed routes and adds 10% more of the drivers/attendants needed to cover those routes. OSSE aims to have a 10% bench of drivers/attendants on any given day. Note that the n umber of attendants is not based solely on the number of routes like drivers; some students need a one -to-one attendant. Average Number of Drivers/Attendants Employed & Active: These are the average number of drivers and attendants that have active employment status. Average Number of Drivers/Attendants Present Each Day: These are the average number of drivers/attendants that report to work each day. As of February 1, 2022, OSSE DOT had 135 vacancies; 41 of these vacancies have candidates selected. The remaining 94 vacancies include 36 bus drivers, 48 attendants and 10 administrative positions. To fill these vacancies, OSSE DOT , in collaboration with OSSE HR, continues to address hiring. The most recent recruitment efforts resulted in the hiring of 12 bus drivers and 6 bus attendants during FY21, ending the fiscal year with a 7.42% vacancy rate. OSSE DOT is preparing for another hiring fair on March 16, 2022, to address remaining vacancies. The current vacancy rate as of February 2022 is 8.16%. (b) OSSE DOT furloughed staff due to the COVID -19 pandemic There were no staff furloughed during School Year 2020- 2021 or 2021- 2022 (as of January 31) due to the COVID -19 pandemic. (c) Duties OSSE DOT's staff have fulfilled during the COVID -19 pandemic since the demand for bus drivers and aides as dropped drastically As schools reopened, OSSE DOT recalled bus drivers and attendants to provide transportation services to students while adhering to federal and local safety guidance. All OSSE DOT staff returned to in person work in July 2021. OSSE DOT staff provided support to DC government agencies to support cold weather relief, leaf collection, and other efforts as needed. FY 2021 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 299 Post- Secondary and Career Readiness 93. Question #93 (a) Please provide an update on OSSE's free SAT testing for all DCPS and public charter school juniors and seniors. Include in your update the following for fiscal years 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022 (through January 31): (1) cost of administering the program; (2) the number of 11th and 12th grade s tudents who utilized OSSE's program; and (3) the District's average SAT score. (b) What steps has OSSE taken in fiscal years 2021 and 2022 (through January 31) to support students' preparation for college admission exams? (a) Update on OSSE's free SAT testing for al l DCPS and public charter school juniors and seniors for FY18- 22 (to date). In 2012, the Council of the District of Columbia passed the \"Raising the Expectations for Education Outcomes Omnibus Act of 2012\" (D.C. Law 19- 142) which requires each student attending a public high school to take the SAT or ACT before graduating. Because the costs of both tests (over $40 per student) can be a barrier for students, OSSE provides all juniors and seniors who attend public high school in the District the opportunity to take the SAT without costs, through SAT School Day. During the fall semester, seniors take the SAT on a given day, and juniors do so during the spring semester. Prior to the pandemic, when an eligible student was present at school on SAT School Day, the y were required to take the exam. In school year 2020 - 21, LEAs were given the option of participating in SAT School Day based on public health guidance and with permission of the State Superintendent, and this decision separated test taking from student at tendance. In school year 2021- 22, SAT School Day resumed normal operation and all eligible students present at school on SAT School Day are required to take the exam. Cost of administering the program (SAT School Day) The table below summarizes the cost o f administering SAT School Day. The number of juniors and seniors (based on OSSE -verified data) participating on SAT School Day dates in the 2021- 22 school year are not yet available, and therefore the cost is not available at this time Fiscal Year Administration progress FY 2021 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 300 Number of students who utilized OSSE's program and the District's average SAT score The table below includes two test groups - All Test Takers and SAT School Day participants. Both represent public and public charter school students enrolled in grades 11 and 12 during the fiscal year reported. SAT School Day participants are test takers who participate in SAT School Day t est dates (OSSE's program). All test takers include students in grades 11 and 12 that take the SAT on any date in the reported fiscal year.

Therefore, the number of SAT tests taken exceeds the number of SAT participants. The average test scores reported here represent the average of all scores even when a student participated in testing on more than one day. (b) Steps has OSSE taken in fiscal years 2021 and 2022 (as of January 31) to support stude nts' preparation for college admission exams. The District set high academic standards in Math and English/Language Arts, and exposure to rigorous instruction in those subjects is essential for success on college admissions exams. The steps OSSE has taken in FY 2021 and FY2022 (to- date) to support students' preparation for college admission exams include a range of supports offered to LEAs for high- quality secondary education. In preparing students, OSSE has supported advanced course work in the form of AP teacher prep and dual enrollment. Further OSSE has encouraged LEAs to access SAT prep through College Boards' relationships with Khan Academy. Since the public health emergency began in March 2020, OSSE has continued to increase flexibility on grants s o that schools could use resources in ways that best serve their students, administered federal emergency funding to address the ramifications of the pandemic to LEAs with broad allowable uses, provided standards for continuous learning, included a section on postsecondary readiness in the continuous learning plans, convened communities of practice so that education professionals had the opportunity to learn what works from their peers, and FY 2021 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 301 provided professional development to improve educator practice in general and Advanced Placement educator practice, specifically. Collectively, these efforts are important to ensuring students are exposed to the content on the SAT and positively impact performance. FY 2021 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 302 94. Please provide an update on the OSSE Scholars program in fiscal years 2021 and 2022 (through January 31). Please provide the following information: (a) the number of students who applied to the program; (b) the number of students were accepted; (c) cost of the program per student; (d) length of time students attended the pr ogram; (e) activities and opportunities students experience through the program; (f) OSSE's student recruitment and outreach efforts; and (g) program outcomes. The OSSE Scholars Program was created in spring of 2012 as an academic enrichment opportunity for high- achieving, low -income District of Columbia high school students with funding support from the U.S. Department of Education's College Access Challenge Gra nt (CACG), which ended in 2015. Through partnerships with selective postsecondary universities, this program has continued and exposes high school sophomores and juniors to university campuses, various academic disciplines, and peers from a wide variety of backgrounds. To participate in the OSSE Scholars Program, interested students apply during the fall (including an essay, income verification, and transcript), and complete an interview. OSSE staff conducts interviews with all eligible applicants and ma kes final selections. Once students have been accepted as OSSE Scholars, they apply directly to university programs. Students may only attend one university program within a given summer. OSSE Scholars is a need- based program and, as such OSSE funds all pr ogram costs, as well as travel to and from each student's selected program. Accepted students and their parents/legal guardians attend at least two informational sessions prior to attending their program. Scholars also receive essay writing assistance, sum mer college application assistance, and college and career counseling assistance. Due to the ongoing public health emergency, OSSE Scholars were not able to experience university campuses in- person but were provided alternative college preparation oppor tunities during the summer of 2020 and attended virtual summer college programs in 2021. (a) Number of students who applied to the program The table below summarizes applications, acceptances, and costs for the OSSE Scholars Program in 2020, 2021, and 2022 to date: Summer 2020 Summer 2021 Summer 20 22 Number of student applicants 240 151 209 Number of accepted students 38 38 46 Total cost of the program* $224,618 $94,972 $292,106 Average cost $6,350 (46 students) FY 2021 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 303 *Costs include tuition, travel, and educational supplies. The summer 2022 calculation is an estimate based on the agreements available with postsecondary institutions, as of January 2022. (b) Number of students who were accepted See response to (a). (c) Cost of the program per student See response to (a). (d) Length of time students attended the program Normally, scholars attend programs at various partner postsecondary institutions with program date ranges between June and August. All programs run between two (2) and eight (8) weeks. (e) Activities and opportunities students experience through the Normally, scholars experience a variety of activities and opportunities through the OSSE Scholars Program. Prior to the summer experience, OSSE staff members provide a series of regular workshops and meetings to ensure OSSE Scholars are fully prepared. Pre -summer activities offered to Scholars include: New Student/Parent Orientation - OSSE Staff members introduce the expectations of OSSE Scholars and share details about deadlines. Travel Orientation - OSSE Staff members meets with students and parents about the intricacies of travel (many of the Scholars have never traveled on an airplane before). Peer Orientation - Scholars alumni meet and discuss their experience with new Scholars. Near Peer Mentoring - Scholars alumni volunteer to serve as mentors for current Scholars through summer application assistance and sharing insight about the on- campus college experience, time management as a high school student, and college and scholarship search and application processes. On-going and frequent 1:1 meetings w ith Scholars for essay writing and application assistance. Once students arrive on campus, students are exposed to: College level academic courses; College professors and staff; College residence halls and college resident life; and Opportunities t o explore the surrounding areas, and participate in exploration activities and other cultural exposure activities. FY 2021 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 304 In the 2019- 20 school year, many pre -program experiences were provided, and participating students remained in touch with program staff throughout summer 2020. However, in May 2020, due to challenges related to the public health emergency, this program as originally designed was cancelled for summer 2020. However, Syracuse University offered all 38 students who had been accepted as OSSE Scho lars the opportunity to audit one summer college course at no cost and 18 students participated. Additionally, all OSSE Scholars were offered the opportunity to participate in an eight -week, virtual college preparation program delivered by the OSSE Scholar s Program Manager, and 26 students participated. The virtual college preparation program included synchronous and asynchronous weekly lessons and assignments, and live panel discussions with representatives from college admissions, local and federal financial aid, scholarship programs, college professors, OSSE Scholars alumni and current college students. Activities included essay and personal statement writing, college exploration of match and fit, exploring scholarships, time management and planning for s enior year, virtual college tours with OSSE Scholars alumni, financial literacy activities, and a mock admissions event. In the summer of 2021, although OSSE Scholars participated in virtual summer college programs, several OSSE Scholars alumni advocated for also offering the virtual college preparation program again to current Scholars. The virtual program was offered to all 2021 OSSE Scholars, and 20 participated. Five OSSE Scholars alumni served as teaching assistants and near peer mentors throughout the six -week program in 2021. (f) Student recruitment and outreach efforts OSSE's recruitment and outreach efforts involve working with high school counselors and LEA staff to share information about the program and explain the application process. OSSE sta ff also works with high school counselors to help them better understand selection criteria and thus recommend the best candidates for the program. OSSE staff also visits high schools to hold informational sessions with interested or eligible students. Rec ruitment for this program occurs in the fall and spring prior to the program dates and was accomplished prior to the public health emergency. In FY21, these recruitment and outreach activities have continued both in- person and online, according to LEA prot ocol for external visitors during the 2021- 22 school year . (g) Program outcomes OSSE administers surveys in order to measure student feelings and expectations around postsecondary education related to their experience as an OSSE Scholar. Overall, participants indicate that this experience increases their awareness and challenges their assumptions about college. Based on feedback from the 2021 Scholars that responded to surveys, they valued the essay writing instruction and \"developing my personal brand\" sessions most. Many students are using essays from this summer as a tool for coll ege applications this fall. They also valued scholarship information (tailored to this particular group), alumni panels, and connecting weekly with an assigned teaching assistant (TA) (who are alumni of the program). As this program pivoted to FY 2021 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 305 virtual program models in 2020 and 2021, staff found that additional college preparation support is needed and appreciated among scholars who participated. This need informed the inclusion of essay writing and personal statements as early program components. FY 2022 outcomes will be measured after students complete programming in summer 2022. FY 2021 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 306 95. Question #95 (a) Please provide the number of dual enrollment seats and individual student enrollments OSSE funded in School Year 2020 -2021. (b) Provide OSSE's reasoning for suspe nding the dual enrollment program and explain how the agency reached its decision. (c) What are OSSE's future plans for the dual enrollment program and when does the agency plan to reinstate it? (a) Number of dual enrollment seats and individual student enrollme nts OSSE funded in School Year 2020- 2021. OSSE funds dual enrollment in two ways. In the first, OSSE awards competitive grants to fund dual enrollment programs with institutions of higher education (IHEs) that establish partnership agreements with local education agencies (LEAs) through the Dual Enrollment Scholarship program. IHEs are then reimbursed per student, per course, using these grant funds. The second, called the DC Dual Enrollment Consortium, began in the 2018- 19 school year. The Consortium is designed to provide additional dual enrollment opportunities for all students, but particularly students attending small LEAs that may otherwise not be able to establish strong partnerships with multiple IHEs. This means beginning in the 2018- 19 school year , students could be enrolled in programming provided by the Dual Enrollment Scholarship and the Dual Enrollment Consortium. In the 2020- 21 school year, 370 dual enrollment seats were available, and with OSSE funds 204 seats were filled. Note that a student may take multiple courses. (b) OSSE's reasoning for suspending the dual enrollment program and explain how the agency reached its decision. As reported in the FY 20 response, in May 2020, OSSE notified partner institutions of higher education in the Dual Enrollment Consortium and Scholarship programs that OSSE would cancel summer 2020 Dual Enrollment Consortium and Scholarship programs due to the decline in revenue stemming from the ongoing public health emergency. In June 2020, OSSE cancelled dual en rollment programs for fall 2020. (c) OSSE's future plans for the dual enrollment program and when does the agency plan to reinstate it. In summer 2020, OSSE began planning for the 2020- 2021 school year, and decided to delay the start of the dual enrollment p rogram until spring 2021, with applications for the spring 2021 semester opening in fall 2020. Dual Enrollment Consortium programming restarted for spring 2021, and OSSE -funded dual enrollment continued during the spring 2021 semester and summer 2021 ses sion. Dual Enrollment programming continues to grow, expand, and take place in the 2021- 22 school year. FY 2021 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 307 96.

This means that among students who first applied for and received DCTAG funds in the 2013- 2014 award year, 51.8 percent are reported as earning a bachelor's or associates degree within six years of enrolling in college. These rates vary year -to-year because a student's first year of college enrollment may not be the same as the first year they apply for and receive DCTAG, so students within an application cohort may reach the six- year completion mark in separate academic years. Please note: Students participating in DCTAG are assigned to an 'Application Cohort' based on the year during which the student first applied for and received DCTAG funds. Students who earned an advanced degree (e.g., MA, MD, Ph.D., etc.) are assumed to have completed either a Bachelor's or an associate's degree within six years, and in cases where the student is reported as earning an Mast er's degree but does not have Bachelor's reported the Bachelor's graduation date was derived by deducting two- years from their Master's graduation date. Students who earned a certificate or who are missing a degree -type are excluded from this analysis.

The District established the DC Re -Engagement Center (REC) to reconnect youth ages 16- 24 to educational programs. Please provide an update on RECs activities and outcomes in fiscal year 2021 and 2022 (through January 31). The DC ReEngagement Center (REC) is a central ized District service through which out -of- school youth between the ages of 16 and 24 can reconnect to educational options and other critical services to support their attainment of a high school diploma or equivalency. OSSE spearheads this effort with support from DC Public Schools and public charter schools, DC's Department of Human Services (DHS), Department of Youth Rehabilitation Services (DYRS), the Office of Neighborhood Safety and Engagement (ONSE), community- based organizations, and other key partner agencies. In an effort to successfully reconnect youth to school, the ReEngagement Center specialists complete the following steps: Performs an assessment of academic and non -academic needs to develop individualized reengagement plans; Provides assistance identifying \"best fit\" educational options, including District of Columbia Public Schools, public charter schools, community- based organizations, and faith based organizations; Provides support during the re -enrollment process (collecting documents, accompanying youth on program visits, and connecting youth to resources that address reengagement barriers); Provides support to schola rs with developing postsecondary education and career plans; and Provides ongoing support for at least one year after enrollment occurs. Outcomes Number of Disconnected Youth Served in FY2021 and 2022 to- date In FY21, the DC ReEngagement Center conduct ed 90 short intakes, conducted 75 full intakes (which includes a full intake interview), and reconnected 71 youth to an education program. In FY 22 to- date (through Dec. 31, 2021), the DC ReEngagement Center conducted 31 short intakes, conducted fewer t han 10 full intakes, and reconnected fewer than 10 youth to an educational program. The \"stick rate,\" is another one of the REC's core outcomes which measures a student's six - and 12-month persistence at the program they were enrolled in through the REC. The calculation is run once per quarter and is averaged across quarters using a weighted average of quarterly stick rates, which controls for variation in the number of youth in each cohort based on their date of enrollment. When constructing this measure, there is a distinction between clients who have remained engaged, or active, with the ReEngagement Center (successfully contacted by their case manager at least once per month) and those clients who are inactive for a variety of reasons (including but not limited to refusing services or changing contact information without notifying FY 2021 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 311 a case manager). Weighted \"Stick Rates\" for the first quarter of FY21 through the first quarter of FY22 are presented in the table below. DC ReEngagement Center Weighted Sti ck Rates ( FY21 Q1 through FY22 Q1) Months Inactive Clients 91.94% 95.70% Active Clients Only 95.56% 91.89% The six months stick rate describes the percentage of youth who, six months after enrolling for the first time since coming to the ReEngagement Center, were still enrolled or had earned a credential. Youth are included in this calculation if their 180th day since being first enrolled occurs in the quarter the calculation was computed. The District of Columbia Government began modifying its operations starting Monday, March 16, 2020, in response to the public health emergency related to the coronavirus (COVID -19). This greatly impacted the operating status of both the DC ReEngagement Center and partner local education agencies that are the main source of enrollment placements and many public service entities that provide youth referrals to the DC ReEngagement Center. Despite having reopened, the REC offices to in- person services in the summer of 2021, the overall totals for fiscal year 2021 and 2022 to- date are still directly impacted by the changes to operations across the city and the public's wariness of reconnecting to in- person services while the COVID -19 pandemic continues. This has been a pattern that has been observed by many DC REC partners across the District, as well as by re -engagement centers across the country. Activities In continuation of response to changes caused by the pandemic, the DC ReEngagement Center continued util izing virtual tools (including an online referral form and an online chat function), maintained the increased frequency of client check -ins, and also continued to facilitate online group sessions for all youth and families called DC REC LIVE. DC REC LIVE a imed to provide additional opportunities for clients to remain engaged, to learn and share information about resources and opportunities, and to connect with each other. Details about these efforts and other shifts the DC ReEngagement Center made to market ing, outreach, and youth/partner engagement effort in response to COVID -19 are included below. Districtwide Strategic Plan to Decrease Youth Disengagement from Education - The DC REC spearheaded efforts, with support from a consultant, to garner feedback and support for the creation and development of a District wide strategic plan. This strategic plan was developed in tandem with key community partners, stakeholders and government agencies as a blueprint that will guide our work over the next four years -collaboratively across the District - in an effort to decrease youth disengagement from education. Continuing Education Plans (CEP) - OSSE included questions in the CEP plans which targeted school efforts in support to consistently disengaged youth. DC REC LIVE (Virtual Youth -Driven platform for engagement) - Strategic weekly virtual engagement opportunities for REC youth that offers direct support to students inclusive of but not limited to the following: resource sharing, motivational speakers, career read iness efforts, mental health and wellness conversations, KBEC stipends, and FY 2021 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 312 client -specialist engagement through group and individual conversations around real issues and barriers facing our youth during the COVID -19 pandemic. DC REC Strategic ReEngagemen t Advertising Campaign - Strategic Citywide advertising that utilized bus advertising, digital advertising and geofencing, a wallscape located along the New York Avenue corridor, and strategic marketing throughout the District of Columbia to promote and advertise the DC ReEngagement Center. 2021 Street Canvassing Outreach Efforts - DC REC team members, following provided safety protocols in respect to COVID -19, began to conduct street outreach and canvassing throughout wards 6, 7, 8 to target reengagement ef forts. Continuation of DC REC Pop- Ups and Community Engagement - The DC ReEngagement Center held four in- person socially distanced events after the start of the COVID- 19 public health emergency, to meet the educational, physiological, socio- emotional and s ocio-economic needs of our students. REC Pop- Ups were held outside and were used to collect documents needed to complete school enrollment and to distribute GED study guides, non- perishable food items and Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). The DC REC's youth action board, better known as the C.O.R.E. (Council of Real Experiences) continued to convene , as needed, to support peer -to-peer outreach efforts, harness youth voice for program improvement (including inclusion in the aforementioned strategic plan ning effort), and support the creation of student leaders. Marion Barry Summer Youth Employment Program (MBSYEP) Virtual - The REC participated in the 2021 MBSYEP by facilitating a six- week hybrid schedule MBSYEP summer experience for DC REC scholars. Duri ng MBSYEP, DC REC scholars were exposed to career counseling, educational and career exposure, and workforce development. The DC REC's MBSYEP scholars connected with community- based organization and agency partners virtually and participated in 2021 Beat t he Streets Outreach events. Scholars were also connected to an American Job Center caseworker to assist them with taking the skills and knowledge they have learned during the summer in preparation to enter the workforce. Partnerships The success of the DC ReEngagement Center is due to the many partnerships formed throughout the District. The small number of DC ReEngagement Center staff maximize services and supports for clients by partnering with these agencies and below are highlighted agencies that have contributed to the overall success of the DC ReEngagement Center in FY 2021 and FY 2022 to- date (a full list of partnerships is available in the DC ReEngagement Center's annual report upon request). Please note: co- locations that are in -person continued to be paused for all of FY21 in response to public health guidance related to COVID -19 and are just now re -starting. Co-located intakes in Columbia Heights: The ReEngagement Center's bilingual specialist continues to conduct intakes as needed in Columbia Heights in order to provide service to youth who are not able or willing to come to the Northeast location. Department of Human Services (DHS): Opportunities include bi -weekly coordinated entry youth housing meetings , co-location of DC REC staff at DHS's homeless youth drop- in center (Zoe's Doors) and the co- location of DHS staff at the ReEngagement FY 2021 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 313 Center to support clients' who need to access TANF, SNAP, Medicaid, and other DHS administered benefits. Lastly, the DC ReEngagement Center is a primary TANF vendor which means that DHS can assign TANF customers who are eligible for REC services to the REC. Office of Neighborhood Safety and Engagement's (ONSE) Pathways Program: The ReEngagement Center partners with the Pathways Program to provide educational assessments, planning, and referrals; as well as barrier identification and remediation for all Pathways participants. OSSE's Division of Early Learning and the Department of Human Services: ReEngagement Center Specialists have been trained to complete the full application process needed to issue child- care vouchers at the REC to youth parents who identify child -care as a barrier to re- enrollment. Department of Employment Services (DOES): DOES makes referrals to the REC, assists eligible ReEngagement Center clients in participating in the Career Connections employment program and the Marion Barry Summer Youth Employment Program (MBSYEP), provides multiple interns to the DC ReEngagement Center under the Project Empowerment program and the MBSYEP, and provide s employment and job readiness services for REC clients through the American Job Center. Department of Youth and Rehabilitation Services (DYRS): DYRS refers clients in need of educational support to the ReEngagement Center and REC staff provide onsite int akes at DYRS's Achievement Centers twice a month. Finally, the DC ReEngagement Center continues to implement postsecondary and career planning and support for clients who have completed or are close to completing their secondary education through monthl y postsecondary and career path workshops. The initiative includes utilizing the Career Coach DC website to conduct career interest inventories and explore labor market information data regarding different career options and plan for their next steps in their career pathway, whether that leads them to a degree granting college or university, a publicly funded job training program to earn an industry -recognized credential, an apprenticeship program, or directly into the workforce. FY 2021 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 314 98. What programs were offered by OSSE in fiscal year 2021 to assist District residents in achieving their high school equivalency? The District of Columbia, through OSSE, offers residents multiple pathways through secondary education, including waivers for local education agencies (LEAs) to offer competency- based education programs, as well as funding for GED, the National External Di ploma Program (NEDP), and basic education programs for adult learners. Specifically, OSSE assists District residents in achieving their high school equivalency in two ways - (1) direct service at OSSE's GED Program Office, and (2) federal and local sub -grants to programs that provide basic education and preparation for two high school equivalency assessments - the GED and the NEDP. Both options support pathways to a secondary credential, either a traditional high school diploma or a state diploma. Since the state diploma option was enacted, each adult learner who passes all sections of the GED has received a state diploma, and learners who complete an NEDP have received either a high school diploma or state diploma, depending on the entity that supporte d their NEDP completion (see Program Support below). Between October 1, 2020, and September 30, 2021, OSSE awarded 144 State High School diplomas to residents who passed all sections of the GED and 20 State High School diplomas to residents who successfully completed the NEDP for a grand total of 164 State Diplomas earned. Between October 1, 2021, and January 31, 2022, OSSE awarded 41 State High School diplomas in total. Thirty -eight (38) of them to residents who passed all sections of the GED and three (3) to residents who successfully completed the NEDP. GED Program Office The DC GED Program Office is an official GED\u00ae testing center and serves as the single source in DC for administering the GED Tests via computer and endorsing candidates who successfully pass the GED Tests to receive the state diploma. This office informs adult educators and learners about the GED requirements, and provides professional development, technical assistance, and resources to GED instructional programs to support students' success in GED programs. Since FY 2016, individuals who passed the GED received state diplomas. Program Funding and Support OSSE's Adult and Family Education (AFE) team supports LEAs and community- based organizations in the District that offer instruction towards the GED as well as the NEDP. The NEDP awards a secondary credential to adults who successfully demonstrate academic and life - skill competencies that have been determined to be what every high school student should know or be able to do. The AFE team works with Comprehensive Adult Student Assessment Systems (CASAS), NEDP National Office, DC Public Schools (DCPS), the DC Public Charter Schools, and community- based organizations to expand the NEDP option in the District of Columbia. FY 2021 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 315 99. Please provi de an update on the Adult and Family Education (AFE) grant. In FY 2020, OSSE, in collaboration with the WIC, conducted a new grant competition for FY21- FY25 AEFLA, Gateway to Careers and WIC Career Pathways funding. Awards were made to the following 12 providers to offer Integrated Education and Training (IE&T) services to 1,000 District residents: Academy of Hope Public Charter School Briya Public Charter School Catholic Charities Congress Heights Community Training and Development Corporation Four Walls Career and Technical Education Center Latin American Youth Center Career Academy Public Charter School Opportunities Industrialization Center - DC So Others Might Eat (SOME) Southeast Welding The Family Place Public Charter School YouthBuild Public Charter School YWCA - NCA IE&T program models include the provision of adult education and literacy, workforce preparation, and training services for a specific occupation or occupational cluster for educational and career advancement . IE&T programs provide adult learners with an opportunity to enhance their literacy and numeracy skills and earn a secondary school credential while working towards acquiring an entry level and/or industry recognized certification in pursuit of their des ired career path. In FY21, a total of 1,246 adult learners received services in OSSE AFE funded programs. Of this number, 1,086 learners met the National Reporting System (NRS) guidelines of having a valid assessment and 12 or more instructional hours i n the program year to be reportable to the US Department of Education. The remaining 160 adult learners engaged in one to 11 instructional hours For FY21, OSSE AFE negotiated a measurable skill gains performance target of 47 percent for all Adult Basic Ed ucation (ABE) and English as a Second Language (ESL) Educational Functioning Levels (EFLs). This target represents the proposed percentage of adult learners making a measurable skill gain (e.g., achieving an educational functioning level gain, acquiring a secondary school diploma or its equivalent, or exiting a program below the postsecondary level and enrolling in postsecondary education and training during the program year). OSSE AFE exceeded its target of 47 percent, with 55.64 percent of students enroll ed in an OSSE AFE - funded program achieving a gain. This reflects a 14- point increase compared to the percentage of students with measurable skill gains in FY20 - (41.64 percent). Additionally, OSSE AFE negotiated a credential attainment target of 46 perce nt for FY21. While the state did not meet its target, the state's performance was 44.87 percent. This reflects an increase of 0.67 percentage points compared to 44.2 percent in FY20. From a national reporting FY 2021 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 316 perspective, the credential attainment metric includes both industry- recognized credentials (IRCs) and secondary credentials. The attainment of IRCs is one of the key benefits to the IE&T service model. It should be noted that some industry- recognized credentials require a practicum component to be completed before earning the credential. This is relevant because students' ability to participate in the practicum component of training programs was negatively impacted by the pandemic, thus decreasing the number of students that were successfully able t o earn industry- recognized credentials. In FY 21, 374 adult learners earned 544 certifications (of 26 types), including those for industries such as healthcare, construction, business administration & information technology, early childhood education, hospitality, and law & security. The most earned certifications were: Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) - Adult/Pediatric /First Aid/AED/BLS (173), Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 10- Hour Construction Safety and Health (82), and Micr osoft Office Specialist (MOS) Certification (26).

The summer meeting in late July or early August is when the Common Lottery Board approves the policy guide for the upcoming lottery cycle. The approved My School DC Policy Guide dated July 2021 states the following changes from prior editions: New Policy: In accordance with the Expanding Equitable Access to Schools Amendment Act of 2020 (DC Official Code \u00a738- 194(a)(1)(A)): o MSDC will share the number of matches, by preference group, for each school and grade. o MSDC will not allow any changes to the order and implementation method of a school's lottery preferences once they are published on the MSDC website in November. New Recommendation: If operating s tatus for the upcoming year is uncertain at the time of the lottery, MSDC recommends that schools do not offer any seats or enroll new students until the operating status is finalized. Point of Clarification: MSDC can implement a preference through designa ted seats for authorized priority groups (Special Education preference, Military preference, and preference for students at -risk of academic failure). Point of Clarification: Schools participating in MSDC that offer multiple lottery programs (examples: Montessori and traditional, or English and French), must offer seats only to those students who applied to that program. For additional information on the Board's business, refer to the hyperlinked minutes and recordings for discussions of steps taken to address preferences, data release, and any other initiatives impacting the Lottery. (d) Steps Board has taken to address lot tery preferences, increased publicly released data, and other initiatives. The Common Lottery Board discussed the Equitable Access Preference (formerly referred to as the at -risk preference) at each 2021 meeting, including the implications and implement ation of the preference at Stevens Early Learning Center, and the Expanding Equitable Access to Schools Amendment Act of 2020 (DC Official Code \u00a738- 194(a)(1)(A)),which authorized charter schools to offer the new preference, subject to approval by the Publi c Charter School Board. Regarding more data being publicly released, the Board discussed the implication of the Expanding Equitable Access to Schools Amendment Act of 2020 (DC Code \u00a738- 194(a)(1)(A)). My School DC will begin sharing the expanded data this fiscal year on the My School DC website in April 2022. FY 2021 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 322 Health and Wellness 102. Provide an update on OSSE's collaboration with the Department of Behavioral Health and the De partment of Health on the implementation of programs to identify and assist children with behavioral health or developmental problems at DCPS and at charter schools. What new work was completed in fiscal year 2021? Please also describe the training made av ailable to LEAs on crisis response and intervention and which LEAs participated. OSSE has continued to collaborate with DC Department of Behavioral Health (DBH) and DC Department of Health (DC Health) in the development and delivery of services to childr en and youth in the District and to offer guidance, actionable resources, and promising practices to help education agencies and schools address the unique challenges of behavioral health services during the COVID -19 public health emergency. OSSE has cont inued to work closely with the Department of Behavioral Health and directly with LEAs to support student and educator behavioral health, through both the city- wide School Behavioral Health Expansion as well as Project AWARE, a five -year grant received by O SSE from the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). The goal of the School Behavioral Health Expansion Program is to integrate school and community -based provider services to ensure all schools provide mental health promotion and prevention, intervention, and direct behavioral health services and supports. Led by DBH, and guided by the Coordinating Council on School Behavioral Health, the expansion effort is executed in partnership with OSSE, education agencies, schools, community providers, parents, youth, and education advocates. Leadership from OSSE's Division of Health & Wellness serve as members of the Coordinating Council, members of the Community of Practice and evaluation core teams, and as co -chairs for the im plementation sub- committees. The implementation committee, comprised of leadership from OSSE's Division of Health & Wellness, DBH, DCPS, and DC Health, is focused on supporting schools with annually assessing the school's available behavioral health se rvices and setting program goals, scoping out the sequence of implementation tasks for executing the expansion plan, and establishing standard benchmarks for year to year. The selected needs assessment - the School Strengthening Tool - was adapted from the Center for Disease Control (CDC) School Health Index and is a self - assessment and planning guide that enables school teams to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the school's policies and progra ms for promoting health and safety, develop an action plan for improving student health and safety, and involve teachers, parents, students, and the community in improving school policies, programs, and services. During FY21 OSSE has supported the Expansion through: Continued support of the completion and mid- year review of the School Strengthening Tool and Workplan process through operationalizing the self -assessment process and creating online accounts for School Behavioral Health Coordinators and CBO Cli nicians FY 2021 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 323 Supporting the assessment of completeness and quality of workplans through the development and utilization of the School Strengthening Work Plan Quality Improvement Tool Creating targeted videos, tip sheets, and reproducible materials to support continued integration of school behavioral health services and programming and promoting student and family roles and engagement in the Expansion Additionally, in FY21, OSSE and DBH completed year three for Project Advancing Wellness and Resilience Education (AWARE), a five -year $8.8 million dollar grant awarded to OSSE in FY18 by the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). This grant opportunity, which complements the significant local investment in school menta l health, allows OSSE and DBH to deepen the partnership with three large LEAs (DCPS, KIPP, and Friendship Public Charter School) to support the development of multi -tiered systems of mental health supports for students, educators, and school communities. M ental health promotion, trauma -responsive practices and family engagement are key elements of the model of care. Major actions through Project AWARE in FY21 were as follows: Project AWARE LEAs increased the number of participating schools from 14 to 38 Project AWARE schools continue to use of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), a 25 -item behavioral health screening tool for youth that assesses emotional symptoms, conduct problems, hyperactivity and inattention, peer relationship problems, and pro- social behaviors. Project AWARE schools hosted targeted trainings for their mental health providers and school staff on topics involving trauma -informed care, personal resilience, crisis prevention and intervention, adverse childhood experiences ( ACEs), suicide prevention and intervention, and special considerations for operations during the COVID -19 pandemic. Project AWARE schools continued elevating topics of mental health and wellness to parents and families through virtual and on- demand webinar s, web platforms, reproducible resources, workshops and skill building events in FY21. OSSE facilitated five virtual Youth Mental Health First Aid (YMHFA) trainings in FY21 utilizing Project AWARE investments. It has been well documented that the COVID -19 pandemic has had a negative impact on the mental and emotional well- being of youth, with increased reports of high anxiety, grief, and concern about academic success. Even with a swift collaborative and comprehensive approach by District schools and comm unity based organizations to support students throughout the pandemic and during remote learning, students continue to experience elevated stress due to concerns with the COVID -19 pandemic, which is compounded in some communities with stress related to racism and racial trauma, loss of employment and income, and loss of caregivers. OSSE supported COVID -19 recovery through the utilization of Project AWARE funds by: Hosting eight suicide prevention and intervention trainings for all District public and public charter school mental health providers targeted for appropriate grade bands served. Training 127 elementary clinicians and 135 middle and high school clinicians. Supplying 53 elementary schools and 48 middle and high schools with suicide prevention and intervention curriculum. FY 2021 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 324 Hosting eight technical assistance sessions to support clinicians in the implementation, roll-out, and problems of practice surrounding their trained curriculums. Hosting two special training sessions on \"Understanding Trauma\" reac hing 34 school clinicians. On the subject of training and trauma -informed practices, both local and federal investments supported the District's school -based behavioral health Community of Practice (DC CoP). The DC CoP advances the citywide school behavi oral health expansion and Project AWARE by inviting school behavioral health coordinators and community- based clinicians to participate in a peer learning environment aimed at building the capacity to implement high- quality school - based behavioral health s ystems. The DC CoP served as an essential link to and across multiple District efforts focused on school -based behavioral health. During the 2020 -21 school year, the DC CoP facilitated monthly learning events and shared conversations to further best practi ces in school behavioral health. OSSE partnered with DBH and the DC CoP to develop sessions on the District's Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS), grief and loss, and suicide prevention. Within the DC CoP is the Crisis Intervention Practice Group, which is c o-chaired by an OSSE staff member and convened four sessions with school behavioral health professionals and administrators in FY21. This practice group had 34 participants across the four meetings representing seven LEAs: Academy of Hope Public Charter School Creative Minds International Public Charter School DC Bilingual Public Charter School District of Columbia Public Schools Early Childhood Academy Public Charter School Elsie Whitlow Stokes Public Charter School Friendship Public Charter School Lastly, OSSE and DBH continued to collaborate on communication and compliance strategies related to mandated behavioral health training requirements for all DCPS and public charter school administrators and teachers in FY21 (DC Official Code \u00a7 7- 1131.17).

According to the data collected and available to OSSE, what is the current compliance rate among LEAs for completing health education and physical education requirements in the District. Compliance rates for the 2021- 22 school year are not available because the school year is in progress and data reported by schools on the School Health Profile has not yet been verified and validated by OSSE . Additionally, due to operational challenges presented by the COVID -19 public health emergency during school year 2020 -21, the School Health Profile data collection was cancelled that year. Thus, OSSE is providing the most recent School Health Profile data available from SY 2019- 20.

This change was made at the request of schools that provide a greater amount of health education per week (c) How OSSE is enforcing health and physical education requirements during the COVID- 19 pandemic and distance learning. OSSE continues to enforce health and physical education during the COVID -19 public health emergency. In an effort to ensure schools continued to offer health and physical education instruction and meet Healthy Schools Act requirements during remote and hybrid learning, OSSE issued school health reminders to LEAs which outlined health and physical education requirements for Kindergarten through Grade 12, including clarifying to LEAs that schools must continue to enforce and report on health and physical education requirements during the COVID -19 public health emergency. OSSE hosted a technical assistance call with LEA leaders to discuss strategies to meet these requirements in a distance learning posture. Additionally, OSSE developed the Data to Action Guide: Addressing Youth Risk Behavior Through Health Education to support the implementation of health and physical during distance learning. The Data to Action Guide elevates critical health and physical education standards and connects schools to a variety of community partners, training opportunities, and curricula. Finally, OSSE worked with DCPS and the Healthy Youth and Schools Commission on Physical Activity subcommittee to identify and disseminate existing tools and resources to support teachers with planning, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of health and physical education during remote and hybrid learning. After the 2022 School Health Profiles are administered and OSSE has validated and reviewed the data, OSSE will provide technical assistance to s chools that are out of compliance with the health education and physical education requirements and support school teams in identifying and addressing barriers ahead of the next school year. As part of this process, these schools will attest they will meet the health education requirements for next school year. Conducting this technical assistance process in the spring and summer timeframe is in sync with the time of year when schools create their schedules, begin planning, and select curricul a for the upcoming school year. FY 2021 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 330 105. Describe OSSE's efforts in fiscal years 2021 and 2022 (through January 31) to increase participation in the Child and Adult Care Food Program and promote health and wellness through Healthy Tots programming and funding. Background The Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) and the Healthy Tots Act (HTA) provide an important funding stream that not only increases access to food for children in the District, but also supports child development facilities in becoming fina ncially stronger by tapping into available funding sources. CACFP provides nearly 5 million meals to children in the District of Columbia through an investment of approximately $10 million. Most eligible child development facilities in the District participate in the CACFP. OSSE plays a key role in supporting access to balanced and nutritious meals for children in the District. OSSE provides over $50 million per year in local and USDA funding to support schools, child development facilities, adult day ca res, summer meal programs, and other programs with healthy meals that feed District of Columbia residents. Through CACFP, child development facilities in the District can be reimbursed for up to four meals per day, which includes local funding for a fourth meal. The Healthy Tots Act ensures facilities have access to CACFP and additional local reimbursements beyond federal funding. The Healthy Tots Act establishes additional local funding for meals (breakfast, lunch, or supper) served by child development fa cilities that: (1) participate in CACFP; and (2) meet the USDA meal requirements. These Healthy Tots Act reimbursements are detailed below: Add10 : Child development facilities participating in the CACFP may request an additional 10 cents ($0.10) for each eligible breakfast, lunch, and supper served to an eligible child. (5A DCMR \u00a71001.2) Local5: Child development facilities participating in CACFP may request an additional 5 cents ($0.05) per lunch or supper when at least one meal component is comprised of a locally sourced food item, as defined in section 101(3) of the Healthy Schools Act of 2010 ( D.C. Code \u00a7 38-821.01) and unprocessed foods, as defined in section 101(10)(A) of the Healthy Schools Act of 2010 ( D.C. Code \u00a7 38-821.01). Locally grown and unprocessed foods does not include milk. (5A DCMR \u00a71001.4- 5) Full Day4: Child development facilities participating in CACFP that have maximized the number of daily meal services eligible for CACFP reimbursements are allowed two (2) meals and one (1) snack or one (1) meal and two (2) snacks, reimbursements from the Healthy Tots Fund are made available to facilities for an additional meal to each enrolled and participating child, if 75 percent of the children enrolled and attending the child development facility are District residents and at least 50 percent of the enrolled and attending children are eligible for subsidized child care. (5A DCMR \u00a71001.7) The Healthy Tots Act requires licensed child development facilities to participate in CACFP if 50 percent or mo re of enrolled children are eligible for subsidized child care for at least six continuous months ( D.C. Code \u00a7 38-282.01(a)). Facilities that are mandated to participate in CACFP receive extensive outreach and technical assistance from OSSE if they are not yet enrolled, including: FY 2021 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 331 Initial and subsequent notifications from OSSE outlining participation requirements and options for the facility; Introductory in- person technical assistance visit and orientation with the facility to provide face -to-face assistan ce with Healthy Tots Act and CACFP compliance; Training and reoccurring technical assistance from OSSE throughout the entire CACFP application process, including a minimum of two in- person technical assistance visits during the full application process; a nd Individual and group CACFP trainings for child development facilities at individual facilities and OSSE headquarters. Beyond working directly with child development facilities to enroll in CACFP, OSSE also provides support and guidance to facilities on health and wellness, including through OSSE's Step by Step Guide for Implementing Wellness Guidelines , direct technical assistance on health initiatives, and wellness challenges for child development facilities to educate them on the Wellness Guidelines . FY21 CACFP HTA Enrollment Activities The Healthy Tots Act (HTA) requires licensed child development facilities to participate in CACFP if 50 percent or more of enrolled children are eligible for subsidized chil d care for at least six continuous months ( D.C. Code \u00a7 38-282.01(a)). Facilities that are mandated to participate in CACFP receive extensive outreach and technical assistance from OSSE if they are not yet enrolled. OSSE has refined an effective and syste matic approach for working with child development facilities that are required to participate in CACFP. When a child development facility has been identified as meeting the HTA requirements to participate in CACFP, OSSE contacts the facility to encourage t hem to participate and follows up by scheduling an in- person technical assistance visit with the facility to provide face -to-face assistance with HTA and CACFP compliance. Facilities that decide to apply for CACFP receive training and reoccurring technic al assistance from OSSE throughout the entire application process, with a minimum of two technical assistance visits during the full application process. Individual and group CACFP trainings for child development facilities are also held at individual facilities and OSSE headquarters. This approach has been refined in FY21 due to ongoing COVID -19 pandemic and operational challenges presented to child development facilities. Typically, OSSE conducts targeted and data -driven outreach to facilities beginning in March of each year to begin their enrollment activities; however, in March of FY21, many child development facilities were still closed or managing through greatly decreased child enrollment or reduced staffing. Additionally, child development facilities were facing significant operational challenges to meet all necessary COVID -19 health and safety guidance, including the rollout of vaccinations for staff and managing through quarantine and isolation periods of children and staff, In lieu of th e routine CACFP expansion outreach activities, the OSSE CACFP team pivoted to providing guidance and technical assistance for child development facilities on providing safe and healthy meals during the COVID -19 pandemic in accordance with DC Health, CDC, a nd FY 2021 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 332 USDA health guidance and recommendations. Child development facilities received guidance on strategies for safely serving meals in -person (e.g., physical distancing, cleaning and disinfection, safe removal and storage of masks, increased air circulation ), providing meals for families to pick up and take home, and establishing systems to deliver meals to children's homes. The CACFP team also provides additional technical assistance to any program operator that requests support throughout the year. Coordinated CACFP training occurs quarterly with OSSE's Division of Early Learning, allowing for a broader reach to program participants. In FY22, OSSE plans to operate the CACFP expansion program in a manner that appropriately fits the health and safety climate in accordance with DC Health, CDC, and USDA health and safety guidance. OSSE is aware many child development facilities continue to be challenged as they navigate the broader demands presented by the lasting impact of COVID -19 on their operations, funding, and staffing capacity. OSSE will continue to evaluate how to best engage child development facilities on CACFP expansion activities during this challenging time. FY21 Healthy Tots Wellness Grant Activities In FY21, the Healthy Tots Wellness Grant completed the second year of its two -year grant cycle with continuation awards totaling $399,581.80 to four community- based organizations. The grantees are required to support the dissemination of healthy eating, physical activity, and wellness programming i n the District's early child care community. These four community -based organizations touched over 60 child development facilities with programming that provided skills in stress management and the connection to social -emotional learning, implemented a children's yoga program and a tennis skills program for toddlers and pre -K children, and bolstered child development facility skills in local food procurement to increase local vegetable and fruit consumption in child development facilities and children's hom es. Grantees targeted facilities in Wards 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8, and served over 3,000 children, staff, and families in FY21 . The impact of COVID -19 on program delivery continued into FY21. The Healthy Tots grantees continued to adapt to the health and saf ety demands in creative ways. Examples include the following: Virtual Saturday support circles to give early childhood educators a space to share their experiences in the changed professional environment. Educators requested Saturday activities to ensure they would be able to participate without interference with their work schedules. New gardens and associated plantings and development supported through virtual technical assistance sessions. Virtual tennis training and training protocols for guiding faci lities in creating an effective tennis play. More details on the Healthy Tots Program are available on the OSSE website . FY 2021 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 333 106. Please provide an update on OSSE's implementation of an environmental literacy program. Pursuant to the Environmental Literacy Specialist Pilot Program Amendment Act of 2015 (Section 4101 of the FY16 Budget Support Act of 2015), OSSE continued opportunities and initiatives for District teachers and organizations to advance environmental literacy in the District, guided by implementation of the DC Environmental Literacy Plan, as described below. Environmental Literacy Leadership Cadre OSSE continued working with its Environmental Literacy Leadership Cadre (ELLC), a group of individuals from elementary schools across the District who will be responsible for: (1) developing a plan to implement the Environmental Literacy Framework at their schools; and (2) coordinating its implementation. The ELLC meets monthly to discuss environmental education best practices, how the Environmental Literacy Framework supports teaching the Next Generation Science Standards, implementation of school garden and recycling/composting projects, and additional resources available to support schools. There have been three cohorts of ELLC since 2016. In September 2019, OSSE began working with 10 elementary schools for Cohort 3 and assigned each teacher a mentor. During the 2020- 21 school year, the cadre continued to meet monthly using a virtual platform. Teachers helped field test the Capital LEAF program to recognize green, healthy, sustainable schools and helped refine the application process. Cadre members also created program sustainability plans to guide future school -based environm ental literacy efforts. Most importantly, teachers were able to connect with colleagues across different schools to share virtual learning tips, tricks, and strategies. In fall 2021, Cohort 3 schools transitioned to become \"alumni schools,\" joining schools from Cohort 1 (formed in 2016) and Cohort 2 (formed in 2018). These 40 alumni elementary schools continue to receive limited support from OSSE to ensure continuity and sustainability of environmental literacy efforts. As of January 2022, OSSE has been ac tively recruiting schools to participate in Cohort 4 of the cadre. Environmental Literacy Advancement Grants To support environmental programming efforts at the ELLC schools, OSSE offers a grant opportunity for nonprofit organizations, strategically emphasizing the physical environment and community involvement components of the Whole School, Whole Community, and Whole Child (WSCC) model to provide environmental education programs in the areas of air quality/climate change, water, land, resource conse rvation, or health. For the 2020- 21 school year, OSSE awarded $216,901.20 in continuation grants to three nonprofit organizations, who partnered with three additional organizations, to support the following: Recycling and composting experiences, Watershed explorations and American shad (DC's state fish) restoration activities, and School -based studies of air pollution and tree canopy. Due to the ongoing impact of the COVID -19 pandemic on school operations, grantees offered virtual programs in addition to safely planned in- person experiences when requested by schools. All grant activities were completed by September 2021 as described below: FY 2021 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 334 Grantees provided programs to the entire grade level s at the cadre sch ools, as well as some classes at alumni cadre schools. By the end of the academic school year, grantees reached approximately 4,265 students through live virtual programming and 113 students through in- person programming at school sites. Grantees continued to support teachers with distance learning resources, which are posted on OSSE's website . Resources include: o Environmental videos, some of which received over 6,000 views. o Activities for students and their families for learning at home. o Virtual lessons that can be accessed by a larger audience of teachers. o Nature Connections: Livestream with Environmental Experts, a bi -weekly series providing virtual field experiences to locations in and around the District for all students. The most popular session was on the Brood X periodical cicadas Capital Leaders in Environmental Actions for our Future (LEAF ) Program In FY21, OSSE continued to pilot the Capital LEAF program to recognize green, healthy, and sustainable schools in the District. In the 2020- 21 school year, OSSE field tested the green school recognition process with elementary schools participating in the Environmental Literacy Leadership C adre. Schools that completed the pilot included: Latin American Bilingual Montessori (LAMB) Public Charter School, Lee Montessori Public Charter School, Tubman Elementary School, Murch Elementary School, Thomson Elementary School, Leckie Elementary School, Miner Elementary School, and Whittier Elementary School. These schools were recognized for their participation during the Growing Healthy Schools Month. Two schools that participated in the first FY20 pilot, Key Elementary School and DC Bilingual Public Charter School, were recognized by the U.S. Department of Education Green Ribbon Schools program in April 2021. Capital LEAF is proving to be an effective track for schools to receiv e federal recognition for green school efforts. DC Environmental Litera cy Plan In FY21, OSSE released the triennial update of the DC Environmental Literacy Plan in coordination with other District agencies., The Environmental Literacy Plan provides a framework for the District to ensure students will be prepared to make info rmed decisions concerning the environmental opportunities and challenges of the 21st century. Implementation of the Environmental Literacy Plan is a specific action item to achieve one of the education goals in the District's environmental sustainability s trategy, Sustainable DC Plan 2.0, plus the regional goals from the 2014 Chesapeake Bay Watershed Agreement. The District inter -agency workgroup that developed the updated plan transitioned to become the Environmental Literacy Advisory Committee. The committee will focus on \"strengthening and amplifying efforts and resources across the District so that students, schools, and families have access to opportunities that foster a thriving culture of health and environmental literacy.\" The committee will also re view progress with the plan and provide implementation recommendations. FY 2021 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 335 107. Please provide a school -level list of how many students have submitted a Universal Health Certificate to date in fiscal years 2021 and 2022 to date. ATTACHMENT: Q107 - Universal Health Certificates.xl sx Schools annually collect paper hardcopy Universal Health Certificates and share this collection data with OSSE via their Student Information System (SIS). These paper hardcopy forms are then given to a school nurse or sc hool health point of contact to be kept in a student's health record (DC Official Code \u00a7 38-651.08). If the school participates in the DC Health School Health Services Program (SHSP), the forms are documented by a Children's School Services (CSS) health su ite personnel (school nurse) in the student health record platform Health Office Anywhere. In the 2020- 21 school year, OSSE did not validate the Universal Health Certificate completion data received by the SIS. Due to schools collecting the Universal Heal th Certificates in paper hardcopy format, OSSE has learned from LEAs that there is a strong probability that schools have a higher number of these paper forms within their student health records, but they have not been fully entered by the schools in the S IS. OSSE will reexamine the data validation process to determine if Universal Health Certificates should be included for LEA data validation. As the public health authority and manager of the Health Office Anywhere data platform, DC Health can provide more information or data on Universal Health Certificates collected and maintained by CSS health suite personnel at the Council's request. Universal Health Certificate completion data continues to be low, due in part to a nationwide drop in annual child wellness visits due to the COVID -19 pandemic. OSSE, DC Health, and the Department of Healthcare Finance have supported schools and families in connecting with primary care to complete annual child wellness visits and to support immunization compliance, including temporarily opening all School -Based Health Centers to all District students for immunizations. It is not required for a student to submit a Universal Health Certificate to attend school, but it is required for a student to be compliant with their immunizations, per District law (DC Official Code \u00a7 38-502). However, it is the preferred method of sharing basic health information with schools. Although universal health certificates contain information on immunizations, it is not the sole source for information on immunization compliance. Immunizations are collected in the DOSES system maintained by DC Health; families may also submit hard copy vaccination records from their primary care providers. Compliance with immunization also includes whether a student has a medical or religious exemption which is not captured on a universal health certificate. In short, universal health certificate completion rates should not be viewed as a proxy for immunization compliance. FY 2021 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 336 108. Please provide the Committee with a n update on DCPS's food and nutrition education programming during fiscal year 2021 and 2022 to date. (a) How many schools participated in the program in fiscal year 2021, and how many are intended to participate in fiscal year 2022? Please share this breakdow n by ward. Was there more demand for participation from schools than funding levels would support? (b) How many schools have school gardens? Please provide this data broken down by ward . (a) Food & Nutrition program participation. To OSSE's knowledge, in FY21 a nd FY22, there was not more demand for DCPS food and nutrition education programing than funding levels would support. OSSE provides a variety of opportunities for food and nutrition education programming in schools, including through the school garden program, special annual celebrations and events, and the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program. To celebrate Growing Healthy Schools Month 2021, OSSE promoted outdoor learning activities to engage schools in the different themes of the Healthy Schools Act: Farm to School, School Gardens, School Meals, Environmental Literacy, and Physical Activity. Schools across DC were encouraged to use outdoor spaces for instruction and activities, as feasible and as weather permitted. Strawberries & Salad Greens Day celebrates seasonality in school meals and is designed to get students energized about the summer produce coming to their plate. OSSE looks forward to encouraging schools to serve locally grown strawberries and salad greens as part of school meals and to educate students about both the health and environmental benefits of eating locally grown fruits and vegetables during this event in FY22. The Fresh Fruit & Vegetable Program (FFVP) incorporates nutrition education while it increases students' exposure to fresh produce. To maintain access to the FFVP, including nutrition education, during the 2021 and 2022 fiscal years OSSE extended maximum federal and local flexibilities available for each school year including allowing the FFVP to be : served to students in a non- congregate setting (including home delivery) o provided to all children in the household regardless of age when provided along with meals via home delivery o provided to any child attending an elementary school that is operating an open meal site o picked up by a parent or guardian without a student being present served at a time the operators deem appropriate, including outside of a regular school day provided alongside other child nutrition program meals provided multiple days' worth of foods at one time when the school is providing multiple days' worth of meals at a time FY 2021 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 337 served at alternate non -elementary school sites if the elementary school building is closed or alternate instructional models are being provided. The following chart includes detail on the number of schools who participated in FFVP.

The School Garden Registration form is the primary tool to assess the state of school gardens . Due to the operational challenges presented by the COVID -19 public health emergency during school year 2020- 21, the School Health Profile data collection was cancelled that year. Additionally, data collection for the current school year is in progress and has not yet been validated. Thus, OSSE is providing the most recent School Health Profile available. Based on the most recent data from the 2019- 20 SHP, there were 62 DCPS and 48 public charter school campuses (110 total) with school gardens. According to the School Garden Registration for the same year, 35 DCPS and 26 public charter school campuses (61 total) reported using the garden to teach about nutrition. Additionally, 41 DCPS and 26 public charter school campuses (67 total) reported maintaining edible gardens. The table below reflects the SY19 -20 data.

FY 2021 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 342 Non-Public Tuition 110. Question #110 (a) Provide a narrative description on how the budget for Non -Public Tuition is formulated for each Fiscal Year. Which services are funded using this money for each student (i.e., tuition, transportation, etc.)? (b) What steps is OSSE taking to assist LEAs in providing students with a free appropriate public education and reducing the number of students who are served by non -public institutions? (a) Non-Public Tuition Budget formulation The budget for Nonpublic Tuition is establ ished based upon a review of expenditures from three prior years and any rate increases from the placement schools. The Nonpublic budget is responsible for funding the following costs: tuition, residential services, room and board, various related services (audiology, counseling, speech, physical therapy, occupational therapy, 1:1 aide, nursing), evaluations/assessments, and travel expenses to and from residential schools outside of the District. Education costs are funded in accordance with services as doc umented on the students' Individual Educational Program (IEP). (b) Steps taken to reduce number of students who are served by non- public intuitions If an LEA anticipates that a student may require a more restrictive nonpublic school placement, the LEA must notify OSSE to initiate the placement review. If at the conclusion of the placement process the IEP Team determines a nonpublic school is required, OSSE is responsible for identifying the school location (nonpublic school) for the student. If students are placed for non - educational reasons by other agencies, such as CFSA, DHCF, and DYRS, OSSE funds the educational portion of the placement through the Non- Public Tuition budget. OSSE coordinates the District's placement oversight process with LEAs, pare nts, and other District government child -serving agencies and community partners to ensure that all District students receive free appropriate public education (FAPE) in the Least Restrictive Environment (LRE). Since its inception, OSSE's placement oversight process has ensured timely guidance and support to IEP teams and LEAs in implementing/exhausting appropriate strategies and supports for children with disabilities before considering placement into a more restrictive separate school setting. This oversi ght process has helped to prevent inappropriate placements into nonpublic settings by supporting LEAs' ability to serve children in less restrictive public settings. Additionally, OSSE connects LEAs with OSSE -wide technical assistance and training support s, as needed. For example, through the placement process, should an LEA request additional training and technical assistance on behavioral intervention models, OSSE will share information about upcoming trainings on behavioral and social emotional support s/interventions, and/or provide an onsite consultation to support program design and implementation.
