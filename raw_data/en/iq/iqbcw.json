In 201 7, provisional data confirmed 1,441 overdose fatalities in New York City \u2014the deadliest year on record .1 Someone dies from a drug overdose in New York City every seven hours , and more people died from overdose in New York City in 201 7 than from suicide, homicide, and motor vehicle accidents combined .2 Since 2014, fentanyl, an opioid 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine , has driven the dramatic increase in overdose deaths. The opioid overdose epidemic in New York City persists d espite current efforts, which include availability of treatment services, collaborative interventions between public health and law enforcement , and increased access to the emergency overdose rescue medicine naloxone . Recognizing that opioid -involved overd ose deaths are preventable, the City has redoubled its efforts with a broad, multi -agency cross -sector approach known as HealingNYC . This comprehensive strategy aims to reduce opioid overdose deaths by 35 % by 2022. Key components of HealingNYC include : expand ed access to effective treatment; innovative methods of overdose prevention that reach individuals at high risk ; educat ion aimed at clinicians and communities to prevent substance misuse before it starts ; and using new methods to reduce the supply of drugs.3 As HealingNYC moves forward, the City maintains its commitment to deploying strategies grounded in science and to consider ing all evidence -based interventions that could prevent people from dying in the present overdose crisis. Supervised injection facilities (SIFs) are one public health strategy to reduce overdose deaths , infectious disease transmission, and public drug use. Supervised injection facilities offer hygienic spaces for people to inject drugs obtained offsite using sterile equipment under medical supervision . There are 100 SIF locations worldwide, including a recent expansion to three cities in Canada . In the United States, SIFs have not been implemented but are under consideration in at least five cities. Through co -location or referral, SIFs also provide people who inject drugs access to a range of health, substance use, and social services . As such, SIFs serve as an early entry point along the continuum of care for people with substance use disorders . Finally, SIFs have garnered support and endorsement from a range of professional health bodies, including the American Medical Association,4 the American Public Health Association,5 the International Drug Policy Consortium,6 and the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction.7 To explore the potential impact of incorporating supervised injection into City's opioid response strategy , the New York City Council provided funding to the New York Ci ty Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) to assess the feasibility of establishing a SIF. DOHMH began with a literature review to summarize the international experience with SIFs. Additionally, an Expert Advisory Panel comprised of national and international drug policy experts, scientists, and advocates was assembled to guide the study . A list of the Expert Advisory Panel members can be found in the Acknowledgments. 4 To explore the feasibility of SIFs in New York City, three key questions were addressed: 1. Would New Yorkers support supervised injection facilities ? The New York Academy of Medicine (NYAM) and DOHMH conducted structured focus group s and individual interviews regarding perspectives on supervised injection services with key community and institutional stakeholders . Participants represent ed a range of constituencies: law enforcement , health care, social and community services, faith traditions , business development, and harm reduction . Input from elected officials serving in New York City and State offices also was solicited. 2. What are the potential health and fiscal benefit s of a supervised injection facility to New York City ? Researchers at Weill Cornell Medical College projected the imp act of a supervised injection facility on opioid overdose deaths and direct health care expenditures in New York City , looking at emergency medical service usage, emergency department visits, and hospitalizations. A Technical Advisory Group composed of global leaders in supervised injection with expertise in economics, policy analysis, and clinical and behavioral sciences offered gu idan ce and oversight to this study. 3. What are the viable legal framework s within which New York City could establish a supervised injection facility ? A legal scholar from Columbia Law School assess ed the current legal barriers to the establishment of a supervised injection facility in New York City to identify potential avenues for implementation. This review assessed federal, state, and municipal criminal and civil laws and regulations that could be relevant to the establishment of a SIF in New York Cit y, as well as examples and lessons learned from other jurisdictions across the United States. The findings from this review support the feasibility of supervised injection facilities . Supervised injection is an evidence -based health intervention for people who inject drugs Scientific evidence suggests that SIFs \u2014like methadone maintenance treatment and syringe exchange programs established in response to the previous opioid and HIV/AIDS crises \u2014 prevent overdose and reduce the harms associated with injection drug use, including HIV and hepatitis C transmission. Supervised injection facilities provide support and connections to health and social services to marginalized individuals, particularly shelter residents , so people who inject drugs can reduce their risk of death and take positive steps toward healthier lives . In addition to the individual benefits, research from other jurisdictions shows that SIFs may lead to long -term reduc tions in individual -level drug use and community -level drug -related crime in areas where they are located , and thus save taxpayer dollars on health care and crime control. 5 Key community leaders recognize the benefits of and challenges to establishing supervised injection as a strategy to prevent overdose and reduce crime Findings from NYAM 's community assessment and DOHMH 's stakeholder interviews suggest that s upervised injection facilities have the support of many m edical , harm reduction, business, faith , community, and elected leaders . Stakeholders acknowledged the seriousness of the overdose crisis, the need for new solutions, and the functional approach of SIFs . Stakeholders particularly appreciated SIFs' role in linking participants to needed medical, social, and community services. Some stakeholders highlighted potential community concerns that SIFs could convey that drug use was being condoned or create geographic concentrat ions of people who inject drugs . These community concerns could lead to challenges with SIF placement , although these challenges may be mitigated through co-location within existing harm reduction services as part of the continuum of care. Almost all leaders and community representatives interviewed , however, acknowledged the public health and safety bene fits of supervised injection . Stakeholders emphasized that meaningful community engagement and education would be critical to the success of SIFs , particularly in any neighborhoods that could be selected for SIF placement. Additional engagement is needed to best capture all community perspectives, as current findings are limited to those who agreed to participate at the time of the study. Establishment of four s upervised injection facilities could conservatively avert up to 130 overdoses and save up to $7 million in public health care costs annually Results from the impact study conducted by Weill Cornell Medical College found that locating SIFs in four New York City neighborhoods most severely affected by fatal drug overdose could prevent up to 130 overdose deaths each year and reduce associated annual costs to the Ci ty health care system by up to $ 7 million. The estimates generated by this study are conservative, as they do not include reduction in crime or chronic disease treatment costs associated with injection drug use. The cost -savings of a SIF would be offset by the costs to operate a SIF. These costs would vary depending on the model and hours of operation. On the low end, a SIF could be implemented for $250,000 annually; on the uppe r end, a new, free standing facility with long hours could cost between $2 and $3 million . Legal establishment of supervised injection facilities in New York City is possible Findings from the legal review suggest that, d espite legal barriers, state and municipal options exist to establish one or more SIFs in New York City . Any avenue would require engaging d iverse representatives from public health, public safety, law enforcement, advocacy and community groups , and elected officials in the planning process . Taken together, these findings have led to a series of recommendations regarding the planning and implementation of a SIF to supplement New York City's comprehensive overdose prevention strategy . In particular, the recommendation s presented in this report aim to leverage New York City 's existing treatment and social service resources to integrate SIFs within established networks of care . A wide range of stakeholders in New York City support supervised injection as a strategy , but also acknowledge potential community 6 concerns in establishing supe rvised injection services. Our recommendat ions around SIFs build on the legacies of methad one maintenance treatment and early grassroots adoption of syringe exchange programs by health advocates, med ical and social service professionals, and scien tists in New York City. A dditionally, New York City has a strong network of health and social service agencies, and productive collaboration between the public health and public safety communit ies\u2014all essential partn ers to launch SIFs. What follows are detailed findings from the three commissioned studies, supplementary data collected by DOHMH, and a comprehensive review o f the existing body of scien tific evidence on supervised injection.

The majority of these deaths ( 66%) are caused by opioids, a drug class that includes prescription painkillers, heroin, and the highly potent synthetic compound fentanyl.8 The entire nation \u2014East and West, North and South, urban and rural \u2014has been touched by this crisis, which has shown no signs of slowing down. Like the rest of the country, New York City has experienced alarming increases in overdose deaths over the last 15 years. The number of d eaths from overdose in New York City have more than doubled since 2000 , with an increase of over 2.5 fold since 2010 . In 201 7, provisional data shows that 1 ,441 overdose fatalities ocurred in N ew York City, the highest number ever recorded. Over 80% of these deaths involved opioids.9 Someone dies every seven hours of overdose in N ew York City; there are more annual deaths from opioid overdose than from car crashes , suicides, and homicides combined. 10 Figure 1: Number of unintentional drug poisoning (ov erdose) deaths by year, New York City, 2000 - 201 7 Source: New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene , Unintentional Drug Poisoning (Overdose) Deaths Qu arters 1 -4, 2017, New York City, released April, 2018. 02004006008001000120014001600Number of overdose deaths1,441 overdose deaths deaths 8 Figure 2: Number of deaths from unintentional drug poisoning (overdose) compared to intentional self -harm (suicide), assault (homicide), and motor vehicle crashes in New York City, 2006 - 201 7 Source: New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, Unintentional Drug Poisoning (Overdose) Deaths Quarters 1 -4, 2017, New York City, released April, 2018.

Although prescription painkillers helped to drive the increase in the rate of overdose deaths in New York City f rom 2010 to 2011 , the proportion of overdose deaths involving opioid analgesics had decreased to 18% by 2016 , from a high of 35% in 2011 .11 Between 2011 and 2014 , a rise in heroin -involved overdoses drove the increases in overdose deaths . Beginning in 2015 , New York City has experienced the emergenc e of fentanyl , which was involved in nearly half (44%) of all overdose deaths by the end of 2016 .12 010002000 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017Number of deathsDeaths From Overdose Deaths From Suicide, Homicide, and Motor Vehicle Crashes1,441 overdose deaths 9 Fentanyl: A public health crisis Fentanyl is a highly potent synthetic opioid propelling drug overdose deaths to record numbers. While fentanyl is a prescription medication used for cancer -related pain or palliative care, non -pharmaceutical fentanyl has been introduced into illicit drug markets in New York City and nationally in recent years. Typically, fentanyl found in the illicit drug supply typically is not sourced from diverted prescriptions, but rather is produced in illicit laboratories and used as a common adulterant to heroin, cocaine, and counterfeit pills \u2014including opioid analgesics, such as oxycodone, and benzodiazepines, such as Xanax. The presence of fentanyl in illicit drugs puts people who use them at enormously increased risk of overdose.13 Fentanyl's potency is such that a small amount can induce overdose; as a fast -acting opioi d, overdoses involving fentanyl can occur within minutes of ingestion.14 Toxicology analyses indicate that fentanyl drove the increase in overdose deaths from 2015 to 2016. Deaths involving fentanyl have increased nearly every quarter since 2015, constituti ng almost half (44%) of all overdose deaths in 2016.15 The acceleration of overdose deaths since the introduction of non -pharmaceutical fentanyl in the New York City drug supply has brought a mutual recognition among the public health and safety communitie s that new and different strategies must be considered. Many people who inject drugs in New York City are aware of the risks of fentanyl and generally do not seek it out.16 Typically fentanyl is introduced into illicit drug mixes at the level of the suppli er. As a result, people who use drugs and street -level drug sellers are unlikely to know whether a certain product does or does not contain fentanyl.17, 18 Additionally, other non -pharmaceutical fentanyl analogues may not yet be identifiable by existing labo ratory tests.

However, certa in populations and neighborhoods bear a disproportionate burden of overdose deaths. Residents of both poor neighborhoods with endemic heroin - related issues and affluent neighborhoods with more recent heroin - and fentanyl -related issues experience some of the highest rates of opioid -involved overdose citywide. In 2016, Staten Island and th e Bronx experienced the highest rates of fatal overdose in New York City in 2016 (31.8 and 28.1 per 100,000 residents, respectively), over two times higher than residents of other boroughs. The largest numbers of deaths in 2016 occurred among residents of the Bronx and Brooklyn, with 308 and 297 deaths, respectively. The breadth of harm spans East Harlem in Manhattan, Hunts Point -Mott Haven in the Bronx, and South Beach -Tottenville in Staten Island, as well as neighborhoods in other boroughs. 19 Taken togeth er, these numbers illustrate the widespread but unequal burden across the city.

Unintentional Drug Poisoning (Overdose) Deaths in New York City, 2000 - 2016. New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene: Epi Data Brief (89); June 2017. Overdose death rates have increased dramatically among all racial groups from 2015 to 2016. In 2016, w hite New Yorkers experience d the highest rate (18.9 per 100,000) of heroin - and/or fentanyl -related overdose death citywide , followed by Latino /a New Yorkers (16.9 per 100,000); the rate among black New Yorkers was 12.3 per 100,000 .

Individuals who reside in shelters or are undomiciled are at increased risk of overdose. These individuals represented 7% of the overdose deaths in New York City in 2016, despite comprising less than 1 % of the C ity population. 20 Overdose is now the leading cause of death for this population , overtaking heart disease in FY 2014 .21 Furthermore, p eople who inject drugs in public or semi -public locations , many of whom are homeless or unstably housed, are at heightened risk of infectious disease transmission (HIV and hepatitis C) and other harms associated with injection drug use .22, 23 2015 2016 White and Black race categories exclude Latino ethnicity.

In March 2017, the City committed an additional $38 million annually over five years to fight overdose through HealingNYC, an innovative, multi -prong ed agenda focused on four areas. In March 2018, the City expanded HealingNYC by an additional $22 million annually .24 1. Prevent opioid overdose deaths 2009: DOHMH began to provide naloxone \u2014a medication used to the effects of an opioid overdose \u2014to sy ringe exchange programs and other registered opioid overdose prevention programs for distribution to laypeople to carry and respond to overdose . 2013: The New York City Police Department (NYPD) equip ped approximately 1,000 patrol officers in the precincts with the highest rates of opioid -involved overdose with naloxone. 2014: The New York City Fire Department (FDNY) equip ped emergency medical technicians and certified first responder firefighters with naloxone. FDNY reported using naloxone to rev erse over 180 overdoses per month in the second half of 2016. 2014: Correctional Health Services, a division of New York City Health + Hospitals (H+H), established one of the first jail -based naloxone distribution programs at the Rikers Island Visitor Center. As of September 30, 2017 , the program has distributed over 6,000 kits to the families and friends of incarcerated persons, who are at elevated risk of overdose following release from jail. 2015: The New York City Commissioner of Health authorized naloxone distribution by pharmacists under a non -patient specific prescription (standing order), and the medication is now available to laypeople without a personal prescription in over 725 pharmacies citywide. Naloxone is now effectively available over the counter. 2016: The New York City Department of Social Services (DSS ) trained all its shelter providers in naloxone administration to ensure 24/7 overdose prevention coverage in the City shelter system. As part of HealingNYC, New York City commit ted to: Distribute 65,000 naloxone kits in 100 services citywide, including, but not limited to: treatment, detoxification, harm reduction, and other programs serving at -risk New Yorkers and their families and loved ones Equip all 23,000 NYPD patrol officers with naloxone and train all officer s in overdose response 13 Distribute 5,000 naloxone kits annually through the Rikers Island Visitor Center program to directly target those individuals at increased risk Increase the number of pharmacies offering naloxone without a prescription to 1,000 Distr ibute 6,500 kits in City shelters and continue to train Department of Social Services shelter providers in naloxone administration 2. Prevent opioid misuse and addiction 2011: DOHMH developed New York City's judicious opioid prescribing guidelines, which served as the model for the guidelines issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in March 2016. DOHMH's guidelines subsequently were implemented in public hospital emergency departments and private hospitals throughout the city. 2013: DOHMH e mployed public health detailing methods \u2014delivering judicious prescribing, overdose prevention, and door -to-door treatment messaging to health care providers \u2014to reach nearly 900 health care providers on Staten Island . 2015 -2017: DOHMH expanded its door -to-door health care provider detailing efforts to over 1,000 providers in the Bronx and nearly 1,000 providers in Brooklyn. 2016 -2017: The City ran the \"I Am Living Proof,\" \"Save a Life, Carry Naloxone ,\" and \"I Saved a Life\" public awareness campaigns, its l argest drug treatment and overdose prevention public education campaigns to date. 2017: DOHMH launched Relay, a peer -based crisis intervention and overose prevention service for individuals in emergency rooms follow ing a nonfatal overdose event. At the time of HealingNYC's launch, t he program was operational in four hospitals across the city. As part of HealingNYC, New York City commit ted to: Create mental health clinics in high -need schools to address youth substance use and intervene early to prevent misuse and addiction before it starts Deliver targeted prevention and treatment messaging in primary care settings to communities at high risk of overdose Train 1,500 clinicians annually in judicious opioid prescribing to reduce overprescribing Expand Re lay to 1 5 emergency departments citywide 14 Public health detailing in New York City Public health \"detailing\" campaigns deliver critical education and prevention messaging directly to health care providers. Providers engage in one -on-one visits with DOHMH representatives during which they receive educational messages about the judicious prescription of opioid analgesic and benzodiazepine medications and means to reduce patient risk of overdose. Ju dicious prescribing messages recommend that prescribers utilize the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration necessary to reduce the risk of overdose or other harms. Detailing is a key component of the City's prevention strategy, reaching providers to help prevent substance misuse before it starts. 3. Connect New Yorkers to effective treatment 2007: Correctional Health Services, which operates the oldest jail -based methadone maintenance treatment program in the nation (since 1987), first introduced buprenorphine treatment to individuals detained at Rikers Island as p art of a research study. Rikers Island now offers access to both methadone and buprenorphine.25 Like methadone, buprenorphine is a medication that is highly effective in treating opioid us e disorder. 2016: DOHMH funded an innovative buprenorphine treatment model that supports nurse care managers (NCM) in seven primary care o rganizations that run federally qualified health centers. These NCM programs support primary care clinics and their clinicians to provide comprehensive substance use care for patients with buprenorphine treatment. As part of HealingNYC, New York City commit ted to: Train an additional 1 ,500 health care providers in buprenorphine prescribing, with a focus on engaging nurse practitioners and physician assistants, who are newly eligible to prescribe buprenorphine under federal law Expand the City's nurse care manager for buprenorphine treat ment model to provide case management services and increased patient adherence t o an additional seven federally qualified health centers Start addiction treatment and care management with buprenorphine prescribing in all New York City H+H primary care clin ics Establish buprenorphine induction, the first phase of maintenance, in at least 10 New York City emergency departments Embed buprenorphine maintenance treatment in up to seven harm reduction programs Transform the New York City H+H substance use care n etwork into a system of excellence in addressing harmful opioid use 15 Increase the daily number of patients in the New York City jail system receiving methadone to 600 and buprenorphine to 150 , and offer individualized treatment plans and connections to care for these patients upon release Engage health professional training programs and health systems leadership to cultivate workforce readiness and optimize responses to treatment needs Connect New Yorkers involved with the criminal justice system to substance use service s through the HOPE (Heroin Overdose Prevention and Education) Program Connect New Yorkers with substance use and mental health problems to necessary treatment services through by establishing Health Engagement and Assessment Team s (HEA T) 4. Reduce the supply of dangerous opioids 2012: DOHMH and the New York/New Jersey High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area launch ed New York City RxStat, a public health and safety working group comprised of over 25 City, State, and federal agencies that share information about overdose and strategize collaborative policies and interventions to reduce overdose death. RxStat has been hailed as a leading national model by Former President Obama's White House Office of National Drug Control Policy and the Un ited States Department of Justice. 2015: NYPD increased heroin seizures by 32% citywide. 2016: NYPD and the Staten Island District Attorney 's Office launched the Overdose Response Initiative to investigate overdose deaths to rapidly identify dealers, dis mantle distribution operations, and provide assistance to families and friends of overdose victims. As part of HealingNYC, NYC commit ted to: Increase laboratory and technology capacity at the NYPD and Office of the Chief Medical Examiner narcotics testing labs to identify new dangerous synthetic drugs and target supply reduction operations Expand the Overdose Response Initiative to more neighborhoods Add NYPD personnel to New York City airports, highways, and ports to disrupt the opioid supply at the level of trafficking 16 The continuum of care for people who use drugs The identification, diagnosis, care, and treatment of substance misuse and substance use disorders are part of a range of services available to people who use drugs. Termed the continuum of care, these services span multiple health care settings, from spec ific programs for substance use, like overdose prevention programs and opioid treatment programs, to medical settings such as hospitals, emergency care, and primary care that address individuals' general health needs. Providing a range of services with com plementary goals and capabilities allows people who use drugs to enter this continuum and receive care that matches their needs. Primary care, emergency medical systems, and hospitals can effectively leverage their high volumes of patient contact to iden tify substance use disorders and initiate treatment \u2014particularly medication for addiction treatment \u2014among patients at risk of overdose or other negative health outcomes. Practitioners in these settings can treat the complications of substance use disorders and provide connections and referrals to other parts of the continuum of care that would meet an individual patient's needs. Treatment for opioid use disorder is most effective when it includes the use of medication, termed medications for addiction trea tment (MATs). The best -studied medications are methadone and buprenorphine. Both medications have been shown to decrease the risk of death from overdose and increase the likelihood of individuals reducing or ceasing their drug use and improving their socia l and economic lives. These medications can be used as long -term treatment depending on individual need. Medications for addiction treatment also reduce the risk of HIV/AIDS, chronic hepatitis C infection, other health problems, and even engagement in crim inal activity. Harm reduction programs provide services and programing for people who use and inject drugs. These programs may include but are not limited to syringe exchange programs, support groups, and treatment services. Harm reduction programs aim to serve people who use drugs by providing connections to support services, such as housing, public benefits, education, or workforce programs. Supervised injection facilities provide a space for people who use and inject drugs to do so safely, in private s ettings with medical staff who can readily respond to an overdose. SIFs reduce other risks associated with injection, such as bloodborne disease transmission, and alleviate the threat of arrest and incarceration. On -site medical, substance use treatment, a nd social services allow individuals to receive an appropriate level of support . 17 A Legacy of Public Health I nnovation in New York City The current opioid overdose epidemic is not the first drug -driven health epidemic to necessitate an innovative public health response in New York City. New Yorkers have a recognized history of national leadership in responding to substance use and associated harms with scientifically grounded inno vative approaches that protect publ ic health. 1960s and 1970s New York City experienced its first large -scale increase in injection heroin use in the decades following World War II. By the 1960s, heroin -involved overdose was the leading cause of death among New Yorkers between the ages of 15 and 35, with 75 % of deaths in this age group attributed to heroin overdose.26 In response, the world's first methadone maintenance treatment program (MMTP) was established as a research pilot at Rockefeller University in 1964. Methadone is a medication that prevents withd rawal symptoms and reduces cravings for people with opioid use disorder. This groundbreaking pilot demonstrated the efficacy and safety of methadone as a long -term maintenance therapy. Over the next decade, MMTPs were institutionalized across the New York City health care system and prescribed to approximately 34,000 patients. Scientific evidence and rigorous evaluations indicating MMTPs' association with decreases in overdose, drug -related crime, and hepatitis transmission helped to push forward public and governmental acceptance and propel the treatment toward wider use.27 By the close of the 1970s, the heroin overdose epidemic declined in large part due to the expansion of methadone maintenance treatment.28 While methadone maintenance is now widely accepted as the standard of care for treating opioid use disorder, the intervention initially faced significant opposition. However, the combined efforts of scientists, health care professionals, advocates, and government led to the program that exists today. Appr oximately 30,000 people are currently enrolled in methadone maintenance treatment in New York City . 1980s and 1990s The second drug -driven epidemic New York City faced was the catastrophic rise of HIV/AIDS in the 1980s and early 1990s . By 1984, an estimated 100,000 people who inject ed drugs were infected with HIV in New York City , the highest disease concentration among people who injected drugs in the United States.29 Without access to sterile syringes , HIV was spreading and people were dying at ala rming rates , as sharing injection equipment and paraphernalia grea tly increases the risk of blood borne disease transmission . Advocates and health researchers identified lack of access to sterile syringes as a risk factor in disease transmission and advocat ed for increased access to sterile syringe s. This collaboration resulted in the founding of s yringe exchange programs (SEPs), now an accepted public health intervention despite initially vehement opposition in the 1980s. Opponents charged that syringe exchange programs condoned drug use and would lead to increased drug use and crime in communities. However, evaluations of SEPs in Europe 18 indicated the contrary: SEPs led to reductions in community drug use and crime and, most importantly, reductions in HI V transmission.30, 31 Despite the strength of this scientific evidence, governmental opposition to syringe exchange continued in the United States . Health advocates, unable to obtain licensure or approval to open a formalized service, distribute d syringes underground to quell the HIV epidemic .32 By the early 1990s, the scientific evidence was overwhelming that syringe exchange reduced HIV transmission. Proven effectiveness along with the mounting toll of AIDS, which took so many lives, spurred government to action. In May 1992, after a decade of advocacy by scientists and activists,33 the New York State Department of Health adopted emergency regulations to authorize the possession and distribution of syringes without a prescription. This emergenc y regulation was adopted into law in October 1993, and the first formal and legal syringe exchange pilot began in New York City, supported by a grant from the Foundation for AIDS Research (amfAR). An evaluation confirmed the pilot's effectiveness in reduci ng risk behavior and HIV infection, with no documented increases in injection drug use or negative impacts at the community level.34 As evidence of the health benefits of SEPs in New York City grew, more sites opened across the city and the scope of SEPs ex panded to offer a broad range of essential services, such as on -site medical care, substance use treatment, and housing placements. By the late 1990s, these programs were attributed with driving down the prevalence of HIV infection among people who inject drugs, and further, reducing HIV transmission to sexual partners.35 This momentum has continued; in 2001 New York State implemented the expanded syringe access program to make syringes available without a prescription in pharmacies and medical settings statewide. Syringe exchange programs remain a significant contibutor to the overall reduction in HIV cases in New York City .36 Although syringe exchange has become institutionalized in New York City, the intervention remains contested in some jurisdictions acr oss the United States and to date remains illegal in 23 states. Indiana \u2014one state where syringe exchange is illegal \u2014experienced an outbreak of HIV infections in 2015 in rural communities of people who inject drugs. Researchers quickly linked the outbreak d irectly to unsafe and unhygienic injection practices. Deeply held opposition to syringe exchange among Indiana government officials and national coverage of the outbreak reopened a public debate about the intervention. Proponents urged state leaders to lif t the ban on syringe exchange. Opponents eventually permitted the practice temporarily on an emergency order from the governor. In the year between detection of the outbreak and the opening of syringe exchange, nearly 200 individuals in Scott County tested positive for HIV, compared with only five HIV diagnoses in the county between 2004 and 2013. Following the implementation of syringe exchange in the affected counties, the pace of infection slowed and the outbreak was contained .37 2000s and 2010s The curr ent opioid epidemic in the United States began more than 15 years ago, driven by the aggressive marketing of opioid analgesic medications by the pharmaceutical industry. The epidemic has escalated since 2010, particularly due to demand for heroin and more recently the introduction of fentanyl into the illicit drug supply. As a result of fentanyl, drug 19 overdose deaths are at unprecedented levels nationally and in New York City. While new health and safety resources have been devoted to overdose prevention at the local, state, and federal levels, the sheer magnitude of this epidemic has compelled scientists, health experts, professional societies, and advocates in the United States to reassess how to address substance use. Among the range of additional strateg ies under discussion are SIFs, which have been shown to reduce overdose deaths in people who are most vulnerable, including people who are unstably housed .38 Supervised injection facilities were established in Europe in 1992. This model has been adopted widely in Europe \u2014initially in Switzerland, Germany, and the Netherlands \u2014as well as more recently in Australia and Canada. Supervised injection facilities now operate in more than 10 countries. Abundant scientific evidence supports the effectiveness of SIFs to reduce deaths and other health consequences of injection drug use while facilitating access to the continuum of care. At the same time, the data refutes concerns that SIFs would cause increases in drug use or crime. Based on this information, many advo cates and professional health bodies publicly support the establishment of SIFs and ask that local and state governments implement this strategy as a lifesaving measure. In response, legislation, new policy, or studies are in progress in Colorado, Maryland , Maine, Massachusetts, New York City and Ithaca, Philadelphia, San Francisco, and Seattle . 20 WHY SUPERVISED INJECTION FACILITIES ? A Review of the E vidence Supervised injection facilities are one of many overdose prevention strategies available to public heath authorities. They have been shown to improve individual and community health, increase public safety, and reduce the health and social consequences of injection drug use through medically supervised use of injected substances. Supervised injection facilities offer hygienic spaces where people who inject drugs can inject pre -obtained substances with sterile equipment. Medically trained staff are on -site to respond to potential overdose events, although these staff do not assist with injection. Most established SIFs refer or provide access to a host of on -site health, mental health, substance use, and social services that supplement existing harm reduction and syringe exchange services through increased opportunities for engagement, education, and treatm ent. Approximately 100 SIFs operate in 10 countries and 67 cities worldwide , with six additional facilities scheduled to open across Europe and Canada over the next two years .39 Although no SIFs exist in the United States, a number of jurisdictions have an nounced intentions to open or explore the possibility of opening these facilities, including Colorado, Maryland, Maine, Massachusetts, Seattle, San Fran cisco, and Ithaca , New York . A growing body of scientific evidence , generated primarily though evaluations of existing facilities , suggest s the safety and effectiveness of SIFs . To date, no fatal overdose has been documented in a SIF anywhere in the world.40, 41 Supervised injection facilities reduce overdose mortality and associated harms Community impact studies conducted in Vancouver, Canada, have found reductions in fatal overdose of up to 35% in communities where SIFs are located.42 Evaluations of a SIF in Sydney, Australia, have demonstrated reductions of up to 80% in overdose -related emergency m edical service calls in areas surrounding SIFs.43 The safe and \"low -threshold \"* access to safer injection, overdose prevention, health care , and drug treatment services provided by SIFs are associated with decreases in risk -taking behavior among consistent SIF visitors and reductions in the harms associated with public injection .44 Supervised injection facilities improve access to health care and social services People who use drugs may face stigma that can create barriers to accessing medical and mental health care and social services.45 By offering on-site medical services, SIFs increase access to routine primary care for people who inject drugs and facilitate s linkages to ancillary services.46, 47 Evaluation of Vancouver's SIF found that on-site and referred * That is, minimal barriers to entry, free, and with few or no demands on the individual in exchange for the service. 21 medical services provided to SIF visitors reduced the length of their hospital stays and improved overall health .48 Supervised injection facilities reduce injection -related health risks By providing sterile injection equipment and a safe space to inject , SIFs can further reduce transmission of blood borne infections, including HIV and hepatitis C (HCV ). Conservative estimates from Vancouver suggest that a single SIF can prevent up to 35 new cases of HIV per year.49, 50 Supervised injection facilities also have been shown to reduce bacterial infections associated with non -sterile injection equipment.51 Supervised injection facilities , as well as syringe exchange programs, educate clients about safer injection techniques and proper syringe disposal , which disseminate through networks of people who inject drugs and can lead to increased community use of safe and hygiene techniques.52 Research indicates that individuals who inject in public or semi -public locations are at heightened risk of injection -related health complications since their injection is often rushed out of fear of being sighted, interrupted or arrested . Rushed injections increase risk s of using non - sterile equipment, developing and spreading infections , and overdosing. As the majority of individuals who inject publicly are homeless or unstably housed,53, 54 SIFs are particularly well -suited to meet the needs of this high -risk and underserved population. Supervised injection facilities increase referrals to drug treatment Supervised injection facilities , like other harm reduction services, have been shown to increase referrals to and uptake of drug treatment and detoxification and, over time, are associated with drug use cessation.55-57 These findings serve as an importan t reminder that SIFs, harm reduction, and treatment are all points along a continuum of care for people who use drugs. Supervised injection facilities provide outreach, engagement, and care to marginalized populations Supervised injection facilities function as spaces to engage and connect marginalized or disco nnected populations with health care , harm reduction, and other social services . Research has demonstrated that SIFs may function as safe havens for women who inject drugs, thereby reducing vio lence against women associated with street -based drug use.58 Similar findings have shown increased engagement with homeless or unstably housed young adults , a group at elevated risk of overdose and infectious disease transmission.59 Supervised injection facilities reduce health care expenditures Evaluations of SIF sites worldwide have demonstrated annual savings of up to $3.5 million per site in averted HIV and HCV treatment costs.60 Other estimates suggest savings of up to $18 million over a 10 -year period based on the number of averted overdose deaths .61 Supervised injection facilities do not increase crime or drug use A number of studies , reviewed below, have examined whether SIFs have negative effects on communities, including increase d crime, drug use, or concentrations of people who use drugs in the neighbor hood in which a SIF is located. The potential for SIFs to have negative effects on communities is one of the most frequent concerns raise d. 22 Some opponents of supervised injection have suggested that SIFs increase drug -related crime in areas where they are located. While this may seem like an intuitive conclusion given that drug use remains illegal in the United States, research from Vancouver, Canada, observed decreases in a range of drug -related crimes follo wing the establishment of a SIF, including decreases in drug sales, drug solicitations, and public injection.62 Research from Sydney, Australia, demonstated decreases in public perception of public injection, discarded syringes, and drug -related crime.63 Other studies evaluating the effects of SIFs on their surrounding communities in Sydney have shown declines in ve hicle break -ins and auto theft and neutral effect s on levels of drug trafficking, assault, or robbery in communities with SIFs .64, 65 Opponents of SIFs have also suggested that these services promote drug use and discourage treatment . However, evidence from Vancouver, Canada , suggests that SIFs reduce drug use in neighborhoods where they are located , by providing engagement and connections to harm reduction and drug treatment services.66 SIFs can serve as an entry point into the continuum of care and lead to reductions in drug use and drug -related health and social consequences .67 As reported above, SIFs increase participation in drug treatment and are associated with long -term drug use cessation. 68, 69 Additionally, some opponents of supervised injection facilities have suggested that these services may facilitate initiation into substance use or substance use injection , particular ly among youth . Like syringe exchange programs, most SIFs are not accessible to individuals under age 18 . Research has shown, however, that the majority of SIF clients are long -term injectors, with an estimated average injecting history of 16 years.70 Additionally, SIFs reduce the number of publicly -discarded syringes in communities where they are located and thus reduce community exposure to injection drug use.71, 72 This reduced community exposure to drug use can function as a prevention measure, particularly as SIFs are often situated in areas with high concentrations of public drug use, drug -related activity , and crime . Opponents of SIFs have expressed concerns that these services may draw large numbers of people who use drugs into communities where they don't live . However , research has shown that the majority of indivi duals who use SIF services are not likely to travel more than 20 minutes to a given facility.73-76 Existing SIFs have been located in areas with high densities of drug use and overdose and function as a targeted health intervention for these communities. Furthermore, this same concern arose in reaction to the early implementation of syringe exchange pr ograms and was disproved through evaluation of SEPs. 23 WOULD NEW YORKERS SUPPORT SUPERVISED INJECTION FACILTIES ? Community S upport fo r and C once rns about S upervised Injection To assess the opinions of key stakeholders regarding the feasibility of opening a supervised injection facility in New York City, the New York Academy of Medicine (NYAM) and the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) jointly conducted a community assessment. The assessment included focus groups and interviews wi th a range of key stakeholders across the city. Findings are limited to those who agreed to participate in the focus groups and interviews; several key stakeholders who have been vocal critics of supervised injection were unavailable at the time of the stu dy. Additional engagement is need to best capture all community perspectives. An Expert Advisory Panel comprised of national and international experts in supervised injection \u2014including leading epidemiologic and economic researchers, experts in drug policy and law, and advocates \u2014 drew on research and implementation exertise to help identify stakeholder groups and provide input into the study design and interview materials. A list of Expert Advisory Panel members can be found in the Acknowledgments. The asses sment occurred in two parts. First, focus groups were conducted with a total of 52 people who use drugs to investigate if and how a SIF could meet the needs of this unique and at -risk population in New York City . These focus group participants were asked a bout their willingness to use a SIF, preferences regarding the types of services offered, suggestions about the operational components of a facility, and perceived benefits and concerns about SIFs. Second, focus groups and individual interviews were conducted with a range of stakeholders across New York City , including : Elected officials Law enforcement officials Health care providers Community leaders Faith leaders Business community representatives Harm reduction program staff and management The interviews and focus groups with the above stakeholder groups \u2014which capture d the perspectives of 71 individuals separate from the sample of people who use drugs \u2014aimed to solicit opinions regarding community need for supervised injection services, gather concerns about possible health or safety consequences that may be associated with a SIF, and identify operational components of a SIF that communities consider essential . 24 Findings from both sets of focus groups and interviews are presented below. People who use drugs : Perspectives on supervised injection Between December 2016 and March 2017, researchers from NYAM conducted six focus groups with a total of 52 people who use drugs. Participants were recruited from harm reduction programs in the Bronx, Brook lyn, and Manhattan. Researchers obtained informed consent from all individuals prior to participation. F ocus groups were conducted anonymously and confidentially ; no identifying information was obtained . Focus groups were audio -recorded and fully transcrib ed for analysis. P articipants received a $25 honorarium for their time. At the beginning of each focus group , participants completed a short written demographic questionnaire \u2014the results of which are presented in Figure 6. Following the demographic survey , researchers provided an overview of SIFs , including photographs and/or videos of existing facilities to demonstrate what SIFs look like in practice. Researchers utilized an open -ended interview schedule to guide the remainder of the focus group. Interviews broadly probed: participant perceptions on supervised injection facilities , including individuals' willingness to atten d or consider attending such a facility; operational aspects of supervised injection facilities , including facilitators and barriers to access; and perceived benefits and concerns about SIFs that might affect people who use drugs.

Health and safety benefits A number of participants discussed the fear they experience while injecting in publ ic: fear s of being seen, interrupted, or arrested; and notably the f ear of death due to injection alone or in a clandestine location. Many participants considered supervised injection a viable means of allevia ting that fear. \"You have staff there tha t's going to look out for you and make sure that you don't overdose. In your own car, you can overdose and nobody is there.\" \u2014Person who uses drugs Participants also described SIFs as potential safe spaces for people at risk of victimization, including women and homeless people. This function of SIFs was of particular importance, as some participants had experienced victimization as a result of high -risk public use. The covert nature of public injection demands that individuals rush the injection proces s, which can lead to injury or further harm. Participants perceived s upervised injection facilities as one means to prevent rushed injection. \"I think supervised injection is excellent for people that are homeless don't have nowhere to go. They're constan tly going to bathrooms and going, you know, places where they're not welcome. People don't make them welcome. People barging in, and sometimes it'll hurt. There are injuries to your arm or something.\" \u2014Person who uses drugs 26 Additionally, participants emph asized that, contrary to popular perception, people who use drugs care very much about their health and share information regarding health issues within their drug -using social networks. Many participants framed SIFs as a means of bringing together a commu nity striving toward health . \"It gets very macabre and lonely to be alone and shooting up, drinking . . . Having a place to go where there's others around me, it could be uplifting and not only save my life if I were to overdose, but save my life in other ways. \" \u2014Person who uses drugs Service integration and site design Participants overwhelmingly emphasized the need for any supervised injection facility to offer on -site or linkages to health care and supportive social services. Noting that SIFs would targ et people who inject drugs publicly , participants \u2014many of whom were street homeless or precariously sheltered \u2014described access to housing and basic medical and psychiatric services as a critical component of a SIF. \"Safe injection, safe needles, doctors, psychiatrists, case workers, housing . The SIF has to incorporate those in, you know, to make things work.\" \u2014Person who uses drugs Regarding site design, participants discussed a need for consistent operational hours to engage and build rapport with client s as well as encourage regular service use. Early morning operating hours were presented as necessary to facilitate withdrawal management for people who use opioids. Late night hours were suggested as preventive safeguards against sexual assault and other forms of violence \u2014particularly violence against women \u2014that may more likely occur at night.77 \"Being a female, I would personally prefer something with middle of the night hours, that would be t he ultimate safe place for me. I don't know how strong it is wh at I'm using. I don't know how my body is going to react to that particular shot. I really would like to be somewhere totally safe , specifically within the you know timeframe of like , you know , 12 to five, 12 to four . \" \u2014Person who uses drugs Community stigma and resistance Most participants anticipated opposition to supervised injection facilities within their communities , with many individuals linking this perceived opposition to pervasive stigma against people who use drugs . Most participants recounted personal experiences of stigma associated with their drug use from family members, medical providers, community members , or even strangers . The stigma these marginalized individuals described led them to a reflexive assumption that the community would be opposed. \"Stigma is life. Stigma is real. We stigmatize each other and we don't even realize it. And that's a shame, because we get enough from society, you know what I'm saying. We really 27 need to be very mindful about the words that we use and the way that we refer to somebody who is just as human as the next person. Whether I use or not is irrelevant.\" \u2014Person who uses drugs New York City stakeholders: Perspectives on supervised injection Between January and December of 2017, six focus groups and 39 individual interviews were conducted with a total of 71 stakeholders representing the following disciplines, backgrounds, and interests: State and local elected officials; law enforcement officials; health care providers specializing in psychiatry, primary care, emergency medicine, correctional health, addiction medicine, infectious disease, and pharmacy; faith leaders representing the Buddhist, Christian, Islamic, and Jewish traditions; business leaders and small business owners; harm reduction pro gram staff and management; and local community leaders. A breakdown of stakeholders by category is presented in Figure 8 . Figure 8 : New York City stakeholders (n=71) Business leaders and small business owners 8 Elected officials 8 Faith leaders 8 Harm reduction staff and management 23 Health care providers 7 Law enforcement officials 7 Local community leaders 10 Stakeholders were solicited for interviews by represe ntatives from DOHMH and/or NYAM, and all interviewees were assured of both organizational and personal confidentiality. Focus groups and interviews were conducted using a structured interview guide that probed perceived benefits and harms to communities and individuals that ma y result from SIFs, as well as opinions on what features or services would be crucial to include in a potential SIF. Consistent with the interviews with people who use drugs, at the start of the interviews stakeholders were presented with background information about SIFs, which included a fact sheet with results from studies and eva luations of SIFs worldwide and photographs and/or videos of existing facilities . Audio recording was used at the researcher s' discretion. At every interview, a designated scribe took detailed notes . Demographic information was not collected at stakeholder interviews, and s takeholders did not receive compensation. 28 Figure 9: Supervised injection facility, Sydney, Australia Photo courtesy New York Academy of Medicine Four themes emerged during analysis: health benefits; safety benefits; safety and community concerns ; and site design and community integration. Health benefits Across all stakeholders, there was broad agreemen t that reducing fatal overdose was a critical need for their communities and New York City. Stakeholders generally acknowledged the seriousness of the overdose crisis and the need for new solutions . Regardless of whether stakeholders felt that SIFs were ri ght for New York City, they n early all acknowledged that supervised injection is one evidence -based public health strategy that could help avert overdose deaths . \"The idea of SIFs is creative but scary. A part of me says this is the wrong direction, but not really, because there are so many people dying and in need.\" \u2014Elected official Some stakeholders \u2014health care providers and harm reduction program staff, in particular \u2014viewed SIFs as an important step along the continuum of care for people who use drug s and believed that engagement with these services could help individuals move toward stability, health, and well -being. A number of health care providers considered SIFs particularly important for individuals who might not be ready to fully curtail their drug use and would otherwise be excluded from programs for which abstinence is a requirement. Stakeholders who expressed this opinion generally viewed SIFs as an effective form of overdose pre vention and patient engagement \u2014a way to keep people who use drug s alive so that they may one day access treatment 29 \"I think what people find the most challenging about caring for people who use drugs, is that our [ health care facility's] model doesn't allow for continued drug use to be in care with us. And so, we have to sometimes coerce or force a model onto a patient that isn't where they're at in order for us to stay in a relationship.\" \u2014Health care provider Safety benefits A number of stakeholders described a need for services that would reduce public injection and publicly discarded syringes, which they view ed as hazards to public safety. M ost agreed that SIFs were one strategy to achieve these goals. The issue of community safety was particularly salient among members of the business community, a number of whom described some of the prior problems they had experienced with public injection and public overdose in local places of business. These individuals were prim arily interested in whether SIFs would reduce high -risk drug use occurring in public and semi -public settings, with many expressing the belief that moving public use into a private setting under medical supervision would benefit both the community and the individual using the drugs. \"Often, a barista will be [at the caf\u00e9] by themselves at night, and [a person who injects drugs] will use the bathroom, and then they'll sit down in the caf\u00e9 and usually just be falling asleep or nodding out. It's of concern because the staff isn't equipped to deal with that, and it's upsetting to other customers, but it's also a concern to the person's health. I think that [a SIF] is the best possible solution.\" \u2014Small business owner Some law enforcement officials viewed SIF s as potential cost -saving tools. When provided with the evidence demonstrating localized decreases in both public drug use and associated nuisance crimes following the est ablishment of a SIF, these stakeholders framed the intervention in pragmatic, monetary terms. Even if they held reservations about supervised injection, the possibility of reduced crime and criminal justice expenditures functioned as a convincing argument for support. \"If SIFs give us less crime, less public drug use, and less vulnerability among drug users, police will save enforcement resources. We need to enforce the law, but we also need to try things we haven't before.\" \u2014Law enforcement official \"At the end of the day, it's about serving the people. People who use drugs are real people with real needs .\" \u2014Elected official Safety and community concerns While concerns about SIFs were most frequently offered by law enforcement, all stakeholders highlighted potential community concerns. First was the concern that supervised injection could be perceived as condoning injection drug use, which remains 30 illegal in New York State. Some stakeholders framed the implementation of SIFs as potential ly negligent , given the increased overdose risks posed by fentanyl. \"I'm concerned that we're arming people with the potential to kill themselves. The X factor is what's in the needle.\" \u2014Law enforcement official \"We spend a lot of time trying to convince people that addiction is an illness. SIFs are almost a bridge too far. It could have a terrible backlash.\" \u2014Law enforcement official Other stakeholders raised the concern that areas around a SIF might create new drug markets in known locations and create geographic concentrations of people who inject drugs. This perception could lead to challenges with SIF placement and generate pushback from community members on the grounds that SIFs might bring new people who inject drugs into their neighborhoods . \"Automatically you'll have a fear issue. 'Don't you dare put that in my backyard.' Needles? They'll say, 'Oh my god, they're bad people.' Not that ' people who use drugs are suffering. '\" \u2014Local community leader A handful of stakeholders raised the concern that their communities feel overburdened by services for vulnerable populations and noted that community members were likely to oppose a SIF on that basis. These stakeholders emphasized that their commun ities had entrenched problems with regard to affordable housing, homelessness, workforce development, and education that, for some individuals in their neighborhoods, might supersede the needs of people who use drugs. Stakeholders emphasized that SIFs coul d garner support in some communities by addressing some of these needs in addition to offering overdose prevention and drug use services. \"It's going to be hard to convince people that it works. We can't even put supportive housing in the neighborhood, be cause of the stigma surrounding the people who might occupy it.\" \u2014Elected official Some stakeholders, particularly more experienced elected officials and harm reduction professionals, connected the current national debate about supervised injection with t he history of syringe exchange programs. These stakeholders recollected that similar concerns were discussed widely in advance of the formal implementation of SEPs in the 1990s. They noted that the political risk taken to implement SEPs ultimately benefitt ed the health and safety of both individuals who use SEPs and their broader communities by reducing HIV transmission. \"We don't want to replicate the battle we fought about needle exchange. We need to educate the public about the benefits: HIV reduction and overdose prevention.\" \u2014Elected official 31 Site design and community integration The majority of stakeholders suggested integrating supervised injection into established harm reduction facilities rather than launching new facilities. They d escribed a number of perceived benefits of co -location within harm reduction programs : established credibility, relationships, and trust with the surrounding communities and law enforcement; existing on-site buprenorphine treatment services; existing on -site health and social services to provide care and expedite and ease referrals; and existing expertise about injection drug use and compassion for people who use drugs. Some stakeholders also suggested that integration into harm reduction services could hel p assuage the concern that SIFs would draw new people who use drugs to their neighborhood, as there is a substantial anticipated overlap in use between syringe exchange and supervised injection. \"It's a perfect idea to have the SIFs in the back and have t he rest of the services out front. Whatever people need they can just get.\" \u2014Harm reduction professional Stakeholders overwhelmingly agreed that a successful SIF ought to include co -located health and social services . Individuals who are homeless and people who inject drugs in public often are disconnected from health care , substance use treatment, housing, and broader social services. Co -locating these services with in SIFs would allow immediate connections to be made. In particular, as SIFs sit a t the early engagement end of the continuum of care for people who use drugs, on-site or immediate access to drug treatment services would allow individuals who feel ready to reduce or cease drug use to do so immediately . \"We can't just say over and over what a tragedy overdose is and do nothing about it. I like the idea of a holistic approach to help people try to get better.\" \u2014Law enforcement official Nearly all stakeholders agreed that the success of a SIF was predicated on proactive relationship -build ing between harm reduction program staff, medical providers, law enforcement, and local community groups. This would involve preparatory outreach with local police precincts to provide education on basic tenets of harm reduction and the intended function a nd goals of the planned SIF. A successful model for this outreach exists as part of the trust -building that has occurred between SEPs and local law enforcement. Likewise, the SIF planning process must acknowledge, consider, and incorporate the needs of police working with people who use drugs. A broad coalition of the stakeholders in this assessment should be involved early in the planning and implementation processes for establishing a SIF . \"I would welcome this in my district, but the community engage ment piece is critical. You need to start laying the groundwork now, because this will be contentious.\" \u2014Elected official 32 \"Are you going to find resistance? Yes. Are you going to need to educate? Absolutely. It will be important to emphasize SIFs as one o f many approaches to prevent overdose deaths.\" \u2014Local community leader 33 WHAT WOULD NEW YORK CITY GAIN FROM SUPERVISED INJECTION FACILITIES ? Estimating the Health and Fiscal I mpacts of Supervised Injection in New York City Weill Cornell Medical College conducted a study to estimate the overdose prevention and public cost saving impacts of supervised injection in New York City. The study aimed to develop neighborhood -specific estimates for overdose deaths prevented, given the wide variation in mortality among different neighborhoods . Short -term cost savings estimates were developed by identifying key areas of public health care expenditures that could experience reductions from SIFs, including emergency medical services, emerg ency departments, and inpatient hospitalizations. A brief review of the estimated impact is presented below. Full text of the report prepared by Weill Cornell, including the methods and results, can be found in Appendix B. As part of the planning and exec ution of this impact analysis, a Technical Advisory Group of five global experts in supervised injection provided guidance to Weill Cornell on methods, analysis, and findings at key intervals across the life of the study between March and June 2017 . Members of the Technical Advisory Gr oup contributed a range of expertise across economics, policy analysis, and the c linical and behavioral sciences. All members have extensive experience in the evaluation of SIFs internationally. To generate the the number of overdoses avoided, researchers developed a model that accounted for the neighborhood -level number of death and the proportion of people who inject drugs who are willing to travel to and use a SIF , drawn from the New York City Injection Drug User Health Alliance Survey, 2013 -2014 and 2014 -2015 . They used this model to estimate the impact of up to four supervised injection facilities on opioid overdose fatalities , assuming unrestricted hours of operation and capacity . Additionall y, researchers estimated the direct health care cost savings in New York City. Using New York City data of emergency department visits and hospitalizations, and emergency services costs, researchers developed a model of direct health care costs saved by implementation of a SIF. Where data was unavailable, best estimates from the literature were used. Findings from the study suggest that implementing supervised injection would contribute to reductions in overdose mortality and savings in di rect health care expenses. 34 Supervised injection facilities could prevent between 67 and 130 overdose deaths annually in New York City Conservative estimates indicate that establishing supervised injection services in four of the neighborhoods with the highest rates of overdose death would prevent between 67 and 130 overdoses annually, dependent on the number and location of SIFs established . Opening a single SIF in the neighborhood with the highest rate of overdose death citywid e is projected to prevent between 19 and 37 opioid overdoses annually. These lives saved would represent a substantial reduction in the overall impact on citywide overdose. Given that the estimates presented here are conservative, it is possible that reduc tions in overdose will exceed these estimates . Supervised injection facilities are designed to serve individuals most in need. Individuals who are homeless or unstably housed may be most likely to inject in public or semi -public settings . In New York City , people who are homeless die of overdose at a rate more than six times that of the general population .78 As SIFs directly target this group, it is likely that the projected reductions in overdose would in large part benefit people who inject drugs , are homeless , and are marginalized for other reasons . Supervised injection facilities could save between $1 and $7 million annually in New York City direct health care expenditures Opioid overdose costs the New York City health care system an estimated $ 50 million annually on emergency medical service calls, emergency department visits, and hospitalizations . Establishing a single SIF in a neighborhood heavily affected by opioid overdose could save the City $ 1 million annually in direct health care expense s. Establishing four SIFs in the most impacted neighborhoods could save up to $ 7 million annually in avoidable acute health care costs . Acute health care is short -term treatment of severe or brief illnesses and injuries, as opposed to chronic care which involves long -term treatment of ongoing conditions. Estimates suggest that SIFs could generate $4 to $6 million in annual net savings . 35 The above estimated cost savings to the health care system are conservative, as additional areas of substantial anticipated cost saving were not included due to limitations in New York City -specific health data. However, e valuations of SIFs from other jurisdictions have shown additional savings drawn fro m the following public benefits: Supervised injection facilities reduce HIV and HCV treatment costs by preventing transmission through acce ss to safe and sterile injection services.79 Supervised injection facilities connect individuals to cost -effective addiction treatment s.80 Treatment with methadone or buprenorphine ha s been demonstrated to reduc e overdose and the financial burden of overdose.81 Supervised injection facilities reduce the high cost of treating skin and soft tissue infections associated with unsafe injection practices. Skin and soft tissue infections are prone to complications and often require lengthy and costly hospita l admissions to treat successfully .82 The anticipated $1 to $7 million saved exclude s the law enforcement and criminal justice costs associated with overdose response. Operating a supervised injection facility could cost a minimum of $ 250,000 annually DOHMH estimate d the operating costs of a supervised injection facility, considering staffing, supplies, and siting. Locating a SIF within an existing harm reduction service Up to $7 million Up to 130 overdose deaths 36 would require substantially lower costs than a freestanding facility, given that th is configuration could eliminate the majority of new overhead and leverage existing and funded on-site services, treatment , and referral networks. In this estimate, a SIF would require annual costs between $ 250,000 and $ 500,00 0, depending on hours of operation, and service and staffing models. Opening a new, freestanding facility would demand subst antially higher operating costs. In this estimate, a SIF could require annual operating expenses of up to $ 2 to $3 million , most of which are associated with infrastructure and capital costs. 37 HOW COULD NEW YORK CITY IMPLEMENT SUPERVISED INJECTION FACILITIES ? Viable L egal Frameworks for Supervised I njection Facilities in New York City To evaluate potential legal pathways and challenges to SIFs in New York City, Columbia Law School Associate Professor Kristen Underhill conducted a review of relevant federal, state, and municipal criminal and civil laws and regulations. A summary of legal issues relevant to the establishment or operation of SIFs in New York City is presented below. Full text of the legal review can found in Appendix C . Despite the growing recognition and support in public health for the need for expanded harm reduction services to help reverse the course of the opioid epidemic, federal and state criminal laws present significant risks to the operat ors of SIFs. The clearest avenue for establishing SIFs would be to changes federal law to allow SIFs to operate and provide SIF clients, staff, and owners with exemptions from federal criminal law . Nevertheless, state legislation or administrative action would also offer some protection, but still leave clients, staff, operators and landlords of SIFs vulnerable to federal prosecution. Existing Federal legislation The F ederal Control led Substances Act (CSA) poses a number of constraints to operating a SIF, including its prohibitions on individual drug possession and on organizations or spaces that facilitate drug use (colloquially known as the \"crack house statute\").83 Supervised injection facility clients, operators, and staff could be at risk of arrest and prosecution under the CSA, although the enforcement of these statutes are at the discretion of federal authorities. Penalties may include fines of up to $500,000 for individua ls, $2 million for institutions, and imprisonment. In addition, any property used to commit a CSA violation is subject to forfeiture, that is, the property could be transferred to the U.S. Attorney General, who may then sell it or transfer it. Profession al staff licensed by the state are also at risk of disciplinary proceedings if convicted of a federal or state felony. No federal prosecutions of harm reduction facilities on the basis of participants' on-site drug use have occurred under the CSA to date . A state or locally sanctioned program that explicitly supervises drug consumption would be a legal first in the United States, and it is difficult to predict how federal prosecutors might respond. Additionally, federal agencies and Congress have the auth ority to prevent the use of federal funding to support SIFs, although no such restrictions exist currently.84 38 State legislation The New York State Legislature has the authority to authorize SIFs by statute, and could do so either with a freestanding law, or with an extension to the current state law authorizing SEPs.85 Although state legislation would not safeguard SIFs against the F ederal C SA, the state legislative pathway provides the greatest legal security with respect to state and local law. Legislation authorizing a SIF could simultaneously amend or provide exemptions from state laws on possession, paraphernalia, criminal injection, criminal nuisance, and professional misconduct to protect SIF staff, owners, and clients from arrest, prosecutio n and disciplinary proceedings in the state. Even if the authorizing legislation did not explicitly amend existing criminal laws, statutory support for a SIF ought to deter arrest and support strong defenses for SIF clients, personnel, and owners who might be criminally charge d.86 Statutory authorization under state law could also provide some protection from local efforts to declare SIFs a public nuisance, or to find SIF clients in violation of local laws such as Administrative Code \u00a7 10 -203. Recognizing t his potential, New York State Assembly bill A.8534 was introduced in June 2017 to authorize SIFs statewide.87 The proposed legislation \u2014currently under health committee consideration \u2014would permit local health authorities to set and maintain SIF operating and reporting standards. In addition to New York, several other states have consider ed or are considering legislation authorizing SIFs, including California,88 Colorado,89 Maryland,90 Maine,91 and Massachusetts.92 No bill has passed both houses of any state legislature to date. State administrative action The New York State Governor or New York State Commissioner of Health could establish SIFs through executive authority. Provisions in New York State law grant administrative authority to the Governor to dire ct funds for programming in the event of a disaster. Similarly, the New York State Commissioner of Health holds the authority to provide treatment, supplies, and services to residents in the event of a statewide medical emergency.93 The scope of the opioid overdose epidemic in New York and the recent acceleration of mortality caused by the introduction of fentanyl likely would justify the declaration of a disaster or state of emergency and initiate SIFs . There is historical precendent for such an approach in New York State, as the State Department of Health used such a emergency regulation in 1992 to successfully establish syringe exchange programs in response to the HIV/AIDS crisis. Executive or agency action would be open to the risk of challenge as contrary to state criminal laws, and it is unknown how New York State and federal legislators and prosecutors might respond to such an administrative directive. However, the emergency health action taken by New York State to establish SEPs we nt unchallenged by federal Although possession of controlled substances remains illegal in New York State, syringe exchange pr ogram participants are allowed to possess trace amounts of illegal drugs in used syringes, an exception to the law established to facilitate SEP use and reduce transmission of HIV and other bloodborne diseases. 39 authorities in the 1990s ; ultimately syringe exchange programs were authorized by state law in 1993.94 As with SEPs, State administrative action to establish SIFs may also go unchallenged. Local legislation or administrative action The New York City Council could establish a SIF through City law.95 A city law authorizing SIFs may be found by the courts to conflict with state criminal laws leaving SIFs established by it vulnerable to state prosecutions . The local law option w ould also leave providers uncertain about professional disciplinary proceedings which are also governed by state law. Local legislative action would need to consider local nuisance codes that criminalize individuals or organizations that \"knowingly allow\" drug use in a given location. Enforcement of these codes is at the discretion of state prosecutors, and establishment of a SIF through City ordinance may be vulnerable to challenge by state and federal law enforcement. However, evidence from other j urisdictions indicates that SIFs reduce nuisances associated with public injection and overdose, reducing the likelihood of prosecution on nuisance grounds. Additionally, the New York City Charter grants the New York City Mayor and DOHMH the authority to establish emergency services during short -term crises.96 Should the City define the overdose epidemic in these terms, DOHMH could establish one or more SIFs. Coordination with the New York State Deparment of Health would be essential so as not to interfere with State health waivers authorizing SEPs . As with local legislative efforts, local administrative actions may draw challenges under state law, depending on state prosecutors' enforcement decisions. Some other cities, including Baltimore, Philad elphia, and San Francisco are using local aut hority to study SIF feasibility. Seattle and Ithaca , New York have announced intentions or decisions to authorize the establishment of SIFs as part of a larger strategy to reverse the opioid overdose epidemic. However, a ll are grappling with the potential impact of state and federal criminal laws. Research study with federal and state authorization A supervised injection facility could be implemented as a research study, with the goal of evaluating the acceptability and feasibility of a SIF in New York City. There are established legal procedures for conducting research that involves the use of controlled substances, which insulate researchers and participants from prosecution under federal and state drug laws. Either the New York State Department of Health or DOHMH could establish a SIF as a research pilot under a two -year state license. Although licensure can be granted by the state, all research licenses of this nature would require review and approval f rom several fede ral authorities, including the National Institute on Drug Abuse, the US Department of Justice and the Drug Enforcement Administration. To date, no American city has attempted to establish a SIF through a research program, although successful SIFs in Vanco uver, Canada and Sydney, Australia began as research pilots. Federally approved research licenses provide several advantages, including certainty on the part of SIF staff and clients that they are not violating federal or state laws. 40 The evidence generated from a pilot also may help garner public support for SIFs as a prelude to New York S tate legislative or administrative efforts. However, sustaining services beyond the two -year license is contingent on reapproval, which may be uncertain in a given politic al climate, and, as experienced in both Sydney and Vancouver, expansion from a demonstration pilot program has been restricted because of limitations in the research license even after years of operation and proven program benefits. Conclusion on legal c hallenges and opportunities State legislative action offers the greatest certainty under state and local laws for a New York City SIF . However , the risk of federal prosecution under the Controlled Substances Act would not be diminished by state legislative action. In the absence of state legislation, state administrative action would provide some security, but would not protect against state or federal prosecution. The City could also use le gislative power, exec utive power, or both to authorize SIF s; however, SIFs so established would be vulnerable to possible contravening powers of both the state and federal government. Regardless of the pathway by which supervised injection is implemented, viability will depend on law enforcement bodies recognizing SIFs as an extension of health services for individuals most vulnerable to illness and death from opioid use. 41 CASE STUDIES: SUPERVISED INJECTION FACILITIES AT THE MUNICIPAL LEVEL Updat e from S eattle, San Francisco , and Philadelphia Although no supervised injection facilities exist currently in the United States, Seattle , San Francisco , and Philadelphia are moving toward implementing SIFs as a strategy to respond to increasing overdose deaths. Seattle In January 2017, the Seattle City Council and King County Board of Public Health approved a measure to authorize two SIFs , slated to open in 2018. The proposal originated from the formal recommendations of the King County Heroin and Prescription Opiate Addiction Task Force , and formal approval followed two years of coalition building and sustained, broad -based support .97 In November 2017, the Seattle City Council voted to a llocate $ 1.3 million to fund a community health engagement location (CHEL) that would include supervised injection and post -consumption drop -in space in conjunction with syringe exchange, overdose prevention, sexual health, peer education, and referrals to medical, mental health, and social services. Since the Task Force released its recommendations, the proposal to establish SIFs has received public endorsement from King County Prosecutor Dan Satterberg. The endorsement from Satterberg, in particular, was critical in shoring up support among the law enforcement community. Satterberg has spoken publicly about his evolution from self - professed \"drug warrior\" during the crack cocaine epidemic of the 1980s to his current stance that drugs are an issue of publi c health. His support for supervised injection is emblematic of the multidisciplinary nature of contemporary drug reform once stakeholders examine the evidence and best practice options. In all jurisdictions with operational SIFs, cooperation between law e nforcement and health authorities has been crucial to the advancement, establishment, and sustainability of SIFs. However, there is opposition to supervised injection in Seattle. Washington State Senator Mark Miloscia introduced a bill that effectively would ban SIFs in Washington State, shortly after the measure was approved by the City Council and Board of Public Health.98 The bill passed the Washington State Senate in March 2017 but has not yet advanced in the State House . Senator Miloscia also drafted an open letter to the United States Attorney General in February 2017 requesting federal intervention to prevent the City of Seattle from opening the scheduled SIF pilot sites.99 While the US Department of Justice has not yet responded to the letter , any f ederal movement to prohibit SIFs could collaterally affect New York City. Finally, the community group Citizens for Safe King County introduced a public ballot Seattle is the county seat of King County. 42 initiative, Initiative 27, to ban supervised injection in King County. The initiative garnered over 70,000 signatures and was scheduled for a February 2018 vote before the King County Superior Court invalidated the initiative in October 2017 on the grounds that matters of public health could not be voted on by referendum. King County intends to use public fund s toward the operation of supervised injection sites. San Francisco In April 2017, California State Assembly Member Susan Talamantes Eggman introduced a bill to authorize eight California counties, including San Francisco, to open SIFs in respo nse to increased overdose and public injection across California.100 While the bill passed the Assembly and received broad public support, it ultimately was voted down in the State Senate in September 2017. Simultaneously, the San Francisco Board of Supervi sors passed a resolution in April 2017 urging the San Francisco Department of Public Health to convene the San Francisco Safe Injection Services Task Force. The Task Force was commissioned between April and September 2017 and was composed of experts in public health, law enforcement, social services, and drug policy, as well as community members representing the interests of small businesses and people who use drugs. As part of the Task Force's recommendations development proce ss, surveys and focus groups were conducted with small business owners, neighborhood groups, people who inject drugs, and people engaged in treatment for substance use disorder. Task Force meetings included sessions for public comment, and feedback from th e public about supervised injection was received and incorporated into the recommendations. In September 2017, the Task Force released its recommendations, which broadly endorsed supervised injection as a public health intervention.101 The recommendations d etailed suggestions for planning, implementation, and sustainability and were presented before the Board of Supervisors' Public Safety and Neighborhood Services Committee for consideration in October 2017. In February 2018, the Director of the San Francisc o Department of Public Health announced that San Francisco would seek to pilot two supervised injection sites as early as July 2018, funded through private sources. San Francisco intends to co -locate supervised injection services within existing community - based programs that provide syringe access and other health and social services to people who use drugs . Philadelphia In January 2018, the Philadelphia Task Force to Combat the Opioid Epidemic released a report recommending supervised injection as a str ategy to reduce opioid overdose.102 Shortly thereafter, Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney, District Attorney Larry Krasner, and Health Commissioner Thomas Farley announced their joint public support for supervised injection. The Kenney Administration intends to pilot \"comprehensive drug user engagement sites,\" holistic health care, and social services for people who use drugs in which supervised injection services would be available. While the details of these pilot programs are in development, the City of Philadelphia has expressed that any sup ervised 43 injection pilots will operate with private funding in partnership with existing harm reduction organizations to oversee site operations . 44 RECOMMENDATIONS New York City has experienced a 166% increase in overdose death since 2010, reaching an all-time high in 201 7 with a provisional 1,441 confirmed fatalities. Over 80% of these deaths involved opioids. Nearly ha lf (44%) of all overdose deaths in 2016 involve d non - pharmaceutical fentanyl \u2014a synthetic opioid 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine \u2014 and the drug's impact on overdose cannot be overstated. Non -pharmaceutical f entanyl greatly increases the risk of overdose among people who inject drugs due to its potency, short -acting effect, and inability to be detected by sight or smell. Projections s uggest that non-pharmaceutical fentanyl 's presence in the drug supply will continue to expand, thus requiring that public health actors deploy new responses. Like syringe exchange before it, supervised injection is an evidence -based public health strategy to prevent and reduce overdose and overdose death, curtail the transmission of bloodborne disease, and facilitate access to care, treatment, and health for individuals at highest risk of overdose. Despite concerns about increases in drug -related crime or substance misuse in communities following the establishment of a SIF, evidence indicates that supervised injection facilities may be an effective measure to reduce crime and prevent community exposure to harmful substance use. Results from the three studi es presented in this report, in conjunction with the broad scientific evidence from other jurisdictions, suggest that supervised injection is one possible intervention to combat opioid overdose in New York City in alignment with the goals of HealingNYC and ThriveNYC . Supervised injection facilities can fit into New York City's comprehensive overdose prevention agenda as a targeted strategy to reduce the risk of overdose and disease transmission among people who inject drugs, as well as offering the community -wide benefit of decreasing public injection. Guided by this e vidence, we offer the following recommendations to address the planning and implementation of supervised injec tion s ervices in New York City. Support the creation of supervised inje ction services in New York City Our overarching recommendation is to support the piloting of four supervised injection facilities in New York City , despite the risk of criminal prosecution f or clients, staff , and operators, as well as the risk of loss of licensure of clinical staff and the forfeiture of property for facility operators and landlords. Supervised injection is congruent with New York City's comprehensive health and safety strateg y to reduce overdose. Establishing SIFs in neighborhoods highly affected by opioid overdose death and in which public injection is a growing concern could maximize the number of lives saved. Findings suggest that piloting four sites could prevent up to 130 overdose deaths and save up to $7 million annually while connecting individuals at risk of overdose to a host of harm reduct ion, drug treatment, and health care services . 45 Planning and implementation Implement pilot supervised injection facilities by December 2018 in response to New York City's fentanyl -driven public health emergency All available data demonstrate that the increases in overdose death \u201447% citywide from 2015 to 2016 \u2014and the toxicity associated with non -pharmaceutical fentanyl constitute a public health emergency in New York City. Non -pharmaceutical f entanyl was identifie d in 44% of overdose decedents in 2016, indicating the tremendous risk of overdose posed by the current drug supply . Individuals residing in shelters represent less than 1% of the New York City population but account for 7% of all overdose deaths. Supervised injection facilities would directly serve the population of people who inject drugs publicly due to lack of housing or private space. Supervised injection facilities also would link individuals to needed medical care , drug treatment, and housing servic es. Locate pilot supervised injection facilities within existing syringe exchange programs Co-locating pilot SIFs within existing syringe exchange programs would leverage the strong community relations and extensive on -site treatment and service re ferral networks tha t SEPs have built over nearly three decades. Given the long -standing history of collaboration and mutual respect between harm reduction services, law enforcement, and local communities in New York City, locating SIF services within an ex isting harm reduction facility will facilitate the acceptance of supervised injection by law enforcement and local community members . The concerns identified through the community assessment presented in this report \u2014such as the generation of concentration s of people who use drugs and public injection \u2014would be assuaged by the co -location of SIFs in SEPs. Evaluations of existing SIFs suggest that, like SEPs, these services are highly localized; people who use drugs generally do not travel more than 20 minutes to use either SIFs or SEPs . Additionally, evaluations of existing SIFs have shown significant declines in public injection and improperly discarded syringes in neighborhoods following the opening of a SIF site. Co-location of SIFs in SEPs would b e cost -effective . It would eliminat e the siting expenses associated with developing a new facility , save startup and development costs, and make co-location a fiscally responsible option. Pilot sites should reflect where the burden of overdose is severe a nd the need for resources is great The burden of overdose is spread disproportionately across the city, with the poorest neighborhoods \u2014including Hunts Point -Mott Haven in the Bronx and East Harlem in Manhattan \u2014experiencing extremely high fentanyl -involved overdose rates. In order to address endemic disparities in risk and harm, pilot SIFs should be located in areas of New York City that have borne a disproportionate burden of overdose deaths . 46 Support New York State administrative action as a realistic lega l possibility in the absence of legislation While State legislative change could eliminate risk of prosecution under State law and of loss of licensure and aid with defense in a federal criminal prosecution, State - level administrative action may be more readily achievable . The current fentanyl crisis and continued increases in overdose deaths constitute a public health emergency, through which the New York State Department of Health could establish a pilot SIF. There is precedent for the New York State Department of Health to take progressive administrative action. In response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic, t he New York State Department of Health used administrative action to issue an emergency health waiver to authorize syringe exchange programmi ng, which was being run underground by activists at the time . Build out and collaborate with coalitions of nongovernmental support to operate supervised injection pilot s Widespread non governmental support exists for supervised injection, with 41 independent advocacy and community organizations endorsing the establishment of supervised injection services nationally or in New York City. See Appendix A for the full list of supporting organizations. One organization in particular, amfAR, wrote an open letter to New York Governor Andrew Cuomo in September 2017 urging him to take New York State administrative action authorizing SIFs and offering to fund a pilot site, as the organization did during the f irst NYS syringe exchange pilot in the 1990s . History has proved the success of allowing scientific experts such as amfAR to operate high - risk, high -reward pilot health programs. W ithout amfAR's funding and operational support, the institutionalization of syringe exchange in New York State would not have been possible. See Appendix B for the full text of amfAR's letter to Governor Cuomo. Ensure that supervised injection facilities are supportive and safe spaces for marginalized communities at increased ris k of overdose and associated harm Supervised injection services can serve as targeted interventions to aid the city's most vulnerable populations. Shelter residents and undomiciled individuals represent less than 1% of the New York City population, yet acc ount for 7% of all overdose deaths with an unprecedented mortality rate over six times that of the general population. Women who use drugs are at heightened risk of experiencing street -based violence. Supervised injection facilities can position themselves as supportive and safe spaces for these and other groups at high risk of overdose to access a va riety of services and referrals given SIFs' demonstrated ability to function as holistic health care and social service centers. 47 Evaluate the health, safety, and fiscal impacts of a supervised injection pilot While with clear proven value globally, g iven that no comparable services currently exist in New York City or the United States, pilot supervised injection facilities in New York City will be evaluated to assess their health, safety, and fiscal impacts. To accomplish this, we recommend sustained engagement with the scientific communi ty coupled with ongoing quality improvement to ensure that pilot SIFs are accountable and successful in meeting the aims for w hich they are established, and contribute to the body of knowledge for use by other jurisdictions nationally and internationally. As was the case with the first syringe exchange programs, evaluation by independent academic experts should be conduct ed and r equired to ensure that the highest possible scientific standards are met. Public engagement and education Leverage the support of county prosecutors to facilitate supervised injection pilot implementation The support of prosecutors has been integral to the success of drug reforms in New York City and nationally. In Seattle, the public support for supervised injection of King County District Attorney , Dan Satterberg , was a key link in building the coalition between public health and law enforcement that h as brought Seattle closer to opening a SIF. In New York City, prosecutors have been at the cutting edge of drug reform in the law enforcement community. The late Brooklyn District Attorney , Kenneth Thompson , ceased prosecuting low -level marijuana possessi on offenses in 2014, which paved the way for the New York City Police Department to revise their marijuana arrest policy. The Manhattan District Attorney , Cyrus Vance, Jr. , is a leader in restructuring drug diversion procedures, allowing the use of evidence - based medication s for addiction treatments in drug courts. The Staten Island District Attorney, Michael McMahon, led the design and implementation of the HOPE Program, a pos t-arrest drug diversion program. The Bronx District Attorney, Darcel Clark, leads the Bronx Heroin Enforcement and Access to Treatment workgroup, which aims to coordinate a comprehensive and collaborating public health and safety response to increasing rat es of opioid overdose in the Bronx. We recommend engaging one or more New York City prosecutors in the planning and development process of any supervised injection pilot to ensure that these front -line leaders in law enforcement are able to pr ovide their e xpertise and input into the development of a SIF pilot . Engage key perspectives as part of a collaborative planning process Incorporating the complementary perspectives of public health, public safety, law enforcement, social services, and local communities in the planning process is critical to maximiz e the potential benefits of SIFs with respect to all groups. Responsiveness to a range of interests will ensure that SIFs can most effectively help the New Yorkers who nee d them most. 48 Hold public planning sessions for the communities most impacted by overdose Public and community support are critical to the successful implementation of supervised injection services. We recommend establishing planning consortiums of key com munity stakeholders and advocates in target neighborhoods highly affected by overdose mortality, with an anchor harm reduction provider in each. Planning meetings would provide a structured space for members of the public to learn about SIFs from recognized experts, provide feedback throughout the implementation process, and ra ise concerns. An advisory committee comprised of health, safety, community leaders, and advocates would guide the public discussion process in the selected neighborhoods and ensure that public feedback is adequately incorporated into the implementation pla n. New Yorkers support the City's ongoing mental health and overdose prevention efforts. Sustained community engagement and procedural transparency are essential to ensuring that SIFs are successfully integrated into the existing landscape of harm reductio n services. Including professional organizations and expert bodies ( e.g., the New York State Medical Society and New York State Nursing Association) in the planning and feedback processes could garner support and educate members who are New York City resid ents. Work with law enforcement officials Law enforcement agencies are key partners of the public health and social service communities citywide and it is important that they remain engaged throughout the planning and implementation processes of any pilo t supervised injection facility. Strengthening the coalition through NYC RxStat that exists in New York City between public health, public safety, and community -based social services will cultivate cooperation and accountability between groups, allow group s to identify clear roles and responsibilities, and ensure that all voices are heard. Develop public resources and education about supervised injection facilities to inform local stakeholders about the continuum of care and discuss stigma toward people who use drugs Opportunities for education about supervised injection and the substance use continuum of care can be developed through collaboration between advocates, public health professionals, and health care providers to both inform and receive feedback from community stakeholders as part of a pilot implementation process. Engaging community stakeholders early and often as part of a design and implementation plan would help facilitate referrals between a pilo t SIF and other critical services \u2014including housing, publi c benefits, re -entry, and victim services \u2014 as well as address community drug use stigma. Additionally, advocates and health professionals can offer training and education to public safety and law enf orcement professionals as part of pilot implementation to ensure collaboration between multiple groups. 49 ACKNOWLEDG MENTS Columbia Law School Kristen Underhill, DPhil, JD New York Academy of Medicine Michele Calvo, MPH Peter Schafer New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene Bennett Allen Gary Belkin, MD, PhD, MPH Stephanie Buhle Holly Catania, JD Cody Colon -Berezin, MPH Rebecca MS Amy Hecker , MPA Maura Kennelly, MPH Jacob Kraemer Hillary Kunins, MD, MPH Sam Miller, MPA Michelle Nolan, MPH Denise Paone, EdD Maibe Ponet Emily Winkelstein, MSW Ricky Wong Weill Cornell Medical College Czarina Behrends, PhD, MPH Bruce Schackman, PhD, MBA Expert Advisory Panel Ahmed Bayoumi, M D, MSc Scientist at the Centre for Research on Inner City Health at the Li Ka Shing Knowledge Institute, general internist and HIV physician at St. Michael's Hospital, and professor in the Department of Medicine at the Institute of Health Policy, Management and Evaluation at the Univers ity of Toronto Czarina N.

New psychoactiv e substances - or NPS - mimic the effects of a wide range of substances, including prescription opioids, cannabinoids, stimulants, hallucinogens, and central nervous system depressants. NPS are sold as \"legal highs\" and alternatives to established drugs of abuse. NPS have been increasingly associated with hospital emergencies, acute adverse health consequences, and drug -induced death. \"Although Congress passed AMA -supported legislation in 2012 that placed 26 synthetic drugs in Schedule 1 under the Controll ed Substances Act (CSA), drug traffickers have devised ways to circumvent federal drug laws by slightly altering the chemical structure of their products and designing new synthetic drugs,\" said Patrice A. Harris, MD, chair of the AMA Board of Trustees and the AMA Task Force on Opioid Abuse. \"These new products are currently unregulated and are frequently marketed to young people as innocent products like \"bath salts,\" plant food, or incense. They also include variations of the extremely dangerous opioid fe ntanyl, which has been wreaking havoc across the country and resulting in a sharp increase in drug overdoses and deaths due to such overdoses.\" Delegates at the AMA Annual Meeting voted to support multifaceted, collaborative multiagency approach to combat NPS. Delegates also supported increased NPS surveillance and early warning systems for more actionable information that can quickly aid law enforcement, public health officials, emergency physicians, and vulnerable populations in mitigating the growing NP S problem. 1 American Medical Association. AMA wants new approaches to combat synthetic and injectable December 29, 2017. 59 Public health approaches have been used to successfully address outbreaks of NPS overdoses. When such approaches have been successful, pre -existing coordinated relationships among multiple stakeholders have allowed for a rapid and comprehensive response to a given outbreak. In addition to the newly adopted policies for eliminating the NPS threat, the AMA is also supporting the \"Synthetic Drug Control Act of 2017\" (H.R. 1732) that would require the Attorney General of the United States to assign Schedule I classification to approximately 250 dangerous new synthetic substances identified by the Drug Enforcement Administration since 2012. In an effort to consider promising strategies that could reduce the health and societal problems associated wi th injection drug use, the AMA today voted to support the development of pilot facilities where people who use intravenous drugs can inject self - provided drugs under medical supervision. Studies from other countries have shown that supervised injection facilities reduce the number of overdose deaths, reduce transmission rates of infectious disease, and increase the number of individuals initiating treatment for substance use disorders without increasing drug trafficking or crime in the areas where the fa cilities are located. \"State and local governments around the nation are currently involved in exploratory efforts to create supervised injection facilities to help reduce public health and societal impacts of illegal drug use,\" said Dr. Harris. \"Pilo t facilities will help inform U S policymakers on the feasibility, effectiveness and legal aspects of supervised injection facilities in reducing harms and health care costs associated with injection drug use.\" The examination of this issue by physicians at th e AMA Annual Meeting was greatly assisted by the Massachusetts Medical Society and its recently completed comprehensive study of the literature associated with supervised injection facilities.2 2 Fitzgerald TC, Abel B, B ates SR.

Was hington, DC: US Department of Health and Human Services; 2010. 61 access to sterile syringes and opioid substitution treatments, and aggressive law enforcement practices have promoted risky practices that facilitate the spread of HIV/AIDS and other diseases while creating barriers to drug and HIV treatment. Failure to adopt proven harm reduction measures has significantly increased the public health harms of drug misuse. For example, legal and bureaucratic barriers still prevent people who inject drugs from accessing sterile syringes in the United States, despite decades of evidence proving that syringe access programs help to reduc e the spread of diseases.14-18 In fact, the US Congress recently reinstated a federal ban on funding of s terile syringe programs, after finally lifting the 2 -decade -long ban just 3 years ago. The federal ban is estimated to have cost thousands of lives and hundreds of millions of dollars.19 Perhaps not surprisingly, fewer than one -third of people who inject drugs surveyed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had been reached by an HIV intervention.20 Furthermore, while the United States has relatively high HIV prevalence rates among people who inject drugs (at roughly 14%), countries that ha ve consistently and comprehensively provided harm reduction and effective treatment options, such as syringe access and opioid substitution therapies, have rates that are far lower; in some of these nations, HIV prevalence among people who inject drugs is 1% or lower.21 Public funds are routinely prioritized for drug law enforcement instead of proven HIV prevention strategies. While drug war budgets have generally increased, effective treatment programs are chronically under resourced , and in the United Sta tes practically no federal funds are invested in programs that will reduce harms related to injection drug 14 Effectiveness of Sterile Needle and Syringe Programming in Reducing HIV/AIDS Among Injecting Drug Users.

With less than 5% of the world's population but nearly 25% of its incarcerated population, the United States imprisons more people (and at a higher rate) than any other nation in the world, largely as a result of the war on drugs.38 More than 1.5 million drug arrests occ urred in the United States in 2011. The vast majority \u2014more than 80% \u2014were for possession only, and half were for marijuana law violations.39 Seventeen percent (17%) of people in state prisons and nearly half (48 %) of those in federal prisons were incarcerate d for a drug law violation in 2011.40 Roughly 500,000 Americans are behind bars on any given night for a drug law violation, 10 times the total in 1980.41-43 Misguided drug laws and disproportionate sentencing requirements have produced grossly unequal outcomes for communities of color. Although rates of drug use and selling are comparable across racial and ethnic lines, Blacks and Latinos are far more likely to be criminalized for drug law violations than Whites.44-46 People of color experience discrim ination at every stage of the judicial system.47 This is particularly the case for drug law violations. Blacks make up 13% of the US population and are consistently documented by the US government to use drugs at rates similar to those among people of othe r races.48 However, Blacks account for nearly one -third of drug arrests and roughly 45% of those 37 Werb D, Rowell G, Guyatt G, Kerr T, Montaner J, Wood E.

A 2012 national study published in the American Journal of Public Health showed that Black youths were less likely than Whites to use or sell drugs but more likely to be arrested; the researchers concluded that \"[r]acial disparities in adolescent arrest appear to result from differential treatment of minority youths and to have long -term negative effects on the lives of affected African American youths.\"55 App roximately 2.7 million children are growing up in US households in which one or more parents are incarcerated. One in 9 Black children have an incarcerated parent, as compared with one in 28 Latino children and one in 57 White children.56 Punishment for a drug law violation is not only meted out by the US criminal justice system but also perpetuated by policies denying child custody, voting rights, employment, business loans, trade licensing, student aid, and public housing and other public assistance to pe ople with criminal convictions. In addition, criminal records are cited as justification for deporting legal residents and barring other noncitizens from visiting the United States.57 Even if a person does not face jail or prison time, a drug conviction rec ord\u2014particularly a felony \u2014often imposes a lifelong ban on many aspects of social, economic, and political life. Such exclusions create a permanent second -class status for millions of people and, as with drug war enforcement itself, fall disproportionately on people of color.

APHA policy 9123 (Social Practice of Mass Imprisonment) states that APHA has \"a long history of concern and activity aimed at correcting inadequacies in health conditions in correctional institutions, and is aware that pri son health and community health are intimately related elements of public health in the US with...millions of individuals released annually from custody to community.\" It notes that \"APHA has long -defined drug abuse as a public health problem rather than a c riminal justice problem and called for drug treatment to be available for all who request it.\" It further \"condemns the social practice that sanctions mass imprisonment rather than defining and changing those conditions that engender and accompany criminal behavior, including drug addiction,\" and calls for alternatives to incarceration. In 2009, in the wake of the XVIII International AIDS Conference in Vienna, Austria, the international scientific and public health community issued the Vienna Declaration, a statement seeking to improve community health and safety by calling for the incorporation of scientific evidence into illicit drug policies. The Vienna Declaration calls for an acknowledgment of the limits and harms of drug prohibition, for ending the cr iminalization of people who use drugs, and for drug policy reform to remove barriers to effective HIV prevention, treatment, and care.59 Since then, an increasing number of prominent figures in and sectors of society have raised their voices against polici es that criminalize people who use drugs, in favor of robust, health -centered alternatives. In 2011, former presidents Fernando Henrique Cardoso (Brazil), Cesar Gaviria (Colombia), and Ernesto Zedillo (Mexico) joined with former UN secretary general Kofi A nnan, former US secretary of state George Shultz, former Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker, former Swiss president Ruth Dreifuss, and other members of the Global Commission on Drug Policy (GCDP) to launch a landmark report calling for fundamental reforms to national and global drug policies, including (1) acknowledging the failure of the \"war on drugs\" and its disastrous impact on human rights, violence, and corruption; (2) replacing the criminalization and punishment of people who use drugs with the offer of health and treatment services to those who need them; and (3) encouraging governments to experiment with models of legal regulation to undermine the power of organized crime and safeguard people's health and security.60 In advance of the 58 Moore LD, Elkavich A.

Rio de Janeir o, Brazil: Global Commission on Drug Policy; 2011. 66 Intern ational AIDS Conference in Washington, DC, the GCDP issued a second report in June 2012, The War on Drugs and HIV/AIDS, which was successful in exposing the causal links between the HIV pandemic and the criminalization of drug use. The GCDP has since been joined by former presidents Jorge Sampaio (Portugal), Alexander Kwasniewski (Poland), and Ricardo Lagos (Chile). Former US presidents Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton have echoed most or all of the commission's recommendations, as has former president Vicent e Fox of Mexico. In 2013, the GCDP issued a third report, The Negative Impact of the War on Drugs on Public Health: The Hidden Hepatitis C Epidemic, which again called for the decriminalization of drug use and the expansion of proven, science - based solutio ns to reduce hepatitis C, including sterile syringe access, supervised injection facilities, and heroin prescription programs.61 Against this backdrop, the Organization of American States issued a groundbreaking, 2 -part report in May 2013 in which it critically examined the current war on drugs and considered new approaches for the future, giving equal weight to options such as decriminalization and harm reduction.62 Among the report's conclusions is the urgent need for a \"public health approach\" to add ress drug problems, and it specifies that \"the decriminalization of drug use needs to be considered as a core element in any public health strategy.\"63 In June 2013, Human Rights Watch publicly condemned \"[n]ational drug control policies that impose crimin al penalties for personal drug use\" as a violation of human rights, stating that the \"criminalization of drug use has undermined the right to health\" because \"fear of criminal penalties deters people who use drugs from using health services and treatment, and increases their risk of violence, discrimination, and serious illness.\" Its statement continues, \"Criminal prohibitions have also impeded the use of drugs for legitimate medical research, and have prevented patients from accessing drugs for palliative care and pain treatment,\" a harm well documented in the literature.64 It concludes by urging governments to \"rely instead on non -penal regulatory and public health policies.\"65 And in November 2012, Colorado and Washington became the first political jurisdic tions in the world to vote to permit the legal regulation of marijuana sales, cultivation, and distribution among adults 21 years of age and older within their borders, and both states are in the process of 61 The Negative Impact of the War on Drugs on Public Health: The Hidden Hepatitis C Epidemic.

Joining those distinguished colleagues and peers, APHA agrees that the criminalization of people who use illicit drugs is fueling the HIV epidemic and has resulted in overwhelmingly negati ve health and social consequences, and that a full policy reorientation is needed. Proposed Recommendations Statement APHA policies 7121 and 8817(PP) call for a reorientation of current US drug policies, and APHA also has adopted longstanding policies tha t support several aspects of a health -based response to drug misuse. Policy 8817(PP) urges a \"redirection of current War on Drugs policies, which are seriously flawed and have little chance of alleviating the serious drug problems facing our society today. \" The present policy statement identifies the following proposals as vital elements of the redirection in US drug policy envisioned by APHA's existing policy statements, toward the adoption and implementation of a truly public health approach to reducing the harms of drug misuse. End the criminalization of drug possession and people who use drugs: APHA's policies 7121 and 8817(PP) recommend the removal of criminal penalties for drug use. Policy 7121 first expressed APHA's belief that people who use drugs should not be criminalized: \"because substance abuse is viewed primarily as a public health problem, this Association recommends that no punitive measures be taken against the users of alcohol, marijuana, or other substances when no other illegal act has b een committed.\" APHA reiterated its belief that drug misuse must be primarily addressed as a public health issue, resolving in policy 8817(PP) that \"[s]trict punitive measures should not take priority over drug treatment and prevention goals...punitive measures have only a limited impact on drug use and problem rates and, in many cases, have been shown to have an underlying purpose to discriminate against disadvantaged groups.\" Policy 8817(PP) further recommends that US drug policy give \"high priority to prevention, treatment and recovery\" and that \"punitive measures should be used with caution and should play a secondary role.... Particular attention should be given to the special needs of young people and disenfranchised groups and caution must be exercis ed to avoid discriminatory policies.\" Countries that have ended the criminalization of drug use and possession have generally been better able to cope with injection drug -related HIV/AIDS. Decriminalizing drug possession and investing in treatment and har m reduction services can provide several major benefits for public health, including reducing the number of people incarcerated; increasing uptake into drug treatment; reducing criminal justice costs and redirecting resources from criminal justice to healt h systems; redirecting law enforcement resources 68 to prevent serious and violent crime; addressing racial disparities in drug law enforcement, incarceration, and related health characteristics and outcomes; minimizing stigma and creating a social, cultural, and policy climate in which people who use drugs are less fearful of seeking and accessing treatment, using harm reduction services, and receiving HIV/AIDS services; and protecting people from the wide -ranging and debilitating consequences of a criminal c onviction. Some countries particularly stand out. In 2001, Portuguese legislators enacted a comprehensive form of decriminalization of low -level possession and consumption of all illicit drugs and reclassified these activities as administrative violations . A person caught with personal -use amounts of any drug in Portugal is no longer arrested but, rather, ordered to appear before a local \"dissuasion commission\" composed of 3 officials (one from the legal arena and a pair from the health arena) who determin e whether and to what extent the person is addicted to drugs. On the basis of these findings, the commission can order someone to attend a treatment program, complete other monitoring activities, pay a fine, or submit to other administrative sanctions. Dru g trafficking and non -drug offenses remain illegal and are still processed through the criminal justice system. The decriminalization policy was part of a comprehensive health -oriented approach to addressing problematic drug use, especially unsafe injecti ng drug use, that also included a major expansion of treatment and harm reduction services. New diagnoses of HIV and AIDS among people who inject drugs have also declined in Portugal. Between 2000 and 2008, the number of cases of HIV among people who injec t drugs declined from 907 to 267, and the number of AIDS cases decreased from 506 to 108. These highly significant declines are largely attributable to the increased provision of harm reduction services and efforts made possible by decriminalization.66 In addition, research has shown no significant increases in overall illicit drug use among adults in Portugal, and any slight increases in lifetime use of some drugs appear to be part of a regional trend. More importantly, adolescent drug use, as well as prob lematic drug use\u2014defined as use by people deemed to be dependent or addicted and by people who inject drugs \u2014has decreased overall since 2003. The number of people arrested and sent to criminal courts for drug law violations declined by more than half after decriminalization. The percentage of people in Portugal's prison system as a result of drug -related offenses also decreased by about half, from 44% in 1999 to 21% in 2008. These positive outcomes cannot be attributed to decriminalization alone. Alongside its decriminalization law, Portugal significantly expanded its treatment and harm reduction services, including access to sterile syringes as well as methadone maintenance therapy and other medication -assisted treatments. Between 1998 and 2008, the number of people 66 Domoslawski A, Siemaszko H. Drug Policy in Portugal: The Benefits of Decriminalizing Drug Use. Washington, DC: Open Society Institute; 2011. 69 in drug treatment increased by more than 60% (from 23,654 to 38,532 people). The percentage of drug -related deaths in which opiates were the primary substance involved declined from 95% in 1999 to 59% in 2008. On the basis of such evidence and APHA's longstanding policies, eliminating criminal penalties for personal drug use and possession is an essential feature of a public health response to drugs and drug misuse, and APHA calls on state and federal governments to remove such criminal penaltie s. Expand access to harm reduction interventions: Harm reduction programs including sterile syringe access, supervised injection facilities, and medication -assisted treatment should be scaled up to eliminate HIV and hepatitis C transmission among people w ho inject drugs. Interventions that have proven effective in other countries should be evaluated for implementation in the United States, and legal and political barriers to programs with evidence of effectiveness should be removed. Treatment providers, he alth professionals (including primary care physicians), community health workers (CHWs), and other stakeholders should receive professional preparation and training with respect to proven treatment and harm reduction interventions. CHWs play a critical rol e in making contact and building trust with hard -to-reach, drug -using populations at high risk and connecting them to health services or delivering those services to them. To expand access to these harm reduction and treatment services to every person in n eed, CHWs must be empowered to deliver cost -effective interventions such as syringe access programs, secondary syringe exchange services, low -threshold methadone maintenance, peer education programs, and HIV/AIDS testing, education, and links to treatment. Criminalization, by contrast, makes the essential harm reduction functions of CHWs more difficult or even impossible. Restricting access to sterile syringes among people who inject drugs has been proven to lead to syringe sharing, a major cause of HIV in fections. According to the CDC, people who inject drugs represented 9% (4,500) of all estimated new HIV infections in 2009, an annual figure that has not changed significantly since 2006.67 Such restrictions persist despite conclusive evidence from more tha n 200 studies conducted in the United States and abroad showing that expanding sterile syringe access \u2014through syringe exchange programs and non-prescription sales of syringes \u2014is a cost -effective means of reducing the spread of HIV and viral hepatitis and t hat these programs do not contribute to increased drug use, drug 67 Estimates of New HIV Infections in the United States, 2006 -2009. Atlanta, GA: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; 2011. 70 injection, crime, or unsafe discarding of syringes.68-75 According to a CDC -funded study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, syringe access has helped reduce HIV incidence among people who inject drugs in the United States by 80% in the past decade.76 Current APHA policy in this regard recognizes \"the critical importance of access to sterile syringes to prevent disease spread, and the effectiveness of increasing sterile syringe access in reducing risk behavior\"; it \"urges states that criminalize possession of prescribed syringes for inje ction of illicit substances to modify their laws or policies to permit such possession.\" Sterile syringe access programs are integral elements of a comprehensive health response to problematic drug use, are necessary to reach the goal of an AIDS -free gener ation, and should be funded at the local, state, and national levels toward the goal of providing a sterile syringe for every injection. Medically supervised injection facilities (SIFs) are controlled health care settings where people who use drugs can mo re safely do so under clinical supervision and receive health care, counseling, and referral to health and social services, including drug treatment. There are currently 92 SIFs operating in 62 cities around the world, but none in the United States.

Such therapies incl ude methadone and buprenorphine, as well as pharmaceutical heroin treatment, and they have proven successful in many countries.81-83 Denial of these treatments can result in untreated addiction, preventable HIV risk behaviors, and heightened vulnerability to fatal overdose.84,85 APHA took a leading position in 1970 when it supported \"further experimentation with organized maintenance programs using methadone and similar compounds, subject to appropriate supervision and evaluation,\" in policy 7015. One year earlier, policy 6907 had resolved: \"The American Public Health Association believes that the illicit profit incentive involved in the sale of drugs to drug addicts not only contributes to their misery but puts at risk entire communities in the United States, unnecessarily submitting its cit izens to muggings, robberies, injuries and in some instances murder, while constantly contributing to the profits of gangsters and Mafia -like organizations. APHA...declares that it will seek and support state and federal legislation to eliminate the profit m otive in the illicit sale of drugs...by making medically approved drugs and regimens of the most suitable and clinically evaluated methods readily available to known drug addicts at specially designated health centers equipped with professional staffs compet ent to deal with the comprehensive rehabilitation of the addict by means of: Medical care...psychological and 77 Kerr T, Wood E, Montaner J, Tynda ll M.

Such treatments utilizing opioid and stimulant agonist and/or partial agonist substitution clearly merit research into their feasibility in the United States and should be adopted as part of the US treatment response if evalua tions prove favorable.124 Opposing Arguments/Evidence Opponents of the health -based drug policies called for in the present policy statement often claim that the criminalization of people who use drugs is effective in reducing drug use. As a corollary, it i s often argued that reducing or eliminating criminal penalties for drug possession or expanding access to harm reduction services such as syringe exchanges, supervised injection facilities, or medication -assisted treatments enables problematic drug use; pr omotes the initiation of drug use; increases rates of drug misuse, crime, and related problems; and worsens public health and public safety. Yet, available evidence does not support these assertions. Not only has the dominant drug war paradigm completely failed to curb drug use or supply, but the evidence consistently shows that this approach has significantly amplified the harms of drug misuse and addiction. A recent evaluation by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) issued in March 2013 showed that the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) and the federal government \"have not made progress toward achieving most of the goals 116 Verthein U, Haasen C, Reimer J.

The first, a 2012 analysis of the relationship between arrest rates for heroin and cocaine offenses and the prevalence of injection drug use from 1992 to 2002, revealed that \"deterrence -based approaches to reducing d rug use seem not to reduce IDU prevalence\" and that \"alternative approaches such as harm reduction, which prevents HIV transmission and increases referrals to treatment, may be a better foundation for policy.\"128 The second, a 2005 study of intense street -level enforcement near syringe exchange program sites in Philadelphia, showed that utilization of such programs fell significantly as a result of increased drug law enforcement.129 After studying nearly a hundred metropolitan areas in the United States, resea rchers found that repressive drug law enforcement was correlated with increased HIV prevalence among people who inject drugs. The researchers concluded: \"This may be because fear of arrest and/or punishment leads drug injectors to avoid using syringe excha nges, or to inject hurriedly or to inject in shooting galleries or other multi -person injection settings to escape detection.\" Criminalization also erects multiple barriers to both HIV and drug treatment.130 ,131 Research demonstrates that people who use drugs tend to have lower rates of antiretroviral therapy utilization and higher rates of death due to HIV/AIDS. What is more, these factors also seriously interfere with the front -line work of CHWs to reach out to, engage, recruit, and retain hard -to-reach peopl e in health programs, especially low - threshold and secondary harm reduction services. 125 Office of National Drug Control Policy: Office Could Better Identify Opportunities to Increase Program Coordination.

Specifically, jurisdictions that have legalized medical marijuana, decriminalized possession of marijuana and/or other drugs, or tolerated limited, retail sales (e.g., recreational marijuana \"coffee shops\" in the Netherlands) have not experienced significant, if any, increases in marijuana or other drug use.132 -143 A new study published in the American Journal of Public Health, for instance, revealed that adolescent marijuana has not increased in states with medical marijuana laws.144 Empirical evidence from countries that have adopted less punitive policies toward drug possession shows that these countries have not experienced any significant increases in drug use, drug -related harm, or drug -related crime relative to more punitive countries.145 A WHO study of lifetime drug use rates among 17 countries showed that the United States had the highest drug use rates by a wide margin, despite its punitive drug p olicies, noting that the US, which has been driving much of the world's drug research and drug policy agenda, stands out with higher levels of use of alcohol, cocaine, and cannabis, despite more punitive illegal drug policies...than many comparable developed countries. Clearly, by itself, a punitive policy towards possession and use accounts for limited variation in nation -level rates of drug use.\" 132 Degenhardt L, Chiu W -T, Sampson N, et al.

Ann Arbor, MI: University of Michigan; 1981. 77 The Portuguese experience is particularly noteworthy; as described above, it has not resulted in any significan t increases in overall illicit drug use among adults. In fact, Portugal's drug use rates remain below the European average and are far lower than those in the United States. Overall, evidence after 10 years shows that none of the fears of drug war proponen ts have come to pass. According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, \"Portugal's policy has reportedly not led to an increase in drug tourism. It also appears that a number of drug -related problems have decreased.\"146 A new study of European Unio n countries showed that countries such as Portugal that have decriminalized the use and possession of all drugs have not experienced increases in rates of monthly drug use and, in fact, have lower rates of use than countries with punitive policies. Nor ha ve harm reduction interventions such as syringe access, SIFs, and medication - assisted treatments been shown to increase drug use. Syringe access programs, on the contrary, have been proven not to contribute to increased drug use, drug injection, crime, or unsafe discarding of syringes. SIFs reduce the social harms associated with injection drug use, such as public disorder, public intoxication, public injecting, and publicly discarded syringes. Several dozen published articles in peer -reviewed journals have confirmed the positive public health impact of SIFs, including 2 articles published in the American Journal of Public Health showing that the SIF located in Vancouver, Canada, has succeeded in attracting and retaining a population of injection drug users who are at heightened risk for infectious disease and overdose without increasing initiation into injection drug use.147 ,148 The evidence is similarly (and uniformly) positive for HAT programs: far from enabling drug use, these programs reduce illicit drug use and crime. In fact, many HAT participants freely choose to move on to another form of treatment (such as methadone) or to become abstinent, while others continue to receive HAT treatment on a long -term basis, with lasting positive results.149 ,150 Alternative Strategies Some policymakers, academics, and commentators have suggested that, rather than removing or reducing criminal penalties or investing in harm reduction services, US drug policies should focus on delivering drug treatment through the criminal ju stice system, 146 World Drug Report 2009.

Addiction. 2010;105(2):300 -308. 78 mainly in the form of an ever -growing number of drug court programs. The 2013 National Drug Control Strategy, for example, \"supports alternatives to incarceration such as drug courts, diversion programs, enhanced probation and parole programs , and other supervision strategies\" and calls for an increase in the country's already significant investment in drug courts. Some evaluations have shown reductions in drug use and recidivism for the duration of time that people are sentenced to drug court .151 However, available evidence shows that coerced treatment programs, such as drug courts, are costly, are no more effective than voluntary treatment, serve very few people, and often deny proven treatment modalities such as methadone and buprenorphine.152 -156 A recent survey of drug courts revealed that while nearly every drug court in the country serves participants who are opioid dependent, fewer than half offer medication -assisted treatments such as methadone. Most drug courts have not significantly reduced participants' chances of incarceration either. In fact, one study showed that because of drug courts' nearly exclusive focus on low -level drug (especially marijuana) possession offenses, their strict eligibility requirements, and underlying senten cing laws (e.g., mandatory minimums) that render many individuals ineligible for any type of diversion, such programs are highly unlikely to reduce the number of people incarcerated. That study also suggested that drug courts may have a \"net -widening\" effe ct; that is, they may actually increase the number of people incarcerated. Such criminal justice programs, moreover, have absorbed scarce resources that could have been better spent on bolstering demonstrated, health -centered approaches such as community -based treatment.157 Finally, coerced treatment for any health condition, especially for mere drug possession, raises serious ethical concerns; a recent commentary argued that coercive treatment for people who use or possess drugs is unethical and runs counte r to accepted health principles; it is also \"unlikely to have large effects on populatio n levels of drug use and crime.\"158 For these reasons, drug courts should be reserved for individuals charged with 151 Rossman SB, Roman J, Zweig JM.

Coerced treatment is ethically unjustif iable, especially when voluntary treatment can yield equal or more positive outcomes.159 More alternative strategies are emerging in various localities. Seattle recently instituted a pilot program known as \"Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion,\" or LEAD, the first pre - booking diversion program; it aims to bypass the criminal justice system entirely. Instead of arresting and booking people for certain drug law violations, including drug possession and low -level sales, police in a pair of Seattle neighborhoods w ill immediately direct them to drug treatment or other supportive services. LEAD allows law enforcement to focus on serious crime but to still play a key role in linking people with certain drug law violations to services before they enter the justice syst em.160 -162 In doing so, it has the potential to reshape law enforcement practices and culture. Seattle's policy resembles aspects of the health focus that many European countries, as well as Canada and others, have adopted: a public health policy orientation often termed a \"4 pillars approach.\" This comprehensive strategy is based on 4 principles \u2014harm reduction, prevention, treatment, and enforcement \u2014and it has demonstrated dramatic reductions in public drug consumption, overdose deaths, and HIV an d hepatitis infection rates.163 ,164 Programs such as LEAD, however, still rely on law enforcement as the primary point of contact with people who misuse substances. To be most successful, local, state, and national drug policies must empower health profession als to assess and deliver services to each individual. CHWs, for example, should be enabled (and given adequate resources) to serve as the point of contact, source of referrals and information, and service provider for certain low -threshold services direct ly. Ultimately, the removal of criminal sanctions in favor of optional, non -punitive, proportionate, administrative sanctions \u2014alongside a major expansion of proven, evidence -based harm reduction, treatment, and prevention services \u2014offers more promise in achieving a health -centered approach to drug misuse. Some commentators hope that 159 Stevens A. The ethics and effectiveness of coerced treatment of p eople who use drugs. Hum Rights Drugs. 2012;2(1):7 -16. 160 King County Government.

The refore, APHA: Urges Congress, the administration, and federal health agencies to convene relevant experts and stakeholders in the fields of public health, drug treatment, medicine, harm reduction, education and prevention, social work, and law enforcement , as well as people who currently use (or formerly used) drugs and affected communities, to critically review the effectiveness of current drug policies; to examine the potential public health gains of a range of new drug policies, including the decriminal ization of personal drug possession and use; to open a public debate about regulatory alternatives to drug prohibition in order to address the public health and safety harms of illicit drug markets; and to produce a policy environment that will be most con ducive to significantly expanding US treatment, education, and harm reduction programs. Urges federal, state, and local elected officials and agency staff to implement evidence -based and culturally appropriate prevention, regulatory, treatment, and harm r eduction interventions, including (but not limited to): Expanding proven, life -saving public health interventions and harm reduction and treatment programs, including medication -assisted treatment, and strengthening professional preparation and training i n these interventions for health care providers, CHWs, and public health, allied health, health education, and health communication professionals.

SIFs provide a clean, safe environment in which pre -obtained drugs can be consumed under clinical supervision with purpose of quickly rev ersing overdoses, providing medical care, and connecting people who inject drugs (PWID) with substance use treatment and care. This research was done in collaboration with DOHMH and with input from a technical advisory group made up of experts in SIF evalu ation. We present a summary of the results below. SIF Impact on preventing opioid overdose fatalities Based on 2015 -2016 NYC opioid overdose mortality data, implementing one SIF in the neighborhood with the most opioid overdose fatalities could prevent 19 to 37 opioid overdose fatalities per year , assuming no operational constraints on SIF hours or capacity. Based on 2015 -2016 data, up to 67 to 130 opioid overdose fatalities per year could be saved if 4 SIFs were placed in four neighborhoods with the most overdose fatalities . The estimate of opioid overdose fatalities prevented in the highest priority neighborhood is within the range of the estimated opioid overdose fatalities prevented annually by Vancouver's SIF (23 per year) and exceeds projected annual opioid overdoses prevented for proposed SIFs in San Francisco and Baltimore (0.24 and 5.9, respectively). Because of the recent upward trend of overdose fatalities in NYC, increasing 46% from 2015 to 2016, this forecast likely underestimates the imp act of SIFs on overdose mortality in 2017. Short -term cost impact to the health care system Opioid overdoses cost the NYC health care system an estimated $50 million per year for EMS calls, ED visits, hospitalizations. Approximately $6 million of these costs are associated with fatal opioid overdoses. 85 If one SIF was optimally placed, $1.0 million in health care system costs would be saved if all onsite opioid overdoses were avoided in the base case scenario. In an alternative scenario, $2.0 million in health care system costs would be saved if all opioid overdoses were avoided. If overdoses continued to occur at SIFs but EMS response and ED rates were at similar rates to those observed in Vancouver, $860,600 in health care system costs would be avoided in the base case scenario. If four SIFs were optimally placed, $3.6 million in health care system costs would be saved ($905,000 per SIF) if all onsite opioid overdoses were avoided in the base case scenario. If opioid overdoses continued to occur at SIFs but EMS response and ED rates were at similar rates to those observed in Vancouver, $2.7 million in health care system costs would be avoided in the base case scenario. Recommendations for future analyses to evaluate SIF impact on other health and cost outcomes Recommend additional analyses of fatal, non -fatal and averted opioid overdose estimates that take into account fentanyl use trends and the potential impact of synthetic opioids on opioid overdose estimates. Recommend analyses of SIF impact on reducing hepatitis C infections, reducing high cost medical care services (i.e., need for treatment of skin and soft tissue infections and endocarditis), and increasing opioid agonist treatment and other addiction treatment uptake. Recommend economic analy ses of cost -effectiveness and net monetary benefit of SIFs that also consider non -health care economic impacts, including law enforcement resource utilization and community impacts such as crime, public injection, and public disposal of syringes Backgroun d: Supervised injection facilities (SIFs) provide a clean, safe environment in which pre -obtained drugs can be consumed under clinical supervision with purpose of quickly reversing opioid overdoses, providing medical care, and connecting people who inject drugs (PWID) with substance use treatment and care. Given the rising rates of overdose fatalities in New York City reaching its all -time peak in 2016, SIFs may be one strategy to reduce opioid overdose mortality in NYC, and the cost of implementing SIFs ma y be offset in part by savings in health care system costs. Purpose : Researchers from the Weill Cornell Medicine Department of Health care Policy & Research, in collaboration with DOHMH, analyzed the potential opioid overdose -related health and health care system cost impacts of implementing SIFs in New York City, with input from a technical advisory group made up of experts in SIF evaluation. Limitations: While our estimates are based on the best NYC data sources available, we relied on the literature for several estimates. We received feedback on the face validity of those assumptions and assistance in identifying additional relevant sources from the technical advisory group and DOHMH. Base and alternate case estimates for fatal opioid overdoses preve nted under different scenarios were estimated. For costs, we provide a range of estimates to account for different assumptions of SIF impact. 86 Summary of Findings: 1) SIF Impact on preventing opioid overdose fatalities Based on 2015 -2016 NYC opioid overdose mortality data, implementing one SIF in the neighborhood with the most opioid overdose fatalities could prevent 19 to 37 opioid overdose fatalities per year , assuming no operational constraints on SIF hours or capacit y. Based on 2015 -2016 data, up to 67 to 130 opioid overdose fatalities per year could be saved if 4 SIFs were placed in four neighborhoods with the highest overdose fatalities . The estimate of opioid overdose fatalities prevented in the highest priority neighborhood is within the range of the estimated opioid overdose fatalities prevented annually by Vancouver's SIF (23 per year) and exceeds projected annual opioid overdoses prevented for proposed SIFs in San Francisco and Baltimore (0.24 and 5.9, respect ively). Because of the recent upward trend of overdose fatalities in NYC, increasing 46% from 2015 to 2016, this forecast likely underestimates the impact of SIFs on overdose mortality in 2017. 2) Short -term cost impact to the health care system Opioid overdoses cost the NYC health care system an estimated $50 million per year for EMS calls, ED visits, hospitalizations. Approximately $6 million of these costs are associated with fatal opioid overdoses. If one SIF was optimally placed, $1.0 million in hea lth care system costs would be saved if all onsite opioid overdoses were avoided in the base case scenario. In an alternative scenario, $2.0 million in health care system costs would be saved if all opioid overdoses were avoided. If overdoses continued to occur at SIFs but EMS response and ED rates were at similar rates to those observed in Vancouver, $860,600 in health care system costs would be avoided in the base case scenario. If four SIFs were optimally placed, $3.6 million in health care system costs would be saved ($905,000 per SIF) if all onsite opioid overdoses were avoided in the base case scenario. If opioid Overdoses continued to occur at SIFs but EMS response and ED rates were at similar rates to those observed in Vanc ouver, $2.7 million in health care system costs would be avoided in the base case scenario. 3) Recommendations for future analyses to evaluate SIF impact on other health and cost outcomes Recommend additional analyses of fatal, non -fatal and averted opioid overdose estimates that take into account fentanyl use trends and the potential impact of synthetic opioids on opioid overdose estimates. 87 Recommend analyses of SIF impact on reducing hepatitis C infections, reducing high cost medical care services (i.e., need for treatment of skin and soft tissue infections and endocarditis), and increasing opioid agonist treatment and other addiction treatment uptake. Recommend economic analyses of cost -effectiveness and net monetary benefit of SIFs that also consider non -health care economic impacts, including law enforcement resource utilization and community impacts such as crime, public injection, and public disposal of syringes. Benefits of current study: While there are limitations, this is one of few studies examining the cost impact of SIF implementation in North America. Two recent studies have examined the potential cost impact of establishing SIFs in two US cities: San Francisco and Baltimore. In comparison to these studies, we took a narrow er approach by focusing on opioid overdose impact only, and we forecast greater overdose impact since we account for greater geographical impact of overdoses in NYC and use local mortality data for estimates. Supervised injection facilities (SIFs) provide a clean, safe environment in which pre - obtained drugs can be consumed under clinical supervision with purpose of quickly reversing opioid overdoses, providing medical care, and connecting people who inject drugs (PWID) with substance use treatment and car e. In North America, Vancouver was the first city to implement a SIF in 2003 and most recently Montreal opened 3 SIFs in June 2017. To date, there is evidence that Vancouver's SIF reduced opioid overdose mortality, 1improved uptake of opioid use disorder t reatment,2 and reduced public injection drug use and public syringe disposal.3 Several studies have estimated the cost -effectiveness of SIFs based on preventing HIV and HCV infections4,5,6,7 and more recently two US studies have examined the economic impac t of implementing SIFs on a number of health outcomes8 with both of these studies indicating favorable economic impacts from SIF implementation.

Researchers from the Weill Cornell Medicine Department of Health care Policy & Research, in collaboration with DOHMH, analyzed the potential opioid overdose -related health impacts and health care cost impacts of implemen ting SIFs in New York City, with input from a technical advisory group made up of experts in SIF evaluation. In this report, the data sources, methods, results and implications from the following three aims are presented: 1. Develop scenario estimates of SI F impact on opioid overdose fatalities for NYC neighborhoods 2. Estimate short -term cost impact on the health care system from opioid overdoses prevented by SIFs 3. Recommend approaches for future analyses to evaluate SIF impact on other health and cost outcome s Aim #1: Develop scenario estimates of SIF impact on opioid overdose fatalities for NYC neighborhoods Data sources: Opioid mortality Data: Estimates of fatal opioid overdoses were derived from a mortality dataset provided by the NYC Office of the Chie f Medical Examiner and the NYC DOHMH Bureau of Vital Statistics for 2015 and 2016. Descriptive data are presented in Appendix I. Type of information provided: o type of location where the fatal opioid overdose occurred (e.g., deceased's own home, home of a friend or family member, public space), o whether the opioid overdose was a result of heroin or other opioid use, and o the zipcode where the opioid overdose occurred. IDUHA (Injection Drug User Health Alliance) survey: The IDUHA survey collected information from clients of all 14 syringe exchange programs in NYC with a sample size of 814 for the two combined years of dat a (June 2013 -2014 and June 2014 -2015). Respondent demographics are described in Appendix I. Type of information provided: o Estimate of travel distance to a syringe exchange program (SEP) that serves as a proxy for willingness to travel to a SIF in our mod elProportion of people who inject drugs (PWID) who do not primarily inject in their own home or the home of a friend or family member (\"public\" injection). Office of Alcoholism and Substance Abuse Services (OASAS) data set: OASAS collects mandatory data on admissions and discharges from all certified chemical dependence treatment programs in New York State. 89 Type of information provided: We estimated the average percentage of heroin and non -heroin opioid users who inject among those who entered detoxifica tion (crisis admissions). Literature Review: We conducted literature reviews to identify additional inputs for our model, and to contextualize inputs from NYC data for face validity. We limited these literature reviews to studies conducted in the USA and Canada because we felt the opioid epidemics, substance use disorder treatment systems, and health care delivery systems in other countries would not be generalizable to NYC. Methods: Geographical Distribution of Opioid Overdose Fatalities NYC is made up of five boroughs (Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens, and Staten Island). There are 42 United Hospital Fund neighborhoods (UHFs) designated to approximate NYC community planning districts distributed across the boroughs (7 in the Bronx, 11 in Brooklyn, 10 in Manhattan, 10 in Queens, and 4 in Staten Island). We selected UHF neighborhoods as the main unit of geographical analysis for identifying opioid overdose hotspots, with the advantages of being a measure frequently used by DOHMH for evaluation and havin g zipcodes uniquely assigned to only one UHF (unlike boroughs or precincts where zipcodes can cross several boundaries). The combined numbers of fatal opioid overdoses for 2015 and 2016 were mapped at the zipcode and UHF level. UHFs with a greater than av erage number of opioid overdose fatalities were chosen for further analysis as potential sites for SIF placement, resulting in 16 of 42 UHFs being selected for further evaluation. These 16 UHFs accounted for 60.3 % of the 1,852 fatal opioid overdoses recor ded in 2015 -2016. All zipcodes within each UHF were ranked according to the number of 2015 -2016 opioid overdose fatalities. Optimal hypothetical SIF placement for was weighted by the number of opioid overdose fatalities within each zipcode. Thus, SIFs were placed closer to the geographic centers of zipcodes containing the most opioid overdose fatalities. SIF placements were implemented in ArcGIS, version 10.2.1 and were not constrained by actual geographical physical limitations such as highways or parks. Projection of Opioid Overdose Fatalities Prevented After placing a theoretical SIF within each UHF, the number of fatal opioid overdoses that could have been avoided by establishing the SIF was estima ted using the following equation . Potential fa tal overdoses avoided (assuming all fatal overdoses are avoided in a SIF) = Number of fatal overdoses Proportion of IDU willing to travel to a SIF at a given distance from the theoretical SIF Proportion of IDU willing to use a SIF 90 Proportion of fatal overdoses due to IDU Proportion of IDU overdos es that occur outside the home I. Number of Opioid overdoses/Willingness to travel: For each SIF, the number of fatal opioid overdoses that may be prevented is partly influenced by the number of PWID wh o would have traveled to the SIF location. We used the IDUHA data set to estimate the distance between the address of the SEP used and the center of the zipcode where the participant last slept. While there were PWID who reported traveling further than 3 m iles to the SEP, we assumed that PWID would not travel more than 3 miles to a SIF because of more frequent expected use of a SIF versus an SEP. A literature review (Appendix II) found that the median distance traveled to an SEP calculated from IDUHA data i s similar to that reported in the literature. We established concentric rings around each hypothetical SIF at different distances (0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0 miles) that represented different probabilities of traveling to a SIF that were red uced as distances from the SIF increased. The proportions of PWID who would travel to a SIF at each distance were estimated directly from the IDUHA data, and applied as cumulative proportions (Figure 1). Based on the distribution of willingness to tra vel at each distance from the SIF, the proportion of PWID who experienced a fatal opioid overdose and would have traveled to a SIF is then estimated for each SIF (Figure 2). In order to estimate the maximum potential impact of each SIF, we include opioid o verdoses in contiguous UHFs and do not consider whether or not SIFs have been established in adjacent UHFs when calculating the potential number of fatal opioid overdoses that may be reached by each SIF 1.5 2 2.5 3Percentage of SEP clients Miles traveledFigure 1: Cumulative Proportion Estimated Willing to travel to a SIF or SEP (Source: IDUHA Survey) 91 II. Willingness to use a SIF: We conducted a literature review regarding the willingness of PWID to use a SIF (Appendix III) because we did not have any SIF -specific data from representative samples of PWID in NYC. Since SIF knowledge and education has improved over time, we focused on the most recent studies to estimate the percentage of PWID who would be willing to use a SIF.9,10 III. Proportion of overdoses that result from injection drug use: Because SIFs currently under consideration for NYC are spaces for PWID only, we limi ted the potential number of fatal opioid overdoses avoided to those associated with injection drug use. We estimate the proportion of heroin and non -heroin opioid users who inject from the OASAS crisis admissions data set for NYC, and also conducted a lite rature review in which we found results consistent with the estimates from the OASAS data (Appendix IV). IV. Proportion of overdoses that result from injection in public spaces (outside the home) In our base case scenario, we focused on individuals who primarily do not inject at home or the home of friends or family (i.e., \"public injectors\"), assuming this population would be most likely to use a SIF regularly for their injections. Given this assu mption, we used IDUHA data to determine the proportion of PWID who fit this definition. We also conducted a literature review to assess the range of estimates for proportion of people who primarily 9 Low D.

Drug Alcohol Depend. 2010;110(1 -2):160 -163. 92 inject in public spaces, but found the definitions of \"pub lic injection\" varied across studies (Appendix V). Analysis: Base Case Scenario: Data for our base -case scenario were derived from both the literature and NYC -specific data sources ( Table 1 ), and we assumed SIF access unconstrained by hours of operation or physical capacity. We make a conservative assumption that people who primarily inject in their home or the home of a friend or family member would not have an overdose averted in a SIF, as they would not attend a SIF regularly for their injections. Alternative Scenario: We include an alternative case where we assume some of those PWID who primarily inject in private spaces would attend a SIF regularly, using estimates of their willingness to attend a SIF from the literature, substantially increasing th e potential number of opioid overdoses avoided. We consider this an upper range estimate of the potential impact on the number of fatal opioid overdoses averted. Vancouver comparison: We compare the results of the base and alternative cases to a scenario in which our outcomes match those reported for the Vancouver, BC SIF (INSITE), which was associated with a 35% reduction of overdose fatality rates in one year within 500 meters of the SIF and no wider impact.1 We applied this assumption to a half mile radius (~800 meter s) around each hypothetical SIF, with no impact beyond this radius.

Am J Drug Alcohol Abuse. 2012;38(1):55 -62. 93 Results (Table 2): Using 2015 -2016 mortality data, implementing one SIF in the neighborhood with the most opioid overdose fatalities could prevent up to 19 opioid overdose fatalities per year in the base case scenario and up to 37 opioid overdose fatalities in the alternative scenario, assuming no operational constraints on SIF hours or capacity. For the highest priority neighborhood's 3 -mile radius, these estimates represent a 7% decrease in fatal opioid overdoses in the ba se case scenario and 14% decrease for the alternative case scenario . Based on 2015 -2016 data, up to 67 to 130 opioid overdose fatalities per year could be saved if 4 SIFs were placed in four neighborhoods with the most overdose fatalities . The estimate of 19-37 opioid overdose fatalities prevented with one SIF in the highest priority neighborhood is within the range of the number opioid overdose fatalities prevented by Vancouver's SIF (23 per year) and exceeds the projected number of opioid overdoses prevented annually by one SIF in San Francisco and Baltimore (0.24 and 5.9, respectively). Estimates for each neighborhood are also consistent with the comparison where we applied the neig hborhood impact observed in Vancouver to the half mile radius around each hypothetical SIF in NYC. Because overdose fatalities in NYC increased 46% from 2015 to 2016 in NYC due to increased fatalities associated with fentanyl use, this forecast likely unde restimates the impact of SIFS on overdose mortality in 2017. 94 Table 2: Projected Maximum Number of Fatal Opioid Overdoses Avoided Annually by Implementing a Supervised Injection Facility in Each of the Most Affected NYC Neighborhoods (Based on 2015 -2016 Overdose Fatality Data) UHF Neighborhood (Rank Order) Base Case Estimate Alternative Case Estimate Comparison Based on Vancouver BC Outcomes* 1 19 37 24 2 18 35 31 3 15 29 37 4 15 29 46 5 15 28 16 6 11 21 18 7 10 20 26 8 10 20 14 9 10 19 20 10 8 15 10 11 7 13 21 12 6 12 21 13 5 10 7 14 4 9 9 15 4 8 10 16 4 7 3 * Represents the opioid overdoses prevented based on Vancouver's percentage decrease in opioid overdoses within 500 meters applied to a half mile radius of each theoretical SIF in NYC. These numbers do not represent the actual number of overdoses prevented in Vancouver, which were reported to be 23 per year.1 Limitations: Some model inputs are based on self -reported drug use behavior and willingness to use a SIF. Due to lack of data, SIF attendance assumptions in the base and alternate cases do not include the proportion of daily injections that might occur at a SIF among attendees. This may vary substantially depending on a variety of individual and SIF characteri stics, in addition to whether attendees primarily inject in public or private spaces. We used an estimate of the proportion of heroin and non -heroin users who inject from the OASAS database, which reflect drug use behavior among substance use treatment cl ients. People who inject drugs are more likely to experience a fatal opioid overdose than non -injectors.12,13 As a result, we may have underestimated the proportion of fatal opioid overdoses attributable to injection drug use. 12 Galea S, Nandi A, Coffin PO, et al. Heroin and cocaine dependence and the r isk of accidental non -fatal drug overdose. J Addict Dis. 2006;25(3):79 -87. 13 New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. Unpublished Data. 2009. 95 The combined impact of implementing 4 SIFs may overstate their impact since the potential number of opioid overdoses prevented by each theoretical SIF was estimated assuming no other SIFs; there may be overlapping impact of SIFs implemented within 3 miles of each other. The impact of each SIF may be understated because there may be \"spillover\" effects of a SIF in preventing over doses for injections that occur outside of the facility due to increased naloxone distribution and overdose prevention education that are not accounted for in these estimates. Our analysis used the average of 2015 -2016 overdose data for each neighborhood i n order to ensure stable sample sizes. Given the increasing trend of overdoses occurring in NYC between 2015 and 2016, if SIFs are implemented in 2017 their impact may be greater and there may be some differences in impact by neighborhood. Aim #2: Short -term cost impact to health care system from opioid overdoses prevented by a SIF Data Sources: Mortality Data: The number of fatal opioid overdoses was derived from the analysis of 2015 -2016 data in Aim #1. Types of information provided: o Information abou t the number of opioid overdose fatalities that occur in the hospital Syndromic surveillance data set: The syndromic data set is emergency room surveillance data that is reported to DOHMH. Types of information provided: o The relative frequency of non -fatal opioid overdoses was estimated using syndromic data; total number of non -fatal opioid overdoses in NYC is 10 times the number of fatal opioid overdoses. o While the syndromic data set is an accurate count of total non -fatal opioid overdoses, there is uncertainty around the geographical distribution of the non-fatal opioid overdoses due to non -random missing information on the location of where these overdoses occurred. We account for these limitations in the data by using an estimated factor of 10 non -fatal opioid overdoses for each identified fatal opioid overdose, so that the non -fatal opioid overdoses were assumed to be distributed similarly to the fatal opioid overdoses by geographic location. o Use of EMS was estimated fro m the 2015 syndromic data set, which had more consistent reporting of ambulance use. Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System (SPARCS): SPARCS is a comprehensive all payer data reporting system that covers outpatient and inpatient 96 admissions, including ED visits. 2014 data is used because 2015 data were not available at the time this analysis was conducted. Types of information provided: o We identified non -fatal and fatal opioid overdoses in this database discharged from the ED or an inpatient setting from NYC hospitals. More information on how opioid overdoses were defined in the SPARCS dataset is available in Appendix VI. o Health care utilization per fatal and non -fatal opioid overdose event was estimated using this data and applied to the total fatal overdoses and non - fatal overdose estimates. o Based on information from a chart review of emergency department (ED) opioid overdoses conduct ed by NYC DOHMH and the literature, the ED data in SPARCS was determined to be underreported for non -fatal opioid overdoses. In place of the SPARCS estimates for non -fatal ED utilization and ED to inpatient transfers, we used percentages from the chart rev iew (28% ED to inpatient admissions). The remaining estimates of health care services utilization comes directly from SPARCS, including direct inpatient admissions and fatal opioid overdose health care services utilization. Methods: Health care Services U tilization: A decision analytic framework was used to assign utilization of EMS, ED, and inpatient services, taking into consideration fatal and non -fatal opioid overdoses (Figure 3). Figure 3: Decision Tree of Health care Services Utilization from Opioi d Overdoses 97 Health care services utilization per opioid overdose event for EMS services, ED discharges, and inpatient discharges are described in Table 3. Among non -fatal opioid overdoses that were treated at a hospital, most resulted from an EMS call and almost three quarters were discharged after an ED visit. Among all fatal opioid overdoses, one quarter died in the hospital with the majority dying in an inpatient setting. We assume that among all fatal opioid overdoses an EMS call occurred 90% of the ti me, with the response for the other 10% coming directly from the Office of the Medical Examiner. Table 3: Utilization of health care services by non -fatal and fatal opioid overdoses in NYC for 2014 % of non - fatal opioid overdoses treated at the hospital % of all fatal opioid overdoses Emergency Medical Service Calls Emergency Medical Services (EMS) called for hospital transport 90% 90%* Other transportation used to hospital or morgue 10% 10% Total transportation utilization 100% 100% Hospital Service Fatal opioid overdose outside of hospital setting 0% 74% Discharged from emergency department (ED) or died in ED 72% 2% Discharged from inpatient stay or died in inpatient 28% 24% Total hospital service utilization 100% 100% is assumed to be 90% for fatal opioid overdoses. Assumption that 10% of 911 calls for fatal opioid overdoses results in the office of medical examiner directly transporting to morgue Cost Measures: Costs were assigned to each outcome from the perspective of the NYC health care system. We used NYC area Medicare fee -for-service payment estimates as proxies for provider costs, because these payments are designed to reimburse providers for the resources that would be used to treat a typical patient with a given condition and are adjusted for a number of relevant factors that are unique to the patient or provider. Costs are understated in that they do not include physician costs that are billed separately to patients or insurers, but this approach is consistent with several studies where physician costs are not included 98 or reported separately.1415 All costs are reported in 2016 US dollars; cost sources from earlier years were converted to 2016 US dollars using the NYC -area medical -care Consumer Price Index.16 Emergency medical services (EMS) unit cost. The mean cost of an ambulance call was estimated using Medicare urban ground adjusted base rates for basic and advanced life support rides in NYC.17 The mean basic and advanced life support rates were weighted by the proportion of observed rides reported nationally by the Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General,18 because no relevant local data were available. Emergency dep artment (ED) unit cost. Medicare reimburses ED visits using ambulatory payment classification (APC) codes. However, these codes were not available for many of the opioid overdose patients discharged from the ED in the SPARCS database; therefore, we calcula ted the mean Medicare reimbursement rate for an ED visit using data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS).19 Through MEPS we were able to calculate a nationally -representative mean Medicare payment for an ED visit. Inpatient unit cost. Medicare reimburses fo r inpatient stays according to the patient's assigned diagnosis -related group (DRG).20 Each DRG represents a clinically similar group of patients that, on average, would be expected to utilize the same quantity of resources. Generally, the amount that Medic are reimburses for each DRG is a function of the base rate (i.e., the mean operating cost for a typical inpatient stay), the DRG weight that reflects the resources used relative to the base case, local wage rates, hospital teaching and disproportionate -share status, and outlier costs for cases that are exceptionally resource - intensive. Four DRG codes accounted for approximately 85% of all opioid overdose inpatient stays in SPARCS. Costs differences among these DRGs are consistent with differences in the ave rage length of stay and proportion with intensive care unit stays; fatal opioid overdoses were also more likely to be assigned higher cost DRGs (see Appendix VII for inpatient cost calculations). 14 Inocencio TJ, Carroll NV, Read EJ, Holdford DA.

Cost Calculations: Health care services utilization and the cost measures described above were used to determine: Current costs to the health care system from opioid overdoses Cost savings from implementing 1 SIF assuming all opioid overdoses that occur at the SIF are avoided or required no health care service utilization outside of the SIF Cost savings from implementing 4 SIFs assuming all opioid overdoses that occur at the SIF are avoided or required no health care service utilization outside of the SIF Cost savings from implementing 1 SIF and 4 SIFs assuming that 39% of opioid overdoses that occurred on site resulted in an ambulance call and 28% of those overdoses resulted in a transfer to the hospital as was observed at the Vancouver SIF, INSITE.21 Results: Current Health care Costs: Opioid overdoses cost the NYC health care system an estimated $50 million per year for EMS calls, ED visits, hospitalizations. Approximately $ 6 million of these costs are associated with fatal opioid overdoses (See Appendix VIII for cost estimate tables) . average cost opioid overdose was approximately per Implementation: If one SIF was optimally placed, $1.0 million in health care system costs would be saved if all onsite opioid overdoses were avoided in the base case scenario. 21 Kerr T, Tyndall MW, Lai C, Montaner JSG, Wood E. Drug -related overdoses within a medically supervised safer injection facility. Internatio nal Journal of Drug Policy. 2006;17(5):436 -441. 100 In an alternative scenario, $2.0 million in health care system costs would be saved if all opioid overdoses were avoided. If overdoses continued to occur at SIFs but EMS response and ED rates were at similar rates to those observed in Vancouver, $860,600 in health care system costs would be avoided in the base case scenario. If four SIFs were optimally placed, $3.6 million in health care system costs would be saved ($905,000 per SIF) if all onsite opioid overdoses were avoided in the base case scenario. If opioid overdoses continued to occur at SIFs but EMS response and ED rates were at similar rates to those observed in Vancouver, $2.7 million in health care system costs would be avoided in the base case scenario. Cost savings are derived primarily from avoided hospitalizations (84% of savings), followed by avo ided ED visits without hospitalizations (9%) and avoided EMS transports (7%). Approximately 88% of savings are from non -fatal opioid overdoses and 12% of savings are from fatal opioid overdoses . Limitations The health care service utilization data derived from SPARCS may not be representative of all opioid overdoses in NYC; the total number of opioid overdose cases identified in the SPARCS data set are substantially lower than the number of ED admissions estimated from the syndromic data. While we accounted for the fact that the ED data was underreported in SPARCS, we assumed that fatal opioid overdoses and inpatient stays were more consistently reported in SPARCS. A national ED cost was estimated instead of a NYC -specific cost for opioid overdoses, which may underestimate actual ED costs for NYC We were unable to identify NYC -specific data on EMS reimbursement codes regarding the use of life support when responding to opioid overdoses, resulting in applying national basic a nd advanced life support utilization to NYC -specific EMS costs for a weighted mean cost. In our sensitivity analysis we used the experience at INSITE in Vancouver to estimate health care utilization for responding to opioid overdoses occurring at a SIF; h owever, the NYC local practice may differ regarding whether or not to call EMS for opioid overdoses occurring at a SIF. If EMS is more likely to be called in NYC the estimated cost savings may be lower, although opioid overdoses transported from a SIF may be less likely to result in a high cost inpatient admission. Health care savings from other improved outcomes such as preventing hepatitis C, providing onsite wound care, and substance use treatment referrals (see Aim #3) and estimates of the costs of ope rating a SIF would be essential for providing an accurate estimate of the net economic impact of SIFs on the health care system. Aim #3: Recommend approaches for future analyses to evaluate SIF impact on other health and societal cost outcomes The implem entation of a SIF provides benefits beyond reversing opioid overdoses; therefore, we recommend that further analyses be conducted to better understand the total impact that a SIF would have on health and other related outcomes. Further analyses in 101 these ar eas would also allow for more in depth economic impact analyses of cost - effectiveness and net monetary benefit of establishing SIFs. Further areas of analysis are described below. Impact of Synthetic Opioids on Estimates Rationale/Recommendation: The rates of opioid -related fatalities are increasing in the northeast United States due to the increasing amount of synthetic opioids such as fentanyl in the heroin and cocaine supply.22,23 Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid that is 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine. SIFs may be more effective at reversing fentanyl -induced overdoses since these overdoses typically require multiple naloxone doses that exceed the amount that people may have at home. Use of local neighborhood data on synthetic opioid use as it relates to overdose fatalities is recommended to develop additional SIF impact scenarios; otherwise a multiplier for recent overall trends could be applied to the existing estimates. Criminal Justice and Community Impact: Rationale/Recommendation: Evidenc e from Vancouver's SIF shows that there was no significant increase in crime after opening24, but public injection and disposal of used syringes in public spaces significantly decreased.25 Thus, while the impact on the criminal justice system is not expected to increase from opening a SIF, a SIF could potentially reduce police responses to 911 calls for opioid overdoses thereby improving law enforcement resource utilization. We recommend estimating this potential impact on police response using law enforcemen t data from the NYC police department. Because there is evidence of potential improvement in public injection and public disposal of needles, estimating the potential economic impact on neighborhoods in terms of societal benefit is also recommended. HIV Rationale/Recommendation: In contrast to studies that have examined the impact of SIFs on HIV in Canada,7,26 ,27 the very low incidence of HIV among PWID in NYC (0.14 new 22 NYC Health.

CMAJ. 2008;179(11):1143 -1151. 102 diagnoses per 100 person year)28 suggests that unless incidence patterns change HIV prevention can reasonably be excluded from fu ture analyses of SIF impact for NYC. Hepatitis C Rationale: The cost -effectiveness of SIFs in Canada has been previously modeled taking into account impact on Hepatitis C (HCV) prevention,5,6,29, 29 but to date, no such cost - effectiveness analysis has been conducte d in the United States. Because of the high prevalence (60%) and incidence of hepatitis C among PWID in NYC and high cost of treatment,30 determining the potential impact of SIFs on HCV transmission is important for understanding the full impact of SIFs on health outcomes. Recommendations: We recommend conducting a NYC -specific modeling study of the impact of SIF implementation in NYC on HCV transmission, similar to a study recently published for Toronto and Ottawa.31 The model used in that study incorporated geographic location and the combined impact of multiple SIFs, which would be amenable to the situation in NYC where substance use is geographically dispersed. Potential data to use as inputs to this model would include HCV and mortality data from DOHMH, as well as needle and equipment sharing behavior data from IDUHA. Medical care services Rationale: Skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) are prevalent among PWID due to muscle or skin injection and are one of the most common causes for ED and hospital admissions for this group.31,32 The two recent studies tha t examined net monetary benefits of SIFs in San Francisco and Baltimore both considered SSTIs, but acknowledged limitations of lack of data on both rates of infection and costs.8,9 Nevertheless, estimating the impact of providing wound care services at SIFs, and the resulting savings to the health care system would be valuable. 28 Des Jarlais DC, Arasteh K, McKnight C, et al.

Drug Users Seeking Emergency Care for Soft Tissue Infection at High Risk for Subsequent Hospitalization and Death. Journal of Studies on Alcohol and Drugs. 2008;69(6):924 -932. 103 Endocarditis: Safer injection practice can also reduc e the risk of endocarditis, a heart infection, more common among PWID who use used syringes for injection.33,34,35,36,37 No other studies have projected the impact of SIFs on reducing the risk of endocarditis and associated health care costs, but endocarditis is a very expensive health condition that often requires hospitalization or expensive outpatient treatment,37 and we recommend taking it into consideration. Recommendations: Data from SPARCS could be used to identify DRGs most frequently associated with SSTI and endocarditis admissions. The proportion of clients receiving these medical care services and the likelihood that these clients might have been treated at a hospital in the absence of onsite care may be estimated from the literature and interviews with NYC SEP programs providing these services. Projections of the potential cost savings to the health care sector from improved wound care should be conducted in the context of defining SIF delivery models, such as whether the SIF would be located at site that already provides wound care services to PWID, would provide these services on -site de novo , or would provide medical referrals for this care. 38, 39Projections should also take into account current medical service delivery capacity (providers and hours) and potential increased demand from new SIF clients versus existing clients newly accessing SIF services. Substance use disorder and addiction treatment Rationale: Offering substance use disorder treatment, particularly opioid agonist treatment (OAT), is crucial to helping PWID mitigate and potentially eliminate illicit drug use. The studies in San Francisco and Baltimore8,9 that examined the economic benefit projected increased uptake of OAT based on data from a SIF in Sydney, Australia that provided OAT referrals.40 Examining the impact of OAT and ad diction treatment uptake is an important outcome, as SIFs provide an opportunity for regular contact with health care 33 Axelsson A, Soholm H, Dalsgaard M, et al.

Recommendations: For NYC, estimates fo r OAT treatment referrals should take into account location and referral patterns of possible SIF delivery models. For example, if a SIF were to be co -located at an SEP, the OAT referral history for the types of SEPs being considered should be used in maki ng these estimates, taking into account how much the SEP will be serving new SIF clients versus existing clients newly accessing SIF services. Once referral rate estimates are determined, existing literature and potentially data from OASAS can be used to p roject the impact of OAT enrollment on health care system and societal costs.41 41 Murphy SM, Polsky D.

For the NYC Bureau of Vital Statistics/Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, overd ose death location was similarly classified as private if it occurred in the home of the deceased or a friend or family of the deceased. **For drug of injection, IDUHA survey respondents were asked if they used heroin, other opioids, and a number of other drugs in the past 30 days. For the NYC Bureau of Vital Statistics/Office of the Chief Medical Examiner heroin, fentanyl, and other opioid s could all be present in an overdose. Overdoses with opioids present but without the presence of heroin or fentanyl were classified as other overdo ses. 106 Literature Review Appendix Willingness to Travel to a SIF The following table details the findings from a literature review of peer -reviewed studies on the distance that people who use drugs would travel to use a supervised injection facility.

For completeness we looked at willingness to use a SIF in different settings and among diff erent populations, but did not include these values in our estimates. Study Willing to use SIF Sample Sample Descriptio n Location Notes Willingness to use a SIF (general) Shaw et al. (2015)6 75.2% 270 PWID who injected in past 12 months Ottawa 50.7% of those who want a SIF reported they would use it daily. 45.8% of those who responded in favor of a SIF injected heroin in previous year, 46.3% reported injecting opiates a few times a week or more. 80% of this SIF group were homeless in past 12 mon ths and 60% per unstably housed. 82.7% injects in public and 83.5% overdosed in past 12 months.

Harm Reduct J. 2015;12:49. 110 Leonard, DeRubeis, & Strike (2008)7 64.0% 250 PWID who injected in past 6 months Ottawa 64% reported would use a SIF; 14% reported they might use a SIF. 86% reported they would use the SIF if located in a convenient location. Among these respondents, 45% women and 32% men said they would always use a SIF to inject. 58% of both women and men i ndicated they would use a SIF if it was located in a pre -existing service they already used. 93% of women and 82% of men indicated they would be willing to use standalone SIF. 23% of respondents reported at least one non -fatal OD in prior 6 months. 24 resp ondents reported last OD occurred in public space. Sample: Recruitment in 2005. 180 men and 70 women were surveyed. Top 3 drugs injected were cocaine, crack cocaine, & morphine. Top 3 reasons for both men & women were the ability to get clean sterile inje ction equipment, ability to inject in private vs. public, & to be safe from police. Green et al. (2004)8 76.0% 251 PWID who injected in public or semi -public in the past 6 months Montreal Public injectors with histories of cocaine or heroin overdose and injection drug use who injected at least weekly were significantly more likely to be willing to use SIF. 83% who are willing to use SIF have ever experienced an overdose. Drug of Choice : Mo st willing to use SIF were cocaine users (78%), but that is because injection drug use in Montreal is cocaine centered. Sample : SurvUDI study (surveillance project) on PWID in past 6 months. Sampled from 12 recruiting sites from April 2001 to February 2002, but most of the sample came from downtown SEP (93.6%). 7 Leonard L, DeRubeis E, Strike C.

This brief memorandum will evaluate potential legal challenges to ope rating a SIF in New York City, as well as several legal pathways for establishing a local SIF. This memorandum will outline challenges for SIF clients, criminal and civil law issues for SIF staff and property owners, specific concerns for licensed health care providers who practice at SIFs, and potential avenues for SIF implementation in New York City. I. Federal, State, and Local Law Challenges for a New York City SIF A. Legal Challenges for SIF Clients The federal Controlled Substances Act (CSA)1 poses p otential legal difficulties for SIF clients in any state. Clients of the SIF who bring controlled substances on the premises would violate \u00a7 844 of the CSA, which penalizes persons for \"knowingly or intentionally possess[ing] a controlled substance.\"2 Pena lties for an initial violation include a minimum fine of $1,000 and/or imprisonment up to one year, with larger penalties for subsequent offenses. Where users possess drugs with an intention to distribute them to other people, \u00a7 841 levies steep additional penalties, depending on the type and amount of the substance.3 People who use drugs run the risk of arrest in any location where they possess controlled substances, but a SIF could present a known location for enforcement efforts. Clients' possession of controlled substances and paraphernalia would also violate several state criminal laws, principally N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 220.03, which criminalizes the possession of small amounts of controlled substances as a misdemeanor.4 Prosecutions for possessing extremel y small amounts of controlled substances, including residue, are within the letter 1 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 801 et seq. (2017). 2 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 844 (2017). This section exempts persons who possess a controlled substance with a \"valid prescription\" from a practitioner acting in t he scope of professional practice, but clients with nonprescription substances will violate the statute. 3 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 (2017). 4 N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 220.03 (2017). A separate section criminalizes the possession of marijuana, which may be relevant for some SIF clients, N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 221.05 (2017). Possession of small quantities is a misdemeanor; larger quantities incur felony charges. 131 of the federal CSA.5 N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 220.03, however, explicitly permits syringe exchange program (SEP) clients to possess trace amounts of controlled substances in used sy ringes, in order to facilitate SEP use.6 It is useful to note that this exemption was initially established in federal court as a logical extension of the New York state law enabling SEP program operation.7 A revision to the statute in 2010 subsequently co dified the SEP participant exception for trace amounts. If SIFs are authorized by state law, similar reasoning may allow courts to find that this state statute impliedly exempts SIF clients from possession laws for the purposes of using a SIF. N.Y. Penal L aw \u00a7 220.45 similarly criminalizes the possession of \"hypodermic instruments,\" including syringes and needles, but provides a parallel exemption for SEP clients and program personnel.8 A separate section of the penal code, \u00a7 220.50, also criminalizes the p ossession of certain drug paraphernalia, including \"dilutants or adulterants\" for preparing drugs.9 (There is no SEP client exemption for these materials, which are more likely to be used in manufacturing.) In addition to extending the exemptions availabl e to SEP clients, SIF clients may also benefit from N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 220.78, also known as the state's \"Good Samaritan\" law. Like the majority of state legislatures that passed such laws, the New York State Legislature enacted this law primarily to promote access to emergency services for people experiencing drug overdoses.10 Under this statute, anyone \"w ho, in good faith, seeks health care for someone who is experiencing a drug overdose or other life threatening medical emergency\" is exempt from being charg ed or prosecuted for drug possession, paraphernalia, or possession of alcohol by a minor.11 This exemption extends to any possession or paraphernalia that is discovered \"as a result of such seeking or receiving health care ,\" and it extends to both the victi m and those who seek care on their behalf.12 Seeking medical care for an overdose or other medical emergency may also be an affirmative defense to some criminal sales of controlled substances, depending on prior convictions.13 This may provide some protectio n for SIF clients and staff who come in 5 See, e.g. , U.S. v. Jones, 531 F.3d 163 (2d Cir. 2008). 6 Roe v. City of New York, 232 F. Supp. 2d 240 (S.D.N.Y. 2002) ( interpreting an earlier version N.Y. Penal L. \u00a7 220.03, and noting that \"[i[t would be bizarre to conclude that the Legislative intent was to permit the creation of needle exchange programs in order to remove dirty needles, while at the same time frustrati ng that goal by making the essential steps of participation criminal\"). The current statute specifically exempts residual amounts \"in or on a hypodermic syringe . . . obtained and possessed\" N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 220.03 (2017 ). 7 Id. 8 See also N.Y. Public Health Law \u00a7 3381, which echoes the criminal prohibition on possession or provision of hypodermic syringes, but provides for the authorization of syringe exchange programs (SEPs) that qualify for exemption from this law. 9 The remainder of this provision is more tailored to paraphernalia used for \"manufacturing, packaging, or dispensing,\" such as scales and vials; there are no exemptions for SEPs. 10 See National Conference of State Legislatures, Drug Overdose Immunity and Goo d Samaritan -immunity -good -samaritan - laws.aspx (noting that as of now, 40 states maintain Good Samaritan drug immunity laws). June 5, 2017. 11 N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 220.78 (2017); see als o N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 220.03 (2017) (providing for this exemption). 12 N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 220.78 (2017) 13 N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 220.78(4) (2017). 132 contact with law enforcement during overdose responses. Indeed, there may be an argument that this blanket exemption extends to all SIF clients and personnel, since using a SIF may be viewed as a preventive form of s eeking emergency care for overdose. Importantly, however, this law can only extend exemptions for state drug offenses, rather than federal offenses under the CSA. Additional liabilities for SIF clients may depend on specific activities or substances used within the SIF. For example, should SIF clients offer one another direct assistance with injecting, they may violate N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 220.46, which criminalizes injecting \"a narcotic drug\" into another person's body with that person's consent, as a class E felony.14 Sharing drugs in the SIF may also qualify as \"sales\" under state law15 or \"distribution\" under federal law,16 which would expose clients to additional charges in the event of arrest. New York City's local laws may also present challenges, particula rly Administrative Code \u00a7 10 -203, which imposes criminal and civil penalties for the \"manufacture, distribution, or sale\" of synthetic cannabinoids or phenethylamine, including possession with an intent to sell. (These \"designer drugs\" evolve quickly to ev ade listing on controlled substances schedules, which has prompted a response through local law while awaiting the inclusion of these drugs in state and federal statutes.) B. Legal Challenges for SIF Staff and Property Owners This section will consider cr iminal law challenges arising under federal, state, and local law, followed by questions regarding civil liability. 1. Criminal Law Like SIF clients, SIF staff and owners will face some uncertainty under federal, state, and local law. Most significantly, \u00a7 856 of the federal CSA \u2014often cited as the \"Crack House\" statute \u2014imposes criminal penalties on persons who \"knowingly open, lease, rent, use, or maintain any place . . . for the purpose of . . . using any controlled substance,\" or who \"manage or control an y place . . . and knowingly and intentionally available for use the purpose of unlawfully . . . using a controlled substance.\"17 These provisions may extend to the activities of SIF staff, as well as the owners of properties that h ouse SIFs. Penalties may include fines of up to $500,000 for individuals, $2,000,000 for institutions, and imprisonment. SIF staff and owners may also be vulnerable to claims that they 14 N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 220.46 (2017). Prosecutions under this statute require that the injector \"unlawfully possess\" the drug. If a court or the legislature found an exemption to possession laws under \u00a7 220.03 to enable SEP operation, the element of \"unlawful p ossession\" would be absent. 15 Sales are defined under New York law to include gifts and exchanges. See N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 220.00(1) (2017). 16 on site under \u00a7 844 or \u00a7 841(a)(1), although this i s a weaker theory compared to the \u00a7 856 violation.18 In the event that a SIF is prosecuted and found liable for a \u00a7 856 violation, SIF owners may also experience additional penalties under \u00a7 881 of the CSA.19 This section extinguishes private property right s in any property used to commit a CSA violation, including controlled substances, vehicles, books and records, money, and real property, including buildings and land.20 This property would be transferred to the federal government under custody of the U.S. Attorney General, who may then sell it or transfer it to the state for public use.21 The case law under \u00a7 856 does not include any prosecutions of harm reduction facilities on the basis of clients' drug use on the premises, and this may be a low priority fo r federal drug enforcement and prosecution. But a SIF that explicitly supervises drug consumption would be a legal first in the United States, and it is difficult to predict how federal prosecutors may respond. There has been at least one public effort to encourage the Attorney General to enforce \u00a7 856 against a potential SIF in Washington state, should one successfully open.22 At an extreme, federal agencies could also attempt to withhold federal grants from jurisdictions that are viewed as noncompliant wit h a requirement of federal law, such as \u00a7 856.23 If the legislative branch were to oppose SIF implementation by states, Congress could impose similarly restrictive conditions on receipt of all federal funding, or it could specify that federal funds may not be used to operate a SIF.24 Statutory or agency authorization of a SIF in New York would also invoke questions about federal preemption of state or local initiatives. The federal CSA recognizes that states independently regulate the use of controlled substa nces. Section 903 specifically notes that the federal law does not \"exclude[e] any State law on the same subject matter which would otherwise be within the authority of the State, unless there is a positive conflict . . . so that the two cannot consistentl y stand together.\"25 Where there is a conflict between a state and federal law, however, the Supremacy clause of the U.S. Constitution requires that federal 18 See Scott Burris et al., Federalism, Policy Learning, and Local Innovation in Public Health: The Case of the Supervised Injection Facility, 53 ST. LOUIS U. L.J. 1089, 1115 -16 (2009). 19 from Mark Miloscia, State Senator, Washington to Jeff Sessions, Attorney General (Feb. 14, 2017), available at http://markmiloscia.src.wastateleg.org/sen -miloscia -letter -u-s-attorney -general -jeff-sessions/. 23 See, e.g. , Memorandum from Jeff Sessions, Attorney General, to All Department Grant -Making Components, May 22, 2017, available jurisdictions\" \u2014those that do not certify compliance with a named section of federal immigration law \u2014are no longer eligible for certain federal grants through the Department of Justice or the Department of Homeland Security); see also County of Santa Clara v. Trump, 2017 WL 1459081 (N.D. Cal. 2017) (issuing a nationwide preliminary injunction against an executive order limiting federal grants for sanctuary jurisdictions). 24 See Burris et al., supra note 18, at 1146 -47 (noting that Congress could, in theory, limit federal funds to programs or jurisdictions that operate SIFs, and describing an unsuccessful prior legislative effort t o do so). 25 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 903 (2017) 134 law control.26 Given the potential conflict between \u00a7 856 of the federal CSA and a state law authoriz ing the operation of a SIF, it is an open legal question of whether \u00a7 856 preempts state law in this field. There may be persuasive legal defenses for SIFs and jurisdictions that attempt to authorize SIFs, including the argument that the CSA drafters did n ot intend for the statute to reach harm reduction programming.27 SIFs may also be within the scope of \"ethical medical practice\" contemplated by the CSA, which establishes processes for registered providers to prescribe and administer controlled substances in practice and research.28 These providers follow state laws regulating the practice of medicine; if SIFs are within the usual scope of practice, there may be a colorable claim that SIFs are outside the boundaries of activity proscribed by the CSA statute. In Gonzales v. Oregon , the Supreme Court held that the CSA merely \"bars doctors from . . . illicit drug dealing and trafficking as conventionally understood,\" but does not \"regulate the practice of medicine generally.\" 29 The regulation of medical practice is instead within the states' police powers to provide for their citizens' health, safety, and welfare.30 If SIFs are considered part of medical practice,31 or if supervising injections is viewed as within providers' existing authority,32 SIFs may succeed in a courtroom challenge under \u00a7 856. It is nevertheless difficult to predict how a court would decide the question.33 A broad reading of state and local law may also result in penalties for SIF staff and property owners. If SIF clients commit state law felo nies through possession or sale of drugs or paraphernalia, SIF owners or staff may be engaging in \"criminal facilitation\" \u2014\"provid[ing] . . a crime.34 If SIF owners are convicted of violating any felony drug laws under N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 220 \u2014which include the possession, paraphernalia, sale, and injection laws outlined above \u2014they may be subject under state law to civil forfeiture of any property that is an \"instrumentality of the crime,\" including real property.35 Where the forf eiture is \"disproportionate to the defendant's gain from or 26 U.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2. 27 See Burris et al., supra note 18, at 1120 -45. 28 See Burris et al., supra note 18, at 1128 (quoting 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 801a(3)) 29 Gonzales v. Oregon, 546 U.S. 243, 270 (2006) (striking down Attorney General's interpretive rule that would prohibit doctors from prescribing drugs for physician -assisted suicide, as permitted by Oregon state law). 30 Id. 31 This may be increasingly true; see infra section II.C for the associations of medical professionals that have endorsed SIF implementati on or study in the United States. 32 Providers who are registered to prescribe controlled substances may do so \"in the usual course of [their] professional practice.\" 822(b) (authorizing registered providers to distribute controlled substances). If SIF activities can be considered part of usual medical practice, there may be a claim that these activities are already authorized as a lesser entailment of prescription authority, at least for registered pr oviders. 33 Courts have divided on whether states may authorize the prescription of marijuana, although the Supreme Court has found that federal CSA prosecutions of growers and users are still proper despite state laws. See Preemption of State Regulation o f Controlled Substances by Federal Controlled Substances Act, 60 A.L.R.6 TH 175 (2010); Gonzales v. Raich, 545 U.S. 1 (2005). 34 N.Y.

Penal Law \u00a7 480.05 (2017). 135 participation in the offense,\" however, the owner may only be required to forfeit \"a portion\" of his or her property.36 This is likely to be true of a SIF owner, for whom the loss of property would greatly outweigh any personal gain from using the property as a SIF. SIF staff and owners may also fall under an expansive reading of the state criminal nuisance law, which penalizes persons who \"knowingly . . . maintain any premises, place, or resort whe re persons gather for purposes of engaging in unlawful conduct.\"37 Past cases have upheld New York's criminal nuisance law against individuals who knowingly allow their homes to be used for smoking marijuana, noting that \"knowledge coupled with acquiescence \" is sufficient for conviction.38 A SIF could be found to meet these standards,39 although prosecuting SIFs may not be a high priority for state prosecutors. Several defenses under state law may also be persuasive.40 The New York City code barring public nuis ances may also penalize SIFs, depending on the discretion of the city corporation counsel.41 Public nuisances include \"any building, erection or place\" where there is a criminal nuisance as defined by state law,42 or where there are three or more violations per year of state drug laws (with the exception of simple possession) or the city's synthetic marijuana code.43 Where a building violates these codes, counsel for the city may sue to enjoin the nuisance, including requesting a permanent injunction to seize or close the premises. If health care providers at the SIF provide direct assistance with injecting or other modes of consumption, additional provisions of the CSA may apply. Injecting drugs into a person, or otherwise applying drugs to a person's body, q ualifies as \"administering\" controlled 36 Id. 37 N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 240.45 (2017). New York has additional statutes defining public nuisances on other grounds, including public health grounds. See, e.g. , N.Y. Pub. Health Law \u00a7 2320 (2017) (defining public nuisances to include buildings \"used for the purpose of lewdness, assignation, or prostitution\" ); N.Y. Pu b. Health Law \u00a7 1300 et seq. (2017) (giving local departments of public health authority to examine and order the abatement of public nuisances that are detrimental to public health). In general, public nuisance claims require plaintiffs to prove a substan tial interference with a right that is common to the public, which offends public morals, interferes with the use of a public place, or endangers or injures the property, health, safety, or comfort of \"a considerable number\" of persons. See, e.g., 532 Madi son Ave. Gourmet Foods, Inc. v. Finlandia Ctr. Inc., 96 N.Y.2d 280 (N.Y. 2001). A state prosecutor or city counsel may sue to enjoin the operation of a SIF on this basis, and the success of such a claim would depend on the court's interpretation of these t erms. This would be a novel use of public nuisance law. 38 People v. Schriber, 310 N.Y.S. 2d 551 (N.Y. App. Div., 3d Dep't 1970) (aff'd 29 N.Y.2d 780 (1971)). 39 Notably, however, if state law were to exempt SIF clients from most \u00a7 220 possession laws \u2014as ha s been done for syringe and residue possession by SEP clients, and for possession by individuals who witness overdoses \u2014the \"unlawful conduct\" element would no longer apply. 40 For example, a SIF may defend on the basis of justification due to medical necessity. Years before SEPs were authorized by statute in New York, a group of early SEP implementers used this defense successfully against hypodermic needle possession charges, on the grounds that the danger of HIV transmission outweighed the legal harm of possession. People v. Bordowitz, 588 N.Y.S.2d 507 (N.Y. Crim. Ct. 1991). A similar defense may be successful against state criminal law charges for a SIF. 41 New York City Administrative Code \u00a7 7 -703 (2017). 42 Id., at \u00a7 43 Id., at \u00a7 7 -703(g) 136 substances under the CSA.44 Section 841(a)(1) prohibits \"dispens[ing]\" a controlled substance, with penalties including imprisonment and fines, and administering a client's drug through direct injection may qualify.45 As discussed above, the New York state law prohibiting injecting another person with drugs would also apply to SIF staff who inject clients in need of injection assistance.46 2. Civil Liability In general, SIF staff and owners will be subject to the same statutory and common -law ci vil liabilities as other health care facilities that serve the general public, such as hospitals, clinics, or SEPs. Like staff and owners of all health care facilities, SIF personnel must use ordinary care to provide a safe facil ity and to deliver non -negligent services, and they will be liable in tort for negligence resulting in injury. This memorandum is not intended to provide a comprehensive list of potential liabilities, but the nature of services provided at a SIF raises sev eral potentially novel questions. The prior section described criminal nuisance law on the theory of public nuisance, as well as the capacity for both state prosecutors and New York City counsel to make public nuisance claims.47 New York state law also all ows tort suits by private parties alleging nuisance claims. Private nuisance claims in New York face a fairly demanding and fact - specific test \u2014the claimant must show an interference with the use or enjoyment of land, and the interference must be \"substanti al in nature,\" intentional, unreasonable, and caused by the defendant's actions or failure to act.48 Private parties who oppose a SIF may allege that a SIF interferes with the use and enjoyment of surrounding property. These parties would be required to sho w injuries that are \"certain and substantial,\" rather than \"fanciful\" or speculative, and the reasonable person standard would apply.49 In this instance, a SIF may be analogous to a homeless shelter. Several prior actions have alleged that homeless shelters , including a homeless shelter providing alcohol crisis services, are nuisances due 44 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802(2) (defining \"administer[ing]\" as \"the direct application of a controlled substance to the body of a patient or research subject\" ); 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 10 (\"'dispense' means to deliver a controlled substance to an ultimate user or research subject . . . including the prescribing and administering of a controlled substance\"). \"Administering\" may thus bring SIF staff within the prohibition of \u00a7 841. 45 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 (2017). 46 N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 220.46 (2017). 47 Private parties may bring public nuisance claims in New York, but they must show an injury that is \"different in kind\" from that suffered by the general public, not merely different in d egree. This is difficult to satisfy. See, e.g. , N.A.A.C.P. v. AcuSport, Inc., 271 F. Supp. 2d 435 (2003) (finding that the N.A.A.C.P. did not allege an injury \"different in kind\" from the injury experienced by \"the community at large\" from the lax sales and distribution practices of handgun manufacturers, importers, and distributors). 48 See, e.g. , Copart Indus., Inc. v. Consolidated Edison Co. of New York, Inc., 41 N.Y.2d 564 (N.Y. 1977); Taggart App. Div., 2d Dep't 201 5). If the nuisance is based on criminal conduct, it is a nuisance per se , meaning that plaintiffs need not show that the interference is intentional or negligent. See State v. Fermenta ASC Corp., 656 N.Y.S.2d 342 (N.Y. App. Div., 1997). 49 See Matteliano v. Skitkzi, 925 N.Y.S.2d 276 (N.Y. App. Div., 4th Dep't 2011). 137 to the presence of \"violent or unstable\" clientele.50 Courts have found that these facilities are public necessities, that \"apprehensions\" alone do not support nuisance alle gations against them, and that the burdens these services impose on public rights are neither substantial nor unreasonable.51 Professionals who work at a SIF will be subject to the same medical malpractice standards as health care professionals in other settings in New York: claimants must show a deviation from accepted standards of practice, and that deviation must have proximately caused injury.52 New York legislation provides for \"Good Samaritan\" immunity from malpracti ce claims for health care providers who respond to accidents or emergencies outside \"the normal and ordinary course\" of practice, without expecting monetary compensation, in locations other than places \"having proper and necessary medical equipment,\" with the except ion of claims arising from gross negligence.53 Although overdoses in SIFs would certainly qualify as accidents or emergencies, providers at a SIF likely will not qualify for this reduced standard of liability. SIF services will be part of the ordinary cours e of these providers' practice, providers may work at SIFs for compensation, and SIFs are likely have \"proper and necessary medical equipment\" to treat overdoses. Ordinary medical malpractice standards will thus likely apply to the duties of SIF providers, even when responding to overdoses. Available reports reflect no record of a client dying on the premises of a SIF, despite the use of SIFs in a number of countries. Should a SIF client die from an overdose, however, the client's decedents may seek to make a claim against SIF staff and owners for wrongful death. These claims are structured by statute in New York, which allows a decedent's personal representatives to recover damages for wrongful death due to \"a wrongful act, neglect or default which caused t he decedent's death.\"54 Wrongful death actions may allege simple negligence (i.e., negligence that is easily discerned by a jury without expert testimony) or malpractice by health care personnel; claims alleging medical malpractice will require expert testi mony regarding standards of practice.55 If SIF staff and owners operate the facility with ordinary care, and if SIF professionals practice according to accepted standards, plaintiffs in a wrongful death suit are unlikely to prevail.56 SIFs are 50 See Spring -Gar Community Civic Ass'n, Inc., v. Homes for the Homeless, Inc., 516 N.Y.S.2d 399 (N.Y. Sup. Ct., Queens Cty., 1987); DeStefano v. Emergency Housing Group, Inc., 722 N.Y. S.2d 35 (N.Y. App. Div., 1st Dep't 2001). 51 Spring -Gar, 516 Ct., Cty. N.Y.S.2d 35 (N.Y. App. Div., 1st Dep't 2001). The practice of a church of allowing homeless persons to sleep outside on church property ha s also been found not to be a public nuisance under New York law. Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church v. City of New York, 2004 WL 2471406 (S.D.N.Y. 2004). 52 Gillespie v. New York Hosp. N.Y.S.2d 148 (N.Y. App. son, 32 F.3d 658 (2d Cir. 1994) (applying New York law). 53 See N.Y. Educ. Law \u00a7 6545 (2017) (for physician assistants). 54 N.Y. Estates, Powers & Trusts Law \u00a7 5-4.1 (2017) 55 See Coursen v. New York Hosp. Cornell Med. Ctr., 499 N.Y.S.2d 52 (N.Y. App. Div., 1st Dep't 1986). 56 Defining the standard of care for SIF owners and staff may require looking to how SIFs are operated in other countries, given that no SIF is yet in operation in the United States. 138 thus similar t o other health care facilities providing emergency services \u2014although death on the premises is possible, non -negligent operation of the SIF will be a defense against wrongful death claims. A final and somewhat unique question for SIFs is the application of \"dram shop\" liability and its analogues, which take effect when intoxicated or impaired persons cause injury or death to third parties (e.g., by driving under the influence). In the case of intoxication due to alcohol use, New York's Dram Shop Act (N.Y. G eneral Obligations Law \u00a7 11 -101) provides a cause of action for these injured individuals, who may bring suit against anyone who, \"by unlawful selling or unlawfully assisting in procuring liquor [,] . . . [has] caused or contributed to such intoxication.\"57 The intoxicated person himself or herself may not bring claims, although any dependents may sue for loss of \"means of support\" in the event of the intoxicated person's death.58 A complementary statute in New York (\u00a7 11 -103) applies when injury is inflicted by someone \"impaired by the use of a controlled substance\" other than alcohol.59 Injured persons may then recover damages from \"any person who caused or contributed to such impairment by unlawfully selling to or unlawfully assisting in procuring a controll ed substance for such person.\"60 If SIF clients leave the SIF in a state of impairment or intoxication and subsequently cause harm, injured parties may seek to recover damages from the SIF under the dram shop laws. These actions, however, are unlikely to s ucceed under current judicial interpretations of \u00a7\u00a7 11-101 and 11 -103. Courts examining the action of \"assisting\" in \u00a7 11 -101 have generally required actions related to sale, such as contributing funds or actually purchasing alcohol for someone's consumpti on.61 Nonsellers, social hosts, and companions of impaired or intoxicated people are not liable under \u00a7 11 -101.62 Although courts interpreting \u00a7 11 -103 have noted that money need not change hands for the transfer of a controlled substance (e.g., marijuana) t o constitute a \"sale,\"63 SIFs will not be the source of substances used by SIF clients. A physician who prescribes controlled substances has also been found not liable 57 N.Y. Gen. Oblig. Law 11 -101 (2017). 58 See Searley v. Wegmans Food Markets, Inc., 807 N.Y.S.2d 768 (N.Y. App. Div., 4th Dep't 2005). 59 N.Y. Gen. Oblig. Law 11 -103 (2017). 60 Id. 61 See Southland Corp. 683 N.Y.S.2d 286 N.Y.S.2d 731 (N.Y. App. Div., 4th Dep't 2010) (finding that social hosts that provided alcohol at a party had \"no expectation of pecuniary gain,\" and therefore were not liable under the Dram Shop Act; this finding on Dram Shop Act liability was later affirmed by Martino v. Stolzman, 18 N.Y.3d 905 (N.Y. 2012)); Casselberry 533 N.Y.S.2d 31 (N.Y. App. Div., 4th Dep't 1988) (finding that a union that provided beer to union members wa s not engaged in commercial sale and therefore not liable); D'Amico v. Christie, 71 N.Y.2d 76 (N.Y. 1987) (finding that an employees' association that provided beer without charge at a picnic was not liable, as they had \"no recognizable expectation of pecu niary gain\"); French v. Cliff's Ltd., 508 N.Y.S.2d App. Div., 2d Dep't 1986) (finding that \"drinking companions\" are not liable). If SIFs are legally authorized in New York, claims under \u00a7 11 -101 and \u00a7 11 -103 may also fail on the \"unlawful\" element of the claim. See infra section II.A. 63 Terrigino v. Zaleski, 544 N.Y.S.2d 283 (Sup. Ct. 1989) (finding a cause of action against someone who supplied marijuana to a driver who subsequently injured other drivers, even without receiving \"something in return\" for the transfer). 139 under \u00a7 11 -103, where the complaint does not allege that the physician has \"the authority or ability\" to control the drug user, and where there is no other relationship between the physician and the injured party.64 SIFs will not have any involvement in the purchase or sale of controlled substances, and because all clients will bring their own substances, SIFs will have less of a direct connection to the substances than social hosts. Accordingly, although any injured parties may seek to bring suit against a SIF under these laws, the success of these claims is far from certain, and they would be a novel extension of the state statutes. C. Legal Challenges for Professionals at SIFs Additional le gal issues may arise for health care professionals who practice at SIFs. If licensed nurses, physicians, or other allied health personnel who staff SIFs are held to violate federal, state, or local laws \u2014such as \u00a7 856 of the federal CSA, or N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 240.45 on criminal nuisance \u2014they may face professional penalties in New York. New York state law regulates the practices of medicine, nursing, and other al lied health professions. Under the state's general professional misconduct statute,65 as well as the specific statute governing misconduct for physicians and physician assistants,66 conviction of a crime under New York or federal law is misconduct per se , even when the crime is unrelated to the profession. The case law on these offenses does not show any disciplinary proceedings arising from involvement in harm reduction activities. The Office of Professional Medical Conduct in the New York Department of Health handles disciplinary proceedings for physicians and physician assistants, while the New York State Education Department Office of the Professions addresses complaints arising in other professions, including nursing. Without a criminal conviction, d isciplinary proceedings for practice \"beyond [the] authorized scope\" of the profession (for physicians) or \"committing unprofessional conduct\" (for other professions) may be broad enough to encompass some SIF activities, depending on whether the profession al offices recognize harm reduction as part of medical practice. To this end, the views of national and regional professional societies may be instructive. In June 2017, the American Medical Association \u2014the nation's largest physician group and publisher of JAMA \u2014voted to endorse pilot SIF projects in the United States as a promising strategy to diminish overdose deaths, to reduce infectious disease associated with injection, and to advance access to treatment.67 In its press release announcing this position, the AMA noted that it also consulted the recent deliberations and findings of the Massachusetts Medical Society \u2014publisher of the preeminent New England Journal of 64 Ferguson v. Laffer, 53 N.Y.S.3d 89 (N.Y. App. (2017). 67 American Medical Ass'n, AMA Wants New Medicine \u2014endorsing SIFs.68 The American Public Health Association has called for study and imp lementation of SIFs in the US,69 and the Medical Society of the State of New York has also advocated a comprehensive study.70 Several other groups have not yet weighed in specifically on SIFs, but have previously supported harm reduction strategies for respo nding to substance use: the AMA, American Nurses Association, American Society of Addiction Medicine, and APHA have encouraged SEPs for decades.71 This history of commitment to harm reduction and interest in SIFs suggests that a provider facing professional discipline for involvement in a New York SIF may persuasively argue that SIF services are part of ethical medical practice. II. Legal Avenues for Establishing a SIF in New York City In light of these legal challenges, states and cities may choose among se veral pathways for implementing a SIF. Of course, the clearest avenue for establishing a legal SIF would be a federal statute that authorizes SIF operation and provides SIF clients, staff, and owners with exemptions from federal criminal laws. The followin g analysis, however, assumes that there will be no change in federal law. A. State Legislation The New York State Legislature has the authority to authorize SIFs by statute, and could do so either with a freestanding law, or with an extension to the curre nt state law authorizing SEPs.72 The Tenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution provides that any powers that are not specifically delegated to the federal government are \"reserved to the states,\" giving states broad authority to regulate for the health, safe ty, and welfare of their residents. Known as the \"police power,\" this authority extends to \"health laws of every description\"73\u2014as long as those state laws are not preempted by a federal statute within the federal government's authority. On June 21, 2017, Linda B. Rosenthal, a Manhattan representative in the 150 -member New York Assembly, introduced bill A.8534 (the \"Safer Consumption Services Act\") to authorize the establishment of SIFs statewide.74 This bill would provide a new section of the state public h ealth law, which would allow local health departments to approve SIFs 68 Massachusetts Medical Society, Massachusetts Medica l Society Expands on Opioid on May 1, 2017, 69 Defining and Implementing a Public Health R esponse to Drug Use and Misuse. American Public Health Association. Updated Nov 5 2013. 70 Medical Society of the State of New York, Supervised Injection Facilities, Resolution 2017 -160 (2017). 71 Normand et al. eds. Preventing HIV Transmission: The Role of Sterile Needles and Bleach. . The National Academies Press. 1995. 72 N.Y. Public Health Law \u00a7 3381 (2017). 73 Gibbons v. Ogden, 22 U.S. 1, (1824) 74 A.8534, 2017 -2018 Reg. Sess. (N.Y. 2017) (int roduced June 21, 2017, in the Committee on Health), available at http://nyassembly.gov/leg/?default_fld=&leg_video=&bn=A08534&term=2017&Summary=Y&Actions=Y&Co mmittee%26nbspVotes=Y&Floor%26nbspVotes=Y&Memo=Y&Text=Y. 141 implemented by community -based organizations, hospitals, medical clinics or offices, health centers, nursing care facilities, mental health facilities or \"other similar entit[ies] that p rovid[e] medical care.\" The legislation permits local departments of health to set standards for program approval and training, and it sets forth required program activities and reporting requirements. All programs would also be designated as SEPs, and the statute specifically provides that SIF clients, staff, and owners will be immune from arrest, criminal charges, prosecution, and civil or administrative penalties (including civil forfeiture and professional licensing sanctions) associated with \"participa tion or involvement\" in an approved SIF. Immunity would not extend to activities \"not permitted or approved\" under the SIF implementing legislation. The bill is currently under consideration in the Committee on Health. In addition to New York, several othe r states have considered legislation either authorizing or prohibiting SIFs, including California,75 Maryland,76 Maine,77 Massachusetts,78 and Washington (to prevent SIFs, as a response to a local Board of Health decision to establish to SIFs in Seattle),79 as of now, no bill has yet passed both houses of a state legislature. As of June 2, 2017, the California State Assembly passed AB -186, which would authorize SIFs for a period of five years in several state counties, including Alameda, Fresno, Humboldt, Los Angeles, Mendocino, San Francisco, San Joaquin, and Santa Cruz.80 The statute provides for required program services, the development of operating procedures and policies to address neighborhood concerns, and immunity from arrest, charge, or prosecution from specific drug laws.81 The bill is currently in committee in the state Senate Committees on Health and Public Safety. There are several advantages to establishing a SIF by state statute in New York. Any legislation authorizing a SIF could simultaneously amen d or provide exemptions from state laws on possession, paraphernalia, criminal injection, criminal nuisance, and professional misconduct to protect SIF staff, owners, and clients from arrest, prosecution and disciplinary proceedings in the state. Even if t he statute and implementing regulations do not explicitly amend these criminal laws, statutory support for a SIF may deter arrest and provide persuasive defenses for SIF clients, personnel, and owners faced with unexpected 75 AB-186, 2017 -2018 Reg. Sess. (Cal. 2017 ) (passed of June 2017). 76 H.B. 519, 2017 Reg. Sess. (Md. 2017) (in 2017). 77 L.D. 1375, 128th Legisl.

(Mass. 2017) (in the Joint C ommittee on Mental Health, Substance Use and Recovery as of June 2017). 79 S.B. 5223, 2017 -18 Sess. (Wash. 2017) (passed the Senate, referred by the House back to the Senate Rules Committee as of June 2017). 80 Like many other U.S. cities considering SIF imp lementation, the San Francisco Department of Public Health currently has a task force considering the feasibility of a local SIF. San Francisco Department of Public Health, Safe Injection Services Task Force, https://www.sfdph.org/dph/comupg/knowlcol/SISTa skForce/ (last visited June 30, 2017). 81 Assembly Bill 186, January 19, 2017. 142 criminal charges.82 Statutory auth orization under state law could also provide some protection from local efforts to declare SIFs a public nuisance, or to find SIF clients in violation of local laws such as Administrative Code \u00a7 10 -203. Although this pathway provides the greatest legal ce rtainty with respect to state and local law, it may not safeguard SIFs against federal efforts to enforce the CSA.83 States have authority to enact laws that appear to present conflicts with the CSA, as evidenced by laws enabling SEPs, medical marijuana, le galization of recreational marijuana, and physician aid in dying.84 Questions remain, however, about how a state law establishing SIFs would fare in a federal preemption challenge, or whether state law protections would insulate SIF personnel in a federal p rosecution under the CSA.85 Under any legal pathway with the current CSA, the operation of a SIF would depend on the discretion of federal prosecutors and the reasoning of courts that would hear these challenges. B. State Administrative Action In the absenc e of state legislation, a state agency or the state governor could also establish a SIF through executive authority. New York Public Health Law \u00a7 201 accords the state Department of Health the authority to \"promote or provide diagnostic and therapeutic services for . . . communicable disease, medical rehabilitation . . . and other conditions and diseases affecting public health;\"86 the department may also \"receive and expend funds made available for public health purposes pursuant to law.\"87 The commissioner of the state Department of Health may authorize people to obtain and possess hypodermic needles to enable the operation of SEPs.88 The state governor has executive power to \"take care that the laws are faithfully executed,\" and may issue executive orders wi thin state constitutional limits.89 The governor may also declare a state of disaster in response to \"natural or man -made causes\" that threaten \"wide spread or severe damage, loss of life or 82 See Roe v. City of New York, 232 F. Supp. 2d 240 (S.D.N.Y. 2002) (finding an exception to the law criminalizing possession of trace amounts of drug in syringes, as applied to c lients of legally authorized SEPs). 83 See Burris et al., supra note 18, at 1112. 84 See id. , at 1107. Some states have taken these actions directly through citizen ballot referenda, but New York State law does not provide for direct referendum or initiative options for new legislation. 85 See id. ; see also Leo Beletsky et al., The Law (and Politics) of Safe Injection Facilities in the United States , 98 AM. J. PUB. HEALTH 231 (2008). Congress has included language in several consecutive budget appropriations to prevent the Department of Justice from spending federal funds to prosecute activities that are completely authorized by state laws providing for medical marijuana use. See, e.g. , Consolidated Appropriations Act 2016, Pub. L. No. 114 -113, \u00a7 542, 129 Stat. 833 F.3d 1163 (9th Cir. 2016). SIFs lack this protection at present, but Congress could choose to enac t parallel language to insulate state - authorized SIF activities from federal prosecution under the CSA. 86 N.Y. Public Health Law \u00a7 201(1)(h) (2017). 87 N.Y. Public Health Law \u00a7 N.Y. Public Health Law \u00a7\u00a7 3381(1)(b), 3381(4) (2017). 89 N.Y. Const., art. IV \u00a7 3. 143 property,\"90 and where local governments are unable to respond adequately.91 Where there is a disaster, the governor may direct state agencies to assist in a response.92 The state Department of Health or governor could seek to establish a SIF through one of these avenue s, such as direct service provision and funding by the department, authorization by the commissioner, executive order, or a governor's declaration of disaster. Any of these executive or agency actions, however, may be challenged as contrary to state crimin al laws, assuming that these laws remain unchanged. In 2004, the governor of New Jersey authorized SEPs by executive order, citing the threat of HIV and hepatitis C transmission. A group of state senators challenged the order as exceeding the governor's executive authority,93 and an advisory opinion by the New Jersey State Legislature Office of Legislative Services supported the senators' position.94 It is unclear how state lawmakers and prosecutors would respond to a similar effort in New York State. Althou gh perhaps preferable to local authorization of a SIF, establishing a SIF through a state agency or the governor's authorization will leave substantial legal uncertainty about conflicts with the federal CSA, state prosecution under state criminal laws, cha llenges from state legislators citing separation -of-powers concerns (as in New Jersey), and professional discipline for SIF providers. These issues are matters of prosecutorial discretion and/or courts' reasoning. A SIF established on this basis may prevai l in court, or it may go unchallenged; if so, the program may be durable despite the lack of supportive state statutes.95 C. Local Legislation or Administrative Action New York City also has the authority to establish SIF services through a city ordinance. The New York State Constitution96 and New York Municipal Home Rule Law97 allow cities to \"enact and amend local laws\" for the \"safety, health, and well -being\" of their residents, provided that city ordinances are not inconsistent with state laws. Like the st ate legislature, New York City could exercise this power to authorize SIFs under city law. A SIF established by city ordinance may be vulnerable, however, to challenge by state prosecutors enforcing state criminal law, such as N.Y. Penal Code \u00a7 220.03 (pos session) or \u00a7 240.45 (criminal nuisance). SIF providers may also remain uncertain about professional 90 N.Y. Exec. Law \u00a7 20 (2017). 91 N.Y. Exec.

IX \u00a7 2(c)(10) (\"[E]very local government shall have power to adopt and amend local laws not inconsistent with the provisions of this constitution or any general law relat ing to . . . the government, protection, order, conduct, safety, health and well -being of persons or property therein.\"). 97 New York Municipal Home Rule Law \u00a7 10(1)(ii)(a)(12) (2017) (similar language as above). 144 disciplinary proceedings, and local endorsement of a SIF may be less persuasive than a state statute for disciplinary purposes. If state prosecutors choos e to oppose a locally authorized SIF, a New York court could find a city ordinance or agency action authorizing SIFs to be inconsistent with state criminal laws. The case of SEPs in Atlantic City provides an instructive example; after state legislative eff orts to authorize SEPs stalled, the city established a SEP under local law to address the local hepatitis C and HIV epidemic.98 A state court subsequently struck down the ordinance as inconsistent with state criminal laws, citing the failure of state -level SEP bills as additional evidence of inconsistency.99 New York may be distinguished from this case, as the state does not have adverse precedent in the legislature rejecting SIFs.100 Moreover, prosecution would remain a matter of state prosecutorial discretion . Cities in other states have implemented SEPs successfully without state -level prosecution, including cities in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and California.101 Action by a city agency or city executive branch is another pathway by which New York City could establis h a SIF. Pursuant to the New York City Charter \u00a7 556, the New York Department of Health and Mental Hygiene is empowered \"to regulate all matters affecting health in the city of New York and to perform all those functions and operations performed by the cit y that relate to the health of people of the city, including . . . substance abuse - related needs of the people of the city.\"102 This authority also entails the power to \"maintain and operate public health centers and clinics,\" to \"promote or provide for prog rams for the prevention and control of disease,\" to \"provide or promote diagnostic and therapeutic services for . . . communicable disease, medical rehabilitation, and other diseases and conditions affecting public health,\" and to \"promote or provide medic al and health services for . . . the ambulant sick and needy persons of the city.\"103 The Board of Health, as part of the department, may also amend the City Health Code.104 City agencies may adopt rules without notice and comment on a temporary basis if \"nece ssary to address an imminent threat to health,\" but such rules may remain in effect for only 60 days.105 Local chief executives \u2014here, the city mayor \u2014also have authority to declare a local state of emergency and to enact ordinances pursuant to that authority, but this power lasts only 30 days.106 98 State v. City of Atlantic City, 379 N.J. Super. 515 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 2005); Beletsky et al., supra note 85, at 233. 99 City of Atlantic City, 379 N.J. Super., at 526. 100 The state legislature has yet to consider bill A. 8534, which was recently introduced. Moreover, unlike in the state of Washington, there has been no legislative effort to prohibit SIFs in New York. See supra note 79. 101 Beletsky et al., supra note 85, at 233. 102 New York City Charter \u00a7 556. 103 New York City Charter \u00a7 556(d). 104 New York City Charter \u00a7 558(b) -(c). 105 New York City Charter \u00a7 1043(h). 106 N.Y. Exec. Law \u00a7 24 (2017). 145 The New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene could use these powers to implement a SIF, as could the city mayor. But like local legislative efforts, these executive and agency actions may draw challenges un der state law, depending on state prosecutors' enforcement decisions. Like New York City, other cities including Baltimore, Philadelphia, and San Francisco are using local authority to study SIFs, and a few cities have publicized intentions or decisions to implement SIFs. The King County Board of Health in Seattle has voted to establish two SIFs, and although they have not been challenged by state prosecutors, a state legislative effort to block SIFs statewide is ongoing.107 Ithaca, NY, has publicized the \"It haca Plan\" approach to address drug overdoses, which includes establishing a SIF, but the plan has not yet taken effect.108 D. State or Local Pilot Research Study with Federal and State Authorization A final avenue for establishing a SIF is to run the progra m as a research study, with the research goal of pilot -testing the acceptability and feasibility of a SIF in New York City. There are established legal procedures for conducting research that involves the use of controlled substances, which insulate resear chers and participants from prosecution under federal and state drug laws. The New York City Charter grants the city Department of Mental Health and Hygiene the authority to \"engage in or promote health research for the purpose of improving th e quality of medical and health care .\"109 New York Public Health Law \u00a7 201 grants the state Department of Health similar research authority.110 This suggests that either department could establish a SIF on a research basis, or could contract out to a local institution to i mplement the pilot program. In order to operate a SIF program on a research basis, researchers must first obtain institutional review board (IRB) approval for conducting human subjects research with SIF clients as participants.111 They would then apply for a research license under New York State law, pursuant to N.Y. Public Health \u00a7 3324, to carry out \"scientific research\" with controlled substances.112 The commissioner of the New York State Department of Health has statutory authority to issue these licenses f or a period of two years,113 and they are managed by the Department of Health Bureau of Narcotic Enforcement.114 After obtaining the state license, researchers must then apply for a federal license to gain an exemption from the federal CSA.115 Registrations are reviewed by the U.S. Department of Justice Drug 107 See supra note 79 and accompanying text. 108 See GWEN WILKINSON & LILLIAN FAN, MUNICIPAL DRUG POLICY COMMITTEE , THE ITHACA PLAN (2016). 109 New York City Charter \u00a7 556(d)(2). 110 N.Y. Public Health Law \u00a7 201(1)(d) (2017). 111 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 46 N.Y. Public Health Law 2444 (2017). 112 N.Y. Public Health \u00a7 3324 (2017). 113 Id. 114 New York State Department of Health, Dear Researcher Licensee Letter, available at https://www.health.ny.gov/professionals/narcotic/licensing_and_certification/2008 -08- 01_controlled_substance_license.htm .

Federal protocol review and approval will depend on the priorities of the Drug Enforceme nt Agency and the Attorney General. The Attorney General has authority to promulgate rules regarding registration, including research licenses.116 By statute, the AG considers at least five factors in granting research licenses: (1) recommendation by the state licensing board, (2) the researchers' experience in research with controlled substances, (3) researchers' conviction records under federal and state controlled substance laws, (4) compliance with \"applicable state, federal or local laws,\" and (5) threat s to public health and safety.117 Controls against the potential diversion of drugs \"from legitimate medical or scientific use\" may also be part of the review.118 The protocol for a SIF will likely differ from the typical research protocol for the study of con trolled substances. Unlike research studies that supply controlled substances for research participants, a SIF protocol would permit participants to bring their own (sometimes unknown) substances for use on site. Controls against diversion may be inapposit e for a protocol that aims to measure the harm -reduction benefits of a SIF for recreational drug use. Approval of a research exemption would be at the discretion of the state Department of Health and federal Attorney General. Implementing a SIF as a pilot research study has several advantages, and this was the initial means by which Vancouver, Canada and Sydney, Australia first established local SIFs. By opening a SIF with both federal and state licenses, SIF staff and owners would have some certainty that they are not violating federal or state laws. The experimental period may help the SIF gain public support, which may bolster subsequent state legislative or agency efforts to establish a SIF for service, rather than research purposes. The New South Wales Parliament, for example, legislatively authorized the Sydney SIF to continue in operation after a nine -year trial period.119 The drawbacks of establishing a SIF for research include the uncertainty of success in licensing at both federal and state levels, th e need for reapproval and continued adherence to research protocol over time (at least every two years for state authorization), concerns about sustainability, and the potential for drug inventory recordkeeping requirements if the Attorney General does not waive them for a 116 21 U.S.C . \u00a7 821 (2017). 117 21 -medically 4, 2017). The first Vancouver SIF, Insite, operated as a pilo t program with an exemption from federal and provincial drug laws from 2003 through 2007. Insite's operators then sued the Canadian Attorney General, asking British Columbia courts to declare that attempts to close the site violated clients' rights to life , liberty, and security of the person, under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Insite succeeded in this claim before the Supreme Court of Canada in 2011, and now operates as a service rather than a pilot project. See PHS, The History of Insite, https://www.phs.ca/index.php/project/the -history -of-insite/ (last visited June 4, 2017); Canada v. PHS Community Services Soc'y, [2011] S.C.R. 3 (Can.). 147 protocol of this type.120 There may also be disadvantages to delivering services in the context of a researcher -subject relationship rather than a provider -client relationship. Additionally, operating a SIF through a research protocol may r equire the creation and storage of more identifiable information about individual clients, which could limit program usage by clients who wish to stay anonymous. III. Conclusions As prior analyses have suggested,121 U.S. jurisdictions \u2014including New York State and New York City \u2014have legal authority to establish a SIF through several different pathways. Assuming that federal laws do not change, enacting a SIF through state legislation provides greatest legal certainty on a long -term basis for SIF clients, staff, and property owners, at least with respect to state criminal law and professional licensure. (Creating a SIF through a research waiver would provide greater legal certainty on a short -term basis, if the state and federal research licenses were granted. A research SIF, however, would end with the conclusion of the pilot or the expiration of either license.) Although state legislative authorization may provide greatest certainty for a New York City SIF, this pathw ay nonetheless leaves open questions about the federal response under the Controlled Substances Act, particularly 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 856 (the \"Crack House\" statute). Legal challenges to a SIF on the basis of the CSA will depend on enforcement priorities and prose cutorial discretion. Federal Attorney General involvement (or forbearance) will therefore matter for implementing a SIF by any pathway, including state legislation, state administrative action, local ordinance or administrative action, or a research exempt ion to federal and state laws. 120 See, e.g. , 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 827 (2017). 121 See supra note 85; Burris et al., supra note 18.
