Humacel is a natural constituent of the soil and ground water. It is considered a phenolic compound made from humic acid which can interact with over 50 elements. Current research has shown humic acid to be a promising therapeutic substance due to its ability to enhance the immune system. Studies have shown that it can support the immune system and may support/help to inhibit the replication of a virus, by disrupting the inter-cellular replication process. It also may support the body to inhibit viral transmission by helping to block a viral particle from attachment from entering a healthy cell such as a white blood cell. These types of cells can harbor unwanted viruses and other infectious agents allowing them to reproduce within. There seems to be no viral resistance as I have been on it for 12 years. Studies have also shown it may support the immune systems response by interfering with the proliferation of the virus once it enters cells. Research has shown that humacel may support the immune system in working against many viruses. Additionally, there is new research indicating humic acid may protect the body against toxins entering cells and may have the ability to help bind these toxins. Taken in conjunction with [ resveratrol](https://energyhealingapproach.com/product/resveratrol-125-mg-ultra-labratories-organic/) and [ Aurora Life Sciences liposomal vitamin C](https://energyhealingapproach.com/product/liposomal-vitamin-c-2/) for maximum long term immune, anti-pathogenic, anti-viral support. Why this form of humic acid works so good has to do with the peptide delivery system and the addition of beta glucan. 60 count caps PERSONAL NOTES: I personally have found perfect solutions humacel to be a very potent immune modulator and the best product available for anti-viral support. I take this product every day, and feel it is one of the best immune support products on the market. Humacel seems to work even better when used in conjunction with Resveratrol. I take 2 humacel. along with [ 225mg of Resveratrol daily](https://energyhealingapproach.com/product/resveratrol-125-mg-ultra-labratories-organic/).

When I feel a cold coming on 2 humacel seems to halt the cold before it gets deeper. Otherwise, if I think it is bacterial in nature like a sore throat for example, I take [ liposomal vitamin C](https://energyhealingapproach.com/product/liposomal-vitamin-c-2/) from vida life science. This is how I keep myself free from common colds. Perfect solutions humacel is the best ant-viral support and immune modulator available.
