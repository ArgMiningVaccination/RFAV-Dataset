While budesonide does not cure this condition, it may decrease symptoms such as pain and diarrhea. Budesonide is an anti-inflammatory drug (corticosteroid hormone). It works by decreasing the body's natural defense response (immune response). This section contains uses of this drug that are not listed in the approved professional labeling for the drug but that may be prescribed by your health care professional. Use this drug for a condition that is listed in this section only if it has been so prescribed by your health care professional. This drug may also be used for certain immune system disorders. Read the Patient Information Leaflet if available from your pharmacist before you start taking budesonide and each time you get a refill. If you have any questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. Take this medication by mouth with or without food as directed by your doctor, usually once daily in the morning. Swallow this medication whole with a full glass of water (8 ounces/240 milliliters) unless your doctor directs you otherwise. Do not crush or chew the capsules. Doing so can release all of the drug at once, increasing the risk of side effects. If you have trouble swallowing the capsules whole, certain brands may be opened and the contents sprinkled onto a tablespoonful of soft, cool applesauce in a clean container. Stir and take all of the mixture without chewing. Drink a full glass of cool water (8 ounces/240 milliliters) to make sure you have swallowed all of your dose. Take all of the mixture within 30 minutes after preparing it. Do not save the mixture for later use. Ask your pharmacist if you have questions about your particular brand. The dosage and length of treatment are based on your medical condition, age, and response to treatment.

Grapefruit can increase the chance of side effects with this medicine. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for more details. If you are regularly taking a different corticosteroid by mouth (such as prednisone), you should not stop taking it unless directed by your doctor.

If you suddenly stop taking the drug, you may also have withdrawal symptoms (such as weakness, weight loss, nausea, muscle pain, headache, tiredness, dizziness). To help prevent withdrawal, your doctor may slowly lower the dose of your old medication after you begin taking budesonide. Tell your doctor or pharmacist right away if you have withdrawal.

Tell your doctor if your condition does not get better or if it gets worse.
