These physicians are trained in both modern medicine and acupuncture, giving them the ability to examine a problem, make a diagnosis, and offer treatment options from both modern medical and acupuncture perspectives. That means their patients get the best of both worlds: proven, ancient healing techniques and cutting-edge, modern medicine. We invite fellow health care providers and prospective acupuncture patients to explore this website to learn more about the benefits of medical acupuncture and about membership in the AAMA. The AAMA encourages its members and other interested individuals to stay informed about research and news related to medical acupuncture and to participate in the Academy's live and virtual educational events.
