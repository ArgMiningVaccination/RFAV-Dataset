The Facility features a 2019 Leica SP8 Confocal Microscope with White Light Laser and Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (FLIM) capability. The SP8 is funded by a grant from the National Science Foundation. [See the award page for more details](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1828136&HistoricalAwards=false). See the [Videos](https://about.illinoisstate.edu/confocal/videos/) page for a discussion of the facility and some of the available applications. For scheduling and user information please contact Kevin Edwards, [kaedwar@ilstu.edu](mailto:kaedwar@ilstu.edu) Training courses: The graduate training course for the SP8 is BSC 411 Confocal Microscopy in Biology. It will be offered in Fall 2023. Students: BSC 411 has 1 hr per week of lecture/computer work from 1-1:50 on Fridays, and a separate 75 min of training per week at the SP8. The lab section schedule will be determined once we know everyone's availability. There is limited space, so please email [kaedwar@ilstu.edu](mailto:kaedwar@ilstu.edu) if you plan to enroll. Undergraduates: BSC 356 is the undergrad SP8 training course, and runs concurrently with BSC 411; contact Dr. Edwards for an override. "}
