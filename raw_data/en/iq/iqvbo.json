Introduction 1.1. This report provides the position with regard to the strategic and operational risk registers. 1.2. The next formal review of the strategic risk and opportunity register will take place in September 2023, the operational risk register will also be reviewed at this time. Risk registers are however a live document and should be regularly discussed at Direc torate Management Teams. 2. Strategic Risk Register 2.1. There are 2 3 strategic risks currently being managed. In total there are seven risks with a rating score of high amber / red which are reported in line with the City Council's approved risk toleran ce levels and are shown below - Risk Number one in appendix A relates to the Council's expenditure exceeding the resources available to meet that expenditure within the medium term financial plan period. The risk score is 25 which means extensive manageme nt of the risk is essential. Risk number 20 concerns Lawful Accounting Treatments in Respect of the Pensions Fund. The risk score is 20 which means considerable management of the risk is required. Risk number two relates to possible failure to meet statutory duties due to growing volume and complexity of demand for children's social care services. The risk score is 20 which means considerable management of the risk is required. Risk number three relates to the potential for a cyber -attack to render a ll of the Council's IT inaccessible for an extended period of time therefore impacting on the Councils ability to deliver services. The risk score is 20 which means considerable management of the risk is required. Risk number four relates to IT supply chai n constraints results in increased costs and extended lead times for equipment. This will lead to budget pressures for the Council plus Service delivery pressures as new and replacement IT equipment experiences considerable delays. The risk score is 20 whi ch means considerable management of the risk is required. Risk number five relates to workforce concerns and the growing fragility of the Adult Social Care Market that might lead to the inability of the Local Authority to meet statutory duties and meet eli gible need.

The risk score is 20 which means considerable management of the risk is required. Risk number 24 Cater -Ed: PCC still carries pension and redundancy liability for Cater -Ed staff. The risk score is 20 and requires considerable management effort to respond to the risk. This risk was moved from the Operational to Strategic Register. 2.2 Five of the 2 3 risks on the strategic risk register have a risk rating of 16 and above, indicating higher risk and where management effort is required to adequately mitigate the risk. These are - OFFICIAL Risk number six insufficient economic performance to sustain the City's e conomy and growth plans. Risk number seven Ongoing COVID -19 rates (with potential for further peaks) Risk number eight Failure to reduce Health Inequalities will mean our poorest residents continue to live shorter lives as well as more years in ill healt h.

Risk number ten Adult Social Care (ASC) Reforms - There are a number of reforms to ASC that have created significant financial uncertainty in terms of being able to accurately understand the cost, volume and funding that will be made available to deliver these reforms. 3. Operational Risk Register (Appendix B) 3.1. There are currently 1 19 risks on the operational register. This is a reduction of 1 1 risks during this reporting period. The main reason for removal of risk that they were no longer relevant as advised by risk owners. (removed risks remain on the register stru ck out). 3.2. There is a total of seven red risks on the operational register , an increase of two in this reporting period . These relate to - Failure to meet statutory duties due to growing volume and complexity of demand for children's social care services .

To adopt a system of monthly financial reporting to DMT's, CMT, and Cabinet and Quarterly to Full Council, with monthly consideration of directorate level financial issues at each Scrutiny Committee. In addition the Council has introduced a system of deta iled monitoring of the delivery of savings targets so that a view is published monthly in Cabinet reports. The Council also holds an annual review of fees and charges and has annual and ongoing programmes of work to identify and understand potential savin gs opportunities. The governance system of the Council - as unpacked in the Annual Governance Statement comprise a rigorous system of financial control. 5 5 25 As reported to CMT 18 April 2023 the Council has a balanced Outturn for financial year 2022/23. Although general reserves have been used in the sum of \u00a39m there has been no drawdown on the Working Balance. A balanced budget and Council tax was agreed at the February 2023 Full Council meeting. These are major pieces of the MTFP update to cover the 5 year period to 2017/18. A revised MTFP is currently being updated with continued input to be given by SLT ahead of the September 2023 Council sign off. Revisions will also be implemented to the monthly monitoring reports to focus on savings delivery, given the \u00a323m target. For Capital, a revised capital governance is being proposed to tighten the reporting and understanding of the programme, with additional information included in each monitoring report. 5 5 25 David Northey 20 Lawful Accounting Treatments in Respect of the Pensions Fund 5 5 25 Options appraisal undertaken with Chief Executive and Assistant Chief Executive with a view to finding an acceptable closure.

Schedule 3 provides a framework for approval and adoption of drainage systems, an approving body (SAB) and national s tandards on the design, construction, operation and maintenance of SUDS. This is highly likely to be introduced from 2024 and will be a risk for the local authority from FY 2024/2025. No provision has been made in the MTFP although Government grant may b e Resource and funding implications of legislation being implemented to bring into operation 'Suds Approval Bodies' or SAB, within Lead Local Flood Authorities, that could require PCC to adopt and main tain SUDS surface water drainage assets such as underground storage tanks, pipes, ponds, swales etc that serve Private development. This has implications for the Council in that it is likely that the Council will be required to technically approve and fo rmally adopt, inspect and maintain SUDS features in a similar to a new estate road. General lack of resources but there will be a requirement to: set up a SAB, run and operate it, and the operation and maintenance of SuDS. 5 4 20 At the moment this is a proposal and would not be implemented until 2024. No information provided at present. Previously when the LLFA's were established, ring fenced GOV'T funding was p rovided for the first 3 years on a reducing basis. Consultation likely in 2023 and therefore responses need to reflect the need for funding to take on this function. The key considerations will be: Policy requirements; national standards and guidance req uirements; cost and funding; future working with partners; skills and capability of local authority to take on this function. 5 4 20 Paul Barnard # OFFICIAL provided at the outset but could decline year on year.

Cost cutting reductions have been made where possible. The board are meeting in May 23 to discuss and agree the business plan and in June they will meet with Shareholders to discuss. CATERed is a going concern within the period but the long term viability is a significant concern - Escalated to Stra tegic Risk 4 5 20 Tina Brinkworth 6 Place Insufficient economic performance to sustain the City's economy and growth plans. Account management of our key businesses will help early identification of risks. Labour market remains very tight and we are working closely with people directorate to support the skills launch pad.

Health Protection Group established and meets fortnightly to discuss issues related to COVID -19 and other infectious diseases. 4 4 16 The key mitigation of vaccination has now reached around 85% (one or more doses) of those eligible. Mitigations have been removed and we have be en seeing sustained low levels but fewer surges. The longstanding advice to the general public remains in place and is re - emphasised at regular intervals. 3 3 12 Ruth Harrell / Rob Nelder # OFFICIAL 8 ODPH Failure to reduce Health Inequalities will mean our poorest residents continue to live shorter lives as well as more years in ill health. The Thrive Plymouth framework Plymouth Plan and Integrated Commissioning Strategies 4 4 16 Persistent action across t he Council and the city is required at many levels to tackle inequalities by addressing the wider detriments of health , as embedded in the Plymouth Plan. Austerity, the pandemic, and the current economic downturn and cost of living crisis all serve to wide n health inequalities. Thrive Plymouth continues, with a wide range of partners, and work to tackle child poverty and support people in need is ongoing but is unlikely to sufficiently mitigate the impact of the current risks to narrow HI. 4 4 16 Ruth Harre ll / Rob Nelder 9 People Increased and sustained pressure on Adult Social Care budget due to increased costs of providing care, growing numbers of people and increased complexity of need.

We will continue cost of care exercises locally, including working with our local care market to better understand impact on finance and resources. We will continue engagement with Local Government Agency and regional and national groups (such as ADASS) to determine approach to managing all reforms. We will continue to seek to understand impacts of all reforms through our established transformation programmes, and will consider potential use of Offers and Asks due to cost of new burden s on the service. 4 4 16 Gary Walbridge 5 People Lack of adult social care workforce and growing fragility of Adult Social Care Market leading to inability of Authority to meet statutory duties and meet eligible need.

Enhanced cleaning regime of buses to continue. Ensure clear messaging by transport providers about maximising messages about maintaining sa fe travel. In March 2021, the Government announced its new National Bus Strategy \"Bus Back Better\" making a further \u00a33bn of funding available for the 3 years from April 2022 to significantly improve bus services across the country. In the end only \u00a31bn w as available and although PCC has not received any additional BSIP funding from the \u00a31bn released, PCC has confirmed that it will introduce an Enhanced Partnership from the 31st October 2022. At the moment it is not possible to deliver Plymotion to encour age the take up of bus services. Schemes continue to be delivered through the Transport Capital Programme to encourage patronage returning to pre -Pandemic levels as soon as possible.

The DfT has set out minimum staffing levels, but recognising that as the DfT, it will ne ed to cover the cost of salaries and redundancies. As we stand, the DfT is unable to confirm funding to cover the cost of salaries for 23/24 and for covering any redundancy costs should that be required. The 2022/23 allocation of funding for the STB from the DfT is \u00a3585K but only \u00a3338K is indicated of which none has yet found its way to PCC's account as Accountable Body for the STB. The DfT as with other Government Departments is under Plymouth City Council is the Accountable Body for Peninsula Transport Sub -National Transport Body and subject to final Board approval on the 2nd March will become the Lead Authority and also to be the employer and host to the proposed Core Peninsula Transport Staff. A governance structure is already in place for Peninsula Transport to ensure that the STB's annual business plans are managed and delivered. DfT has set out its expectations for minimal staffing levels required within each STB in order that they can pe rform their strategic role and in doing so continue to receive central government support. In moving to a permanent core staff structure, the DfT are keen for Peninsula Transport to provide more support in the future, to individual constituent local autho rities that make up Peninsula Transport. The additional core staff resource is likely to reduce the need for the STB to commission work from external consultees to those tasks which require specialist knowledge and skills not available within the core sta ff resource. 2 4 8 The DfT has restated their commitment to ensure that the host authority for these positions will not be liable for all costs relating to these posts and any redundancies should they be required. Hold a meeting between the STB, DfT and P CC to understand whether DfT are able to honour their commitment to cover cost of salaries and underwrite cost of redundancies before commencing recruitment.
