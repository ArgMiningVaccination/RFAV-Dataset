WXIX-TV/FOX19 produced the story locally which was picked up by MSN nationally. Fichtenbaum says it's still worthwhile for people to get the J & J vaccine despite that comparitively low effectiveness rate With Moderna testing at 94% effective and Pfizer testing at 95%, Fichtenbaum expects that people will have a preference in which vaccine they will receive. \"When we continue to test new vaccines, we're testing them in a different environment where there are these strains that are emerging where the vaccine may not respond as well,\" Fichtenbaum says. \"So, if we tested Moderna or Pfizer vaccine under those conditions, would they still be the same as 95%? I'm not so certain.\" Lead photo/Getty Images Next Lives Here The University of Cincinnati is classified as a Research 1 institution by the Carnegie Commission and is ranked in the National Science Foundation's Top-35 public research universities.
