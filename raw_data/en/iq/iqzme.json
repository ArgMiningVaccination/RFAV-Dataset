Opinion V irus-like particles or what is called VLPs for short are considered a useful tool in the development of vaccines. These VLPs-based vaccines h ave attracted the attention of many biotech and pharmaceutical companies as effective treatment for many types of non-infectious c hronic diseases. VLPs simply resemble viruses; however they are non- infectious due to the lack of viral genome. The expression of envelop or c apsid proteins result in the self-assembly of the particle, this assembly can easily be carried out in bacteria, yeast, plant cells or insect cell lines. The presence of repetitive viral surface protein epitopes is s uccessful in eliciting strong B cell responses. VLPs have also high safety profile due to the lack of viral genome and lack of the ability to r eplicate. This area of research is not really new, the discovery of h epatitis B virus derived VLPs goes back to 1976. An interesting class of VLPs is the \"bacteriophage Q\" , an icosahedral virus with a diameter of about 30nm. This virus can r eplicate efficiently in E.coli . The capsid protein, which is ~ 14kDa, can b e re-combinantly expressed in E.coli and spontaneously assembles in the cytoplasmic compartment of the bacteria. The VLPs are then ready f or the purification process using the modern biotechnology t echniques. The VLPs themselves are not the target of the vaccine but rat her a template to display different antigens of interest. The idea is to im prove the immunogenicity of conjugated antigens (the targets of the vaccine) to enhance B cell receptor cross-linking and uptake by dendritic cells resulting in efficient presentation to the adaptive imm unocytes, an efficient active immunisation strategy. A ctive immunization using VLPs has several advantages over the passive method where monoclonal antibodies are used. mAbs have already shown significant results in the research and clinical settings s uch as in the case of arthritis or other chronic diseases. However, mAbs suffer from several drawbacks, such as primary and secondary t reatment failure, the undesirable cost production specially for long term treatment in chronic diseases and tolerability issues. The following paragraphs summarize some interesting work carried o ut in this field by the pioneer in VLPs-Based Vaccines (Martin B achmann); the professor of vaccinology at the University of Oxfordand the professor of Immunology at the University of Bern. A VLP- b ased vaccine for hypertension has shown promising results in the preclinical studies and reached phase II clinical trial with good safety and efficacy profile. Simply Angiotensin-II peptide was efficiently conjugated to VLPs (Q) which was highly immunogenic in different animal models as well as humans. The results obtained in the phase II s tudy indicated that (AngQ) can reduce the blood pressure to the same levels obtained by ACE blockers. This vaccine is favourable over t he conventional treatment as it induces long lasting effect with less n umber of doses. Also this may overcome the problem of inconsistency happened with daily tablets. VLPs have also been tested as an effective vaccine in allergy r epresenting a major problem worldwide. Q particles were filled up w ith DNA-oligonucleotides containing CpG-motifs which is known to stimulate toll receptor 9 of the innate immune system. The authors h ave focused on allergic rhinitis and asthma and they concluded that clinically effective treatment can be obtained even in the absence of al lergens. Results encourage further investigation of virus-like particles and CpG-motifs in immunotherapy, either as a stand-alone product, or as adjuvants for allergen-specific immunotherapy. VLP s have also shown promising results with cancer; a melanoma specific peptide was chemically linked to Q particles which also have been loaded with DNA oligonucleotides containing CpGs motifs. In this study they have used Melan-A/Mart-1 peptide as a potent inducer of specific cytotoxic T-cells responses. The vaccine was tested in phase I/II clinical trials with melanoma patients in stages II-IV . The vaccine was very well tolerated in these patients and a good percentage showed detectable specific T-cell response to the above mentioned antigen with significant levels of INFg as well. The research concluded that vaccin ation with CpGs loaded virus-like nanoparticles is associated with a human CD8 T-cell response with properties of a potential long- term immune protection from the disease. In conclusion, VLPs-Based Vaccines constitute a promising field for t reating different non-infectious chronic diseases with affordable expenses, high efficacy and large safety profiles.Mohsen, Gene Technol 2016, 5:1 DOI: 10.4172/2329-6682.1000136 Opinion Open Technol ISS N:2329-6682 open access JournalVolume 5 Issue 1 1000.136GeneTechnology ISSN: 2329-6682Gene Technology "}
