This is particularly important for people with diabetes, who may be at higher risk for COVID-complications. While unvaccinated adults tend to be younger in general, there are no data on vaccine attitudes or uptake in young adults with T1D. We explored vaccine uptake in young adults with T1D across demographic and clinical factors and identified common reasons for not getting the vaccine. Methods: At baseline of an ongoing behavioral intervention trial (Feb-Dec 2021) , 35 young adults with 14% other/multiple, M A1c=8.9\u00b12.4%) reported on vaccination status. Unvaccinated participants provided open-text comments on their reasons. Results: Overall, 69% of participants were vaccinated (2 doses) . Unvaccinated participants had higher median A1c than vaccinated participants (9.7% vs. 7.6%, p=0.03) ; every 1.0% increase in A1c was associated with 22.2% decreased odds of being vaccinated. There were no differences in vaccine uptake by age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, employment, pump or CGM use, or health insurance. The unvaccinated participants reported reasons including: distrust of the vaccine research/effectiveness (4) , uncertainty about health impacts (including T1D) /waiting to see impact on others' health (2) , no time to get vaccinated (1) , indifference (1) , no desire for vaccination (2) , and still thinking about it (1) . Conclusion: In a small, diverse sample of young adults with T1D, COVID-vaccinations mirrored national rates. Some participants may have been vaccinated after completing surveys at baseline. Patterns of high A1c and unvaccinated status may place young adults at increased risk as the pandemic continues. Healthcare providers are well positioned to counsel young adults about vaccine information and considerations related to T1D, which may reduce misinformation and increase uptake. K.R.Desai: None.
