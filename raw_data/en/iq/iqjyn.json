Our tutors are all College of Healing trained and are experienced practitioners in their own right. We aim for a 1/6 tutor to student ratio with each student being allocated a Tutor/Mentor.

Are you clairvoyant (receive information visually), clairaudient (hearing), clairsentient (receive information via your physical body)? Do you learn best via the written word, the spoken word, by physical activity? At the end of the course some of our students go on to set up a professional healing practice, some incorporate their new skills and understanding into their existing work and life and some continue to work on their personal and spiritual development. Our Practitioner course has been continually developed and reviewed since its creation in 1983 and offers you the legacy of our 40 years' experience; and a spiritual home. Our course is held in high esteem within the Healing world as a whole, due to the strength, passion and commitment of Diane O'Connell, one of our College Founders. As well as healing skills the course highlights areas of spiritual growth within our students and we ask that you undergo your own monthly Healing sessions to allow you to continue your self-development outside the teaching environment. As you grow you become less easily affected by emotional and environmental influences and able to respond better to life's challenges.
