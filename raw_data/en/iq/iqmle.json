The remaining information has been shuffled and presented in anew order and new form arranged by themes.A 47 page guide to the budget was provided with the budget for the purpose oflocating functionalmaterials, economic information, and specificanalyses and tables.A more subtle change inthe budget is that thedescriptions of the President's spending proposals in the new Section Oneof the budgetare not readily linked to the budget amounts presented for eachfunction in Section Two.In the past, Section 5 ofthe budget presenteda concise account of the President's proposalsin each function alongwith a summary of the budget amounts for the,function.The fiscal year 1991 budget organizes a series of policy statementsby thematic categoriesunrelated to budget functions and does notprovide any explanation ofthe costs or savings from proposed legislation includedin tables of budget authority and outlays by function.This makes it difficult todetermine quickly thespecific budget effects of the policiesproposed in the budget.Since the Budget Act requires the budget resolution tospecify functional totals for spendingand credit authority, this Summary and Analysis of the President's Budget has been arranged,as usual, by functional category. (I) I.OVERVIEW AND MAJOR ISSUES RECEIPTS, OUTLAYS, DEFICIT/SURPLUS UNDER THE PRESIDENT'S PROPOSED POLICY*(in Surplus/Deficit-121.4-61.4-24.4+20.0+64.2+110.8*The administration's 'consolidated' budget includes outlays to the Social Security Integrity and Debt Reduction Fund and net outlays of the Postal Service. The administration's budget on current budget concepts excludes these items. A.Major Themes in the BudgetThe budget message of the President to Congress that introduces the fiscal year 1991 budget describes five broad themes of the budget:Investing in Our Future\"-- Proposals listed in this category include thecapital gains tax cut and incentives for family savings, which are intended to increase the level of private investment in the economy, as well as increases in spending for research and development, space exploration, and certain education programs such as Head Start, which are intended to increase human capital.The President also includes increased spendingfor the war on drugs and continued high levels of defense spending in this category.\"Advancing States as Laboratories -- The President's budget lists a number of state and localprograms which are described as innovativeapproaches to the provision of government services.The, budget states that some of these programs have been aided by Federal grants and some have been made possible by Federal statutory or administrative waivers. (3) 4 \"Reforming Mandatory Programs\" -- The President points out that nearlyhalf of Federal spending is for entitlements and other mandatory spending,in addition to the 14 percent of the budget that goes to interest paymentson the national debt.The Presidents budget proposes mandatory programreforms that would save $13.9 billion in fiscal year 1991, with the largestcuts proposed for Medicare ($5.5 billion, not including $1.7 billion inincreased revenues from requiring coverage of all state and localgovernment employees by the Medicare tax), farm programs ($1.8 billion),and Federal employee health and retirement benefits ($4.5 billion).\"Acknowledging Inherited Claims\" -- The Presidents budget discusses thedemands on current and future resources resulting from environmentaldamage at nuclear weapons facilities, unfunded annuities, and Federalinsurance programs.\"Managing for Integrity and Efficiency\" -- The President's budget proposesbudget process and program management reforms. The budget also proposesreduced funding for discretionary programs that are described as \"low-return\" programs, including mass transit, Amtrak, sewage treatment plantconstruction, new subsidized housing construction, and community servicesblock grants.In addition, in anew section in the drastically revised budget document,the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, Richard G. Darman, providesa \"Director's Introduction to the New Budget\" which stresses the following majorthemes:\"Global Historical Perspective\" -- The Director argues that the greathistorical shift apparently taking place in Europe has been almosttrivialized in the discussion of the \"peace dividend.\"Rather, hesuggests, these events place new emphasis on the importance of U.S.economic growth; budget policy should, instead, address the issue of howto achieve a \"growth dividend.\"\"Deficit-Estimating Perspective\" -- The Director discusses differentconcepts of the budget deficit, some of which are new to this budget.Deficits calculated under these concepts include the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings(GRH) Baseline Deficit, the Adjusted GRH Baseline Deficit, the President'sPolicy Deficit (including and excluding \"speed-ups\"), the On-Budget PolicyDeficit, and the ConsolidatedBudget Deficit. (None of these concepts,however, is the current budget deficit concept most recently used by theCongress and the President.The administration's budget deficits onseveral concepts are projected in Section III. B.)In this context, theDirector also discusses the current treatment of Social Security, whosesurpluses have masked the true size of the underlying non-Social Securityoperating deficit, and introduces the administration's proposed \"SocialSecurity Integrity and Debt Reduction Fund\" to deal with this problem.\"CaDital Budgeting Perspective\" -- The Director notes that the curren,t\"cash\" budget concept is useful if it involves a consodated accountingthat shows the total governmental cash position.However, to get a bettersense of future iabflities and the extent to which current income andborrowing finance investment for the future, some form of capital budgetconcept is required.(The budget presents alternate approaches to capitabudgeting in a more detailed section.) The Director also notes that, by 5 several different measures, the deficit seems to have stabflized and \"thepattern of continuous erosion that characterized the early- and mid-1980sseems to have been broken.\" However, this development is contingent upon continued economic growth, and stabilization should not lead to complacencyin light of future hidden liab'iUtes.\"A Perspective That Gves Greater Weight to Future Liabilities\" -- The Director argues that some major future liabflities of the Federalgovernment are hidden under current budget practices and, \"like a hidden PACMAN [are] waiting to spring forward and consume another line of resource dots in the budget maze.\"He discusses briefly the future liabilitiesrelated to the rising costs of health care, the rising budgetary claims of mandatory programs, unfunded liabilities of retirement programs (including, under some assumptions, Social Security), obligations for environmentalclean-up at Federal facihties, contingent risks of Federal credit programs and government-sponsored enterprises (GSE5), and the contingent risks of Federal insurance programs. He estimates that the \"amortized\" annual amount of the projected \"underfunding\" may be on the order of one-half to one percent of GNP, assuming the problem is managed on an orderly basis.Dealing with this would require reforms in mandatory, credit and insurance programs, reduced spending on other programs, increased governmentmanagerial efficiency, and growth-oriented economic and budget policies.\"A Perspective That Attends to Investment in the Future\" -- The Director briefly discusses administration proposals for \"investing in the future.\" These include deficit reduction to raise public saving; incentives for private savings and long-term investment (capital gains tax cut, IRA modifications, and Famfly Savings Accounts); funds for space exploration and research and development; pubflc investments in education and human capital; expenditures for drug control; the Enterprise Zones proposal and project HOPE (Home Ownership and Opportunity for People Everywhere);environmental protection; programs to \"foster and preserve the American Heritage;\" national security; and management oversight.\"A Congressional Perspective\"-- The Director criticizes Congress's budgetary use of the current services baseline (the projections which display the real cost of programs after adjustment for inflation). He reintroduces a budget projection developed by 0MB in 1989, the \"Current Congressional Path,'to underline the importance of legislation for thebudget and laments the \"games now 'in play\"-- what he calls the Spend-the - Peace Dividend-Game, the Cut-Social-Security-Game, and the Beat-the-Budget-Game,He observes, finally, that \"sooner or 'ater, the American politicalsystem will rise to the responsibility to be serious: to complete the job of fiscal policy correction.\" 6 B.The President's Deficit Reduction PlanThe following analysis of the President's proposals, arranged by majorspending and revenue categories, follows the current budget concepts used byCongress and, before this year, by the administration. However, an adjustment is made to reconcile this presentation with the administration's\"consolidated deficit\", which includes the Postal Service (an off-budgetFederal agency) and the \"costs\" of the administration's proposed SocialSecurity Integrity and Debt Reduction Fund., (For a description of the latter, see section I.D.)The President reduces the 1991 deficit sharply, to $61.4 billion, belowthe Gramm-Rudman-Hollings (GRH) target of $64 billion. His plan calls for $39.1 billion in deficit reduction as compared with the \"adjusted GRHbaseline\" deficit of $100.5 billion. (See Section VI. A. fora discussion of the GRH baseline.)Over the five-year period FY 1991 -FY 1995, he proposes more than $320 billion in deficit reduction. The President's Deficit Reduction Plan(In billions.Deficit increase mandatories 13.9119.1 Medicare (5.5) Civil service/military ret'ment.

This constitutes a budget authority cut of $9.3 billion from the 0MB GRH baseline and an outlay reduction of $3.2 billion. By 1995 nominal defense funding would be about 8 percent higher than the 1990 level but almost 11 percent below the baseline.As a result, outlays would total $87.5 billion less than the baseline over the five-year period FY 1991 -FY 1995.Non-defense discretionary programs show a net budget authorityincrease of $0.8 billion and a net outlay increase of $1.0 billion as compared to OMB's GRH baseline. Over five years, total spending tracks OMB's baseline very closely. However, many sizable long-term increases and decreases are built into the net total.Increases include: the U.N., Dept. of Energy cleanup costs, NASA, NSF, the Superconducting Supercollider, the \"America the Beautiful\" initiative, Superfund, av,iation programs, the Coast Guard, homeless programs, Presidential merit schools and magnet schools, Head Start, Veterans' hospital construction, drug abuse programs (especially law enforcement), and the IRS.Decreases include: Ex-Im Bank loans, REA and FmHA loans, fossil energy R&D, state energy conservation grants and low-income weatherization, Park Service construction, EPA sewer construction grants, Amtrak, mass transit, highways, CDBGs and other community development programs (e.g. ARC, EDA, Community development loans, rural water and waste disposal), library grants, Impact Aid part B, Perkins/NDSL student loans, health professions eduction and training, the Community Services Block Grant, housing for the elderly and handicapped, Employment Services, low-income home energy assistance, Public and Indian housing construction, assistance to states under the immigration reform law, and juvenile justice grants.Entitlements and other mandatory programs are reduced (net) by $13.9 billion.This includes major cuts in Medicare, Civil Service and Military Retirement, CCC and Crop Insurance programs, Federal Employee health benefits, Power Marketing programs, and many other programs.Smaller increases are proposed for Foster Care and Adoption Assistance and for the refundable portion of a new Child Care tax credit.The net savings would grow rapidly each year, significantly more rapidly than the general growth of mandatory programs, and would total almost $120 billion over the five- year period FY 1991 -FY 1995.Governmental ReceiDts (i.e. revenues) are increased by $13.9 billion above the baseline in 1991.This total includes a $4.9 billion increase assumed to come from tax cuts for capital gains.The total also includes increases of $3.0 billion to come primarily from \"Internal Revenue Service management reforms\" and, secondarily, from an increase in the IRS budget. Major components of the remaining $5.1 billion net increaseare a $3.8 billion increase from extending Medicare and Social Security payroll taxes to employees of state and local government that are not now covered, a $1.6 billion increase from extension and speedup of the current 3 percent excise tax on telephone service, and a speedup of the payroll tax. Major revenue- losing proposals include extension of expiring tax benefits (tax credits for 8 research and experimentation, low-income housing, and health insurancedeductions for the self-employed), a \"family savings't incentive, taxincentives for oil and gas, tax incentives for \"enterprise\" zones, and a newChild Care tax credit.The revenue increase of $13.9 billion inFY 1991 shrinks to an average of $7billion per year in FY 1992 -1995 for three reasons: the capital gainsproposal increases revenues primarily In the first few year; some effects ofthe IRS reforms are temporary; and the payroll and telephone tax speed-upsare essentially timing shifts with virtually no long-term effect. (Seesection IV. B.)User fees and other offsetting collections are increased by $5.6billion above the baseline, slightly more than the $5.5 billion recommendedlast year.Most of the proposals were included in last year's budget andwere rejected by Congress.The two largest single proposals, to auction offradio broadcast rights and to lease the Naval Petroleum Reserve, produceonly short-term savings.(See section VI. D.)Other offsetting receirts show the effects in Function 950 of changesin accrual payments from Federal agencies to the Federal retirement andhealth funds.The major proposed change would increase Postal Servicepayments on behalf. of its annuitants. This is accounted as a receipt by on-budget agencies, but the ultimate deficit reduction would be accomplishedthrough an increase in the price of stamps.Asset sales and loan prepayments are proposed for each of the next fiveyears, with net proceeds reflecting almost $0.2 billion per year in lostrevenue starting in FY 1992. (See section VI. E.) 13 D. National Saving, the Social Security Surplus, and the'Social Security Integrity and Debt Reduction Fund' A great deal of concern has been raised recently about the use, or what many call misuse, of the taxes for Social Security, and the surpluses in the Social Security trust funds (Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance-- OASDI).These surpluses result from payroll taxes that are higher than immediately needed to cover the cost of current Social Security benefits.The surpluses result from the Social Security Amendments of 1977 and 1983 that were intended to build up reserves in advance of the rise in benefit costs that will occur when the baby boom generations retire.The issues related to the Social Security surplus are:masking the non-Social Security deficit,the regressive shift in taxation,providing for the future and intergenerational equity,the administration's new proposal. Social Security Surpluses Mask a Very Large Non-Social-Security DeficitCurrently, the Social Security surpluses offset a deficit in the rest of the budget and mask the size of the non-Social Security deficit, as shown by the following Congressional Budget Offlce baseUne projections of JanUary 1990.Table1CBO Budget Baseline Projections(Hscal years, billions of dollars)199019911992199319941995Total Federal budget deficit -138-138-135-141-130-118Social Security surplus j/ 66748598112128Non-Social Security deficit -204-212-221-239-242-246Non-Social Securitydeficit as a percentageof GNP 3.73.73.63.63.53.4jJ The Social Security surplus includes interest receipts from the general Fund, an intra-budgetary transaction. Beginning in 1990, the amounts are $16 billion, $22 billion, $27 billion, $34 billion, $42 billion and $50 billion. These amounts correspondingly enlarge the non-Social Security deficit.The Regressive Shift in TaxationWhile payroll taxes have been raised to pay for Social Security and Medicare, non-Social Security taxes, principally the income taxes, have been cut relative to Gross National Product since 1981. 14 This move away from income taxes and toward payroll taxes has shiftedFederal government taxes toward those with the least ability to pay. Since thepayroll tax applies only to wages up to a ceiling ($51,300 in 1990), it failsto tax the wages and salaries of higher-income Americans to the same extent asthat of lower-middle income Americans. Furthermore, it lacks a personalexemption, does not tax income from capital which is concentrated in the handsof high-income people and does not have graduated tax rates. In contrast, theindividual income tax takes a higher proportionof high than low incomes.Reducing the income tax and increasing the payroll tax makes the overall taxsystem less progressive.The Congressional Budget Office estimates that between 1980 and 1990, theeffective rate of Federal taxation on the bottom twenty percent of the incomedistribution will go up by 16 percent, while the effective tax rate on the topten percent of the income distribution will go down by 7 percent. Thisregressive shift in taxation is analyzed in more detail in section IV. C.,\"Analysis of Tax Policy,\" in this report.Many argue that the payroll tax is acceptable If it is dedicated to payingfor present and future Social Security benefits. However, the Social Securitysurpluses created with the payroll tax are now being used to offset a deficitin the rest of the budget, rather being saved to prepare the nation to payfuture Social Security benefits. Critics charge that this an inappropriate useof the tax that is supposed to be dedicated to Social Security.For this reason, some, including Senator Moynihan, have suggested thateither the Social Security surplus be used for its intended purpose -- a net addition to national saving -- or, failing that, that Social Security be putback on a pay-as-you-go basis by cutting payroll taxes.Providing for the Future: The ProblemMany believe the current situation is contrary to the intent of the 1977and 1983 Social Security Amendments, because these surpluses are not being usedto prepare the nation to furnish future retirement benefits to the baby-boomgenerations.Preparing the nation to support future retirees is a problem because therewill be about 40 percent fewer workers per retiree in the year 2025 than now.In the next forty-five years, the burden of Social Security benefits (notincluding Medicare) will rise about 50 percent (from about 4.5 percent of GNPin 1990 to about 6.8 percent of GNP in 2035). The benefits that have beenpromised will be difficult to pay if the nation is not prepared for this addedburden.A purely pay-as-you-go Social Security system, the historical norm, wouldput a higher tax burden, as a percent of their incomes, on future workers thanis being placed on current workers. Many regard this outcome as inequitablebetween generations.It is not just the nation's promises of retirement benefits to the baby-boomers that creates the need to prepare more adequately for the future. Thereis also the added combination of current total budget deficits and a very lowprivate saving rate.Large total budget deficits in the 1980s have divertedprivate saving away from investment and caused the U.S. to go into debtinternationally.Part of any gain from investment in the U.S. is now mortgagedto outside creditors.The current net national saving rate is only one-third of our averagesaving rate between 1950 and 1980. There is an acute need to reduce government 15 deficits and run surpluses so as to reverse this decline, increase investment, reduce international indebtedness and promote growth in productivity.The benefits of deficit reduction are analyzed in more detail in Section III. A., \"Deficits and the Economy,\" in this report.Saving the Social Security Surplus and Preparing to Pay Future BenefitsWe cannot literally hoard and \"set aside\" food, clothing, shelter and medical care in a vault for the baby-boomers' use when they retire. These goods and services will have to be produced by future workers and transferred to future retirees at that time. Furthermore, no accountingor policy changes can significantly change the underlying demographic facts.Therefore, the fundamental issue is whether we will take action now to expand the size of the future economic pie. By expanding the pie, the standard of living of future workerscan be protected even though they will have toshare a higher proportion of the pie with retirees than do today's workers.The most directly effectiveway to expand resources for the future is to eliminate the budget deficit and to create a total budget surplus, or equivalently to preserv\u00e7 the Social Security surpluses and balance the non- Social Security budget.'This policy also accomplishes the transfer of some of the burden of future benefits from future workers to present workers.A total budget surplus produces net retirement of debt held by the public. This would convert the nation's fiscal policy from one that absorbed and extinguished scarce private saving into one that supplemented it.The resulting new investment would make future workers more productive and would raise the income of future workers who will have to support today's workers in their retirement.The nation would be better prepared to support the baby-boom generations in their retirement, and the baby-boomers would be more likely to receive the benefits they have been promised. A Social Security surplus cannot by itself produce capital formation and higher future incomes, because it can be, and is, being offset bya deficit in the rest of the budget.Running a total budget surplus would also transfer some future Social Security financing burdens from future workers to today's workers.Sufficient spending cuts or tax increases to bring about a budget surplus would reduce the consumption of today's workers, while increasing the income of future workers. A payroll-tax-financed Social Security surplus does not by itself accomplish this intergenerational transfer. There is no reduction in the consumption of present workers when the added payroll tax used to create a Social Security surplus is offset by lower general taxes or higher government programs elsewhere in the budget.What Happens When the Baby Boom Generations RetireAs explained above, sincewe cannot literally hoard and \"set aside\" food, clothing, shelter and medical care for the baby-boomers' retirement, these goods and services will be produced by future American workers (except to the extent they can be borrowed from abroad) and transferred to retirees. Even if the 1The nation's future ability to produce could also be increased by shifting government spending away from consumption (for example, current Social Security and Medicare benefits) and toward public investment (for example, technological research, infrastructure, and education and health benefits for children).However, there is intense controversy over which programs are truly investment-oriented and which are successful in raising productivity. 16 Social Security surplus is \"saved,\" this is the mechanism by which SocialSecurity benefit promises should be fUlfilled, and will probably have to befulfilled.Most likely, the transfer of resources from future workers to retireeswould be effected by higher general taxes. The Social Security system willredeem its Tr'asury securities, and in order to provide the cash, general taxeswill have to be raised.Cuts in non-Social Security spending could also play arole.The alternative is to attempt to pay for benefits by draining away privatesavings and investment into higher national consumption. This could beattempted either through government borrowing or, if, hypothetically, SocialSecurity had made private investments, by cashing in those investments.Ineither case,a capital shortage would result, reducing national, investmenteither directly or by enlarging our debt to foreigners.The ethics of attempting to pass the cost on to yet another futuregeneration is questionable.This aside, real interest rates would rise, theinternational value of the dollar would rise, the trade balance would worsen,and U.S. national debt to foreigners would rise just as in recent U.S. fiscalhistory.The cost of future Social Security benefits does not exceed itsdedicated taxes for only a few years, but rather from the year 2018 to as farforward as the actuaries forecast, 2063, and beyond. An attempt to pay for thebaby-boomers benefits with borrowing could well founder on the unwillingness offoreign countries to lend massively to the U.S. Such unwillingness couldcreate sufficient economic stress in the form of high interest rates to causethe government to run the monetary printing press, thereby \"taxing\" peoplethough the effects of rapid inflation.Changes in Accounting or Social Security Investment PolicyIn order to \"save' each year's Social Security surplus for the future,there must be and equal amount of annual jjj. retirement of debt held by thepublic.For this to happen, the non-Social Security budget has to be inbalance.Otherwise, funds that might be provided by Social Security to theprivate sector, or state and local governments as some have suggested, areoffset by general fund borrowing. The same proposition is true for any specialfund dedicated to retiring the public debt, or to any other earmarking forSocial Security surpluses. These arrangements cannot be effective unlessbacked up by a total budget surplus.Government or Social Security accounting can be chang'ed to make it aearas though the Social Security surpluses are being \"saved\" or \"invested\" in\"real' things, but as long as the Treasury has to borrow the funds that areused in this manner, there is no increase in national saving or investment.'For example, if Social Security were to invest funds in private securitieswithout any reduction in the non-Social Security deficit, the Treasury wouldhave to borrow more funds from the private sector. The two operations cancelin terms of the net availability of saving for investment.The Administration's New \"Social Security Integrity and Debt Reduction\" ProDosalThe proposes a new \"Social Security Interity and DebtReduction Fund.\"Funds would be mandatorily transferred each year from thegeneral fund to this new fund. The Fund would spend its income on retirementof Treasury debt held by the public until all of this debt is retired. Theadministration estimates that, under its plan, retirement of the debt held bythe public would be completed between the years 2005 and 2010. 17 From 1993 though 1995, the amounts to go into the Fund are percentages ofprojected Social Security surpluses: 15 percent for fiscal year 1993, 50 percentin 1994, and 85 percent for 1995. From 1996 forward, the amount is equal to the entire projected Social Security surplus.Operating the Fund, however,is not by itself sufficient to ensure that the Social Security surpluses actually contribute to reduction of public debt.As explained above,in the absence of a surplus in the total budget, theTreasury would have to finance payments into the Fund by selling securities.The combination of this borrowing and purchase of securities by the Fund wouldbe a shell game.The Fund would appear to be retiring debt, but the governmentas a whole would not.In order to actually bring, about the net retirement of debt held by thepublic, the administration's proposal has two other features.The administration would permanently extend the Gramm-Rudman law, whichrequires a balanced budget in 1993 and whichprovides for the automaticreduction of spending (i.e., sequestration) if the necessary deficit-reductionlegislation were not forthcoming. Social Security would be kept in the budgetas is now the case for purposes of Gramm-Rudman.The administration proposal also requires that the traditional measure ofspending outlays be increased by the amounts transferred to the new Fund.Thus, the extended Gramm-Rudman law would be applied to a budget \"deficit\" thatincludes the projected Social Security surplus as 'spending.Requiring balance in this measure of the budget is effectively the same as requiring a realsurDlus approximately equal to the Social Security surplus.The operation of the \"Social Security Integrity and Debt Reduction Fund\"is symbolic, since retirement of debt held by the public is not really spending;it is the consequence of having an excess of revenues over spending, a budgetsurplus.The correct measure of how the budget affects the general economy andnational saving, for example, does not count retirement of debt as spending.Scoring debt retirement as though it were spending simply masks a surplus inthe total budget.Masking the surplus allows Social Security to kept within the budget, asthe administration wants, without having the. budget show an official surplus.The reason for keeping Social Security in the budget is to discourage attemptsto remove other funds from the budget and to discourage the government fromdissipating the Social Security surplus by increasing Social Security benefitsor cutting the payroll tax.Under the administration's proposals, the projections of the SocialSecurity surplus are not updated during the same budget cycle in which benefitsmight be raised or payroll taxes cut. As a result, the amount scored as spending for debt retirement would immediately be reduced when benefits are raised or taxes cut.Spending in the consolidated budget would go up orrevenues go down, pushing the budget out of compliance with the Gramm-Rudmanbalance requirement.However, there is no absolute guarantee of protection for the SocialSecurity surpluses.The government might time an increase in benefits or cutin payroll taxes to coincide with a once-every-five-year updating of the surplusprojection.In this case, the prospective deficit in the \"official\" budgetwould be offset by a reduction in the amount that would have to be put in thenew fund and scored as spending. Alternatively, the government could hangethe scorekeeping. 18Section III. B.,\"Administration Projectionsand Deficit Reduction Proposals,\" of thisreport shows how theadministration budget isable to show a future path thatappears to comply with the new Gramm-Rudman proposals. Economic assumptionsplay the key role. 19 E.Budget Policies, the Distribution of Income, and PovertyDuring the 1980s, the distribution of before-tax income becamemore unequal;Federal tax policies exacerbated the increasing inequality of income, as taxrates were reduced for the upper 20 percent of the population and rose for theother 80 percent, with the most rapid rise for the lowest-income taxpayers; andthe poverty rate was not reduced despite a large rise in employment and agenerally healthier economy at the end of the decade than at its beginning. In this section, these three developments will be discussed in turn, concludingwith a discussion of the characteristics of the poverty population in 1988.The Distribution of Income Before TaxBetween 1980 and 1988, gains in real before-tax income have been sharplyskewed toward the upper end of the income distribution. The poorest 20 percent of families had an average real income gain of just 1 percent over those eightyears, despite the fact that the economy in 1988 had lower unemployment andinflation than in 1980, while the top 5 percent of families had average realincome gains of 26 percent.These trends are shown in the following chart.Figure 1 Census data show that the income gap between rich and poor families waswider in 1988 than in any year since the Census Bureau began collecting thisdata in 1947.The wealthiest fifth of all families received 44 percent ofnational family income, a postwar record. The poorest fifth received 4.6REAL FAMILY INCOME CHANGES 1980-88(BEFORE TAX INCOME BY FIFTHSOF INCOME d.IIaIoy. 20 percent of national family income, the lowest proportion recorded since 1954.It is true that income inequality has been increasing ever since 1968, but theincrease accelerated sharply during the 1980s. Some of this increase ininequality results from social trends such as the rise in female-headedhouseholds and the rise in work by wives at the higher end of the income scale.But the acceleration during the 1980s reflects recent Federal governmentpolicies as well.The failure to increase the minimum wage 'during the 1980s isone source.The large deficits and ballooning debt of the 1980s alsocontri buted.The overvalued dollar caused by deficits and high interest ratesaffected manufacturing competitiveness, employment, and wages.]jjob growth since 1980 has been in \"service-producing industries,\"mainly services and trade, which generally have low-pay jobs.(Claimsare sometimes made that recent job growth has been in high-payingoccupations, but the occupational definitions are so broad that thisclaim is meaningless.)Growing debt and high interest rates meant higher incomes forbondholders, few of whom are in the lower income categories.The Changing Distributionof TaxesReduced rates in the progressive income tax and increased rates for theregressive Social Security taxes combined during the 1980s to make the Federaltax burden lighter on the rich and heavier throughout the rest of the incomedistribution, particularly for the lowest fifth of taxpayers. In the followingtable, Congressional Budget Office calculations of the effective overall Federaltax rate by income group are shown.Table 2Effective Overall Federal Tax RatesIncome Quintile 19801990Percent 20 percent percent 23.022.5-2.2Middle 20 percent 20.020.3+1.5Second 20 percent 15.716.7+6.4Bottom 20 percent 8:49.7+15.5Thus, the effective Federal tax burden has shifted toward those with lessability to pay, and has exacerbated the adverse shift in before-tax income.The same CBO projections of income and tax rates indicate that from 1980 to1990, real after-tax income of the lowest-income taxpayers will have declined 5percent, while the real after-tax income of the richest tenth of families rose41 percent.These data are shown in Figure 2. PovertyFigure 221 The official poverty rate -- the number of persons with incomes below theofficial poverty level for their size family, as a percent of the totalpopulation -- was 13.1 percent in 1988, no lower than in the recession year 1980 when the rate was 13.0 percent. This happened in spite of increases in aggregate real income, declines in the unemployment rate, and increases inemployment between the two years; but it is not surprising in light of theincreasing inequality in the distribution of income that has already beendescribed.A number of criticisms and recalculations of the official poverty ratehave been made.For example, it has been pointed out that rise in the povertyline due to inflation was overstated in the late 1970s and early 1980s becauseof a biased treatment of homeownership in the Consumer Price Index. Last year the Census Bureau calculated an alternative poverty series using a price measure without such bias.This experimental alternative indicates poverty rates of11.5 percent in 1980 and 11.6 percent in 1988 and therefore does not change theconclusion that the poverty rate was unchanged over the 1980s.Another corwnon criticism is that the poverty rate is based on cash incomeonly and does not take into account noncash benefits -- private health insurance and government noncash transfers such as food stamps, public housing, Medicare,and Medicaid.The Census Bureau has also calculated experimental measures ofpoverty for 1988 and 1987 that include these noncash benefits. Under this definition, the poverty rate was 10.5 percent in 1988, not significantly lowerthan in 1987 when it was 10.7 percent. Comparable rates are not available for previous years.However, earlier, related Census Bureau studies showedincreases of 0.4 to 1.0 percentage point in poverty rates including noncashREAL AFTER-TAX FAMILY INCOME CHANGES. 1980-90(ProJected, 1982 dollars. by Iliths of income distribution)REAL PERCENT CHANGE benefits from 1980 to 1987, strongly suggesting that there would be noimprovement in such a poverty rate between 1980 and 1988.Whatever statistical criticisms are made of the official povertythresholds,it is clear that they do not provide a generous standard of living.In 1988, when the median income of four-person families was $39,051, the povertythreshold for such a family was an income of just $12,092. This makes it difficult to argue that current poverty rates overstate the problem of deficientincome.The 1988 poverty estimates give useful information about the structure ofpoverty in an economy at high employment. When the civilian unemployment rate is 5.5 percent, as it was in 1988, there is little \"cyclical\" unemployment, andmost poverty will therefore reflect low earnings and government payments thatare low relative to family size, rather than temporarily low income due torecession.Table3Poverty in 1988In PovertyNumber,Rate (percent 15.810.5 to 74 1.810.0 75 and older 1.715.2By family status:In married couple families 11.16.6Female households, no husband 12.738.1 Not in families 7.120.6 Living alone, 65 and older 2.123.6All families 6.810.4 Householders age 15-64, total 6.211.3By work experience:Worked full year, full time 1.12.9 Worked full time, part year 1.218.2Worked part time 1.026.5Did not work 2.944.1 These tabulations show that the highest poverty rate by age is amongchildren -- 20 percent.The \"young old'(ages 65 to 74) have poverty rates slightly lower than working-age adults, but the 'old old\" (75 and older) havehigher rates.Poverty rates are far lower among married-couple families than among thoseliving alone, and over one-third of persons living in female-householderfamilies are living below the poverty line.Finally, poverty among households where the householder is of working ageis mainly associated with not working, working less than full time or working 23less than a full year.There were 1.1 million families where the householderworked full-time and full-year and the family was still poor.This represented one-sixth of all poor families, although the poverty rate for such families was only 2.9 percent.Federal government spending policies have had different effects on different low-income demographic groups. Congressional Budget Office Director Robert Reischauer has testified before the Ways and Means Committee that AFDCbenefits fell roughly 25 percent in real terms between 1975 and 1987. The Census Bureau has estimated that cash benefits lifted from poverty in 1979 18.9 percent of families with children who otherwise would have been poor, but by 1987, the number was 10.5 percent. On the other hand, according to Reischauer's testimony, SSI benefits for the elderly rose in real terms because they were 'indexed to a CPI that overstated inflation. III.FISCAL POLICY The basic fiscal policy problem facing the United States in 1990 remains what it has been throughout the 1980s: ending the drain on national saving represented by the Federal deficit. Once that drain has been ended by the achievement of a balanced total budget -- an achievement scheduled for Fiscal Year 1993 in the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Reaffirmation Act of 1987 (Gramm-Rudman-Hollings, or GRH) -- many have recommended that the U.S. fiscal policy goal should be a budget surplus equal to the projected buildup in the Social Security trust fund, which would translate into balance in the non-Social-Security budget. Such an achievement wouldmean that the Federal government as a whole would be adding to national saving, rather than subtracting from it as at present. This addition to national saving would mean more investment and a more productive economy in the 21st century when the resources will be needed to support the baby boom generation in its retirement.The President's budget projections are consistent with this goal. However, they achieve the goal as much by optimistic economic and technical assumptions as by hard policy proposals. The projections of the Congressional Budget Office suggest that the President's actual policy proposals will not in fact achieve the balance in 1993 in the total budget, and the implied balance in 1996 in the non-Social Security budget, that they project.Part A of this section discusses the effects of deficits on the economy. Part B presents the President's projections and the effects of his policy proposals on his projected deficit. Part C discusses the projections of the Congressional Budget Office and Part D uses the CBO projections to analyze the actual fiscal restraint in the President's budget.A.Deficits and the EconomyDespite a current slowdown, generally expected to be temporary, the U.S. economy has been and is expected to be operating near its effective capacity, where \"capacity\" is definedas the highest level of capital utilization and the lowest level of unemploymentconsistent with a stable rate of inflation. The problem of utilizing unusedresources has been relatively small over the last year.The bigger problem has been increasing the productivity of the resources we employ: providing more (and more efficient) plant and equipment and better education and training to the American work force.This is required for higher standards of living in the 1990s, and will be a necessity for supporting the baby boom generation in itsretirement in the 21st Century, no matter whatmeans of financing Social Security is chosen. Because improvement in investment and productivity is gradual and incremental in its results, we need to start these improvementsnow. (35) 40 B.Administration Projections and Deficit Reduction Proposals The administration's current services budget (Table 2, Section a) is OMB'sprojection of what the deficit would be under current policy.If there were tobe no changes in current revenue and entitlement law, and appropriations wereincreased by the inflation rate as in the GRH bas\u00e7line specifications, 0MBpredicts the 1991 deficit would be $101 billion.The difference between the current services deficits and thePresident'sproposed deficits (Table 2, Section b) represents policy changesthat willreduce the deficit.This difference for 1991 is $3 billion represents savings fromthe defensebaseline; thedefense savings grow and amount to $34 billion in 1995.In 1991, $14 billionis saved in entitlement and other mandatory spending and another $14 billionnet is raised through revenue changes, including a cut inthe capital gains taxrate which gives a temporarysignificant boost to revenues. The entitlementsavings grow to $33 billion in 1995; the net revenue gains, however, fade toonly $6 billion by 1995.Including smaller net changes in nondefensediscretionary spending and minor gains from user fees, other offsetting receiptsand asset sales, the projected deficit reduction grows to nearly $100 billionby 1995.The projected deficit, as currently measured, comes to $61.4 billion in 1991(Table 2, Section c).Adjusted for asset sales and tax speedups that will notcount for Gramm-Rudman-HOllings (GRH),it is exactly equal to theGRH target of$64 billion (Table 2, Section d). The 1992 and 1993 GRH targets are also met.Since the baseline is so close to balance in 1994-1995, the effect of thedeficit reduction policies is to produce a projection of substantial budgetsurpluses in those years if measured using current budget accounting concepts(Section c).Such surpluses, if achieved, would automatically be used toretire Federal debt held by the public.However, the administration proposes a new policy beginning in fiscal year1993 that departs from current deficit measurement concepts (Table 2, Sectione).The administration would extend the Gramm-Rudman. law, making permanent itsbalanced budget requirement and sequestration.The administration would,alsorequire that the traditional measure of outlays be increased by15 percent ofthe previously projected Social Security surplus in fiscal' year 1993, 50 percentin 1994, 85 percent in 1995, and in 1996 and thereafter 100percent.The fundsare mandatorilytransferred from the general fund to a new \"Social SecurityIntegrity and Debt Reduction Fund.' This fund would,in turn, repurchaseTreasury debt from the public, carrying out the debt retirement which theTreasury would carry out in any case if the projected surpluses were to beachieved.The procedure would expire upon retirement of the entire debt heldby the public.Establishing the fund is not byitself sufficient to insure that the SocialSecurity surpluses actuallycontribute to reduction of public debt.In theabsence of balance in the newly defined budget, the retirementof debt by this 1 The administration also calculated a baseline following strictly the GRHdefinition which is lower than the figures quoted above and shown in thetable, mainly because it does nt. assume that the FoodStamp program,which expires at the end offiscal year 1990, will bereauthorized.Theanalysis here will use the\"adjusted' baseline which does assumereauthori zati on. r41 fund would be offset by increased general fund borrowing from the public.It is thebalancing of the \"consolidated\" budget as newly defined that produces the rig, retirement of public debt (i.e., the surplus under traditional measurements).Whatever the accounting concept, retirement of the public debt would rel.ease funds to flow into private capital formation, preparing the nation for the future burden of supporting the retired baby-boom generations.It would mean that the Social Security surplus was in fact being saved to increase future income rather than spent on current public consumption.The chronic failure to save this surplus has been a major factor in recent proposals to return Social Security to pay-as-you-go financing.It is important to realize that the President's budget and the current services baseline are based on the same optimistic assumptions. If GNP growth is lower and/or interest rates are higher than 0MB predicts, actual deficits will be higher than estimated by the administration, even if all of its policies are adopted, and the projected budget surplus and net retirement of debt held by the public will not materialize. In the sections that follow, a less optimistic projection will be described and compared with the President's. 42 Table 2Administration Budget Aggregates(Fiscal Years, $ billions, total budget)Actual Pro.iected19J receipts (net of lostreceipts) -1.6-1.4-1.5-1.4-1.4Total Policy Changes (net) -0.6-37.8-44.3-52.3-66.5-82.4 Debt Service Savings 0-1.3-4.1-7.0-10.6-14.9Total Deficit Reduction -0.6-39.1-48.5-59.177.397.4 c.

IV.GOVERNMENTAL RECEIPTS (REVENUES)*A. SummaryAs part of its Fiscal Year 1991 budget, the administration proposes $13.9billion in additional governmental receipts. This increase accounts for about one-third of all the proposed deficit reduction amounts from policy actions.Table Isummarizes the major categories of change.Table I1991 Major Changes in Governmental Receipts(administration estimates)(Billions of dollars)Capital gains tax cut \u00f74.9 Internal Revenue Service (IRS) changes +3.0 Acceleration of tax collections +1.0 Other +5.0 Extension of Social Security andMedicare coverage and payroll taxesto state/local government employees +3.8 Extension of expiring telephone excisetax Increase in aviation-use taxes +0.5 Other increases +1.1 Revenue-losing initiatives -0.7 Extension of expiring tax benefits -1.2 TOTAL CHANGE +13.9 The administration estimates that its proposed 30 percent exclusion forcapital gains will raise the $4.9 billion in revenue.$2.5 billion of the $3.0 billion increase for IRS changes comes from \"management reforms' that do not require law changes or increased funding forthe IRS; the remaining $0.5 billion comes from adding resources to the IRS.$0.9 billion of the +$1.0 billion in accelerated tax collections comesfrom changes in payroll tax collections and the rest from the telephone excisetax.The revenue-losing initiatives responsible for the $0.7 billion lossinclude tax benefits for 'family savings accounts,\" tax benefits for oil andgas, tax benefits for enterprise zones and a childrens' tax credit.The expiring tax benefits responsible for the $1.2 billion loss fromextensions are the research and experimentation credit, the health insurancededuction for the self-employed, and the low-income housing credit.Part B of this section explains each proposal separately. *Note:Governmental Receiptss the traditional administration term fr taxes and mandatory fees.

Description of Malor ProDosalsCaDital gains: President Bush proposes a 30 percent exclusion for capital gainson all assets sold by individuals, except collectibles, if held for at leastthree years.There is a 20 percent'exclusion for those assets held between twoand three years, and a 10 percent exclusion for those assets held between oneand two years.Corporate capital gains do not qualify. For 1990,a transitionyear, the 30 percent exclusion is available for any asset that has been heldmore one year.For 1991, also a transition year, assets held for more than twoyears qualify for the 30 percent exclusion, and assets held for more than 1year qualify for the 20 percent exclusion. Excluded amounts become a preferenceitem under the alternative minimum tax, and there is depreciation recapture atordinary tax rates.Although the administration budget assumes that this taxreduction will increase revenues over five years 1991-1995, earlierCongressional estimates of similar proposals suggest that Congressionalestimates for this proposal will not show persistent revenue increases.Internal Revenue Service: The administration budget shows substantial increasesin tax collections to come primarily from 'Internal Revenue Service managementreforms\" and secondarily, from an increase in the IRS budget. The managementreforms are said to produce added tax collections by means of reallocating theIRS budget rather than increasing it; they do not require new legislation orrew rculations.These management reforms increase revenues initially, butr1crae it omcwhat after 1993, since they speed up collections that would berri1'1t-r.J.I.J!iLre excise tax sDeed-ups: The major item isa change in the .(i1JI(: fr pynirit of payroll taxes.

The 53 administration considers the two tax speed-up proposals \"timing\" changes withinthe meaning of the Gramm-Rudman law but the administration does not wish toinvoke an allowable Gramm-Rudman waiver, and their budget does not count the1991 effects of these changes in meeting the 1991 Gramm-Rudman maximum deficittarget.Medicare and its payroll tax: Under current law, state/local employees hiredafter March 31, 1986 must be covered by Medicare and are subject to the hospitalinsurance payroll tax.Although many state/local governments have also chosento participate, roughly one-quarter of state/local employees do not pay thistax.This proposal would make coverage and taxation mandatory for allstate/local employees effective October 1, 1990.Social Security and its \u00f8ayroll tax: Under current law, coverage of state/localemployees is not mandatory, although most states and localities have chosen toparticipate.This proposal would make coverage and taxation mandatory for allstate/local employees who are not otherwise covered by a pension plan.Effective October 1,1990.Telephone excise tax: The new budget permanently extends the current 3 percenttelephone service tax beyond its December 31, 1990 expiration date, and speedsup its collection.The revenue from the acceleration of collections is listedseparately in the above table.Increase in aviation-use taxes: In 1989 legislation, the \"triggered\" reduction in aviation-use taxes was postponed and did not become effective for 1990.Under prior law,if the sum of 1988-1989 funding for certain aviation programsfunded by aviation-use taxes was less than 85 percent of authorizations, mostaviation-use tax rates would have been cut in half in calendar year 1990. The taxes expire at the end of 1990. The administration proposes to eliminate the \"triggered reduction\" provisions and to replace it with a tax increase relativeto the 1990 rates.The proposal would raise the passenger ticket tax from 8 to10 percent with commensurate increases in other use-taxes. The air freight tax would go to 6.25 percent, the noncommercial aviation gasoline tax to 15 centsper gallon, and the noncommercial jet fuel tax to 17.5 cents per gallon. The proposal does not affect the international air departure tax. The purpose of the increases is to move toward user coverage of all aviation-related expenses,not just those financed currently out of the trust fund.Harbor maintenance/ad valorem cargo tax: The tax rate on cargo would beincreased from 0.04 percent to 0.125 percent. The increase is intended to produce revenues to fully offset the cost of Corps of Engineers harbormaintenance dredging, and selected National Oceanic and AtmosphericAdministration marine programs.Insurance company taxation: Property and casualty insurance companies coulddeduct losses only to the extent they exceeded estimated recoveries of salvage.This proposalis intended to clarify current law.Use of excess Dension funds for retiree health benefits: A limited transferfrom excess pension assets would be allowed without termination ordisqualification of the plan. The amount of the transfer could not exceed theamount of assets in excess of 140 percent of the plan's current liability, or,if less, the plan's current retiree health liabilities for the current year.Transferred amounts would not be subject to the excise tax on reversions.Transfers would be permitted only in a \"plan year' beginning after December31,1990 and before January 1, 1993.The proposal raises revenues by substituting for expenditures that would otherwise be tax deductible. 54 Securities and Exchanqe Commission fees: The fee on securities transactionswould be increased from 1/300 to 1/220 of one percent of dollar volume tradedand extended to apply to most over the counter transactions. There would also be increased fees for merger or proxy filing and for registration of securitiesofferings.Internal Revenue Service user fees: The proposal would permanently extendcurrent fees forletter ruling, determination letters, opinions or other similarservices.Abandoned mine reclamation fee: The proposal would permanently extend currentfees: 35 cents per ton for surface-mined coal and 15 cents per ton forunderground-mined coalOther increases: Proposals include a new Commodity Futures Trading Commissionfee (11 cents per transaction), new Corps of Engineer fees for waterway andwetlands development permit requests, new fees on the nuclear power industry tocover related Federal Emergency Management Agency costs, increased District ofColumbia contributions to employee retirement and extension of Social Security.and Medicare coverage to all newly hired D.C. employees, and a change in thecollection point for Bureau of Alcohol and Tobacco occupational taxes fromretailers to wholesalers.Family Savings Accounts and penalty-free IRA withdrawals: Annual contributionsof up to $5,000 per couple, $2,500 per individual, would not be tax deductible;however, after seven years or more, the contributions j4 accumulated investmentearnings could be withdrawn tax-free. There would be a penalty for withdrawalsmade sooner than three years, but not thereafter. Families with incomes of$120,000 and over or individuals with incomes of $60,000 or more would not,however, be eligible.Penalty-free withdrawals from Individual RetirementAccounts would also be allowed for first-time home purchases, provided that thehomecosts no more than 110 percent of the regional median price of homes andthat the withdrawalis $10,000 or less.The revenue losses from the familysavings accounts grow within the budget horizon from $0.2 billion in 1991 to$1.6 billion in 1995.Childrens' credit: Once again President Bush proposes a new refundable creditof up to $1,000 per child for each child under age 4. The credit is equal to14 percent of parents' wages. In 1991, the credit is phased-out beginning at a$8,000 income and is not available to families' with incomes of more than$13,000.In 1995, the phase-out begins at a $15,000 income and is not availableto families with incomes over $20,000. Since the credit is conditioned onwages, at least one parent must be employed.. This credit is flQ tied tofamily spending on formal day care services. The current dependent care creditwould also be made refundable. A family could use whichever credits were larger for each child.The revenue effects are small compared to the effectson spending, which arise because the credits are refundable. The estimated spending increases are $0.2 billion in 1991, $1.8 billion in 1992, $2.0 billionin 1993, $2.1 billion in 1994, and $2.2 billion in 1995.New incentives for oil and gas exploration and recovery: These include a10percent credit on the first $10 million of exploratory intangible drillingcosts (IDCs) and a 5 percent credit on the balance of costs. Revisions wouldbe made in the alternative minimum tax to eliminate 80 percent of currentpreference items generated by IDCs of independent producers; other tax rulesaffecting depletion availability to independents would be liberalized. A 10percent credit is proposed for capital spending on tertiary enhanced recovery.The credits would be phased out if the average daily U.S. wellhead price of oilis at or above $21 per barrel for a calendar year. 55Enterprise zones: Up to fifty zones offering tax incentives would be designatedover four years.Tax incentives include elimination of the capital gains taxon tangible property used within a zone for at least two years, an immediatededuction for individuals for contributions used by a zone business to acquiretangible assets with an annual limitation of $50,000 per investor, and for zone employees, a refundable tax credit of 5 percent on wages up to $10,500 with a phase-out between wage incomelevels of $20,000 and $25,000.Extension of research and exnerimentation credit: The administration proposes to permanently extend the 20 percent incremental R&E tax credit that expiresafter December 31, 1990.(Although 1989 legislation extended the credit through December 31,it also required that eligible expenses be reduced 25 percent for1990 in order to provide only nine months' worth of benefit from the credit.) The administration also proposes to extend the R&E expense allocation rules that also expired after August 1, 1990 under current law.Extension of health insurance deduction for self-employed: The 25 percent deduction, which would expire after September 30, 1989, would be permanently extended.Extension of low-income housinq credit: The low-income housing credit was extended last year for 1990 only at 75 percent levels for state allocationceilings.The administration would extend it at 100 percent with other changesfor one year only, 1991.Other reductions:The major reductions result from the administration practiceof lowering estimated revenues when proposing savings in Federal employee pay. (They propose a three-month pay raise delay from October 31, 1990 until January 1,1991.)The administration also proposes to double and restore the taxdeduction for \"special-needs\" adoption expenses. Up to $3,000 per child could be deducted.That deduction was repealed by the Tax Reform Act of 1986. 56 C. Analysis of Tax PolicyReason for TaxesThe primary purpose of the tax system is to raise revenue to pay forgovernment programs.Borrowing, the alternative source of government finance,crowds out investment for the future and, to the extent that investment isfinanced by borrowing from abroad, puts this country in debt to the rest of theworld.Borrowing also harms interest rate and exchange rate sensitive sectorsof the economy:exports, durable goods, housing, and production that competeswith imports.As foreign lenders and investors cut back on their willingnessto hold dollar-denominated assets, the pressure from deficits is transferred tointerest rates, and if higher interest rates are resisted by monetary expansion,to inflation.Borrowing postpones the bills until larger actions must be takenlater to get control of budget deficits. Revenue increases, in comparison todeficits, increase national saving, reduce interest rates, and thereby increaseeconomic growth and future living standards.Tax Legislation Enacted Since 1981The Federal budget deficit peaked at 6.3 percent of Gross National Product(GNP) in 1983 and fell to 2.9 percent last year, 1989, lower than in 1983 butstill higher than the 2.6 percent for 1981. Changes in taxes played animportant role.First, a large multiyear tax cut was enacted in 1981, followedby increases in deficits.Subsequently a series of tax increases were enactedthat helped to bring deficits under control. The post-1981 period, when actionwas taken to control deficits, was not a period of no new taxes.Table 5, which summarizes estimates from past administration budgets,shows the effect of legislation passed between January 1, 1981 and the end of1988 on revenues.The table shows changes in revenue from what would haveprevailed under tax law in place at the end of 1980. The table shows themassive amount of revenue lost because. of the 1981 tax bill and the successionof legislation that followed the 1981 act.President Reagan signed eleven tax-increasing measures between 1982 and1988, aside from multi-year revenue-neutral legislation and continuingresolutions that provided higher IRS budgets in order to improve taxenforcement.These eleven increases are detailed in Table 5, which also showsthat President Reagan's succession of revenue increases was expected to providefor additional revenues of $142 billion in 1990. Over the nine years 1982-1990the tax increases signed by President Reagan were expected to raise $726billion.Although this revenue-raising legislation has been enacted since 1981, theBush administration forecasts that revenues will be a lower proportion of GrossNational Product in 1990s than in 1981. The administration estimates thatunder current law, baseline revenues would average 19.4 percent of GNP over thenext five years compared with 20.1 percent in 1981. At 1991's forecast GNP,this is equivalent to a revenue loss of about $35 billion. 57 Table 5Effect of 1981-1988 Legislation on Revenues(Fiscal Years, billions of dollars, administration estimates) Total1982 198219831984198519861987198819891990-1990 Economic RecoveryTax Act of 1986 ----+3+2+2+1+8Superfund Amendmentsand ReauthorizationAct of 1986 ----++1+1+1+3Tax Reform Act of 1986 - -- -+22-9-24-20-31Continuing Resolutionfor 1987 ----+2+3+3+3+11Omnibus Budget Recon-ciliation Act of 1987 ----+9+14+16+39Continuing 1988 - -+2+3+3+8Medicare CatastrophicCoverage Act of 1988 --- -+1+7+8Family Support Act of 1988 ----+*+**Technical and MiscellaneousRevenue Act of 1988 ---*-**OtherSubtotal--+18+45+59+78+124+121+120+128+693TOTAL, ALLLEGISLATION-36-73-92-111-132-118-143-171-195 -1,071*Less than $500 million.Source:Budgets of the U.S. Government, Fiscal Years 1982-1990. 58 General revenuesCurrently, Social Security surpluses offset a deficit in the rest of thebudget and mask the size of the non-Social Security deficit. This topic isdiscussed in more detailin Section I.D. ,\"National Saving, the Social Security surplus, and the Social Security Integrity and Debt Reduction Fund,\" of thisreport.Preparing the nation for the cost of future retirement benefits can beaccomplished by making sure that the Social Security surpluses are continuedand the non-Social Security budget is balanced. Setting aside Social Security exposes the large non-Social Security deficit and raises the question of howthese deficits arose.The size of the non-Social Security deficits are shownin Table 6 below.Table 6CBO Budget Baseline Projections(Fiscal years, billions of dollars) receipts, an intra-budgetary transaction.The dollar size of the non-Social Security deficit is rising, not falling,and it is stuck at about 3.5 percent of GNP.Non-Social Security budget deficits reflect recent tax-cut policy. Non-Social Security taxes had been falling relative to Gross National Product forat least a decade prior to 1981, and were then cut more drastically. The 1981multiyear income tax cut had a dramatic effect. Although some of the revenueswere recouped in subsequent legislation, CBO projects levels that will continueto be substantially below those prior to the late 1970s and early 1980s. 59 Table 7Non-Social Security RevenuesHistory and CBO Budget Baseline Projections (Fiscal years, revenues asa percent of Gross National Product)YearsNon-Social-Security Revenues1961-1965 average 17.9 14.51980 15.1 1981 15.7 1982 15.1 1983 13.6 1984 13.6 1985 13.9 1986 13.6 1987 14.5 1988 13.9 1989 14.1 Projections:1990 14.3 1991 14.3 1992 14.1 1993 14.0 1994 14.0 1995 13.9One interpretation of this trend could be that non-Social Security taxes were cut to make room for Social Security taxes,in order to keep the overall tax level from rising.However, non-Social Security public commitments did a fall as Social Securitycommitments rose.For example, 1989 non-Social Security spending exceeded non-Social Security revenues by 28 percent. The legacy of this revenue-spending mismatch continues.1990 baseline CBO non-Social Security spending exceeds non-SocialSecurity revenues by 26 percent. 1995 baseline CBO non-Social Security spending exceeds non-Social Security revenues by 24 percent. If higher taxes are ruledout,it is difficult to \"save\" the Social Security surplus by balancing thenon-Social Security budget.Shiftin Revenue SourcesIncreased relianceon social insurance taxes isa byproduct of growth in Social Security and Medicare spending.Decreased reliance on thecorporate tax was partly the result of legislation, but also of a long-term decline in corporate profits as a percent of GNP.These shifts, it is generally agreed, reduced the progressivity of the Federal tax system, although the expansion of Social Security and Medicare benefits raised the income andwelfare of elderly persons, many of whom would otherwise be poor.Decreased relianceon the corporate income and estate taxes was accelerated by the tax cut enacted in 1981.However, the Tax Reform Act of 1986, which reduced individual incometaxes, increased corporate income taxes.The increase in corporate taxesover the period 1987-1994 will average over $20 billion per year and over 20 percent compared with pre-1987 law.Reliance on the corporate 60 tax will rise from 8.4 percent of the total taxes in 1985 to 10.5 percent in1990.Corporate taxes remain a lower share of total taxes than in the pre-1970period because of the increase in social insurance taxes and the decline incorporate profits as a percent of Gross National Product.Using CBO projections, Table 8 summarizes the changing composition ofFederal revenues.Table 8Percent Composition of Revenues under Current Law(Fiscal years, Percent of Total)Historical Pro.iected19501960197019801985199119931995Individual Income Tax 4044474746474747Corporate Income 2723171381099Social Insurance 1913855332Estate & Gift 22211111Customs & Duties 11112222Miscellaneous 11233222Totalir100100ir100100100100Source: Congressional Budget Office, Baseline Projections, January, 1990. Shift in taxes toward those less able to payFor a majority of American workers the combined employer-employee payrolltax amounts are larger than individual income taxes. Unlike the income tax,the payroll tax rates are not graduated and do not apply to all sources ofincome.Payroll taxes have no personal exemptions or deductions. Wages above$51,300 are not taxed and non-wage income is exempt. That is, the payroll tax fails to be progressive, while, on the'other hand, the income tax is stillprogressive.There has been about a 20 Dercent increase in payroll taxes as a percentof Gross National Product since 1980. Relative to GNP, the payroll taxes forSocial Security and Medicare have risen by 1.2 percentage points in nine years,from 5.1 percent in 1980 to 6.2 percent in 1989. In contrast, individual andcorporate income taxes have fallen by the nearly the same amount as a percentpoints of GNP, from 11.6 percent of GNP in 1980 to 10.5 percent in 1989. Thisshift in the tax mix has shifted the tax burden to those with less ability-to-pay.The combined payroll tax rate for Social Security and Medicare has gone upby 22 percent in nine years and, the maximum taxable wage has gone up about 80percent faster than inflation. Although the size of the cut in the top 61 individual income tax rate, from 70 to 28 percent, is misleading because ofother tax reforms, it has been highly visible in contrast to the rising payrolltax.A better measure of income tax cuts is the CBO estimate that over alltaxpayers, individual income taxes have fallen from an average of 12.3 percentof incomes in 1980 to 11.1 percent in 1990.The marginal tax rate shows how much taxes go up as a percent of any added-income.In 1990, for example, a married couple with two $50,000 salaries islikely to face a marginal income tax rate of 33 percent and a payroll tax rateof 7.56 percent, for the employee share alone. The combined rate on added income is therefore 40.56 percent. A couple with a $500,000 income would, however, face a marginal income tax rate of 28 percent and a zero marginalpayroll tax rate.The substitution of payroll taxes for income taxes has been primarilyresponsible for a decline over this period in the progressivity of the Federaltax system.Furthermore, while the tax burden for the best-off Americans hasfallen, the tax burdens for the middle- and lower-income classes have gone up.CBO estimates that from 1980 to 1990, the effective Federal tax burden(e.g. all taxes divided by income) has shifted toward those with less ability-to - pay.Table 9Effective Overall Federal Tax 28.426.4-7.0Top 20 percent 27.325.8-5.5 Fourth 20 percent 23.022.5-2.2 Middle 20 percent 20.020.3+1.5 Second 20 percent 15.716.7+6.4 Bottom 20 percent 8.49.7+15.5 At the same time, Qr.-tax income has become more concentrated in the handsof better-off Americans.Thus, the tax changes have served to magnify theincreasing disparities in the distribution of income (See Section I. E. of this report). 25-698 0 - 90 - 3 V. BUDGET POLICIES FOR SELECTED GROUPS AND SECTORS (71 96 E. Older AmericansThe almost 30 million Americans who are 65 years of age or oldercompose 12 percent of the population. The Federal budget includes a numberof programs which provide income assistance, health care, social services,nutrition, and housing assistance for this population. The most visible ofthese programs are Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, Food Stamps,housing, and activities under the Older. Americans' Act.While there is considerable economic diversity among the elderly,Federal assistance is essential for many lower income aged persons. The1988 median income for an elderly person was $9,347 (compared to $13,782for the general population). However, 12 percent of the elderly are at, orbelow, the poverty level (compared to 13.1 percent for the totalpopulation) of $5,674 for a single person 65 years of age or older. Whilethe proportion of the elderly who are below the poverty level has declinedin recent years relative to the general population, many more of them remainnear poverty, and therefore, could quickly fall below poverty with slightchanges in income or government assistance. In 1988, for example, 20percent of the elderly (almost 6 million elderly persons) were within 125percent of the poverty level compared to 10 percent of the non-elderlypopulation.Health care cost is an important issue for all Americans, butespecially for the elderly because their costs are four times those of thenon-aged.Even with such high spending, long-term health care costs remainuncovered for most of the elderly. Because of their substantial health carerequirements, the 12 percent of the population who are. elderly account for36 percent of all health spending.The President's budget requests for programs which are of specialinterest to the elderly are described below:Medicare - The President's budget proposes $98.60 billion in outlays forMedicare.This assumes legislative proposals which would save $5.5 billion.New revenues totalling $1.85 billion in fiscal year 1991 would be raised byrequiring all State and local workers to pay the Medicare HospitalInsurance tax.Hospital and other spending under Part A would be reduced by$3.35 billion while Part B spending for physician and other outpatientservices would be reduced by $2.15 billion. Legislation also is proposedto extend the requirement that Part B premiums cover 25 percent of theprogram's cost.For hospitals, annual inflationary updates would not befully funded, capital payments would be held to 15 percent below costs forrural facilities and 25 percent below costs for urban ones, direct andindirect medical education payments for teaching hospitals would be reduced,and payments for hospital outpatient care would be reduced by 10 percent.Physician payments for non-primary care services would not be fullyinflated, and overpriced services as well as services provided in overpricedlocalities would be reduced. In addition, payments for new physicians initially establishing practices would also be reduced, as would paymentsfor anesthesiologists, radiologists, and surgeons. Durable medicalequipment and clinical laboratory payments also would be reduced. 97 The President's budget also proposes an initiative to increase Medicareand Medicaid beneficiary participation in managed care programs such as health maintenance and preferred provider organizations. Savings realized from this effort will be shared with providers and Medicare beneficiaries.Medicaid -- The President's budget proposes $44.9 billion in budgetauthority and outlays for Medicaid in 1991. The budget proposes to save $113 million by imposing fees on health care facilities for the cost ofsurvey and certification activities. In addition the budget proposes a $25 million initiative to encourage States to adopt more managed care Medicaid programs.Of the 2 million Medicaid recipients, approximately 14 percentare elderly, yet they account for nearly 40 percent of Medicaid spending.Because of age and disability, this group requires more acute and long-termcare, which accounts for the disproportionate share of Medicaid payments.Social Security --The President's budget requests $264.8 billion inoutlays.A cost-of-living allowance of 3.9 percent would be provided inJanuary 1991, and 649,000 net additional beneficiaries would be covered.Participation in Social Security would become mandatory for District ofColumbia employees hired after January 1, 1991 and for other State and local government workers not already covered by a retirement and disabilityinsurance plan.Benefits would be expanded to provide coverage for certainadopted children.In addition, the Internal Revenue Service would beauthorized to withhold tax refunds for former Social Security beneficiarieswho have consistently refused to repay Social Security overpayments..The budget also proposes to discontinue the practice required under the 1983 Social Security Amendments wherein trust fund receipt estimates are advanced on a monthly basis from the general funds of the Treasury to the SocialSecurity trust funds.In the future, deposits would be made to the trustfunds as they are received from contributors.The President's budget also proposes to establish a Social Security Integrity and Debt RedUction Fund. Beginning in 1993,a portion of the previously projected annual Social Security surplus will be deposited in the special fund and used for retirement of the national debt. These deposits will be counted as outlays in the budget. In 1993 the deposit will equal 15 percent of the projected surplus. For 1996 and thereafter, it will equal the full amount of the projected surplus. The amounts proposed to be transferred to the new fund are based on estimates of the Social Security surplus as projected in the 1989 Trustees' Report. Itis proposed that the 1989 estimates would continue to be use,d until the year 2000, and after that time would be updated only every five years.FoodStamDs -- The budget proposes $15.4 billion in funding for the Food Stamp program and assumes a multi-year reauthorization of the program in fiscal year 1991.The Food Stamp proposal assumes no benefit reductions.There are legislative savings of $50 million resulting from lower payments due to increased child care collections which raise family income and correspondingly reduce the level of benefit eligibility. An additional $18 million is saved as a result of reduced administrative reimbursement to States.The budget also proposes to replace the Nutrition Assistance to Puerto Rico program with a new block grant operated under the Health and Human Services Department. The new Puerto Rico block grant would be fundedat $825 million in fiscal year 1991, which compares with $937 million in fiscal year 1990. 98 Section 202 Housing for Elderly or HandicapDed -- This program providesloans to nonprofit organizations to finance the construction of housing forlower-income elderly and handicapped tenants who are participating in theHUD Section 8 housing program. The budget proposes to reduce Section 202 loans by approximately 40 percent from $473 million of new loans in 1990,which supported an estimated 7,700 new housing units, to $283 million of newloans in 1991, which would finance an estimated 4,000 new units. As an offset to this reduction, the administration proposes to earmark funds fromits proposed Home Ownership and Opportunity for People Everywhere (HOPE)initiative sufficient to allow nonprofit sponsors to rent 3,000 existinghousing units for the low-income elderly and the mentally ill homeless.Older Americans -- The budget proposes $1,242 million in budget authorityfor programs under the Older Americans Act, $6 million less than provided in1990.The budget request includes $343 million for community serviceemployment, $749 million for the Administration on Aging, and $150 millionfor elderly nutrition programs. 99 F. The Homeless In the past several years the problem of homelessness has captured the Nation's consciousness and become an important part of the Congressional agenda.The McKinney Act was enacted in FY 1987 authorizing $442.7 million for homeless programs and was reauthorized for FY 1989-90 at a level of $388.5 for FY 1990.President's ProgramsThe President's FY 1991 budget proposes $819 million for McKinney Act homeless assistance programs including emergency shelter grants and transitional housing demonstration grants, mental health services block grants and demonstration projects, targeted veterans' assistance, job training, homeless children and adult education and emergency social services.In addition, the Presidentproposes $166 million in non- McKinney Act programs, which is an increase of $32 million over the President's current services for FY 1991. In this category areprograms for runaway and homeless youth, food assistance to soup kitchens and other small programs.As part of the request for McKinney Act programs, the President proposes $247 million for a new \"Shelter Plus Care\" program to help the homeless mentally illor recovering substance abuser. This is part of a new housing initiative, HOPE, which encourages homeownership and requires targeting of funding for the homeless mentally ill and substance abusing popul \u00e0tion.Nature of the ProblemHomelessness raisesmany complex questions including the causes of homelessness and its relationship to poverty, the interrelationship between homelessness and mental disorders, alcoholism and drug abuse, and the impact of homelessness across societyon the children, elderly and families of the Nation.The basic questionsare what can be done and what role can the Federal, State and localgovernments play in the solution?The number of homeless isnot a statistic upon which there is universal agreement.A recent Urban Institute and a National Academy of Medicine study both estimated approximately three quarters of a million homeless on any given night of measurement.In addition, many studies support estimates of total homeless which fall within the range of the one to three million estimated by the National Coalition on the Homeless.One major cause of homelessness is that people cannot afford the rent in many housing markets.The latest Census data (1985) indicates that about 45 percent of all renters in the U.S. with incomes below the poverty line (3.1 million households) paidat least 70 percent of their income for housing and nearly two-thirdsof this group paid at leasthalf of their income for housing.Under HUD program standards, the benchmark of affordable housing is 30percent or less of household income for housing. The data show that the problem has worsened since the 1970's; the number of 100 poor renters who pay at least half of their income for housing has increasedby nearly 50 percent to 4.3 million. In addition, in 1970 there were 2.4 million more affordable units than renters with incomes under $10,000 but by1985 there were 3.7 million fewer affordable units than renters in thissame categcry.Homelessness also seems to be increasing. The U.S. Conference ofMayors just released an annual survey on hunger and homelessness whichreported an increase in demand of 25 percent in emergency shelter requestsover last year. Due to insufficient facilities, cities also turned away 22percent of those seeking shelter. The report also indicated demand foremergency food assistance increased 19% in 1989 and three out Of fivepersons asking for food were children or parents.Health care is also a problem among the homeless, although the extentand magnitude of health care problems have not been fully documented.However, it is clear that children whose families have no health insurancehave less access to health care, especially preventive care. Alcohol abuseand alcoholism are the most frequently diagnosed medical problems amonghomeless men (sometimes estimated at more than 40 percent). Substance abuseother than alcoholis also more prevalent among the homeless and is oftencombined with multiple health problems. Serious mental disorders such asschizophrenia are overrepresented among homeless people and most studiesshow evidence of major mental illness in 30-40 percent of homeless adults.The McKinney Homeless Act provides for a range of general and mental healthservices and the President's budget proposes $95 million for these programsin 1991, an increase of$13 millio'n above the 1990 level of funding. In addition, the President's budget targets $30 million for care ofchronically mentally ill homeless veterans.Action on Homeless ProgramsBoth the Congress and the President have increased the resources forhelping the homeless.While there is much to commend in the additionalcommitment to this problem, the question still remains about the limitedsize of requested resources relative to the overall homelessproblem. For instance, even with the HOPE initiative, the President's budget does notprovide any significant increase in either funding levels or numbers ofunits assisted over the current funding level. The proposed82,049 incremental units fall far short of the CBO estimate that there are as manyas 10 million households who are eligible for Federal housing assistanceprograms but who are not receiving it. Further, the 8,900 units proposed for the Shelter Plus Care program is certainly not sufficient to meet theneeds of the homeless with mental and substance abuse problems.While homelessness continues to grow, there is little agreement aboutspecific needs or the complex relationship between the many factors whichcontribute to the problem. 103 G.Children and YouthThe budget proposes funding of $65.8 billion in budget authority infiscal year 1991 for major programs which assist children and youthdirectly or indirectly. This proposal is $0.45 billion below the CBObaseline for budget authority and is $0.3 billion below for outlays. Themajor increases compared to the baseline are increases for Head Start,summer youth employment, elementary and secondary education and child caretax credits.The major decreases compared to the baseline are in the LowIncome Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), child nutrition, NutritionAssistance to Puerto Rico programs and the proposed termination of theCommunity Service Block Grant program.General Background on Children and Youth related Issues:The latest Census poverty report for 1988 showed very littleimprovement in the child poverty rate. The 1988 rate for children under 18in families and unrelated subfamilies was 19.6 percent, compared with 20.3percent in 1987, showing that about one out of five children lives inpoverty.In addition, the rate of poverty for black children was 44.1percent, and for Hispanic children 37.8 percent. These child poverty rates are far above the national rate o.f 13.1 percent and an elderly rate of 12.0percent.A national bipartisan consensus has developed regarding the need toreverse these poverty trends for our children. It recognizes our Nation's sucess in reducing the elderly poverty rate and focuses on developing.comprehensive policies for investment in children to achieve the sameresults.At the heart of this consensus is the emphasis on preserving andstrengthening families.Other statistics which characterize the present situation of childreninclude:The U.S. Conference of Mayors survey of homeless and hunger needs foundthat famil,ies are the fastest growing segment of the homeless. TheNational Academy of Sciences estimated that 100,000 children arehomeless each night.Reports estimate about 1.5 million childreh and adolescents run awayfrom home each year or are thrown out.The Children's Defense Fund reports that between 7.5 million and 9.5million children and adolescents need help from mental healthprofessionals, but no more than 30 percent are getting the attentionthey need.The House Select Committee on Children, Youth and Families recentlyreported that nearly 500,000 American children live in detentioncenters, hospitals, foster homes and mental health facilities and thatthe number could surge to 840,000 by 1995. Already, the number of children in foster homes has risen by 24 percent between 1985 and 1988to 340,300. 104 The U.S. ranks nineteenth in the industralized world in infantmortality, according to the National Commission to Prevent InfantMortality.Barely haj.f of America's poor children are covered by Medicaid.The Children's Defense Fund estimates that if recent trends continue,the Surgeon General's 1990 goal for reducing the percentage of low-birthweight births for all children will not be met until 2031.Major Program Changes in Programs and Issues Im\u00f8acting Childrenand YouthHead Start - The Presifent's budget proposes $1,886 million for HeadStart which compares with the CBO baseline of $1,442, a $446 millioninitiative.This initiatiie would enable Head Start to enroll up to180,000 more four-year-olds and the total percentage of eligible four-year-old children served could be as high as 70 percent. The requested level would allow the Head Start prOgram to serveapproximately 27 percent of the overall eligible population of three-four-and-five year olds, compared with 19 percent in fiscal year 1990.Elementary and Secondary Education - The President's budget proposes$11.9 billion in budget authority compared with $11.5 billion in thebaseline.This is an increase of nearly four percent inflation.Within the totals, the budget assumes an increase for Chapter 1 and 2programs, handicapped education and a new Presidential Merit Schoolsinitiative.The President's budget also proposes to eliminate fourelementary and secondary school programs currently funded at $33million and significantly reduce Impact Aid Part B.Summer Youth EmDloyment - The President's budget proposes thereplacement of the current block grant and summer youth programs withtwo new programs--Adult Job Training grants and year-round Youth JobTraining Grants. A significant retargeting of funds is proposedfromadult grant funding to year-round youth programs. The overall funding proposed for youth oriented programs is $1.75 billion \u00e8ompared with the 1990 baseline of $0.7 billion. However, the adult training programwould receive $0.95 billion in 1991 compared to a 1991 baseline amountfor the block grant of $1.75. The President also proposes a newprogram called Youth Opportunities Unlimited (YOU) which would providejob training demonstration targeted at youth in high poverty areas.Child Care Tax Credits - The President's budget proposes a new taxcredit of up to $1,000 for each child under age 4 and refundability ofthe existing Dependent Care Tax Credit. This proposal would result inbudget authority of $157 million in 1991 but would grow significantlyto $1.85 billion in 1992 and more thereafter.Foster Care and AdoDtion Services - The President's budget proposes funding in 1991 of $2.45 billion with legislative savings of $121million through a limitation in the growth of administrative costs tono more than 10 percent per State each year. 105 Youth Related Block Grants - The President's budget proposes $2.8billion in budget authority for the Title XX Social Services BlockGrant program, the same amount as authorized under current law. ThePresident's budget also proposes the termination of the CommunityServicesBlock Grant, funded at $389 million in 1990.Food Stamps and Nutrition Assistance to Puerto Rico - The President'sbudget proposes reauthorization of the food stamp program at $15.4billion with no changes in basic benefit structure. The President proposes the elimination of the Nutrition Assistance program for PuertoRico and replaces it with a new block grant funded at $825 million, areduction of about $150 million from current services.Child Nutrition ProgramsThe President proposes $4.6 billion forchild nutrition programs.This includes $0.4 billion in legislativesavings from increasing school lunch subsidies for children in lowerincome categories and decreasing, subsidies for those in higher incomecategories and means-testing the child care food program. The President also proposes $2.2 billion for the Women, Infant, Childrenfood program (WIC), essentially current services.Low Income Home Energy Assistance (LIHEAP) Program - The President'sbudget proposes $1.1 billion, a reducti.on of $0.35 billion from currentservices.Current Child and Youth Program NeedsThe key concern regarding children's programs is the sufficiency offunding relative to known needs. Only about 27 percent of. eligible children from all age categories would participate in the Head Start programeven under the President's proposal. The same question arises in otherchildren's programs; for example, compensatory education enrolls only abouthalf of the eligible children and the Women, Infants and Children nutritionprogram enrolls only approximately half of the eligible mothers andchildren.Many of these major children's programs return many dollars inreduced costs to society for each dollar invested.Last session the Congress enacted an increase in the minimum wage andboth the House and Senate passed child care bills. Child care and other related children's programs such as education reform, food stampreauthorization, implementing welfare reform, expanding children's healthcare will retain high positions on the Congressional agenda. The reduction of poverty is a National goal which will require significant investment.

These programs do not represent all programs whichcould fit into this category. The programs involved in the high prioritylow-income category are programs which are specifically designed andtargeted to aid the poor, homeless and other disadvantaged groups.The President's fiscal year 1991 budget proposal includes severalprogram reductions and program terminations, as has been the case in thepast several years.Three programs are proposed for termination: the low-income weatherization program, the juvenile justice program and thecommunity services block grant program. In addition, significant reductions are proposed in the child nutrition, Nutrition Assistance toPuerto Rico, and Low Income Home Energy Assistance (LIHEAP) programs. Thesereductions are proposed even though there continue to be high levels ofpoverty, homelessness and working poor in an economy operating at highlevels of output and employment. The President's budget does propose a significant increase above baseline funding for the Head Start program inFunction 500 and Homeless Assistance program in Function 450. Much moremodest increases are proposed for compensatory education and the jobtraining program.Entitlement ProgramsThe budget proposes $105.4 billion for the 10 entitlement programs,$0.85 billion above the CBO baseline. In general these entitlement differences are estimating differences; the major exceptions are the chfldnutrition and Nutrition Assistance to Puerto Rico reductions.The child nutrition reduction totals $462 million in budget authority.These savings result from reductions in school lunch subsidies to studentsfrom families with incomesover 350 percent of poverty, partially offset byincreases in subsidy to students from families with incomes between 130 and185 percent of poverty and the means testing of the child care feedingprogram.The Nutrition Assistance to Puerto Rico proposal would eliminatethe current nutrition assistance program operated by the Department ofAgriculture and replace it with a new block grant operated by the Departmentof Health and Human Services at a funding level of $825 million, a reductionof approximately $150 million from current services. The largest entitlement assistance program medicaid is funded at essentially currentservices. 109Discretionary ProgramsThe budget proposes a total of $47.4 billion for the low-income discretionary programs which is $2.4 billion below the CBO baselineamount. Almost three-quarters of the aggregate difference is explainable by CBO's higher estimate of expiring housing contracts.CBO estimates the cost of fully funding expiring housing contracts at $9.5 billion whereas 0MB estimates the cost to be $7.7 billion. The remaining $0.2 billionis a composite of many minuses and partially offsetting pluses.Included in the reductions are the proposals to terminate the low-income weatherization and community services block grant program and the traditional juvenile justice program.Besides the program terminations, the largest reduction is in the Low Income Home Energy Assistance program, a cut of $399 million or 27.5 percent. 110 FUNDING FOR HIGH PRIORITY LOW-INCOME PROGRAMS(Budget Authority in millions of dollars)FY Rehab Income Education 37238917Handicapped 355520Older 371343-28Vocational 26330037Head Start 1,4421,886444Community Services Block 0Grant 396-396 111 FUNDING FOR HIGH PRIORITY LOW-INCOME PROGRAMS(Budget Authority in millions of dollars) 1/ The differences nc1ude both policy and estimating differences.FY 1991C BOBasel I ne Community Health Centers 445 Migrant Health 49 Infant Mortality Initiative 33 Family Planning 145 Homeless 87 Indian Health 1,320 Immunization and Vaccines 163600Low-Income Energy Assistance1,449 Homeless 441 WIC and CSFP 2,279 Subsidized ne-33 3-68-28-10-399-51-2,179-2-12-68-2, 387-1,529SUBTOTAL (Discretionary) TOTAL49,76447,377154,316152,787 VI. SELECTED SPECIAL TOPICS A. Deficit Reduction and the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings ActThe Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act (as amended), better known as Gramm-Rudman-Hollings\" or GRH, places limits on Presidential and Congressional budgets and provides \"sequestration\" to enforce those limits. -Deficit limits: GRH sets deficit targets of $64 billion for F? 1991, $28 billion for FY 1992, and zero (a balanced budget) for FY 1993. Both the President's budget and, the Congressiona' budget resolution for FY 1991 must meet the FY 1991 target of $64 billion,1 but they are not required to meet the outyear targets; the President's budget meets the targets in all three years.GRH Baseline and ScorekeeDing: Based on current spending and tax law (as opposed to that proposed by President Bush), 0MB estimates the FY 1991 \"GRH baselinet deficit at $84.7 billion. As discussed below, most of OMB's analyses use an \"adjusted baseline\" deficit of $100.5 billion.GRH projection and scorekeeping rules differ in a few cases from other budget accounting rules.For example, GRH counts Social Security receiptsand outlays in the totals, although Social Security has been technically \"off-budget\" since FY 1986. GRH also does not count the proceeds of new asset sales and loan prepayments2, does not count new timing shifts unless a special exception is invoked by statute3, places constraints o the aggregate defense and non-defense discretionary spendout rates\", places limits on Medicare reestimates between January and August, and prescribes rules for projecting appropriations if a full-year appropriations bill has not been enacted.Overall, the rules provide direction for estimating the 1The requirement that the FY 1991 budget resolution meet the $64 billion deficit target is enforced by a point of order.In the Senate, a waiver requires 60 votes.In the House, a waiver requires a majority vote when the budget resolution is first considered and 3/5 of those present and voting when the conference agreement is considered. The point of order does not apply if Congress has declared war.2Except 'routine, ongoing asset sales and loan prepayments at levels consistent with agency operations in FY 1986. 0M8 expects $0.5 billion in proceeds from such sales in FY 1991 and builds them into the GRH baseline.3Section 202(a) of GRH II states that timing shifts shall not count; section 202(b) allows laws enacting timing shifts to include a waiver of the \"do-not-count\" rule.The average rate at which defense budget authority is assumed to be spent in the first year of its availability (the \"spendout rate\") must not differ by more than 1/2 percent from the average in the previous year's sequester report, adjusted for changes in program mix. The same constraint applies to non-defense discretionary spendout rates. 114 baseline deficit if Congress takes no action by August or October (thedates of the two sequestration reports), and for estimating the deficit fCongress enacts some or all of the President's proposals. Some of thescorekeeping rules apply only to 0MB' August and October GRH estimates;others apply under all circumstances.Adjusted Baseline: 0MB notes that, because of the mechanical nature ofthe projection, the baseline deficit of $84.7 billion includes some figuresthat are programmatically implausible. For example:1) The Food Stampprogram (including nutrition assistance to Puerto Rico) is scheduled toexpire at the end of FY 1990. As a result, the FY 1991 costs of thisprogram ($16.2 billion) are not included in the GRH baseline.2)Discretionary programs are assumed to be at FY 1990 levels plus inflation.In the case of the Census Bureau, the FY 1990 level reflected the costs ofrunning the 1990 census, which will not be repeated in FY 1991 (a reductionof $1 billion).3) Subsidized housing contracts expire from time to timeand need renewal.While 42,000 such renewals were needed in FY 1990, about295,000 renewals will be needed in FY 1991. 0MB estimates that an additional $6.6 billion in BA and $0.4 billion in outlays will be needed.4) One-time appropriations of $2.8 billion were made in FY 1990 as a resultof the California earthquake. It is assumed that these need not be repeatedin FY 1991, so that BA can be lower. In addition, other smaller adjustmentscould be justified.0MB has chosen to create an \"adjusted baseline\" for analyticalpurposes, in which the Food Stamp program is assumed to be re-enacted andCensus Bureau funding is assumed to be reduced to the FY 1991 levelrequested by the President. No adjustments are made for subsidized housingrenewals or disaster assistance. The adjusted baseline shows a deficit of$100.5 billion for FY 1991.Technically, that adjusted baseline would applyif, by August or October, Food Stamps were re-enacted, Census appropriationswere enacted at the level requested by the President, and all otherappropriations were at baseline levels (or had not yet been enacted). Certain types of transactions count. for GRH purposes as follows:Initial Budget0MB BaselineCBO Baseline0MBCongressJanAug/OctAug/OctSocial Security surplus (*)(*)(na)(*)(*)Spendout rate adjustment NoNo(**)YesNoMedicare reestimates (na)(na)(na)NoYes*New timing shifts count only if section 202(b) of GRH II is invoked bystatute.** 0MB is not required to reflect spendout rate adjustments until the Augustand October reports, but has chosen to do so in its January baselineestimate. 115 Deficit Reduction from the adiusted GRH baseline: Table 1shows the President's deficit reduction plan for FY 1991 as compared to the adjustedGRH baseline.The table uses GRH accounting, and also shows figures thattie to the administration's consolidated cash (all-inclusive) budget deficitof $63.1 billion.(A summary of the proposals by category is included insection I.B.) As noted, for purposes of GRH, asset sales and loan prepayments do not count as deficit reduction and timing shifts do not count unless thelegislation implementing them invokes section 202(b) of GRH II.The President's budget proposes $1.6 billion in new asset sales and loan prepayments.In addition it proposes a number of timing shifts: a one-time Medicare payment speed-up, which shifts FY 1991 outlays into FY 1990; a repeal of the Federal retiree \"lump sum\" option, which shifts FY 1991 costs into future years;a temporary two-day speed-up of employer withholdingtaxes, which increases FY 1991 and 1992 revenues at the expense of FY 1993 revenues; and a permanent 2-week speed-up of telephone excise taxes.In the case of the revehue timing shifts, the administration has statedthat it will not request a \"202(b) waiver', so those timing shifts will not count for GRH purposes.From its budget figures, however, 0MB makes itclear that the outlay timing shifts are intended to count. Both the asset sale and the timing shift provisions of GRH have been interpreted to applyTable 1:President's FY 1991 Deficit Reduction Plan:Comparison mandatoriesRevenuesUser sales and loan prepaymentsNet interest-3.2+1.1-13.9-12.9-5.6-0.6na-1.3TOTAL Deficit salesCount adjustment....Include Postal Service Fund61.4 Administration's consolidated deficit-1.6-1.0-0.1+1.7 Figures may not add due to rounding.nanana+1.763.163.1 116 to \"new\" actions: in the years after a sale, prepayment, or shift has takenplace, the effects of that action are generally scored and are built intothe baseline.The administration therefore includes the outyear effects ofits timing shifts in its outyear GRH accounting of the President's proposalsand likewise shows the income loss from asset sales and loan prepayments inthe outyear GRH figures.Additional adjustments are needed to bridge between theadministration's GRH deficit and its consolidated cash (all-inclusive)deficit.The 1989 reconciliationbill removed the Postal Service Fund fromthe budget for all purposes including GRH. Finally, a spendout rate adjustment of +$63 million in non-defense discretionary outlays is includedin the baseline and the GRH deficit, but removed when bridging to theconsolidated budget deficit.Table 2 compares the President's deficits using GRH scorekeeping for FY1991 through FY 1993, after which GRH expires. Table -64.0-26.0+18.3* The FY 1993 figures exclude the \"outlays\" of the proposed \"SocialSecurity Integrity and Debt Reduction Fund\". See Section I.D.** Excludes new asset sales, prepayments, and revenue timing shifts,and includes the spendout rate constraint. The amount of sequestration: GRH requires automatic spending cuts,called sequestration, if 0MB determines that the deficit (as mesured inAugust or October) is over the target by more than $10 billion.0 To avoidsequestration in FY 1991, the deficit must therefore be reduced below $74billion.If, on October 15th, the FY 1991 GRH deficit were measured at$100.5 (as in the adjusted GRH baseline above), then $36.5 billion inautomatic spending cuts would occur. The concept behind GRH is that the threat of sequestration provides an incentive for Congress and the Presidentto implement a better-targeted deficit reduction plan. In either case, thedeficit would be reduced.It should be noted that sequestration to reduce outlays by $36.5billion would be unprecedented. For FY 1986, the first year of GRH I, sequestration occurred but was capped by that law at $11.7 billion. For FY1987, after GRHIwas ruled unconstitutional, the August and October reportsshowed an excess deficit of $19.4 billion. Congress later enacted 6In FY 1993, no $10 billion cushion is provided; the budget must bebal anced. 117sufficient deficit reduction -- albeit mostly temporary -- to get within the$10 billion margin.For F? 1988, the first year of GRH II, the 0MB finalreport showed a required sequester of $23.0 billion7. However, as a result of the later summit agreement, Congress enacted laws achieving sufficientdeficit reduction and cancelling the sequester. For F? 1989, the 0MB final report showed that the excess deficit was slightly less than the $10 billionmargin, so no sequester was ordered. For F? 1990, the 0MB final report showed an excess deficit of $16.1 billion. However, later legislation reduced that deficit and instituted a partial sequester in lieu of the onethat had been ordered.The partial sequester called for savings of $5.7bilHon (but see The seauester crediting rule).Sequestration formula:Sequestration, if triggered, follows a formulaspelled out by law.Fifty percent of the outlay savings must come fromdefense (with Military Personnel excluded at the President's option). The remaining fifty percent of the outlay savings come from domestic programs.Some, such as Social Security, certain low-income programs, stateunemployment benefits, and veterans compensation and pensions, are exemptfrom cuts.A few programs are subject to limited cuts: Medicare andveterans hospitals, for example, are cut by no more than 2%. The remaining programs are cut across-the-board by the necessary percentage. In both defense and non-defense accounts, new budgetary resources (e.g. budgetauthority, loan limits, etc.) are reduced by sequestration. Sequestration does not reduce outlays from commitments pursuant to appropriations made inprior years.Thus, the sequestrable base 9enerally includes new outlays,not total outlays, in non-exempt programs.Table 3 illustrates a sequester using OMB's adjusted GRH estimates of$100.5 billion.Note that 0MB may forecast a less rosy economic outlook,and thus project a higher deficit, in August. Historically, the \"August surprise\" has increased the baseline deficit by an average of $10 bilHon.Last year, however, OMB'sunderlying estimates became about $8 billion moreoptimistic in August than at the start of the year. 7For FY 1988, GRH set a deficit reduction target; the stated fixeddeficit target of $1444 billion was legally inoperative. Instead,Congress was required to enact $23.0 billion in deficit reduction legislation ascompared to a start-of-session baseline.8In defense, unobligated carryover balances are also subject tosequestration. 118 As can be seen, total defense funding would be cut by 9.3 percent; ifMilitary Personnel accounts are exempted by the President, then the otherdefense accounts would have to be cut by 15.3 percent to achieve the samesavings.Non-defense programs, except for those exempt or limited byspecial rules, would be cut by 13.0 percent.The seQuester crediting rule: In general, sequestration is based on laws in effect on October 15th. Later laws can increase or decrease the deficit, but the sequester is not recomputed. (The President has proposed amending GRH to require another sequester later in the year to address theeffect of later legislation -- see section VI. G., Budget ProcessProposal s.)GRH provides an exception to the general rule in the case ofresolutions making temporary continuing appropriations (\"CRs\"). For anappropriation account funded by a temporary CR on October 15th, the GRHestimate equals the baseline and the sequester savings for that accountequals the amount in the account times the required uniform percentagesequester.The baseline minus the savings produces a \"post-sequesterlevel\".Then, when a full-year appropriation is later enacted, the amountactually sequestered from each account is as follows:.If the funding for the account is at the baseline or above, thesequester savings calculated on October 15th are subtracted from theaccount.(Thus, the dollar amount calculated on October 15th, ratherthan the uniform percentage, actually applies.)Table 3: Sample Sequestration,Based on OMB's Estimates .0% 119 If funding for the account is below the baseline, the account receives the amount actually appropriated or the post-sequester level, whichever is lower.There are two consequences of this rule. First, the amount sequestered from an appropriation bill will almost certainly be less if the billis enacted after October 15th. This produces an incentive for Congress or the President to delay favored bills. Second, the smaller sequester means that the GRH deficit target is unlikely to be met.Table 4 shows a sample sequestration from two accounts, assuming a 10% uniform percentage sequestration. Table 4: Sample 10% SequestrationAppropriations Enactment Before vs. After October 15thEnact before Oct 15Enact after Oct for both accounts but especially account #2 (because it was being cut from the baseline), delaying enactment until after October 15th resulted in a higher funding level.For FY 1990,in which the partial sequester implemented by the reconciliation bill reduced outlays by an apparent $5.7 billion, the actual outlay savings according to 0MB were only $3.7 billion.Further, instead of the outlay savings being divided 50-50 between defense and non-defense programs, only one-third of the outlay savings came from defense because defense accounts in general had already been reduced below the gRH baseline in the appropriations bills.

Congress would then have 20calendar days of session to agree to a bill or joint resolutiondisapproving such rescissions or they would take effect. 140 Current ProcedureThe current rescission procedure provides that:The President may submit a special message toCongress proposing the cancellation of a specificamount of budget authority; this is referred to theappropriate committee of each House.Unless both Houses complete action on a billapproving all or part of the proposed rescissionwithin 45 calendar days of continuous session afterthe President's message is received, the budgetauthority must be made available. During that period, the authority is withheld from obligation.If the committee to which a rescission message wasreferred fails to act within 25 calendar days ofcontinuous session,a small number of Members (one-fifth of the total Members of the House or Senate)can discharge the bill from committee and force Floorconsideration.Biennial BudgetProposalThe President urges greater progress toward a biennial budgetprocess, without endorsing a specific proposal.Current ProcedureThe congressional budget process is an annual process.However,a modified two-year budget cycle was established forfiscal years 1988 and 1989 through implementation of the 1987Bipartisan Budget Agreement (the \"Summit'). The two-yearagreement was implemented through the multi-year reconciliationprocess and the annual appropriation process.Joint Budget ResolutionProlosalThe President proposes a joint budget resolution. The resolution would be submitted to the President for hissignature or veto.Current ProcedureThe existing process requires a concurrent budget resolutionthat sets forth spending and revenue levels for three fiscalyears.The concurrent resolution governs subsequentcongressional actions and, as such, does not requirepresidential signature. 141 MeasurinQthe Effects of Budget ProposalsProposalThe President proposes continuation of recent progress indeveloping a common set of scorekeeping principles to be usedin the executive and legislative budget processes.Current ProcedureThe Budget Committee has participated with 0MB, CBO, and theappropriate congressional committees in the development ofconsistent scorekeeping principles.Social Security Sur1usesProposalThe President proposes an extension of Gramm-Rudman-Hollingslaw beyond its current expiration date of 1993, making itsbalanced budget requirement and sequestration authoritypermanent.In addition,a \"Social Security Integrity and DebtReduction Fund\" would be established.For further information on this proposal, see Section I. D. of this document.Second SeQuester Trigger DateProposalThe President proposes 'having a second sequester trigger date,preferably one early in the next calendar year' to take intoaccount the deficit impact of legislation and regulations afterOctober 15.The underlying economic and technical assumptionsused in the post-October 15 calculations would be required tobe the same as those used for the earlier review.Current ProcedureAt present, no actions after the October 15 sequester datecount against the deficit target. Spending increases or revenue reductions in legislation or by regulation add to thedeficit but do not trigger or add to sequestration.Reinforcing SeQuestersProposalThe President proposes to'require a supermajority vote [inCongressj restore) sequester savings onceachieved.' 142 Current ProcedureLegislation \"to cancel (or restore) sequester savings onceachieved\" could be vetoed by the President and would then onlybecome law if two-thirds of both Houses voted to override theveto.Restraining SuDplemental ApproDriationsProDosalThe President proposes \"restraining\" supplementalappropriations by requiring that--\"supplementals should ...meet aemergency'standard, both in their submission by the Presidentand their approval by Congress\";\"there should be provision for automatic offsets forboth budget authority and outlays in allsupplementals\";\"a uniform across-the-board reduction in,discretionary accounts in the same appropriations actthat is the subject of the supplemental (that is,accounts in the jurisdiction of the sameappropriations subcommittee)\" would be applied\"unless an alternative full offset were provided inthe supplemental\"; and\"the automatic across-the-board offset rule should bewaived only by a supermajority vote.\"Current ProcedureIn 1987 and again in 1989, Congress and the President agreednot to in.itiate supplementals except in the case of a \"direemergency\" and that the executive branch, when making such arequest of Congress, should accompany it with a presidentially-transmitted budget amendment. These agreements covered fiscalyears 1988, 1989, and 1990.

DESCRIPTION AND HISTORY OF FUNCTIONThe programs in the Income Security function provide cash and in-kind benefits topeople who need temporary or permanent income assistance. The major types ofassistance programs include pensions, unemployment insurance, housing, nutrition,welfare and other miscellaneous programs which assist both individuals and familieswith low incomes.The vast majority of funding in this function is for entitlement and mandatoryprograms with just under 10 percent of the total budget authority and approximately 17percent of the total outlays classified as discretionary.Approximately 36 percent of the total outlays in the function are composed of themilitary and civilian retirement pension programs. During the 1980's there have been annual proposals tomake significant changes in the pension programs. The major proposals have generally involved a one-year freeze in COLA, a reduced COLA for theCSRS system as well as benefit reductthns. Significant reforms were enacted in the civilian and military retirement programs in 1986. An additional pension related repeated proposal has been to privatize the railroad retirement system. 214. Another major entitlement program in this function is the unemployment insuranceprogram which'is proposed at a funding level of $24.1 billion in budget authority and$18.6 billion in outlays: The major issues in the unemployment area are the adequacyof reserves if there is an economic downturn and the current erosion in the level ofunemployment coverage.The Federal 'ow income housing programs operated by the Department of Housing andUrban Development have received increased attention because of the growth inhomelessness and the \"affordable housing crisis\". These housing programs total $11.9billion in discretionary budget authority and $16.5 billion in outlays.The housingbudget authority and the number of incremental units are substantially below thelevels prior to this decade while the outlays have grown substantially as a result ofthe timing of disbursements resulting from earlier housing commitments. The budgetauthority for housing is over 60 percent of the overall discretionary budget authorityin the function.The major housing issues include maintaining the current inventoryof over 4 million assisted households which involves housing modernization andoperating funds as well as funding for expiring contracts and contract prepayments.In addition, it is important to focus on expanding Federal assistance to additionalneedy families, providing innovative programs to meet new and existing needs,preventing homelessness and dealing with the present needs of the homeless as well asfighting drugs and crime in Federally assisted housing.The major nutrition assistance programs include the food stamp, commoditydistribution, child nutrition and Women, Infant and Children (WIC) programs. T2seprograms are in general targeted to provide nutrition and hunger assistance todisadvantaged groups.The funding has generally expanded in relationship to demand,but program reductions did occur 'in the early part of the decade with some laterrestorations.The overriding issue is the continued existence of unmet nutritionaland hunger needs amongst the economically disadvantaged.The welfare program in this function was significantly reformed by legislationenacted in 1988.Provisions in the 1988 welfare reform law provided extended job,and education requirements for welfare recipients as well as expanding child care andMedicaid coverage.The reform legislation requires additional funding as the AFDC-JOBS program and other provisions are implemented. Other significant income supportprograms in this function are the Earned Income Tax Credit program and SupplementalSecurity Income (SSI), program which are both entitlement programs.The other major programs in the function include the discretionary Low IncomeHome Energy Assistance program (LIHEAP) and the Refugee and Entrant Assistanceprogram.The LIHEAP program has had substantial reductions in funding in both realand nominal terms, and Presidential proposals continue to recommend furtherreductions.The Refugee and Entrant assistance has provided less assistance toStates to aid refugees.For instance, the AFDC and medicaid coverage has been reducedfrom 24 months in 1989 to currently 4 months. There are now substantially morerefugees, particularly from the Soviet Union, ready and willing to emigrate to theU.S. which would further strain available funding resources. 215 HIGHLIGHTS OF MAJOR PROPOSALSRetirement and Disability Programs - The President's budget proposes once again the privatization of the $5.1 billion railroad retirement program. The budget also re-proposes a reduction of 25 percent in the Federally funded windfallsubsidy by substituting partial funding of the program by the rail operators withan estimated savings of $80 million.The President's budget proposes $54.7 billion in budget authority and $34.3billion in. outlays for the Federal civilian retirement programs. The budget proposals include legislative proposals which save $2.25 billion in outlays.These legislative proposals include the elimination of the Lump Sum benefit($-1.5 billion) and a fiscal year 1991 COLA freeze ($-0.7 billion). The budgetalso proposes a CPI-minus 1COLA payment for the Civil Service Retirement System(CSRS) beginning in 1992 equal to the current Federal Employee Retirement System(FERS) payment.The President's budget proposes $35.0 billion in budgetauthority and $22.1 billion in outlays for military retirement. The budget proposes a COLA freeze on military retirement for fiscal year 1991 which saves$0.7 billion.The President's budget proposes to reduce the Federal exposure in the PostalService and District of Columbia retirement systems by requiring that theemployee contribution be raised in steps from 7 percent currently to 14 percentby 1994.Unemployment Programs- The President's budget proposes the elimination of theTrade Adjustment Assistance program's (TAA) cash benefit and training stipendfunded in this function, for a net savings of $119 million. A corresponding reduction n TAA employment training funding is found in function 500.Low Income Housinq Assistance Programs - The President's budget proposes $17.8 billion in budget authority and $17.4 billion in outlays for discretionary lowincome housing assistance.The President's overall housing budget request inthis function is $6.6 billion in budget authority and $0.4 billion in outlaysabove his current services estimate and these numbers are precisely the amountswhich, when added to the $1.1 billion in budget authority in the current servicesbaseline, are necessary to fully fund the 295,000 expiring contracts for fiscalyear 1991.Assisted Housing Account- Within the totals the budget proposes $13.1 billionfor assisted housing which will fund 82,049 incremental units, an amount similarto the current year.Programmatically the budget continues to emphasize voucherswith 5-year terms and the budget proposes the elimination of the public andIndian housing construction programs as well as the Section 8 moderaterehabilitation and Nehemiah programs. The budget also reduces the number of section 202 elderly and housing section 8 certificates by almost half to justover 3,000.The assisted housing account also includes several major portions of thePresident's Homeownership and Opportunity for People Everywhere (HOPE) proposal.These portions include: 1,000 lased units costing $35.8 million targeted to longterm homeless; 6,000 certificates and vouchers costing $251 million for 216 relocation and replacement of rental units due to tenant homeownership andpurchase initiatives; and homeownership opportunities costing $412 million inmultifamily projects where owners elect to prepay. The HOPE proposal alsoincludes 'Operation Bootstrap\" which requires that public housing operators andlocal governments \"help welfare and other low-income families achieve upwardmobility by combining housing assistancewith support services such as jobtraining, child care and transportation\". However, the budget does not appear toprovide any Federal funds for Operation Bootstrap; Operation Bootstrap is alsosimilar to the \"Gateway bill\" concept which is being considered in the Congress. Expiring Section 8 Housing Subsidies The budget proposes a total of $7.7 billion in budget authority and $0.4 billion in outlays to refund an estimated295,000 expiring housing contracts which compares to $1.1 billion and 41,000units in the current fiscal year. HUD \"recognizes the need to ensureuninterrupted housing assistance\" and is basing renewals on using 5-yearcontracts.The budget projects an additional 550,000 expiring section 8contracts and over 250,000 vouchers cumulatively between 1992 and 1995.Public Housing ODerating, Modernization and Anti-drug Proqrams - The budgetproposes $1.8 billion in public housing operating subsidies and $1.8 billion formodernization funding.The operating subsidy is $43 million below currentservices and the modernization funding is $214 below current services. Inaddition to these reductions there has been serious controversy regardinginadequate reflection of insurance, utility and other costs in determiningoperating payments as well as inadequate financing of the modernization programand lack of funding for lead paint removal. The budget proposes $150 million foranti-drug efforts which is a $50 million increase over the 1990 appropriatedlevel.Rural Housing Vouchers- The President's budget proposes a series of changes inthe Farmers Home Administration rural loan programs which are discussed infunction 370:Commerce and Housing Credit. As part of these proposals thebudget proposes $190 million to fund 8,000 rural housing vouchers in thisfunction.HOPE and Homeless Assistance Proqrams - The President's HOPE proposal includes a$250 million grant program to allow low-income families to become homeowners; thecreation of Housing Opportunity Zones (tax expenditure proposal; the extention ofthe low income tax credit through December 1991 (tax expenditure proposal).Italso calls for the use of IRA's for young families and first-time homebuyers toaid in purchasing homes; provides for a $34 million frail elderly demonstrationproject; and, assumes the creation of Housing and Enterprise Zones (taxexpenditure proposal).The HOPE initiative also proposes $247 million for ahomeless \"Shelter Care Plus\" program, including $161 million for a new RentalHousing Assistance program (discussed in Function 450), $50 million for section 8moderate rehabilitatiOn of single room occupancy units and $36 million for thesection 202(h) homeless program. The budget also continues other homelessMcKinney Act funding including $71 million for emergency shelter grants, $143million for transitional housing assistance for the homeless and $125 million forthe emergency food and shelter program. 217 Food and Nutrition Assistance - The President's budget assumes thereauthorization of the food stamp program and proposes $15.4 billion (notincluding assistance to Puerto Rico) in budget authority with an assumption of$68 million in legislated savings resulting from lower payments due to increasedchild care collections and reduced administrative payments to States. The budget also proposes to replace the Nutrition Assstance to Puerto Rico foodassistance program with a new block grant funded at $825 million, a reduction ofapproximately $150 million from current services.The President's budget proposes $4.6 billion for the child nutrition programswhich reflects $0.4 billion in legislative savings. The President's legislativeproposal would reduce grants to schools for operating school lunch programs($-220 million) by eliminating subsidies for students from families with incomesabove 350 percent of poverty. The proposal would partially offset ($+48 million)the reduced subsidy to schools by increasing the subsidy formula for studentswith family income between 130 and 185 percent of poverty. In addition, the child care feeding program would be means tested with a projected savings of $242million.The President's budget proposes $2.2 billion in budget authority for the SpecialSupplemental Assistance program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) consistentwith the current services projection for fiscal year 1991. The WIC program has had significant participation increases primarily due to successful infantformula rebate programs. However, the WIC program still serves just over half theeligible population despite its excellent cost-benefit ratio.The President's budget also reflects reductions in a few smaller nutritionrelated programs.The budget proposes $32 million for the purchase ofcommodities for distribution to soup kitchens. Although $32 million is the authorized amount it represents a reduction below the $40 million for the twopreceding years and according to Mayors and service providers program demand hasincreased not decreased.In addition, the budget proposes a reduction in theMcKinney Act Emergency Food and Shelter program from the 1990 level of $130million to $125 million.Cash Income Assistance Programs - The President's budget proposes full benefitpayments for the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) and SupplementalSecurity Income programs (SSI). The AFDC program would be funded at $12.7 billion and includes minor savings resulting from lower federal reimbursement forchild support enforcement by states and a speed up in fiscal sanction collections(cumulatively $33 million in savings). The budget also assumes $1 billion in funding for the AFDC- Job Opportunities and Basic Skills Training program (JOBS)which provides work and education experience and opportunities for eligible AFDCrecipients.The budget assumption of $15.1 billion for the SSI program assumes$55 million in savings resulting from a new administrative fee charged to statesthat provide a supplemental benefit program. 218 Other Income Security Programs - The President's budget proposes $1.1 billion for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) which is a reduction of $0.35 billion from the fiscal year 1990 appropriated level. The President's proposal is based on his contention that \". ..fuel prices have moderated\". However, the real world experience with the LIHEAP program is that despite statistical claims that energy prices have moderated, the program is forced to serve millions fewer than several years ago and now serves less than 40 percent of the eligible population.The President's budget alsoproposes $369 million for the Refugee and Entrant Assistance program which is the same funding level as in 1990 and below the level for fiscal year 1989.The $369 million funding levelis restrictive in light of the substantially increased refugee populations seeking, to emigrate from the Soviet Union, Asia, Afghanistan and other locations as well.

The President's budget includes a total of $7.7 billion in budget authority for expiring contracts and requested $1.85 billionin budget authority for modernization as a separate program. The CBO fiscal year 1991 baseline number has been adjusted by adding $8,358 million in budget authority and $798 million in outlays for comparable full funding for expiring contracts. FUNCTION 600:INCOME SECURITY(In billions of dollars)Fiscal programs is discretionary.*Mandatory program.For these programs, it is appropriate to compare the President's FY 1991 budget figures to OMB's FY 1991 currentservices figures.However, a comparison with CBO's figures is less meaningful because both estimating and policy differenceswould be reflected.For discretionary programs,it is preferable to compare the President's requested level of FY 1991 budget authority (or loan limits)to CBO's FY 1991 baseline, since that baseline is a better measure of zero real growth. Such an outlay comparison should be avoided, since it may include estimating as well as policy differences. 223 FISCAL YEAR 1991HIGHLIGHTS AND ISSUES FUNCTION650: SOCIAL SECURITY(In billions of dollars)1989Actual1990199119921993 232.5248.5264.7280.9297.7NOTE:Because CBO and 0MB have different.economjc and technical estimating assumptions, the differences between the President's Budget and the CBO baseline result from both policy differences and estimating differences. CBO will prepare a reestimate of the President's policies using its own estimating assumptions which will be available in approximately late February. DESCRIPTION AND HISTORY OF FUNCTIONThis function includes the Old-Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance Trust Funds (OASDI) which will provide cash assistance to 40 million beneficiaries in FY 1991.The program beneficiaries include persons who are retired and disabled and their dependents or survivors. The average monthly payment will be $592 for a retired worker in FY 1991, an increase of 4.5 percent above the 1990 average.Benefits are financed primarily through payroll tax contributions of workers. During 1991 over 93 percent of American workers will pay social security taxes of 6.2 percent on the first $54,300 of income, andemployers will match these contributions (an additional 1.45 percent is paid by employers and employees on the same wage base to cover the Medicare Hospital Insurancecontribution).Self employed persons pay the employer and employee shares.The Social Securityprogram is authorized to provide an annual cost of living allowance (COLA) to beneficiaries to cover inflation.A COLA of 4.7 percent was awarded in January 1990 anda 3.9 percent increase is projected for January 1991. 224 As a result of the 1983 Social Security Amendments, the old-age survivors' anddisability insurance trust funds continue to have annual surpluses. The fiscal year1991 budget estimates a surplus of $80 billion and a cumulative balance of $299billion for fiscal year 1991 in the old-age, survivors and disability insuranceprograms.These funds are invested in Treasury notes. The budget proposes toestablish a Social Security Integrity and Debt Reduction Fund. Annual deposits tothis fund would be phased in until they equal the amount of the annual SocialSecurity surplus and would be used to retire the national debt (also discussed underI.D. \"National Saving, the Social Security Surplus and the Social Security Integrityand Debt Retirement Fund\".For budget presentation purposes, the fund transactionsare reflected in Function 800: General Government).The FY 1991 request assumes a 6.5 percent increase in Social Security outlaysover FY 1990.This increase will support the COLA, an additional 649,000beneficiaries who will be covered, and the higher average wages of new beneficiaries. HIGHLIGHTS OF MAJOR PROPOSALSQQj - The budget proposes full funding of all benefits required under currentlaw, including the 3.9 percent COLA.Payroll Taxes- Two new categories of workers would be. required to contribute Social Security payroll taxes. District 'of Columbia government employees hiredafter January 1,1991 and State and local workers without other retirement anddisability coverage will be brought under Social Security. These changes willincrease fiscal year 1991 trust funds income by $2.3 billion.Eligibility - Eligibility for benefits will also be extended to a group ofadopted children who are not now covered. These are children who are adopted bythe surviving spouse of a deceased worker and who receive benefits based on thedeceased worker's earnings.Such children had to have been living in theworker's home at the time of the worker's death or had to have been receiving atleast one-half of their support from the deceased worker.Overrayment Collections - The budget also includes a provision authorizing theInternal Revenue Service to withold income tax refunds from former SocialSecurity recipients who owe money to the Federal government as a result ofoverpayment of Social Security benefits.

DESCRIPTION AND HISTORY OF FUNCTIONThis function covers the core activities of the Federal Government which includepolicy formulatthn and direction, financial management and revenue collection, construction and management of Federal civilian buildings and property, andadministration of the merit personnel system. Other programs in this function include the Federal payment to the District of Columbia; Forest Service receipts paidto States; payment n lieu oftaxes (PILT); and payment to territories and PuertoRico from IRS and Customs Service collections. The major agencies in this function are the Congress, the White House and Executive Office of the President, the GeneralServices Administration, the Office of Personnel Management, and most of the TreasuryDepartment.Overone half of the spending in this function is attributable to thebudget of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Since the early 1980's, significant increases for the IRS have been proposed by the administration and accepted by theCongress. Internal Revenue Service (IRSI - The President's budget proposes fundingbillion in 1991.This compares with $5.5 billion estimated for 1990.Theincreased funding over 1990 is associated with an IRS enforcement initiativedesigned to improve taxpayers' reporting of income and to improve collectionsfrom past due accounts.The budget estimates that this initiative will yield$0.5 billion in increased collections in 1991. The budget also proposesimprovements in the management of tax law enforcement resources whichincrease revenue yields by $2.5 billion in 1991 without requiring additionalexpenditures.Payment in lieu of Taxes (PILT1 - This program provides payments to localgovernments for Federal use of land located within their jurisdictions. Thebudget proposes fiscal year 1991 funding of $105 million, which is the sameamount provided in 1990.Payment to Territories and Puerto Rico - The Federal Government provides specialassistance to the local governments of Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Virgin Islands.The budget proposes $210 million in assistance in 1990 compared with $199million provided in 1990.Government-sponsored enterDrise fees - The budgetagain proposes to impose oncertain Government-sponsored enterprises (GSE5), a fee on new securities issuedafter September 30, 1990.Savings estimated for the proposal are $52 million in1991, $306 million in 1992, and $666 million in 1993 and nearly $3.0 billion overthe period 1991-1995.The GSEs affected include the Student Loan MarketingAssociation, the Federal National Mortgage Association, and the Federal Home LoanMortgage Corporation.The purpose of this fee is to reimburse the FederalGovernment for the borrowing advantages these enterprises enjoy as a result oftheir special relationship with the Government.Federal Payment to the District of Columbia (DC) - The 1991budget proposes atotal of $505 million (net of $35 million in loan repayments) for D.C. Thisproposal compares with the 1990 and 1991 CBO baseline estimates of $505 milhonand $545 million respectively. Of the total requested forDC in 1991, $431million is for the direct payment, $52 million is for the Federal share ofpayments to DC retirement funds for police officers, fire fighters, teachers, andjudges, and $10 million is for a payment to assist in financing St. ElizabethsHospital as part of the existing plan to transfer administrative and financialresponsibility from the Federal Government to the District. The budget alsoproposes to make permanent, the pilot project involving D.C. directly billfederal agencies for water and sewer costs.Social Security Integrity and Debt Reduction Fund (SSIDRFI - The President'sbudget proposes legislation to assure that the intended buildup in SocialSecurity reserves is not used to mask the non-Social Security deficit.The Fundwould receive each year, as outlays, an amount equivalent to the increasingportion of the projected Social Security operating surplus - reaching 100percentin 1996.The Fund would be linked with a continuing obligation to meet a Gramni-Rudman-Hollings deficit target of zero starting in 1993 and the estiniatesin thisfunction reflect this policy starting in 1993. Under the budget proposal,payments to the new fund would be $14.1 billion in 1993, $53.6 billion in 1994,and $101.8 billion in 1995.For further discussion of this proposal, seeFunction 650: Social Security and Part I.D.238 HIGHLIGHTS OF MAJOR PROPOSALS FUNCTION 800:GENERAL GOVERNMENT(In of taxes... 105104105FUNCTION 800:GENERAL GOVERNMENT(In millions of dollars) Internal revenue collectionsfor Liberties PublicEducation Fund 500500 500500Claims, judgments, andrelief acts 510510For discretionary programs, it is preferable to compare to President's requested level of FY 1991 budgetto CBO's FY 1991 baseline, since that baseline is a better measure of zero real growth.

The reader is referred to those studies for greater detailabout methodology. The tables presented here are unpublished tables whichcorrespond to pages 86 and 87 in the CBO report titled \"The Economic andBudget Outlook: Fiscal Years 1991\u20141995.\" These tables present effectivetax rates, income and shares of tax burdens in much greater detail.Study MethodologyInthese CBO studies, combined Federal taxes include individual and cor-porate income taxes, social insurance payroll taxes, and excise taxes exceptfor the windfall profit tax. Although Federal tax payments are made by per-sons, corporations, and noncorporate employers, the economic burden of alltaxes ultimately rests with families and individuals. Economists speak of thereduction in family income or purchasing power as the incidence of a tax.The incidence of some taxes, particularly the corporate income tax, has notbeen estimated conclusively, and remains a controversial issue. The follow-ing incidence assumptions were used in the following tables.\u2014The individual income tax burden is attributed to the families who directlypay the tax. The study assumes no shifting of the tax among families.\u2014The social insurance payroll tax burden is allocated to employee compen-sation. The poiion of the payroll tax collected from employers is assumedto be shifted back Onto employees in the form of lower wages.(I) 2\u2014Excise taxes are assumed to be passed forward to individual consumers inhigher prices on goods subject to the tax.\u2014Althoughthe corporate income tax is collected from coiporations, fami-lies are assumed ultimately to bear its economic burden. Economists dis-agree, however, about who is affected by the corporate income tax, em-ployees of the corporation or shareholders. The tables that follow assumethat half of the corporate income tax is allocated to capital income andhalf to labor income. The method of allocation does not affect the mainconclusions about how the distribution of the tax burden among incomeclasses has changed over time.These tables do not attempt to allocate the distributional effects of generalgovernment spending. In comparing the distribution of Federal taxes in dif-ferent years, shifts in the distribution of general expenditures between thoseyears are ignored. The CBO studies also separate the distribution effects oftaxes from the effects of expenditures significantly related to those taxes.Social Security revenues are thus imliciUy treated as independent of benefitpayments.Family income is measured on a cash receipt basis, a defmition generallyconsistent with the measure of income used by the Federal tax system.Family income equals the sum of wages, salaries, self-employment income,and personal rents, interest, and dividends plus cash pension benefits and re-alized capital gains. Family income excludes accrued but unrealized capitalgains, employer contributions to pension funds, in-kind government transferpayments, and other noncash income. Because income is measured beforereductions for any Federal taxes, employer contributions for Federal socialinsurance and Federal corporate profits taxes are added to family income.Family incomes are put in constant dollars by the CPI\u2014U price index.DataSourcesDistributionsof family income for 1977, 1980, 1985, and the projecteddistribution in 1990 are based on data from four sources. The primaiy sourceis the March Current Population Survey (CPS) for 1978, 1981, 1986, and1988. The CPS is a monthly survey of approximately 60,000 families, con-ducted by the Bureau of the Census. Each March, the survey collects de-tailed information on family characteristics and family income in the previ-ous calendar year. The reported data on income from taxable sources fromthe CPS files were adjusted for consistency with reported income from Sta-tistics of Income (SOD samples for calendar years 1977, 1980, 1985 andearly data for 1987. The SO! is an extensive annual sample of actual indi-vidual income tax returns. Data on consumer expenditures were taken fromthe 1980/81, 1984,and1985 Consumer Expenditure Survey (CES) interviewSurveys. The CES Interview Survey is a quarterly panel survey conductedby the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The survey collects detailed data onhousehold expenditures over a 12-month period. The 1980/81 CES data wereadjusted to 1977 levels by changes in per capita expenditures of certaintypes as repoied in the National Income and Product Accounts. Each of the1987 files wasadjustedto 1990 using actual growth rates in population,income, and expenditures through 1988, and projected growth rates for 1989and 99O.Many people incur \"paper losses\" for tax purposes. In order to approxi-mate better the economic income of families, rental losses and most partner-ship losses were not subtracted from family income. All losses of sole pro-prietorships were allowed. 3 Reportedpre-tax family incomes were adjusted to include the amount ofthe employer share of the Social Security payroll tax, the unemployment in-surance payroll tax, and the corporate income tax. The unemployment insur-ance payroll tax and the employer share of the Social Security payroll taxwere allocated to the employee on whose behalf the taxes were paid.Study ResultsFederal taxes in 1990 will be less progressive than they were in either1977 or 1980 but more progressive than in 1985. The distribution of taxes isprogressive if the ratio of taxes to income rises as incomes rise; is regressiveif the ratio falls as incomes rise; and is proportional if the ratio is the same at all income levels. In 1990, the effective tax rate for the one-fifth (quintile)of people in families with the highest incomes will be 25.8 percent, slightlyless than in 1977 or 1980. The effective tax rates for people in the lowestthree quintiles will be higher than they were in either 1977 or 1980.Effective Federal tax rates\u2014the percentage of family income paid intaxes\u2014for people ranked in quintiles by their adjusted pretax family incomeare shown in Table 1. (Adjusted pretax income includes all cash income plusrealized capital gains and is measured before all Federal taxes, includingthose collected from business but assumed to be borne by families.) Peopleare assigned to quintiles based on family income divided by the povertythreshold for the appropriate family size. Twenty percent of the populationare in each quintile for each year. They will represent a different percentageof families. Families include both families and single individuals. Tax rates for the lowest quintile were calculated excluding families with negative or zero incomes. The poverty thresholds depend on family size, the age of thehouseholder, and the number of children. The average thresholds for variousfamily types are shown in the table below. POVERTY THRESHOLDS AND EQUIVALENCE VALUESFORDIFFERENT FAMILY SIZES Family 4What has caused the. Federal tax system to become less progressive than itwas a decade ago? The individual income tax has not become significantlyless progressive ovez the period, although it did become less progressive be-tween 1977 and 1985. However, recent changes in tax law\u2014especially theTax Reform Act of 1986\u2014will make the tax more progressive in 1990 thanit was in 1985, restoring 1990 effective tax rates approximately to their 1977levels.The major factor in reducing the progressivity of Federal taxes is the in-creased reliance on social insurance payroll taxes. Because these taxes arelevied only on earnings and only below a maximum amount, they are muchless progressive than individual income taxes across most of the income dis-thbution and, in fact, regressive in the upper part of the distribution. In1990, 77 percent of families who pay social insurance payroll taxes will payhigher payroll taxes (counting both the employee and the employer portions)than Federal income taxes. In 1977, 58 percent of these families paid morein payroll taxes than in income taxes.Table 1Table 1 compares the total Federal effective tax rates for all families. In1990, total Federal taxes are projected to be 9.7 percent of income for thelowest 20 percent of the population, while they are estimated to be 25.8 per-cent for the highest. From 1980 to 1990, the tax rale is estimated to rise by16.1 percent for the lowest quintile. By contrast, it is expected to fall by 5.5percent for the highest quintile.Table 2Table 2 compares the adjusted family income for all families, with incomeexpressed as multiples of the poverty thresholds and percentage changes inreal income adjusted for inflation. In 1990, average adjusted family incomeis estimated to be 84 percent of the poverty threshold for the lowest 20 per-cent of the population, while it is projected to be an average of 11.34 timespoverty for the highest. From 1980 to 1990, real income is projected to fallby 3.2 percent for the lowest quintile. By contrast, it is expected to rise by31.7 percent for the highest.Chart 1 gmphically depicts the percentage change from 1980 to 1990 inreal income and Federal tax rates (Tables 1 and 2). For the lowest 20 per-cent of the population, real income fell by 3.2 percent, while the total Feder-al tax rate rose by 16.1 percent. By conast, for the highest 20 percent ofthe population, real income rose by 31.7 percent, while the total Federal taxrate fell by 5.5 percent.Table 3Table3 describes the Federal effective tax rates for different kinds oftaxes for all families. In 1980, for the middle quintile in income of the popu-lation, the individual income tax rate was 8.1 percent of income. Overall, forthe totalU.S.population it was 12.3 percent. From 1980 to 1990, the taxrate for the middle group declined by 17.2 percent.In 1980, for the middle quintile, the social insuiance tax rate was 8.7 per-cent of income. Overall, f the total U.S. population it was 7.2 percent.From 1980 to 1990, the tax rate for the middle group rose by 23.3 percent.Table 4Table 4 presents data with respect to total Federal effective tax rates byfamily type. In 1990, for families with children in the lowest 20 percent of 5income of the total U.S. population, total Federal taxes are estimated to be 10.0 percent of income; 22.1 percent for the middle quintile, and 26.3 per- cent for the highest. From 1980 to 1990, the total Federal effective tax rate is expected to rise by 7.2 percent for families with children in the lowest quintile of the total U.S. population and by 2.5 percent for the middle quin- tile. By contrast, it is expected to fall by 2.9 percent for the highest quintile. In 1990, for elderly households in the lowest 20 percent of income of the total U.S. population, total Federal taxes are estimated to be 2.7 percent of income; 7.9 percent for the middle quintile, and 21.9 percent for the highest. From 1980 to 1990, the total Federal effective tax rate is expected to fall by 25.3 percent for elderly households in the lowest quintile of the total U.S. population; by 6.3 percent for those in the middle quintile, and by 11.2 per- cent in the highest. Middle income elderly rates are considerably less than Lax rates for the middle quintile for non-elderly families.In 1990, for non-elderly households without children in the lowest 20per- cent of income of the total U.S. population, total Federal taxes are expected to be 14.2 percent of income; 22.8 percent for the middle quintile, and 27.0 percent for the highest. From 1980 to 1990, the total Federal effective tax rate is expected to rise by 28.5 percent for non-elderly households without children in the lowest quintile of the total U.S. population, by 6.0 percent in the middle quintile, and to fall by 4.6 percent in the highest quintile. In 1990, for all families in the lowest 20 percent in income of the total U.S. population, total Federaltaxes are projected to be 9.7 percent of income; 20.3 percent for the middle quintile, and 25.8 percent for the high- est. The reader is referred to Table 1 for these figures.Table 5Table 5 compares the share of total Federal taxes paid by all families, from lowest to highest quintiles. In 1990, families in the lowest 20 percent in income of the total U.S.population paid 1.6 percent of the total tax burden, while the highest quintile paid 58.1 percent. From 1980 to 1990, the Lax burden of the lowest 20 percent in income of the total U.S. population remained the same, while itrose by 2.4 percentage points for the highestquintile. The increase in the share of the tax burden borne by the highest quintile results entirely from the fact that real incomes increased bya sub- stantially larger amount (31.7 percent\u2014see Table 2) than Lax rates declined (5.5 percent\u2014see Table 1).Table 6Table 6 describes shares of pre-Lax income for all families, from lowest to highest quintiles. In 1980, families in the lowest 20 percent in income of the total U.S. population received 4.5 percent of total pre-tax income, while the highest quintile acquired 47.4 percent. From 1980 to 1990, pre-tax income of families in the lowest quintile dropped by .8 percentage points, while i rose by 4.4 percentage points for the highest quintile.Table7Table7 describes shares of after4ax income for all families, from lowest to highest quintile. n 1980, families in the lowest 20 percent in income of the total U.S. population received 5.4 percent of total after-tax income, while the highest quirnile acquired 44.8 percent. From 1980 to 1990, after-tax income of families in the Iowes quintile dropped by 1.1 percernge points, while it rose by 5.1 percentage points for the highest quintile. 6Chart 2 graphically depicts shares and changes in shares of after-taxincome of all families, from 1980 to 1990 (referto Table 7). The representa-tion shows that growth in after-tax income for the highest 20 percent of thetotal U.S. population between 1980 and 1990 is more than the total incomeof the lowest quintile.Table 8Table 8 illustrates shares of tax burdens for different kinds of taxes for allfamilies. In 1985, the lowest 20 percent in income of the total U.S. popula-tion paid zero percent of total individual income taxes, while the highestowed 68.1 percent.Table 9Table 9 illustrates the distribution of persons across the different quintilesfor different family types. The lowest quintile excludes persons living infamilies with negative or zero income. These persons are, however, includedin the totals. Overall the population is projected to increase by 10.9 percentfrom 1980 to 1990. Persons living in families with children will increase by3.8 percent between 1980 and 1990, while persons in families with an elder-ly head (age 65 or over) will increase 22.8 percent and persons living innon-elderly families without children will increase by 20.6 percent.The number of persons in the lowest quintile in income in elderly house-holds actually declined by 10.3 percent. There was a substantial migration ofthese persons from the lowesi and second quintiles to the top three quintiles.Among persons living in families with children, there was a substantialmigration into the lowest quintile and to a lesser extent the second and high-est quintiles.These percentage shifts in the composition of the quintiles are illustratedin the last four columns of Table 10.Table 10Table 10 presents income and demographic information for each quintilefor 1990. The first column illustrates average pre-tax family income. Thesecond column is the number of families in millions. The percentage compo-sition of persons living in thfferent types of households is illustrated in thefollowing columns.CoMPARIsONOFPAYROLL AND INDIVIDUAL INCOMETAxEsTable 11Thelast two columns of Table 11 illustrate the percentage of familiespaying some taxes who pay larger social security taxes than income taxes. In1990, this percentage will be 34.4 percent, if only the employee portion ofthe social security tax is counted. This percentage increases to 69.4 percent,if both the employer and employee portions of the social security tax arecounted.Table 12Table 12 illustrates estimates of the number of families paying no tax,paying income tax only, or payroll tax only. In addition, for those familiespaying both payroll and income taxes, the table shows the number of fami-lies where the payroll tax is greater than the income tax. In one set of esti-mates (last two columns)only the employee share of the payroll tax is 7counted. In the preceding two columns both the employer and employee shares are counted.REVENUE TusTable 13Table 13 presents total Federal revenues in nominal dollars and as a per- centage of ON? from fiscal years 1989 to 1995 in the January CBO base- line.Table14Table14 presents similar data to that in Table 13 for selected historical years. BUDGET TABLESTable15Table15 compares CBO and 0MB projections of baseline revenues, out- lays and deficits. In general, these baseline projections assume that revenue and entitlement law are unchanged, that expiring provisions do indeed expire, and for discretionary programs it is assumed that the budget authority is increased to reflect inflation. For fiscal year 1991, CBO projects a base- line deficit of $138 billion while 0MB projects a deficit of $101 billion, approximately $37 billion less.Without any change in law, 0MB projects the deficit will fall and become a surplus of $13 billion by 1995, while CBO projects a small decline in the deficit. The primary reason for these differences is the economic assump- tions, primarily the interest rate assumption.Table16Table16 illustrates the trust fund surpluses in the January CBO baseline. In fiscal year 1991 the trust funds will have an annual surplus of $136 bil- lion. This will increase to $185 billion by 1995. The rest of the budget will have a deficit of $273 billion in fiscal year 1991 which will increase to $303 billion by 1995.Table 17Table 17 shows CBO baseline outlay projections for major spending cate- gories.Table 18Table 18 shows CBO baseline projections for entitlements other man- datory spending categories.Table 19Table 19 shows CBO baseline estimates of Federal debt and interest costs.Table 20Table 20 presents rules of thumb which illustrate the impact on revenues, outlays, and deficit projections if the economic assumptions assumed in the baseline do not materialize. For example, the first panel illusirates that if real growth were 1 percent lower beginning in January 1990 the deficit pro- jection for fiscal year 1991 would be $26 billion higher. The fourth panel indicates a similar effect for a I percentage point increase in interest rates. 8Thus, a 2 percentage point change in the interest ratescompared tothe base-lineassumption would increase the deficit in fiscalyear1991 by $22 billion.Table21Table21 illustrates the increase inspending if government expenditures inmajor categories had been increased for prices and population.This tableblindly assumes that spending should stay the same in real per capita terms.The methodology does not take into account medical priceincreases differ-ent from inflation, it does not account for defense policyneeds nor accountfor the fact that some progra1Tis serve populations growing faster than average. The price indexchosen un this methodologyis the GNP deflalor. Thistable is primarily designed to illustrate which major spending programs aregrowing faster than prices and population and which caiegories are growingmore slowly.If 1980 is chosen as a base year, defense spending would have grown to$282 billion in fiscal year1995 compared to $355 billion in the JanuaryCBO baseline. This is a difference of $73 billion as illustratedin the lastcolumn of the table. Medicare spending under these assumptions would haveincreased to $71 billion in 1995 compared to the CBO estimate of $183 billion. Non-defense discretionary spending shows a completely different result.If expenditures had beenadjusted for prices and population, non-defense dis-cretionary spending would have been $78 billion more thanis projected inthe CBO baseline for 1995.The boilom third of this table shows somewhatdifferent results using 1985 as the base year.Table 22Table 22 shows CBO January baseline pmjections for programs within thejurisdiction of the Commitlee on Ways and Means.Table 23Table 23 presents outlays for major spending categories for selected yearsin nominal dollars and as a percent of Gross National Product(GNP). SAVINGs AND INVESTMENTTable 24Table 24 presents netsavings and investment flows as a percentage ofGNP. This table shows that net domestic savings shortfalls(primarily aresult of the Federal deficitand declines in net privatedomestic savings)have been met by capitalinflows from abroad. Thesehave grown from zeroin 1982 to 3.2 percent in1987 and have fallen to 1.5 percent in 1989.

Medianincome of a full-timeyear-round male worker in1988 is below each and every year in the 1970's. 9 ADMINISTRAnON PROPOSALSTable 26Table26 illustrates 0MB estimates of deficit reduction proposals by major category. In 1991, the Administration proposes to decrease defense spending by $3.2 billion relative to the GRH baseline. Non-defense discre- tionary spending is to be increased by $1.0 billion, entitlements are to be reduced by $13.9 billion, and revenues are to be increased by $13.9 billion.Table27Table27 illustrates management., asset sales and non-recurring savings in the fiscal year 1991 budget.Table28Table28 compares the Administration budget proposals to sequestration assuming an 0MB deficit projection of $85 billion. Defense programs would receive a $10.3 billion outlay reduction under sequestration compared to a $3.2 billion decrease under the Administration budget proposals. Non-de- fense discretionary programs would receive a $8.0 billion reduction under sequestration and a $1.0 billion increase under the Administration budget proposals.Table 29Table 29 illustrates preliminary estimates by the Administration for budget proposals affecting programs within the jurisdiction of the Committee on Ways and Means. Medicare legislative proposals are projected to reduce out- lays by $5.5 billion in fiscal year 1991 increasing to $15.2 billionby fiscal year 1995. The Administration also proposes to end the Trade AdjustmentProgram for a total savings of $1.1 billion over the next five years.Table 30Table 30 illustrates revenue proposals within the jurisdiction of the Com- mittee on Ways and Means. 13 TABLE3.-FEDERALEFFECTIVE TAX RATES FOR DIFFERENT KINDS OF TAXES FOR ALL EFFECTIVE TAX RATES BY quintile)======\u2014============================================%Change 19771980198519901980\u201490For Families With Children==== == == fig.ire with double asterisk (**) that for families with children in the lowest 20 percent in incone of the total population in 1977, total federal taxes were 10.2 percent of income. 20 TABLE8. -SHAREsOFTAX URDNS FOR DIFFERENTKINDS Source: Tax Simulation ModelNote:Table reads for figure with double asterisk(**) that the second quintile in income of thetotal population in 1977 contained 30.0 millionpersons living in families with children. *Excludespersons living in families withnegative or zero incomes.

Part B PremiumCurrentlaw and backgroundFrom 1984 through 1990, the Part B premium has been set at25 percentof program costs for the elderly and adjusted for interest income to providefor an appropriate contingency margin. The remaining 75 percent is coveredby general revenues. In 1991, however, the method for calculating the pre-mium will revert to the formula used prior to 1984. Namely, increases in thePart B premium will be limited by the Social Security cost-of-living adjust-ment (COLA).Description of proposalThe budget proposes to set a floor on the rate increase each year, begin-ning in calendar year 1991, at a level that would be necessary to finance 25percent of the program.

Coverage of State and Local EmpJoyees Not Covered by A Public Re. tirement ProgramCurrent law anr backgroundState and Ioca employees are covered by social security under agreements between the state and the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The state has broad latitu\u00e7le to decide which groups of employees are covered. In some cases wheile states have elected not to provide coverage, a part of their work force does not participate in any public retirement plan. Most of these individuals are temporary workers, pan-time workers, and students employed by state universities.Description of pioposaJThe proposal would require social security coverage for individuals not covered by the public retirement program.2. Coverage of All New Employees of the District of ColumbiaCurrentlawand 5ackgroundSince October 1,1987, new District employees have been covered bysocial security unless they participate in one of the city's three special retire- ment programs. These programs cover police and fire fighters, teachers, andjudges.Description of prQposalThe proposal would make social security coverage for new District em- ployees universal by extending iL to new employees covered by these three systems.3. Recoupment of Certain Overpayments through Income Tax Refund OffsetCurrent law and ackgroundA federal agency that is owed a past-due, legally enforceable debt, other than a social securny overpayment, can collect it by having the Internal Rev-enue Service withhold or reduce the debtor's income tax refund.Description of prposaJThe proposal 'ou1d authorize SSA to use this system to recover overpay- ments from two groups of individuals: (1) former beneficiaries and (2) bene-ficiaries who are not in current pay status (i.e., whose monthly check hasbeen suspended due to earnings).

Preeffectuation Review RequirementsCurrent law arid backgroundThe Social Security Act Amendments of 1980 require the Secreta'y ofI{HS to review 65 percent of favorable disability determinations made byState Disability Determination Services (DDSs) before the decision becomeseffective. The review applies to favorable decisions on initial claims, recon-siderations, and continuing disability investigations.Description of proposalThe proposal would require the Secretary to review 50 percent of DDSallowances and 25 percent of continuances. The 50 percent requirementwould apply both to initial claims and reconsiderations. To the extent feasi-ble, the reviews would focus on allowances and continuances that are likelyto be incorrect..5. Normalized TaxTransfersto the Trust FundsCurrent law arid backgroundThe Treasury credits the social secvirity trust funds at the beginning of themonth with the paymll tax revenues that it estimates will be received duringthe month. This practice, known as the normalized tax transfer, was institut-ed in 1983, when the trust funds had virtually no reserves and faced amonthly cash flow problem. While the trust funds earn additional interest asa result of this advance crediting, the social security trust funds reimbursethe Treasury each June and December for the loss of revenue from interestthe general fund would have received if the transfer had taken place on adaily basis. It is an even exchange of funds. In addition, however, advancedcrediting enables the social security trust funds to purchase bonds at the be-ginning of each month, giving the trust funds a wider investment portfolio.As a result, the trust funds are in a position to sell short-term, low interestbonds to meet their monthly benefit obligations and preserve their invest-ments in long-term, high interest bonds.Description of proposalThe proposal would eliminate the practice of crediting the trust funds inadvance and instead would return to a system of transferring social securitypayroll tax receipts on a daily basis as the Treasury receives them. TheSocial Security Administration's Office of the Actuary estimated in 1989that eliminating the normalized tax transfer would cost the trust funds be-tween $1004200 million per year in lost interest depending on economicassumptions. There would be no revenue loss within the unified budget be-cause the Treasury, as issuer of the bonds, would pay less interest.6. Benefits for Adopted ChildrenCurrent law arid backgroundA child adopted by the surviving spouse of a deceased worker must meetseveral tests in order to be entitled to benefits as a surviving adopted child.First, adoption proceedings must have been initiated prior to the worker'sdeath or the adoption must have beeti completed within 2 years of the work-er's death. Second, the child must have been living in the worker's homeand cannot have been receiving support fmm any source other than the 61worker and the spouse (i.e. a welfare agency) in the year prior to the work-er's death.Description of pPoposalThe proposal would change the support requirements to permit entitlementif the child eithr lived with the worker or received one-half support fromthe worker in the year prior to death. The requirements relating to the timingof the adoption are not changed.7. SSA Staffing(non-legislativeproposal)After six corsecutive years of staffing reductions, SSA has recentlyreached its goal pf reducing the size of the agency by 20 percent. The fiscalyear 1991 budget includes no further staff reductions. Rather, it proposes tostabilize agency staff at a level of 62,875 full-time equivalents (FFEs), amodest increase \u00f8f 375 positions over last year. RAILROAD RETIREMENT1. Privatization of Railroad RetirementCurrent law and backgroundThe railroad retirement system is a federally-administered retirement pro-gram that pays social security-type benefits (Tier 1) and private pension-typebenefits (Tier 2 and other benefits) to railroad workers and their families.Description of proposalThe proposal would privatize the railroad retirement system. Tier 1 bene-fits would be paid by the Social Security Administration. Tier 2 and otherbenefits would be converted to a privately-administered industry pension.2. Social Security Benefits for Railroad Retirement DependentsCurrent law and backgroundRailroad retirement Tier 1 benefits are in most cases identical to socialsecurity benefits and are computed under the social security benefit formula,However, benefits for certain dependent family members that would be pay-able if the worker had worked under social security are not paid at all underrailroad retirement. These dependents include the child of a retired or dis-abled worker, the retired divorced spouse of a railroad worker who has notyet retired, the spouse or divorced spouse of a disabled worker, and a sur-viving spouse who elects to withdraw pre-1974 taxes paid under railroad re-tirement in a lump sum rather than receiving monthly benefits. In addition,railroad retirement does not pay a lump sum death benefit if the recipient ofthe benefit is entitled to a railroad retirement benefit for the month of theworker's death.Description of proposalThe proposal would pay social security benefits to those family membersof railroad workers who do not receive benefits that they would be eligiblefor had the worker been employed under social security. (6) SOCIAL SECURITY AND BUDGET PROCESSThe President proposes to create a SocialSecurity Integrity and Debt Re-duction fund. Beginning in 1993, an amount equal to an increasing portionof the projected socialsecurityannual surplus (30 percent in fiscal year1993, 100 percent in fiscal year 1994 and thereafter) would be paid into thisfund from the general fund. The amount would be an outlay from the gener-al fund and would increase the size of the deficit. Gramm-Rudman-Hollings(GRH) targets would be extended to require balance in the unified budgetfor 1993 and thereaftet. Thus, additional deficit reduction equal to theamount of the payment into the debt reduction fund would be required eachyear ($17 billion in fisGal year 1993 and $62 billion in fiscal year 1994).The amounts in the fun1 would be used to reduce federal debt held by thepublic.The impact of the prdposal is to increase the amount of deficit reductionwhich must be accomplished to reach GRH targets. As under current law,the unified federal budget (including social security) would be balanced by1993, and thereafter any 'additional deficit reduction would retire federal debtand increase national savings. The amount of reserves in the social securitytrust funds would not tie affected. Because these trust funds remain on-budget, cuts or increases in social security benefits and taxes would becounted for purposes of reaching the GRH targets. (63) PART 3--READINGS Statement of Robert D. 1(eischauer, Director, Congressional Budget OfficeBefore the Committee on the Budget, U.S. House of RepresentativesJanuary 31, 1990 Mr.Chairman, I am p'eased to appear before the Committee thisafternoon to discuss the latest economic and budget projections of theCongressional Budget Office (CBO). These projections are described indetail in the CBO report titled The Economic and Budget Outlook:Fiscal Years 1991-1995,which is being released today. CBO forecasts that the U.S. economy will grow by almost 2 percentin 1990 and slightly faster next year. The restrictive monetary policythat was in force from 1987 through mid-1989 is still tending to slowthe economy, as will the tighter fiscal policy slated for 1990. TheFederal Reserve began to loosen monetary policy in June 1989, andCBO expects that it will continue to encourage lower interest rates formost of this year. CBQ forecasts that this policy will succeed inavoiding a recession in 1$90 without boosting inflation. CBO estimates that the federal budget deficit will fall from $152billion in fiscal year 1989 to $138 billion in 1990. Over the next fewyears, no further progress in reducing the deficit can be expected undercurrent budgetary policies. The Balanced Budget Act requires a deficitof $64 billion in 1991 ad a balanced budget in 1993. But withoutspending cuts or tax increases, the deficit in 1993 is likely to be nolower than in 1990. Figure 1 compares CBO's baseline budget projec-tions for 1990 through 195 with the statutory targets. (67) 81 Social Security Piojections The Balanced Btdget Act currently includes Social Security in itscalculations and makes Social Security subject to the same fiscaldiscipline as the rest of the budget. From an economic perspective, thisapproach makes sense.The purpose of reducing the deficit is toincrease national saving, which can spur economic growth and capitalformation. The federal budget deficit absorbs private saving, therebyimpairing the growth of living standards. The annual balance in theSocial Security programs affects national saving in exactly the sameway as the balance in any other government account. Thus, the mo8t appropriate measure of the impact of the federalbudget on the ecoromy is the total deficit, not any part of it. The totalgovernment deficit, including the Social Security and other trust 15 82 funds, determines the government's fiscal stance, its drainon creditmarkets, and the amount of saving that it diverts from uses thatpromote growth in living standards. Nevertheless, the Balanced Budget Act requires that the SocialSecurity trust funds be shown as off-budget to highlight theircontribution to the totals. With income of the trust funds exceedingbenefits and other costs, the Social Security surplus grows from $66billion in 1990 to $128 billion i 1995, as shown in Table 5. An TABLE 5.ON- AND OFF-BUDGET TOTALS(By fiscal year, in billions of dollars) Postal Service)RevenuesOutlaysDeficit7798288749249789841,0411,0951,1631,2202042122212392421,0371,283246Off.Budget(Social Service,which1. a1.o off-budget. 16 83 increasing amount of this surplus, however, reflects interestpaymentsreceived from the Treasury.Because these interestpayments aremerely intragovernmental transfers, they do not reduce thegovern-ment's need to borrow in the market.Excluding interest, SocialSecurity's contribution to holding down the total deficit looks muchsmaller--about $50 billion in 1990 and $78 billion in 1995. Sources of Growth in Spendg Baseline revenues and outlays are both projected to grow by $70 billionin 1991. Table 6 shows that $59 billion of the growth in outlaysoccursautomatically under current law. These built-in increases stem fromsuch factors as cost-of.living increses and growth of caseloads forSocial Security and otherretirement and disabilityprograms.Spending for Medicare and Medicaid, two of the fastest growingprograms, is driven up by increases in the price of medical care and bythe wider use of more expensive medical technologies. Net interestoutlays--arguably the least controllable component of spending--aredetermined by the government's deficit and by interest rates.

Another $6billion--almost 10 percent of the growth--is added by net interest.Other increases required tuder current law total $24 billion. Only $11billion of the projected increase in spending in 1991 stems fromdiscretionary increases in ippropriations that are assumed in the CBObaseline. The figures in Table 6 permit one to estimate the amount of deficitreduction required by Chairman Panetta's proposed Budget ProcessReform Act. Under the Chairman's proposal, the 1991 deficit wouldhave to be reduced by the amount of increases for inflation included inthe baseline, plus an additional $10 billion. In the CBO baseline,inflation increases other than Social Security cost-of-living adjust-ments total about $18 billion. The required deficit reduction in 1991would therefore total $28 billion, and the resulting deficit would be$110 billion. 20 [From \"The Economic and Budget Outlook: Fiscal Years 1990-1994,\" Congressional Budget Office, U.S. Government Printing Office, 1989]CHAPTER IIIIMPLICATIONS OF FEDERAL DEFICITSFOR ECONOMIC GROWTH New attention is being devoted to the outlook for living standards inthe United States over the next half century. Economic projections bythe Social Security trustees and other analysts show a substantial slowing in the growth of such measures as output and consumptionper capita. In large part, the slowdown is caused by the projected ef-fects of the retirement of the \"baby-boom\" generation early in the next century: a smaller part of the population will be working then, andtheir output will have to be shared with the larger population of re- tirees. Observers are worried by this outlook for several reasons:it means that future generations of Americans may inherit a lower rateof growth in living standards than their forebears enjoyed; and, on a more practical level, that social and political strains may arise between workers and retirees.Faster economic growth would head off many of these problems, since it would increase the amount of goods and services available to be shared. The search for ways to make the economy grow faster has focused on national saving, which is put forward as an importantfactor in determing long-run economic growth. An increase in savingraises investment, which in turn increases productive capacity. Oneway to increase national saving and investment would be to reducethe federal deficit.This chapter reviews the part played by public and private savingin determining economic growth, and the contributions deficit reduc-tion might make to improving the current outlook for growth. The chapter reaches three main conclusions: oA decline in saving, both by the private sector and by thefederal government, has contributed to the prospective long-term decline in the economic growth rate;oReduction of the federal deficit is the most promising way to increase saving; an increase in private saving seems unlike-(95) 96 80ThE ECONOMIC AND BUDGET OUTLOOK January 1989 lyto occur by itself, and in any case cannot be directly con-trolled by policymakers; oSaving and investment in the long run will be most affectedby the overall deficit, not by components of the deficit suchas the Social Security surplus.The technical discussion in this chapter cannot disguise the factthat reducing the deficit for the benefit of later generations is ulti-mately a political choice. It means making some sacrifice of consump-tion now for the sake of higher consumption later. Economic analysiscan only help inform that choice; it is up to the voting public to decidewhether the future benefits pictured by the analysis in this report jus-tify the sacrifices they would entail.Other factors besides falling saving and the retirement of thebaby-boom generation contribute significantly to the projected declinein economic growth, but are not discussed in detail in this chapter. Inparticular, growth in the proportion of the population in the laborforce, especially women, is expected to slow. The economically activeproportion of the population is projected to decline and remain low byhistorical standards even after the \"baby-boom bulge\" of retirees haspassed from the scene. Growth in productivity, finally, has alreadyslowed significantly, and may not return to earlier rates. Policymeasures--such as changes in the age of eligibility for Social Securityretirement benefits--could make a difference to some of these pro-spective developments.Reducing the federal deficit could have several additional bene-fits, which also are not the focus of this chapter. It could, for example,reduce interest rates and thus improve prospects for many interest-sensitive sectors in the United States as well as benefiting debt-burdened countries abroad; it could reduce the trade deficit, and withit the inflows of foreign capital to the United States; and it couldreduce the likelihood of sharp swings in financial markets.In order to describe the implications of deficit reduction for thegrowth of living standards over long periods, this chapter uses certainsimplifying assumptions that set it apart from traditional short-runeconomic analyses of fiscal policy. In particular, the analysis supposesthat changes in the deficit and in other components of U.S. flows of 97 CHAPTER LU IMPLICATIONS OF FEDERAL DEFICITS 81 saving and dissaving are immediately reflected in changes in invest-ment and, therefore, in productive capital and in potential grossnational product (GNP). This type of analysis takes no account ofbusiness cycles, which could affect the conclusion that all saving givesrise to changes in capital. Similarly, the chapter does not take accountof the role of the budget deficit in stabilizing the economy. Instead, itimagines that the economy is quite stable at high-employment levelsof output and that fiscal policy therefore primarily affects the divisionof national output between consumption and investment, rather thanstabilizing the economy. 100 84 THE ECONOMIC AND BUDGET OUTLOOK January 1989 RECENT TRENDS IN NATIONAL SAVING AND INVESTMENT 104 88THE ECONOMIC ANDBUDGETOUTLOOK January1989 Effectsof Social Security. Increases in expected Social Security bene-fits may reduce private saving, but it seems unlikely that this effecthas been significant in explaining the downward trend. Such an effectcould occur because households with large expected Social Securitybenefits do not need to save as much on their own to achieve a givenstandard of living in retirement. This effect may be offset, however,by the lure of early retirement in a generous system. if householdsplan retirement earlier in life, the need to save may actually rise.These conflicting effects of Social Security \"wealth\" on savinghave been tested in empirical work, and the results are inconclusive.6A relatively large number of economists believe the effect of SocialSecurity wealth on saving is negative, but such an effect would helpexplain the recent decline in saving only if expected benefits had risen 6.See SheldonDanziger, RobertHaveman,and Robert Plotnick. \"How Income Transfer ProgramsAffect Work. Savings, and the Income Distribution: A Critical Review.\" Journal of Econom&cLifrrature (September 1981); Martin Felds.ein. \"Social Security. Induced Retirement, andAggregate Wealth Accumulation.\" Journal of Political Economy (September 1974); and Henry .1.Aaron. Economic Effects of Social Security (Washington. D.C.: Brookings Institution, 1982). 105 CHAPTERm IMPLICATIONS OF FEDERAL DEFICITS 89 dramatically relative to expected payroll taxes in the 1980s.But re- cent legislation has raised Social Security taxes and slowed real bene- fit growth, so net Social Security wealth has fallen from itslevelof a decade ago. Moreover, lower expectations of long-run growth in real wages may have further diminished the influence of Social Securitywealth on saving. 111 CHAPTER III IMPLICATIONS OF FEDERAL DEFICITS 95 FISCAL POLICY ANDTHE FINANCING OFSOCIAL SECURITYThe improvement in futureliving standards that wouldresult from a shift in fiscal policytoward surplus has thus far been discussed inde- pendently of the mechanismby which that surplus would be achieved. In fact, significant shiftsare likely to take place in the makeup of fed- eral revenues and spending,even if the overall surplus is unchanged.In current projections, forexample, the Social Securitytrust funds will run large surpluses in the next few decades, but will latergo into defi- cit as the baby boom retires.Assuming a constant surplus in the over- all budget implies thatthe non-Social Securitybudget offsets this pattern by running large deficits in the next few decades,followed by surpluses when the baby boom retires.As stressed throughout thischapter, only a change in the govern- ment's ouerafl budgetary position will significantly affect future sav- ing and investment: neitherthe projected Social Securitytrust fund buildup nor the balancein the non-Social Securitybudget affects the outlook for these variablesexcept insofar as it helps determine the overall budget balance. The financing of Social Security does, how- ever, affect the equity with which the tax burden is distributedamong younger and older taxpayers, and among taxpayers of different income levels; it may also affectincentives to work andsave. 112 96 THE ECONOMIC AND BUDGET OUTLOOK January1989 Methods of Social Security FinancingThrough much of its history, Social Security operated as a \"pay-as-you-go\" system. In general, the trust funds' receipts roughly matchedthe benefits being paid out. Changes in the asset positions of the SocialSecurity trust funds--more specifically, the Old-Age and Survivors In-surance (OASI) and Disability Insurance (DI) trust funds--primarilyreflected the Congress's goal of insulating the system from businesscycles. More recently, under aniencirnents enacted in 1977 and 1983,Social Security has shifted to what is sometimes called a \"partialadvanced funding\" mechanism, whereby revenues collected exceedbenefits paid for a period of time, resulting in substantial interestearnings designed to supplement other revenues.Under the current partial advanced funding mechanism, theSocial Security trust funds are projected to collect substantially morein revenues than they are expected to pay in benefits until at least thebeginning of the retirement of the baby-boom generation in about2010.\" In the interim, the most commonly used projections of theSocial Security AdrninistrEltion indicate that trust fund assets--claimson future resources--will grow rapidly, from slightly over $100 billion(about 2 percent of GNP) at the end of 1988 to about $9.1 trillion(about 29 percent of GNP) by the year 2020. By that time, federal taxrevenues for Sociil Security will not cover program outlays, but inter-est payments on the trust funds' accumulated reserves will be morethan sufficient to offset the revenue shortfall, and the surplus will stillbe positive. Ten years 'ater, however, the large reserve is expected tobegin diminishing as trust fund securities are redeemed, and it shouldbe depleted by 2048.The large buildup and subsequent decline in the Social Securitytrust funds projected under the current partial advanced paymentscheme, when viewed in the context of a fixed overall deficit and gov-ernment spending policy, will shift the composition of federal receipts 11The 1988 annualreports olthe tr1stees olthe OldAge and 5urvivors Insurance and the DisabilityInsurancetrustfundspresent estimates of the financial operations of the funds overthe next 75yearsunder four different sets of economic and demographic assumptions Under the mostpessimistic assumptions, annuall surpluses persist through about the year 2015.

There will be heavy reliance on payroll taxes for the next three decades as the trust funds (which rely heavily on payroll taxes) accumulate a surplus and invest it in Trea- sury securities. After that, the government will have to redeem the trust funds' securities using general revenues, and as a result there will be a shift toward other forms of revenue--most likely, the income tax--as the baby-boom generation retires.The current partial advanced funding system involves higher pay- roll taxes during the next few decades compared with a pay-as-you-go system, but lower payroll taxes later. The advanced funding approach uses its payroll tax receipts to build up reserves until early in the twenty-first century; if apay-as-you-go approach were substituted,lower rates would be possible because no buildup in reserves would be needed during this period. On the other hand, payroll tax rates would have to be raised by 2020 under the pay-as-you-go approach to cover high benefit payments whenthe baby-boom retirement begins in earnest. This increase would not be necessary under partial advanced funding, since benefitpayments under that approach would be paid bydrawing down reserves.The federal government would nevertheless have to raise funds under the partial advanced funding approach to redeem the trust funds' securities after 2020. The method that the government chose to raise these funds, when compared with the payroll tax involved in the pay-as-you-go approach, could affect equity among generations and among individuals at different income levels, as well as incentives to work and save. Since most non-Social Security revenues are currently drawn from the individual income tax, most analyses of the equity of the two systems are basedon comparisons of the payroll tax and theincome tax. uity Considerations in Social Security FinancingIf funds to redeem trust fund securities under partial advanced fund- ing were raised through increases in income tax rates, more of the burden would fall on older people than under the pay-as-you-goap- proach. The difference would likely be relatively slight, however. 114 98 THE ECONOMIC AND BUDGET OUTLOOK January 1989 The burden of the pay-as-you-go approach would be likely to faflmore heavily on people atlower incomes than that of the partia'advanced funding approach when the baby-boom generation retires.Here again, however, the effect might be slight. Economists generallyagree that payroll taxes fail more heavily on low-wage workers thandoes the income tax, and this accounts for the more regressive natureof the pay-as-you-go system early in the next century. Incentive Effects of Social Security FinancingThe choice between the pay-as-you-go approach and partia' advancedfunding also affects the disincentives to work and save that are em-bodied in the tax system. Higher payroll taxes under pay-as-you-gowould reduce the return from working, but only for workers at wagekvels below the wage ceiling of the tax. After-tax wages wou'd behigher under the partial advanced funding approach with higherincome tax rates, but the return from saving would be lower. Thiseffect occurs because the higher tax burden under this approach wou'dfafl kss heavily on wages and more heavily on property income. CONCLUSIONSUnder current projections, a smaller share of the population will beworking in the United States in the next century. This change impliesa slowdown in overalleconomic growth, with the working populationreceiving a smaller share of total output. Fiscal policy, through its ef-fects on national saving and investment, can offset these trends some-what and improve the living standards of future generations, thoughthe change would require less consumption in the near term.The extent to which increasing saving now would raise livingstandards in the future cannot be stated with certainty, since the out-come would depend crucially on the uncertain relationship betweensaving and total factor productivity. If total factor productivity growsindependently of saving, the contribution of saving to output growthwould be relatively small.If, on the other hand, saving increasesgrowth in productivity as some evidence suggests, the reward to sav-ing may be substantial.Accepting the mid-range of these possi- 115 CHAPTER In IMPLICATIONS OF FEDERAL DEFICITS 99bilities, if the federal budgetwere to move permanently to a surplus of 2 percent of GNP, consumption per person would increase by 8 percent in the long run--though there would first be a period of five to ten years during which the average person's consumption would be lower than if saving had not beenincreased.The policy of allocatingrevenues toward the Social Security trustfunds, enacted in 1977 and1983, does not representan increase in national saving.It does, however, implya shift in taxation toward wages in the near term. By the year 2030, taxes will have to shift back to other forms of incomeas the accumulated trust funds are drawndown. The demographic shift toward a smaller work force in relation to the population also complicates the issue. Current fiscal policy will create the framework in which future policymakers must make their decisions.0 26\u2014300(128) 101ST CONGRESS 12dSessionCOMMIVEE PRINT{S.PRT.101\u201482 1991Finance Committee ReportUnder theCongressional Budget ActPrepared by the Staff for the Use of theCOMMITTEE ON FINANCEUNITED STATES SENATELloyd Bentsen, Chairman ERUAR' 1990 Printed for the use of the Committee on Finance U.S. GOVERNMENTPRINTINGOFFICEWASHINGTON: 1990 For a1e by the Superintendent of Documents, Congressiona!Sates OfficeUS.Government PrintingOffice.Washington.

For each fiscal year between now and FY 1993, the Act establishes maximum deficit amounts as $64 billion; FY92 $28 billion. A $10 bil-lion tolerance level is established for each of these years. For FY93, the act specifies a zero deficit as the maximum deficit amount and provides no tolerance. If Congress fails to meet the specified goal for any of these years, an automatic deficit reduction procedure (called \"sequestration\") will go into effect.The Congressional Budget Act, as amended, has a number of ef- fects on the consideration of legislation handled by the Committee on Finance. Major provisions affecting the Committee include:1. Letter to Budget Committee.\u2014By February 25 of each year, the Finance Committee must submit a report to the Budget Committee estimating the effect that Finance Committee legislation will have on expenditures, revenues, and the debt limit during the next fiscalyear, and presenting the Committee's views and estimates with re- spect to such expenditures revenues, and the debt limit. For the current year, the deadline for submitting this report has been ex- tended to March 9 to allow additional time to consider the budget submissions of the Administration. (The report submitted for the 1st Session of the 101st Congress appears as Appendix A of this document.)2. Timing restrictionson tax and spending bills.\u2014Certain kindsof legislation may not be considered prior to the adoption by Con- gress of the Budget Resolution. This restriction applies to most of the legislation considered by the Finance Committee: revenue and debt limit changes for the upcoming fiscal year and legislation in- creasing expenditures in such areas as social security and welfare.3. Budget allocation reports.\u2014After the adoption of a budget reso- lution by the Congress, the Finance Committee is required to file an allocation report showing how the aggregate spending authorityassumed in the budget resolution for all Finance Committee pro- grams will be subdivided. This subdivision can be by program or by(1) 2subcommittee. A point of order will lie against any bill or amend-ment affecting Finance Committee spending program jurisdiction ifthe allocation report hasnotbeen filed or if it is inconsistent withthe proposed legislation. Also, for non-trust fund entitlement pro-grams, bills reported from the Finance Committee could be subjectto 15-day referrals to the Appropriations Committee if they havenot been provided for in an allocation report. As it acts on legisla-tion throughout the year, the Committee can file revised allocationreports.4. Resolution totals binding.\u2014By April 15, Congress is requiredto complete action on the concurrent budget resolution for thecoming fiscal year setting appropriate revenue, spending, and deficit levels. For the duration of the Gramm-RudmanHol1ings 1egis1ation, the budget resolution must set a deficit which is no greater(but can be smaller) than the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings maximumdeficit amounts described above. After the resolution is adopted,points of order can be raised against bills or amendments whichwould cause its overall spending ceiling to be exceeded, or wouldcause revenues to fall below its revenue floor, or would cause theGramm-Rudman-Hollings maximum deficit amount to be breached.5. Reconcjljatjon.\u2014The budget resolution can require the Fi-nance Committee to report \"reconciliation\" legislation by a speci-fled date to raise taxes or cut back on spending programs withinthe committee's jurisdiction. Such legislation is considered underspecial procedures which establish automatic time limits for consideration and prohibit nongermane amendments. The Budget Actschedule calls for Congress to complete action on reconciliation leg-islation by June 15.6. Sequestration.\u2014If the overall impact of spending and revenuelegislation enacted by Congress and the President does not reducethe deficit sufficiently to meet th GrammRudmanHollings target(with the $10 billion tolerance), a \"sequestration process is trig-gered under which nonexempt spending programs are reduced byamounts sufficient to bring the deficit down to the target (withoutany tolerance). Half the savings must come from domestic pro-grams and half from defense. Within each category, all non-exemptprograms must be uniformly reduced. For the most part, entitle-ment programs are exempt from sequestration although Medicarepayments would be reduced by not more than 2 percent. The decision as to whether a sequestration is required is made by the Direc-tor of 0MB based on the situatiom prevailing on October 15.THE BUDGET PROCESS1. Key ConceptsFederal Budget.\u2014There are two separate and distinct Federalbudgets: the President's budget and the Congressional budget.In early January of each year, the President submits to the Con-gress his budget plan for the fiscal year which will start on the fol-lowing October 1. The President's budget not only sets forth theoverall levels of spending and revenues that he recommends butalso contains a detailed listing of how much he estimates and pro-poses for each individual program of government. 3The Congressional budget is a concurrent resolution reportedfrom the House and Senate Budget Committees and adopted by theCongress. Unlike the President's budget, it does not include de-tailed programmatic budget levels. Instead it establishes overallbudget aggregates: total revenues, total outlays, total budget au-thority. The budget resolution does include a breakdown of thespending totals by broad functional categories such as \"national de-fense,\" \"agriculture,\" etc., but these are not binding.Both the President's budget and the congressional budget are es-sentially planning documents designed to guide the Congress as itworks on the separate pieces of legislation (tax, entitlement, andappropriations bills) which actually determine the amount of Fed-eral spending and revenues and the extent of budgetary deficit orsurplus.Baseline.\u2014Both the President's budget and the Congressionalbudget set forth plans as to what the ultimate levels of taxes,spending, and deficit or surplus should be for the fiscal year afterthe impact of any legislative changes which may be enacted. Inorder to determine how much of a change in law or policy is re-quired to reach the budgetary goals, it is necessary to compare thebudget plan with a \"baseline\" budget which represents the con-tinuation of current law and policy. A baseline would generallyassume continuation of entitlement programs and revenue lawswithout substantive change and the enactment of discretionary ap-propriations at a level which permits the continuation of existingpolicies. Ordinarily, in order to construct a baseline that representsa continuation of existing policy, an inflation factor would be ap-plied to discretionary appropriations. At the present time, thebudget process uses three different baselines: the CBO baselinewhich projects spending and revenues using economicand assumptions, the 0MB \"current services\" baselinewhich the Administration's economic and technical as-sumptions, and the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings baseline. The GRHbaseline is similar to the 0MB \"current services\" baseline, but itfollows certain statutory specification in the GRH legislation and isused to determine how much deficit reduction is needed to avoidsequestration. BASELINEFOR FISCAL YEAR 1991[un billions of GRH baseline calcu'ation does not assume reauthorization of the Food Stamp program as wefl as otherprobablechangesandisthereforesomewhatmisieadingasanindicationofrequireddeficitreduction. 4Spending Authority.\u2014Federal laws which control the expendi-ture of Federal funds can be generically referred to as \"spendingauthority.\" Some of the more significant types of spending author-ity are:DISCRETIONARY APPROPRIATIONSFor many programs, the amount of spending is controlled bythe annual appropriations process. This is the case with re-spect to the administrative costs of Federal agencies such asIRS, the Social Security Administration, and the CustomsBureau. For most Finance Committee programs, however,actual programmatic costs are not controlled by annual appro-priations acts. (Exceptions to this rule are the Child WelfareServices program andi the Maternal and Child Health pro-gram.)ENTITLEMENTSIn general, most Finance Committee spending programs areentitlements. From a budgetary perspective, this means thatthe actual control of spending levels is exercised by the sub-stantive legislation under the jurisdiction of this Committeerather than by annual appropriations acts. There are two typesof entitlements: direct spending entitlements such as social se-curity which do not require annual appropriations becausetheir funding is based on a permanent appropriation and \"ap-propriated entitlements\" such as Medicaid and the program ofaid to families with dependent children. The costs of these pro-grams are controlled by the substantive legislation, but theirfunding is nevertheless included, as a mandatory or nondiscre-tionary item, in annual appropriations bills.Outlays.\u2014Although Congress exercises control over spending byenacting, modifying, or repealing various forms of \"spending au-thority, the annual deficit or surplus is determined by comparingrevenues and outlays. Outlays take place when the spending au- thority actually results in the expenditure of funds. In some pro-grams (for example, defense procurement activities), there can be major differences between spending authority and outlays. Forpractical purposes, however, Finance Committee programs are as-sumed to have annual outlays equal to annual spending authority(which is not the same as \"budget authority\").Treatment of Social Security and Medicare.\u2014Public Laws 98-21and 99\u2014177 established special rules for the budgetary treatment ofthe Old-age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI) and theHospital Insurance (HI) programs. Effective starting in FY 1993 forHI and effective starting with FY 1986 for the OASDI program,current law requires that the expenditures and revenues of theseprograms be excluded in computing budgetary totals for purposesof both the President's budget and the Congressional Budget. Atthe same time, however, the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings statutespecifies that the income and outgo of the OASDI program is to beincluded in determining whether or not the GRH targets are met.Since the current budget process focuses heavily on the attainmentof the GRH targets, most budgetary displays show combined (or 5\"unified\") totals which include the impact of social security. Strict-ly speaking, however, OASDI is \"off-budget.\"In addition, the Budget Act provides that reconciliation legisla-tion will be subject to a point of order if i.t includes any provisionsaffecting the OASDI program.2. Outline of Congressional Budget ProcessBy April 1 of each year, the Senate Budget Committee is re-quired to report to the Senate a concurrent resolution which is, ineffect, a congressional budget document setting forth appropriatelevels of spending, revenues, and public debt for the coming fiscalyear. The spending levels are, for informational purposes, brokendown into broad functional categories (such as \"health,\" \"incomesecurity,\" \"national defense\"). The recommendations in the resolu-tion reported by the Budget Committee are subject to debate andamendment.When agreed to by the House and the Senate (which is requiredto happen by April 15), the budget resolution represents congres-sional judgment of the appropriate fiscal situation for the comingyear. The resolution is intended to guide the development of legis-lation providing for taxes and spending, and such legislation can besubject to points of order if it is inconsistent with meeting the over-all revenue and spending totals in the resolution.The budget resolution also may include \"reconciliation\" instruc-tions to direct the appropriate committees to report legislationchanging spending, revenue, or debt limit levels. Upon adoption byCongress of the resolution, committees affected by such instruc-tions must report legislation meeting the spending or revenuetotals in the instructions. This legislation is then debated by Con-gress as part of a reconciliation bill under special expedited proce-dures. Action on this reconciliation bill is to be completed by June15.3. Waiver of Rules Regarding Budget ProcedureSome of the rules applicable to Senate procedures under the Con-gressional Budget Act can be waived by a majority vote of theSenate. Others require a vote of three-fifths of the full Senatemembership (60 votes). In addition, the act includes a specialwaiver procedure in connection with the provisions requiring thatrevenue, debt limit, and spending bills (including social security,welfare, etc.) not be acted on before the adoption of the budget res-olution. If a committee wished to have such legislation consideredoutside of the prescribed time, it would report out a resolution pro-viding for waiver of the rule. This resolution would be referred tothe Budget Committee, which would have 10 days in which to con-sider and make its recommendations with respect to the waiver.Once the resolution is reported by the Budget Committee (or after10 days in any case), the resolution of waiver would be voted on bythe Senate. If it were approved, the Senate could then proceed toconsider the legislation. 64. Impact of the Budget Act on Finance CommitteeLEGISLATION WHICH RESULTS IN ADDITIONAL FEDERAL SPENDINGAnnual report to Budget Committee.\u2014Each year, prior to the con-sideration of the concurrent resolution on the budget, each commit-tee is required to make a report to the Budget Committee present-ing its views and estimates concerning spending under its jurisdic-tion during the coming fiscal year (and the following two fiscalyears). By statute this report is due no later than February 25. Thisyear the reporting date has been postponed to March 9.Allocation report after adoption of budget resolution.\u2014The con-ference report on each budget resolution allocates the outlay andbudget authority totals among the various committees. Each com-mittee is then required, after consultation with the appropriatecounterpart committee in the House of Representatives, to subdi-vide its allocation of new budget authority and outlays among theprograms under its jurisdiction or among its subcommittees. Theseallocations subsequently serve as the basis for scorekeeping reportsand for judging whether particular legislative proposals are consist-ent with the budget resolution. Bills and amendments involvingspending may not be considered until the committee with jurisdic-tion over that spending program has filed its allocation report, andpoints of order may be raised against bills or amendments whichare not accommodated in these allocation reports.Limitation on consideration of spending bills.\u2014The Congression-al Budget Act provides that bills involving appropriated entitle-ment programs (such as welfare or Medicaid) and bills directly in-creasing spending authority (such as social security or unemploy-ment insurance) may not be considered in the Senate prior to theadoption of the concurrent budget resolution. This requirementmay be waived under the special waiver procedure or by a majorityvote of the Senate to suspend this rule. In addition, entitlementlegislation (other than trust fund legislation) reported after Janu-ary 1 of any year may not have an effective date prior to October 1of that year.Impact of concurrent budget resolutions on legislation.\u2014The con-current resolution, which is to be passed by April 15, not only setsappropriate spending levels but may direct the committees havingjurisdiction over spending legislation to report reconciliation legis-lation to rescind previously enacted spending authority so as tobring spending for the coming fiscal year within the levels deter-mined to be appropriate. In the case of the Committee on Finance,in order to meet such a requirement that the committee couldreport legislation to defer or reduce benefits under entitlement pro-grams, including both trust fund programs (such as unemploymentinsurance or Medicare) and non-trust-fund programs (such as wel-fare, social services or Medicaid). Reconciliation legislation may notinclude changes in the Social Security programs of Old-Age, Survi-vors and Disability Insurance (OASDI).After the adoption of the budget resolution for a fiscal year, newspending measures for that fiscal year would be subject to a pointof order if they would cause the spending limits in the concurrentresolution to be exceeded or would cause the deficit for the fiscalyear to exceed the maximum deficit amount. In the case of the 7Committee on Finance, thislimitation would apply toentitlement legislation dealing with bothtrust fund and non-trust-fund pro- grams. (A new or revised budget resolution could, however, be passed to authorize such additional spending, or the rule could be waived by a three-fifths vote of the Senate.) The budget totals included in the resolutionare mandatory, es- tablishing firm guidelines within which the Congress considers leg- islation affecting spending. Thus, if unrealistic assumptionsor ob- jectives are used in setting the budget resolution totals,committees may subsequently find their ability to act on desired legislation im- paired.Appropriations Committee review of certain entitlement bills.\u2014- Legislation in suchareas as supplemental security income, welfare, social services, or Medicaidcreates an entitlement topayments on the part of individualsor State or local governments even though these programsare funded through appropriations acts. The Con- gressional Budget Act requires that any future legislation which would create new entitlement programs or increase existing ones must be referred to the Appropriations Committee for a period of 15 days after it is reportedby the substantive committee, if its en- actment would exceed theamount provided for in the committee'sallocation of its spendingauthority under the mostrecent budget resolution. The Appropriations Committee could not recommend any substantive changes in the legislation (e.g., lower individual benefit amounts), but itcould recommendan amendment to limit the total amount of fundingavailable for the legislation. If such an amendment is approved bythe Senate, the substantive committee might have to proposea further amendment to conform the legisla-tion to that funding limit.The requirement ofreferral to the Appropriations Committee would not apply to legislation affecting existing Social Security Act trust fund programsor other trust fund programs substantiallyfunded through earmarkedrevenues. It would also not apply to leg-islation amendingor extending the generalrevenue sharing pro- gram to the extent that such legislation included an exemption from that requirement.In the past, refundabletax credits were treated for purposes of the congressional budgetprocess as revenue reductions. Under re- vised procedures adoptedin 1978, the budgetprocess now treats the refundable aspects of suchcredits as \"outlays\" thus bringing them within the scope of theabove described provisions related to Appro- priations Committee reviewof entitlement bills. In addition, the authority previously usedfor disbursing the refundablepart of tax credits has been thepermanent appropriation for tax refunds. Thispermanent appropriationwas amended in 1978 so as to requireannual appropriations for this purpose in the case of any new pro- grams of this type whichmay be enacted.Report on spending legislation\u2014The Budget Act requires the committee, in reporting legislation involving increased spending, to include in the report information showing how that spending com- pares with the amount of spending provided for in the most recent budget resolution. In addition, if this information is provided by the Congressional BudgetOffice (CBO) ona timely basis, the report must also include CBO projections showing the extent to which the 8legislation provides financial aid to States and localities and a pro-jection for five fiscal years of the spending which will result fromthe legislation. This requirement also applies to conference reports,if the information is provided by CBO on a timely basis.LEGISLATION RELATING TO REVENUES AND DEBT LIMITAnnual report to the Budget Committee.\u2014The annual report tothe Budget Committee which is described above also must, in thecase of the Finance Committee, present its views and estimateswith regard to revenues and the debt limit.No revenue legislation prior to adoption of the budget resolu-tion.\u2014Under the Budget Act, debt limit or revenue legislation forthe upcoming fiscal year is not in order for consideration by theSenate (or House) prior to the adoption of the resolution on thebudget. This rule does not prevent action on revenue changes to beeffective in years after the upcoming fiscal year. (A procedure forwaiving this limitation is provided for; the rule could also be sus-pended by a majority vote of the Senate.)The wording of this provision of the Budget Act is not entirelyclear. In 1978, the Senate Budget Committee adopted the positionthat this restriction required that there be no increase or decreasein revenues to become effective in the next fiscal year for which nobudget resolution had been adopted. In other words, under this in-terpretation, there would always be one \"closed year\" for which norevenue change could beconsidered. Consequently, a point of orderwas raised during theconsideration of the 1978 tax cut bill (H.R.13511) against an amendment by Senator Roth on the grounds thatit provided for a revenue change effective in fiscal year 1980. (Thefirst budget resolution for fiscal year 1980 would not have beenadopted until approximately May 15, 1979.) The position of the Fi-nance Committee was thatthis restriction in the Budget Act onlyapplied from the beginning of the calendar year, when the processof developing the fiscal 1980 budget resolution has begun. Oncethat resolution has been approved, revenue changes may be consid-ered throughout the remainder of the calendar year which wouldbe effective for the fiscal year to which the resolution applies andfor any future fiscal year.The point of order raised by the Budget Committee was sus-tained by the Chair, but the ruling of the Chair was overturned bythe Senate on a vote of 38 to 48. This occurred on October 5, 1978.Impact of a budget resolution.\u2014As with spending measures, theconcurrent resolution adopted in mid-April sets mandatory levelsfor revenue and debt limit legislation, and may direct the Commit-tee on Finance to report reconciliation legislation to achieve thechanges in aggregate revenues or in the debt limit which the Con-gress determined to beappropriate. Such legislation would have tobe reported in time to be included in the reconciliation bill whichis to be acted upon by June 15.Once a budget resolution is adopted by the Congress, any legisla-tion which would cause the total revenues to be reduced below thelevels specified in the budget resolution would be subject to a pointof order. If the budget resolution sets a revenue target which exact-ly matches the projected revenues under existing law (or any ex-pected modifications to existing law), even minor bills having 9nearly negligible revenue impacts can be rejected on a point of order. If the resolution includes goals based on unrealistic assump- tions about revenue increases, the committee will face points of order against the consideration of any revenue reducing legislation. Required report on tax expenditures.\u2014The Budget Act defines the term \"tax expenditures\" to include any revenue losses attributable to tax provisions such as income exclusions, tax credits or defer- rals, or preferential tax rates. The law requires that the committee report accompanying legislation to provide new or increased tax ex- penditures include a projection by CBO (if timely received) as to how such legislation will affect the level of tax expenditures under existing law. The report will also have to include (to the extent practicable) a projection of the tax expenditures resulting from the legislation over a period of five years. This requirement also ap- plies to conference reports. CHARTS AND DESCRIPTIONS (11) 12Chart 1 Reportto Budget Committee Viewsand estimatesof Finance Expenditures2. Tax expenditures4. Public Debt Relatingbothtoexisting law and proposals tochange existing law Chart 1Report to Budget CommitteeUnder the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, as amended, the Committee on the Budget isrequired by April 1 of eachyear to report to the Senate a concurrent resolution on the budget which is,in effect, a proposedcongressional budget document setting forth appropriate levels of Federal expenditure and revenue,sur- plus or deficit, and relatedmatters. To assist the Budget Commit.tee in making the judgments necessary to develop such a budget,the Act also mandates thateach committee send to the Budget Committee its views and estimates on those aspects of the budget which fall within its jurisdiction. This report is due by February 25 of each year. For 1990, thisdeadline has been changedto March 9. In the case of the Committee on Finance, the report to the Budget Committee mustcover the expenditure programs under Fi-nance Committee jurisdiction which are listed on chart 5, Federal revenues, tax expenditures, and the public debt. With respect to each of these matters, thecommittee is required to provide its views and estimatesas to the levels anticipated under existing law or under any changes to existing law which the committee expects. The period to be covered bythe report to the Budget Committee is fiscal year 1991 (and forplanning purposes, fiscalyears 1992 and 1993). The reportsent to the Budget Committee in 1989 is reprint- ed in Appendix A.Section 301(c) of the BudgetAct, which deals with the February25 report to the BudgetCommittee, is included in the excerpts from that Act whichappear in Appendix B.

These differences can reflect divergent viewpoints as tohow the economy will operate and as to the type of legislation thatmay be enacted and its effect on the operations of the economy.Different programs are particularly sensitive to different aspectsof the economy. For example, expenditures under social securityare sensitive to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) since that programincludes an automatic cost-of-living increase provision. The unem-ployment insurance program does not incorporate such a provisionbut is, of course, particularly sensitive to the amount of unemploy-ment.Revenues, similarly, are strongly affected by the level of personalincome and of corporate profits, and, in the case of payroll tax rev- enues, by wages and salaries. In addition, trends in interest rates,the rate of inflation, and the size of the budget deficit affect thecost of interest on the public debt.In developing the Congressional budget, the Congress has mostfrequently used the economic assumptions of the CongressionalBudget Office. In as much as the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings legisla-tion is based upon determinations made by the Office of Manage-ment and Budget (0MB), the Congress in 1989 used the 0MB eco-nomic assumptions which were the basis for the President's budget.This chart shows the major economic assumptions underlying thebudget as submitted by President Bush in January and also thosewhich have been adopted by CBO. In general, the CBO assumptionsproject somewhat slower economic growth, higher inflation and in-terest rates, and higher unemployment levels. (15) Chart 3.\u2014THE OVERALL BUDGET[In billions BudgetIn considering its legislative plans for the upcoming year, the Committee may find it useful to look at the overall budget totalsunder a continuation of current tax and spending policies and alsounder the budget proposed by the President.Because of differing economic and technical assumptions, 0MBand CBO project somewhat different budgetary totals under a con- tinuation of current policies. For fiscal year 1991, the CBO projec-tion would indicate a need for $74 billion in deficit reduction inorder to meet the $64 billion deficit required by the EmergencyDeficit Reduction and Budget Control Act (\"Gramm-Rudman-Hol-lings\"). The 0MB current services projections would show a need for $37 billion in deficit reduction to meet that target.Present law requires that the income and outlays of the socialsecurity cash benefit trust fund programs be excluded from thebudget totals. However, these items are added back in to determine whether or not the \"Gramm-Rudman-Hollings\" targets are met. This chart shows the overall budget totals under the budget sub-mitted by the President and also under a continuation of current policy as estimated in the CBO baseline and in the 0MB current services budgets.

Chart 5Major Expenditure Programs Under Finance CommitteeJurisdictionThis chart lists the majorprograms involving an expenditure ofFederal funds whichcome within the legislative jurisdiction of the Committee on Finance. Each of these programs is covered in more detail in the following charts. Interest on the public debt is includ- ed as an expenditureprogram since it constitutes a significant part of the Federal budgeteven though the level of expenditure is not subject to legislative control in the same sense as expenditures under the other programs listed.Under a revision in the Congressional budget procedures adopted in the 95th Congress, refundable tax credits are treatedas revenue items insofar as theyserve to reduce tax liability and as \"outlay\" items insofaras they exceed tax liability. For this reason, the earned income tax credit is shown here as an expenditureprogram.

Chart 6Social Security Cash Benefit (OASDI) Trust Funds:Financial Status and Relationshipto the BudgetThe social security cashbenefit programs, Old-Ageand Survivors Insurance (OASI) and Disability Insurance (DI), provideincome protection to people who work in employment coveredby social se- curity and earna certain minimum number of \"quarters of cover- age\". The OASIprogram pays benefits to eligible workers age 62or older and theirspouses and children, and to surviving spouses and children of deceased workers. The DI programpays benefits to dis- abled workers and to theirspouses and children.The Administrationestimates that onaverage in fiscal year 1991 a total of 35.8 million individuals will receive monthlysocial securi- ty benefits from the OldAge and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund, as retired workers or their dependents, or as survivors of deceased workers. In addition,some 4.2 million individuals will receive bene- fits from the DisabilityInsurance Trust Fundas disabled workers or as dependents of disabledworkers. In total,approximately 40 million people will bereceiving some type ofmonthly social securi- ty cash benefit.The thetrust funds.\u2014The budget projec- tions under currentlaw for the next 5years continue to reflect an improving financialoutlook for the OASDItrust funds with the combined trustreserve ratio growing from 71 percent of the pro- jected annual outgoat the beginning of fiscalyear 1990 to 193 per- cent at the beginning offiscal year 1995.The following tabledisplays the economicassumptions underly- ing the budgetas they relate to the OASDI program.

SOCIALSECURITY [In millions of dollars] Fiscal local Cover CBO estimate 000000 Coverageof State and local employees not covered by a public re-tirement program._Employees of State and local government arecovered by Social Security under agreements between the Stateand the Secretary of Healthand Human Services. Currently about30 percent of State and local government jobs (about 7 million em-ployees) are not covered byOASDI. About 3.8 million of these em-ployees, many of whom are young and are employed part-time ortemporarily, are not participating in a public employee retirementplan.The Administration is proposing mandatory coverage of Stateand local employees who are not participating in a public employeeretirement system, effective October 1, 1990.Coverage of new employees of the District of Columbia.\u2014 SinceOctober 1, 1987, new employees of the District of Columbia have 25been covered by SocialSecurity unless theyparticipate in one of the city's three specialretirement programs (forpolice and fire fighters, teachers, and judges).The budget includesa proposal to cover all new employees, in- cluding the groups currentlycovered by the special retirement pro- grams.Benefits for adopted children..\u2014Under current law, a child adopt- ed by the survivingspouse of a deceased worker must meet several tests in order to be entitledto benefits as a survivingadopted child. First, adoption proceedingsmust have been initiated prior to the worker's death or the adoption must have been completed within two years of the worker's death. Second, the child must have been living in the worker's homeand cannot have beenreceiving sup- port from any source otherthan the worker and thespouse in the year prior to worker's death.The kdministration isproposing to change thesupport require- ments to permit a child who is adopted by the survivingspouse of a deceased worker to receivebenefits on that worker'searnings if the child was living in theworker's home when the worker died, or the child was receiving one-halfsupport from the worker at the time of death.Recoupment of certainoverpayments through income tax refundoffset.\u2014Under current law,Federal agencies thatare owed a past- due, legally enforceabledebt, other thana social security overpay- ment, may collect it by having the Internal Revenue Service with- hold or reduce the debtor'sincome tax refund.The Administration's budget includes a proposal to giveSSA per- manent authority to collectsocial security and SSIoverpayments by withholding theamount due from Federal income tax refunds if recovery through benefit adjustment or direct payment by the overpaid individual hasnot been successful. Theproposal would apply only to amountsowed by former beneficiaries,not to amounts owed by current beneficiaries.Pre-effectuation \u2014State make determinations on individuals' initial and continuing eligibility for disability benefits. Amendments enacted in 1980 require the Secre- tary of HHS to review 65percent of favorable disability determina-tions before the decisionbecomes effective. The review applies to favorable decisionson initial claims, reconsiderations, and continu- ing disability investigations.The Administrationis proposing to reduce and 25 percent ofall continuances.Advance tax transfer.\u2014Another proposal in the Bush budget would end the advancetax transfer provision. These provisions were adopted in the 1983 social security amendments whentrust fund balanceswere precariously low. They provide for crediting the social security trust fundsat the beginning of each month with the social security taxesexpected to be collected during the month. The trust funds are requiredto repay the general fundfor any interest paid on amounts transferredin advance of when theyare collected so that there should beno financial advantage to either the trust funds or the general fund.In some cases, however, theavailability 26of the advance tax transfermakes it possible for the trust funds toavoid redeeming investments that would otherwise beneeded tomeet benefit payments atthe start of the month.Depending onprevailing interest rates, this apparenfly unintended effect couldresult in the trust funds earning more or less interest than wouldbe the case in the absenceof the advance taxtransfer provision.The Administration estimates that the provision willresult in alowering of interest paid to the trust fund over the nextseveralyears. Since interestpayments are an interfundtransaction, therewould be no budgetary impact on the \"unified\"or Gramm-Rudman-Hollings deficit. 54 Chart 12.\u2014SUPPLEMENTAL SECURITY INCOME [In billions of dollars] Fiscal year\u2014 19901991 Present law:Total SSI outlays 1 1214 Includes11monthlypayments,comparedto12monthtypaymentsin1991.Source: Budget Office. Chart 12Supplemental SecurityIncomeSince January 1974,the Social SecurityAdministrationhasbeen responsible for administering a basic income supportprogram for needy aged, blind, anddisabled persons calledSupplemental Secu- rity Income (SSI). Thisprogram is funded entirely from general revenues. The law establishing the SSI programpermits the tempo- rary use of the social securitytrust funds to meet theadministra- tive costs of theprogram, but provides specific safeguards toassure that those costsare promptly reimbursed to the trust funds byan appropriation from generalrevenues.Under present law, theaverage number of recipients receiving SSI payments isestimated by the tration to be as foran individual, and $579 fora couple. Annual adjustments are made in January to reflect increases in the cost ofliving.

SUPPLEMENTALSECURITY INCOME\u2014SAVINGS No independent CBO estimate available.Underpresent law, States may choose to supplement the Federalpayment and have these supplements administered by SSA. SSAcurrently administers the supplementation programs for 17 Statesand the District of Columbia. Currently there is no provision in thestatute allowing SSA to charge a fee for administering these pro-grams -TheAdministration's budget proposes to assess a fee from Statesfor administration of State supplementation programs. Details ofhow the fees would be assessed are still to be worked out, but, ac-cording to the Administration, the fee that a State must pay willgenerally reflect the total amount of the State's supplementarybenefits. Total 13Health is a nationwide health insurance program for 33 mil- lion aged and disabled individuals. It is authorized by Title XVIII of the Social Security Act and consists of two parts. Part A, the Hospital Insurance Program, provides protection against the costs of inpatient hospital services, skilled nursing facility services, home health care and hospicecare. Part B, the Supplemental Medical In-surance program, is a voluntary program which provides protection against the costs of physicians' services and other medical services. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that under current law, spending for the Medicare program in FY 1991 will be $116.8 billion, of which $67.5 billion is for part A and $49.3 billion is forpart B. The CBO estimates that basic premiums collected from Medicare participants in FY 1991 will total $11.9 billion. Spendingfor program administration will be $2.8 billion for FYyear 1991, about 2.4 percent of the total.MEDICAIDMedicaid is a Federally-aided, State-designed and administered program, authorized by Title XIX of the Social Security Act, which provides medical assistance for certain low-income persons. Subject to Federal guidelines, Statesdetermine eligibility and the scope of benefits to be provided. TheFederal government's share of Medic-aid expenditures is tiedto a formula inversely related to the per capita income of the State.Federal matching for services variesfrom 50 percent to 78percent. Administrative costs are generally matched at 50 percent except for certain items whichare subject to. higher matching rates.Recent budget reconciliationacts have expanded Medicaid's cov- erage for pregnant women and young children. Pursuant to the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989 (P.L. 101\u2014239), States are required, as of April 1, 1990, to cover all pregnant women and children up toage six with family incomes up to 133 percent of the Federal Poverty Level ($14,045 for a family of three). At their option, States maycover pregnant women and infants (up to age one) with family incomesup to 185 percent of the Federal PovertyLevel ($19,536 fora family of three). (59) Porl estimates NOTE:Figures do not reflect offsetting income from beneficiary premiums Chart 14Health Programs: Administration ProposalsMEDICAREThe Administration budgetproposes to reduce outlays and in- crease premiums under the Medicare program for fiscal year 1991 by $5.158 billion. This amount includes $3.035 in reduced payments to providers under Part A, and $2.108 billion in payment reduc- tions and premium changes under Part B. It does not include in creased revenue to the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund associated with proposals to include State and local government workers under Medicare. (See section on revenue). All estimates have been prepared by the Congressional Budget Office. Table 14 compares Administration and CBO estimates of Medicare savings proposals. Unless otherwise specified, the proposals are legislative, rather than regulatory, in nature.Of the $5158 billion in Medicare spending cuts, $3.9 billion, or 75 percent, would come from reducing payments to hospitals for both inpatient and outpatient services. Payments to physicians would be reduced roughly $990 million, less than 20 percent of the total. (69) 70 MEDICAREPART B 75 14. Part B premium.\u2014The part B premium was originally set at a level to cover 50 percent of program costs, but subsequently theincrease in the premium from year to year was limited to the most recent percentage increase in Social Security cash benefits. As a result, the percentage of program costs covered by the premiumdropped to 24 percent by 1981, and legislation was enacted to holdthe premium at 25 percent of program costs through 1984. Thisprovision was extended on a number of occasions, but will expire atthe end of 1990.The Administration budget would establish the part B premiumat the greater of 25 percent of program costs or the previous year'spremium, increased by the annual percentage increase in Social Se-curity cash benefits. This provision would be permanent.

Capital Gains.=The Administration proposes to allow individ- uals, beginning in 1990, to exclude a percentage of gain on capital assets as defined under present law, except that collectibles would be excluded. After 1991, the exclusion would increase based on the length of time the asset was held: 30 percent for assets held 3 years or more, 20 percent for asseth held at least 2years but less than 3 years, and 10 percent for asseth held at least 1 year but less than 2years. The alternative minimum tax would apply to excludedamounts and all depreciation would be recaptured in full as ordi nary income.2.

Treatment of Salvage Value by Property and Casualty Insur-ance Companies.\u2014TheAdministration proposes that the deductionfor losses incurred by property and casualty insurance companiesshould be reduced by estimated recoveries of salvage (includingsubrogation claims) attributable to such losses, beginning after De-cember 31, 1989.11. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Fees\u2014The Ad- ministration proposes to increase the fee on securities markettransactions from 1/300 to 1/200 of 1 percent of dollar value ofsales, and to expand this fee to apply to most over-the-counter secu-rities transactions. The Administration also proposes to increasethe fee charged for merger or proxy filing from 1/50 to 1/40 of 1percent of the value of the transaction, and the registration fee onsecurities from 1/50 to 1/40 of 1 percent of the value of the securi-ties.12. Federal Reserve Reimbursement. \u2014The Administration pro-poses to establish a permanent, indefinite appropriation to reim- burse Federal Reserve banks for their services as fiscal agents forthe Bureau of the Public Debt.

Energy Tax Incentives.\u2014The Administration makes four pro- posals to boost energy production: a 10 percent tax credit for thefirst $10 million of exploratory intangible drilling costs and a 5 per- cent credit for the balance of such costs; a 10 percent credit for newtertiary enhanced recovery projects;for percentage depletion, eliminating the transfer rule and increasing the net income limita-tion for independent producers; and eliminating 80 percent of theexploratory intangible drilling cost preferences of independent pro-ducers from the minimum tax.23. Family Savings Accounts.\u2014The Administration proposes tocreate a new type of savings account, the \"Family Savings Ac-count.\" Although no current-year tax deduction would be availablefor contributions to these accounts, the contributions and the earn-ings could be withdrawn tax-free, as long as the account was main-tained for at least seven years. Withdrawals of earnings on contri-butions maintained in the account for less than three years wouldbe subject not only to regular income tax, but also to a 10 percentexcise tax penalty. The proposal would allow contributions of up to$2,500 a year for single individuals with income of $60,000 or less,and $5,000 a year for families with income of $120,000 or less.24. Health Insurance Deduction for Self-employed.\u2014The Adminis-tration proposes to extend permanently the 25 percent deductionfor health insurance expenses of self-employed individuals, whichwould expire after September 30, 1990 under current law.25.

Itwas intended that, with this information, consideration of thebudget might involve examination of both direct expenditures andtax expenditures as alternate means of providing incentives.The Budget Act defines tax expenditures as \"revenue losses\" at-tributable to provisions of the Federal tax laws that allow a specialexclusion, exemption, or deduction from gross income, or whichprovide a special credit, a preferential rate of tax, or a deferral ofliability. In general, the concept is intended to identify provisionsin the tax law which either encourage certain behavior or compen-sate for specific hardship. The term encompasses tax provisions oflimited applicability, which are exceptions to provisions of moregeneral applicability considered necessary to make the tax systemfunction.The definition of \"tax expenditure\" is not precise. This impreci-sion has resulted in substantial controversy. Chart 18 includes allitems listed as tax expenditures by the Administration. A listing ofa provision as a \"tax expenditure\" here is not intended to implyapproval or disapproval, or any judgment about the effectiveness ofany provision.Chart 18 presents a summary of tax expenditures by budgetfunctional category. The chart reflects both the Administration'sestimate of the budget outlay equivalent for tax expenditures andthe Administration's estimates of the revenue loss for tax expendi-tures.Tax expenditure estimates should not be interpreted as the in-crease in Federal receipts (or reduction in the budget deficit) thatwould result if a provision were repealed. Repeal of some provi-sions could affect the aggregate level of income and economicgrowth. Many tax expenditures are not independent of each other;their values are largely interdependent. Additionally, the annualvalue of tax expenditures is very time-dependent.The tax expenditure table from the President's budget is reprint-ed in Appendix E.

CHAIRMAN:Pursuant to section 301(d) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, as amended, Iam transmitting to you the attached documentpresenting the views and estimates of the Committee on Finance with respect to the fiscalyear 1990 budget. I am also enclosing a committee print which provides additional information on matters within the jurisdiction of the Committee on Finance.Sincerely,LLOYD BENTSEN, ChairmanAttachment. (103) March 7, 1989Views and Estimates ofthe Committee on FinanceWith Respect to the Budget for FiscalYear 1990Overall budgetarysituation.\u2014Under the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit ControlAct of 1985, as amended,the Congress is mandated to seek certainlevels of deficit reductionleading ulti- mately to a balanced budgetin 1993. In any givenyear, automatic cuts in spending levels willbe triggered if the requireddeficit re- duction has not beenachieved as determined bythe Office of Man- agement and Budget. The President's budget for fiscalyear 1990 projects a deficit whichmeets the target, but only if current poli- cies (including appropriations) are changed sufficiently to reduce the disparity betweenspending and revenues byapproximately $27 billion.The baseline estimatesof the Congressional Budget Office would indicate thatan even larger amount of deficit reduction would be required tomeet the goal of havinga deficit for fiscal year 1990 which does not exceed $100 billion. As the committee withprimary legislative responsibility for fi- nancing the operations ofthe Government, the Committee on Fi- nance is keenly aware of the importance of reducing the massive deficits of recentyears. At the same time, the Committee recog- nizes that Congressretains a responsibility to deal with the high- priority needs of the nation,and many of theprograms within Fi- nance Committee jurisdictionare vital to the health and well-being of the citizens of thiscountry.It is clear, inany case, that effective action against the deficits requires cooperative effortson the part of the Congress and the Ad-ministration. We look forward to working with the Administration in fashioning thosedetails of the budgetaryprogram which involve matters within the jurisdiction of this committee.Tax proposals.As notedabove, the President's Budget projects a baselinedeficit under Gramm-Rudman.Hollings statute which must be reducedby approximately $27 billionif we are to meet the revised goals set by Congress and the Administration in 1987. That situationcould worsen if economicconditions develop unfavorably in the next fewmonths. The President's budget does include severalrevenue proposals. Some of these would reduce the deficit while others wouldincrease it. The Committee is committed to assuring thatany revenue changes it may propose will be de- signed in sucha way as not to worsen the deficit. The Committee believes, however, thatrevenues are unikely to playa role in meeting this year's deficitreduction goals unless there is biparti- san agreement on suchan approach. In the absence of bipartisanagreement, the budget resolution should contain no reconciliation(105) 106instruction directing theCommittee on Finance to propose revenueincreases.Medicare\u2014The Committee notes that the Medicare program hasover the pastseveral years borne much ofthe burden of outlay re-duction. While that programdoes represent a ofFederal spending, without care systemin wars whichwill ultimately be harmful tothe nation and the program s benefi-ciaries. The Committeewill of course continue tocarefully reviewthis program to assurethat it is operating on afiscally sound andefficient basis. The Committee strongly believes, however,that theCongressional budget for fiscal year 1990 should not be based onany assumptionof significant cutbacks inMedicare. Specifically,the Committee President'sbudget ($5 billion infiscal year 1990;$24 over fiscal years exceeds the levelthat it willbe willing to recommend.Welfare reform.\u2014In lastCongress, a reformof wel-fare system enactedinto law. This legislationhas the potentialfor changing welfare inthis nation from a program of dependencyinto a program whichprovides recipients with thetools to be inde-pendent, productive members of society. It is crucial tothe successof this legislation that it beadequately funded in entitlements(including the new JOBSprogram) estab-lished year. assume both thatentitlement funding andfunding to implementseveral provisionsof the welfare reformlegislation which were adopted on a non-enti-tlement basis as discretionary authorizations. This includes, for ex-ample, funds for research and evaluation. The full costof fundingthe welfare reformlegislation, from a budgetary standpoint, wasoffset by financing provisions in that same act.Children's initiatives\u2014While the Committee is deeplyconcernedwith the need for deficitreduction, the existence ofthat deficitdoes not relieve the nationof its responsibility tofind ways to im-prove the lives ofits children, especiallythose who are poor or dis-abled. The Committee expects to propose meetingthat responsibil-ity by implementing newinitiatives in the areas ofchild welfare,child care, and child health.Several elements of theCommittee'sjurisdiction are closely involved with those areasincluding: the taxcode; the social services program under title XX of the Social Secu-rity Act; the adoptionassistance, yet hadthe opportunity toreview or develop specificproposals in these areas, we recommendthat the budget resolutionaccommodate new children's initiativesin these Finance Committeeprograms in fiscal year1990.Custom.s/Internationchl Trade.\u2014We note that the budget submit-ted by President Reaganassumed the repeal of theTrade Adjust-ment Assistance programwhich was just extendedand reformed bylast year's trade bill. It isextremely unlikely that the Committeewill recommend repeal, sothe Committee on theBudget should notassume the enactmentof repeal legislation. to fund-ing the United StatesTrade Representative, theCommittee isconcerned that the President's budget submission does not fully 107take into account the increased program activities of the agency due to enactment of last year's trade bill, implementation of the U.S-Canada Free Trade Agreement, and increased activity in the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations. We recommend that the budget resolutionassume that the Committee may in-crease USTR's funding above the President's requested level inorder to assure that the agency has adequate resources to perform its functions.Other Finance Committee prograrn.s.\u2014In general, the Committee recommends that the budget resolution be based on an assumption that the programs in its jurisdiction which are not specifically ad- dressed above be continued without substantive change. Public Debt Limit\u2014The debt limit under existing law is set at $2.8 trillion. It appears that this level will be exceeded by the end of fiscal year 1989. At that time, a debt subject to limit of approxi- mately $2.85 trillion is now projected. By the end of fiscal year 1990, the debt limit will have to be increased to about $3.1 trillion. The budget resolution should reflect these projections. Summary. \u2014As in the past, the Committee is prepared to act re- sponsibly pursuant to the directives of the Congress contained in the concurrent resolution on the budget, working together with the other committees of the Senate. We must emphasize, however, that the Finance Committee will insist on maintaining the flexibility to choose among all available policy options to meet its obligations under the budget process, rather than being limited to any specific set of options.

Medicare Part B PremiumPRESENTLAWPart B is a voluntary program financed by premiums paid by aged, disabled and chronic renal disease enrollees and by general revenues of the Federal government. The premium rate is derived annually based partly upon the projected co6ts of the program for the coming year. Under prior law, the premium rate was changed on July 1 of each year. The Social Security Amendments of 1983 moved the premium increase to January 1 of each year to coincide with the changed date for the annual Social Security cash benefit cost-of-living adjustment (COLA).Ordinarily, the premium rate is the lower of (1) an amount suffi- cient to cover one-half of the costs of the program for the aged or (2) the current premium amount increased by the percentage by which cash benefits were increased under the COLA provisions of the Social Security program.From 1984 through 1990, the premium was set at 25 percent of program costs for aged beneficiaries. The remaining 75 percent was covered by general revenues. In CY 1990, the basic Part B premi- um is $28.60.RXPLANATION OF PROVISIONThe Part B premium would be set to cover 25 percent of program costs as follows: $29.90 in 1991, $31.70 in 1992, $36.50 in 1993, $41.20 in 1994 and $46.20 in 1995.EFFECTIVE DATEFor premiums beginning January 1, 1991. PROVISIONSSuwrim A. Iiiiwmu Irrco TAX PROVISIONS; LUXURY EXCISETAX 84. Increase in Ebllar Limitation on Amount of Wages and Self-Em-ployment IncomeSubjectto the Hospital Insurance Payroll Tax(Bee.18105of the bill and eec. 3121 of the Code)PRENT LAWAs part of the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA),a tax is imposed on employees and employers up to a maximum amountof employee wages. The tax is comprised of two parta: old-age, sur-vivor, and disability insurance (OASDI) and Medicare hospital in-surance (HI). For wages paid in 1990 to covered employees, the HItax rate is 1.45 percent on both the employer and the employee onthe first $51,300 of wages and the OASDI tax rate is 6.2 percent onboth the employer and the employee on the first $51,300 of wages.Under the Self-Employment Contributions Act of 1954 (SECA), atax is imposed on an individual's seIf.employment income. The self-employment tax rate is the same as the total rate for employersand employees (i.e.,2.9 percent for HI and 12.40 percent forOASDI). For 1990, the tax is applied to the first $51,300 of self.em-ployment income and, in general, the tax is reduced by any wagesfor which employment taxes were withheld during the year.The cap on wages and self.employment income subject to FICAand SECA taxes is indexed to changes in the average wages in theeconomy. In 1991, the amount of wages or self-employment incomesubject to the tax is projected to be $54,300.REASONS FOR CHANGEIncreasing the cap on wages and self.employment income subjectto tax with respect to the HI tax will improve the progressivity ofthe tax system. In addition, increa8ed revenues under the bill willprovide necessary funding for the Hospital Insurance Trust Fundand will enhance its long-term solvency.EXPLANATION OF PROVISIONThe bill increaaes the cap on wages and self.employment incomeconsidered in calculating HI tax liability to $100,000. As underpresent law, for years beginnin after 1991, this cap is indexed tochanges in the average wages in the economy. The OASDI wagecap remains at the level provided under present law.EFFECrIvE DATEThe provision is effective on January 1, 1991. 25 SUBTImE C.\u2014GrjjnREvwE INCRKASES 866. Employment Tax F'ovision8a. Extend 8OCial8ecurzty retirement coverage(OASDI)to Stateand local government employees not covered by a publicemployee retirement program (8ec. 18841of the bill andsec. 8121 of theCode)PRENT LAWEmployees of State and local governments are covered undersocial security by voluntary agreements entered inth by the Stateswith the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS). After aState has entered inth such an agreement, it may decide, orpermitits political subdivisions todecide, whether to includeparticulargroups of employeesunder the agreement. All States have enteredinth such agreements. The extent of coverage is high in someStates and limited in others.Nationally, about 72 percent of Stateand local workers are covered by social security.With certain exceptions, a State has broad latitude to decidewhich groupe of State and local employees are covered under itsagreement. In some cases in which States have elected not to pro-vide coverage, a part of theworkforce does not participate in anypublic retirement plan.For 1990, the social security (Old Age, Survivors, and DisabilityInsurance) tax rate is 6.2 percent of covered wages up th$51,300and is imposed on both theemployer and employee (for a total of12.40 percent).REASONS FOR CHANGECertain employees of State and local governments have no retire-ment protection either fromsocial security or a public retirementsystem. Many of theseindividua]s are low-paid individuals withlimited or intermittent workexperience who are not able th earnadequate retirement benefits. Therefore, social security coveragewill provide important disability, survivorship, and retirement pro-tection.EXPlANATION OF PROVISIONUnder the bill, State and local workers who are not covered by aretirement syatem in conjunction with their employment for theState or local government are required th be covered under socialsecurity (Old Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance) and suchworkers wages are subject th the OASDI portion of taxes under theFederal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA). An exception is pro-vided for students employed in public schools, colleges, and univer-sitie8, for whom coverage may continue to be provided at theoption of the State government. This exception maintains parallelcoverage rules for studentsemployed by public educational institu-tions and thoee employed by private schools, colleges, and universi-tie8.A retirement system is defined as under the definition of retire-ment system in the SocialSecurity Act (42 U.S.C. sec. 418(bX4)).Thus, a retirement system isdefined as a pension, annuity, retire- 87ment, or similar fund or system established by a State or by a po- litical subdivision thereof.Whether an employee is a member (i.e., is a participant) of a re- tirement system is based upon whether that individual actually participate8 in the program. Thus, whether an employee partici- pate8 is not determined by whether that individual holds a poeition that is included in a retirement system. Instead, that individual must actually be a member of the system. For example, an employ- ee whose job clas8ification is of a type that ordinarily is entitled tocoverage is not a member of a retirement system if he or she is ineligible because of age or service conditions contained in the plan and, therefore, is required to be covered under social security. Sinii- larly, if participation in the system is elective, and the employee elects not to participate, that employee does not participate in the 8ystem for purposes of this rule, and is to be covered under the social security system.The Secretary of the Treasury, in conjunction with the Social Se- curity Administration, is required to issue guidance in order to im- plement the purposes of this provision.FFECV11TE DATEThe provision is effective with respect to services performed after December 31, 1990. 88c. Payroll tax depositstabilization (sec. 18843 of of the bill and sec.6302(g)ofthe Code)PRESENTLAWTreasury regulations have established the system under whichemployers deposit income taxes withheld from employees' wagesand FICA taxes. The frequency with which these taxes must be de-posited increases as the amount required to be deposited increases.Employers are required to deposit the8e taxes as frequently aseight times per month, provided that the amount to be depositedequals or exceeds $3,000. The8e deposits must be made within threebanking days after the end of the eighth-monthly period.Effective August 1, 1990, employers who are on this eighth-monthly sstem are required to deposit income taxes withheld fromemployees wages and FICA taxes by the clo8e of the applicablebanking day (instead of by the clo8e of the third banking day) afterany day on which thebusiness cumulates an amount to be deposit-ed equal to or greater than$100,000 (regardless of whether thatday is the last day of an eighth-monthly period).For 1990, the applicable bpnking day is the first. For 1991, theapplicable banking day is the second. For 1992, the applicablebanking day is the third. For 1993 and 1994, the applicable bcLnkingday is the first. The Treasury Department is given authority toissue regulations for 1995 and succeeding years to provide for simi-lar modifications to the date by which deposits must be made inorder to minimie unevenness in the receipts effects of this provi-sion.REASONS FORCHANGEItis appropriate to simplify this provision by making the depositrules uniform for all years.EXPLANATION OF PROVISIONThe bill requires that deposits equal to or greater than $100,000must be made by the close of the next banking day for all years.Thus, no change from pre8ent law is necessary for calendar year1990, but for calendar years 1991 and 1992 deposits are accelerated.The regulatory authorityprovided to the Treasury Department isrepealed.EFFECTIVE DATEThe provision is effective for amounts required to be depositedafter December 31, 1990.

Mr. Speaker, I have a parli&mentary Inquiry.The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr.MURTBA). The gentleman will state it.Mr. MICHEL Mr. Speaker, becausethe House has been In somewhat disar-ray and going through some coninio-tion, did I understand the Clerk tohave just read House ResolutIon 509?The SPEAKER pro tempore. Thegentleman Is correct.POINTOPORDERMr.MICHEL. If so, Mr. Speaker,then I make a point of order.The SPEAKER pro tempore. Thegentleman will state his point of order.Mr. MICHEL Mr. Speaker, I make a point of order against House Resolu-tion 509 on grounds that it violatesclause 4(b) of House rule XI. and askto be heard on my point of order.Mr. Speaker, clause 4(b) of Houserule XI provides that, and I quote:The CommitteeonRules shall not reportany rule or order of business which' wouldprevent the motion to recomjjit frombeing made as provided in clause 4 of rulexv'.Andclause 4 of rule XVI provides.and again I quote:After the previous question shall havebeen ordered on the passage of a bill or Joint resotution one motion to recommitshall be in order, and the Speaker shall givepreference in recognition for such purpose to a Member who is opposed to the bili or Joint resolution.Mr. Speaker, those two clauses were adoptedas anendments to HouseRules on March 15. 1909, when thethen minority party Democrats joinedwith a group of insurgent Republicansto guarantee greater minority rights.Prior to this rules revision, the motionto recommit was controlled by the ma- jority party. This change wasinstitut-ed for the specific purpose of givingthe minority a final vote on its alter-native legislative proposal through a motion to recommit with instructions.House Resolution 509, on the otherhand, provides that the motion to re-commit, and I quote, \"may not containInstructions.\" It therefore is in directviolation of this rule which was pur-posely designed to guarantee the mi.nority a vote on its alternative by wayof Instructions.Mr. Speaker, In support of this argu-ment I quote first from the author ofclause 4(b) of rule XI on the day heoffered the amendment\u2014Representa.tive John Fitzgerald, a Democrat fromNew York. In his words:Under our present practice, if Member desires to move to recomnit with instruc-tions, the Speaker instead of recognizingthe Member desiring to submit ft specific proposition by instructions, recognizes thegentjeman in charge of the bill and hemoves to recommit, and upon that motiondemands the previous quesUon. When theprevious question is ordered, the motion torecommit is voted down. Under our practice,the motion to recommit might better beeliminated from the rules altogether.The subsequent rulings of Speakersconhfrm that the whole purpose of thenew rule was to permit the minority achance to offer a final amendment Ina motion to recommit with Instruc-tions.Speaker Champ Clark ruled on May14, 1912, and I quote:It is not necessary to go into the historyof how this particular rule came to beadopted but that it was intended that theright to make the motion to recommitshould be preserved inviolate.That is from a precedent found involume 8 of Cannon's Precedents Insection 2757. From that same volumein section 2757 is found a precedentfrom October 7, 1919. Former SpeakerCrisp is quoted as follows:The object of the motion to recommit isclearly to give the minority of the Housea chanceaffirrnatvely to go on record as towhtt they think this legs1ation should be,and if a motion to recommit does not permitthat, then the motion is futile.And Speaker GIllett, in deciding thepoint of order on that occasion, said,and I quote:The fact is that s motion to recom-mit is intended to give the minority onechance to fully express their views so longaa they are germane. Thewhole pur- pose of this motion to recommit s to have arecord vote on the program of the minority.That Is the main purpose of the motion torecommit..Speaker Bankhead. in a 1939 rulingfound in volume 7 of Deschler'8 Prece-dents, chapter 23, sectIon 26.1 saId ofthis rule, and I quote:The purpose of the motion to recommit'isto give Member8 opposed to the billan opportunity to have an expression ofopinion by the House upon their proposi-tion.Mr. Speaker, the whole key to thispotnt of order and the underlying ruleat Issue is what is meant in clause 4(b)of rule XI when it says the RulesCommittee \"shall not report any ruleor order of business which would prevent the motion to recommit frombeing made aa provided in clause 4 ofrule XVI.\" It is not sufficient for theRules Committee to simply permit astraight motion to recommit and pro.H 9933hibit instructions, since it may not pre-vent a motion \"as provided\" by clause4 of rule XVI. And the legislative his-tory of that rule and the early rulingsmake clear that what was being pro-vided was an opportunity for the minority to offer a motion to recommitof its choosing, with or without in-structions.IndeedDeschler'sPrecedents,In volume 7, chapter 23, section 25 makesthis abundantly clear, and I quote:There are in the rules of the House fourmotions to refer the ordinary motion pro-vided for in the first 8entence of clause 4,Rule XVI when a question is\"under debate;\" the motion to recommit with orwithout thtructionalterthepreviow question has been ordered on a bill or Jointresolution to final passage provided In thesecond sentence of clause 4, Rule XVI .Mr.Speaker, that second sentence ofclause 4 of rule XVI Is the 1909 rulethat is at Issue in this point of order.And while it does not specifically men-tion Instructions, it is clear from thelegislative history behind the rule aswell as this recent interpretation fromDeschler's that the right of the minor-ity to offer Instructions in a motion torecommit is not only implied by therule, but is the whole reason for theadoption of the rule in the first place.It therefore should be obvious thatif the Rules Committee is prohibitedfrom denying the minority the rightto offer a motion to recommit \"as pro-vided\" by that second sentence in that1909 rule, it may not bring in a rulesuch as this which denies Instructions.To do so is to render rule, which pro-tects our minority right, null and void.It is not only a violation of the spiritof the rule but of the literal content ofthe rule.I therefore urge the Chair to sustainthis point of order for the sake of up-holding the tradition, the spirit andthe letter of the rule in question.0 1220Mr. SOLOMON. Mr. Speaker, willthe gentleman yield on his point oforder?Mr. MICHEL. I would be happy toyieldto the gentleman from NewYork.The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr.MuRrn). The gentleman may notyield on this point of order.Does anyone wishtobeheard against the point of order?Mr. DERRICK. Mr. Speaker, I re-spectfully suggest that the point oforder as made by the minority leaderis not correct, is not valid. Simply, asthe minority leader has pointed out,there is a motion to recommit, but themotion does not have Instructions.There is ample precedent in the Houseover a long period of time that saysthat a motion to recommit is in order,it Is necessary that it also include theInstructions,Mr. SOLOMON. Mr. Speaker, I askto be heard on the point of order.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD HOUSE CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 HOUSE Mr. DERRICK. Mr. Speaker, I reit-erate my original statement on thepoint of order.The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr.Mwtit). Does anyone else wish to be.heard on the point of order? If not,the Chair will refer to a ruling by Speaker Rathey, January 11,1934 cited on page 471 of the Manual and inDeschler's volume 6, chapter 21, sec-tIon 26.11, and in volume 7, chapter 23,section 25:The Chair w)I statethatthe Committeeon Rules may, without violating this clause.recomxnend a special order which limits, butdoes not totally prohibit, a motion to recom-mit pending passage ofbill or joint resolution. such a8precludingthe motion fromcontaining Instructions relative to certainamendments.In the only precedent directly relat-ing to the question at Issue, SpeakerRalney on January 11, 1934, ruled andwas sustained on appeal. The Commit-tee on Rules is not precluded tinderclause 4b, rule XI, from specificallylimiting motions to recommit bills orjoint resolutions pending the questionof final pa&age to specific type of in-structions.Speaker Rainey stated on that occa-sion:October 16, 1990The Chair, therefore, holds the motion torecommit, as provided In clause 4, nileXVI,has been reserved to the minority and that,Insofar as 8uch a nile Is concerned, the spe-cial nile,\u2014And the Chair emphasizes to thesouse,does not deprive the mIrorlty of the right tomake a simple motion to recommit.This is Speaker Rainey speaking:The Chair thinks, however, that a motionto recommit with instructions to incorpo-rate a provision, which would be in violationof the special nile, and would not be Inorder.Thus, the Committee on Rules hasthe authority to recommend specialrules to the House which may limit,but not totally prohibit, the type ofmotion to recommit which may be of-fered, not merely with respect to thegeneral rules of the House, but withrespecttogermaneamendmentswhich might otherwise be in order.Clause of Rule XVI does not guaran-tee that a motion to recommit a billmay always include Instructions.The Chair, therefore, overrules thepoint of order.Mr. WALKER.

In addition, the rulemakes in order consideration of theamendments in part 2 en bloc, not sub-ject to a demand for a division of thequestion in the House or in the Com-mittee of the Whole. The 1 hour ofdebate time Is to be equally dividedand controlled by the proponent and aMember opposed. The rule also waivesall points of order against the amend-ment in the report.Finally, Mr. Speaker, the rule makesin order amendments to be offered byRepresentative PANEL-rA en bloc.

The rule also provides for onemotion to recommit which may not in.dude instructions.Mr. Speaker, as my colleagues are well aware, the Omnibus Budget Rec-onciliation Act of 1990 Is the legisla-tion implementing the deficit reduc-tion plan agreed to at the budgetsununit as reflected in House Concur-rent Resolution 310, the concurrentresolution on the budget for fiscalyears 1991 through 1995. ThIs bill con-tains submissions from 12 House com- mittees achieving deficit reduction to-taling $40 billion in fIscal 1991 and$500 billion over 5 years.Mr. Speaker, equally vital to thisdeficit reduction effort are the im-provementstothecongressionalbudget process incorporated into thebill by the rule as title XIV.Title XIV represents thetion of countless hours of work by themembers and staffs of key committeesof jurisdiction, the administration, andothers in interpreting the enforcementprovisions of the summit agreementand drafting a comprehensible, work-able package to implement that agree-ment. As chairman of the Subcornmit-tee on the Legislative Process of theCommittee on Rules, which shares ju-risdiction Over the budget process withthe Committee on Government Oper--atlons, I can assure the House thesereformsconstitutemajor improve-ments which will impose strict budget-ary discipline during the 5 years cov-ered by the bi-partisan summit agree-ment.These improvements would be ac- complishedin two principalways. First, title XIV improves and tightensthe Balanced Budget and EmergencyDeficit Control Act of 1985. commonlyknown as Gramni.Rudman.Hollings,by creating three kinds of sequestra.tions. One sequestration enforces caps on discretionary spendlng another en.forces limits on entitlements and rev\u00e9.nue floors, and another provides foran aeross-the.bco.rd deficit sequestra.tion similar to the current Oramm.Rudnian.Second, the provisions make tempo-rary revisions to the CongresslonajBudget Act.

Mr. Speaker, HouseResolution 509 Is a modified closedrule providing for 3 hours of generaldebate, with the time to be equally di- vided and controlled by the chairmanand ranking minority member of the Committee on the Budget. All pointsof order against the bill and against its consideration are waived except thatthe Ways and Means Committee chair.man or his designee may raise pointsof order under clause 5(b) of rule XXI.Clause 5(b) of rule XXI provides that no bill or joint resolution carrying a tax or tariff measure shall be reportedby any committee not having jurisdic-tion to report tax and tariff measures.The rule provides that the amend-ment printed In part 1 of the HouseReport 101-882 to accompany the rulewill be considered as having beenadopted In the House and In the Com-mittee of the Whole. The rule makesIn order no other amendments In the House or in the Committee of the 119936qufring5-year budget resolutions, 5-year spending allocations, and by en-hancing the section 302 and 311 poIntsof order to apply them to measureswhich would breach the budget-yeartot&ls and the totals for all 5 yearscovered by a budget resolution. In ad-dition, if any bill loses revenue and isnot fully offset by entitlement cuts inthe same bill, the budget committeesmay report a spectalreconciliationconcurrent resolutiondirecting thecommittees to raise revenues by anamount equal to the deficIt increase.Finally, the title provides importantreforms in the area of credit account-ing, beginning infiscalyear 1992,which will help us budget for our con-tingent liabilities. The package also re-rr.ovca the Social Security trust fundsfrom the budget and the deficit calcu-lations under Oramm-Rudxnafl, and cteates a point of order prohibitingconsideration of a measure which in-crc.n.v,es Soei Security benefits with-out Increcuing payroll taxes, or whichcutsbenefitswithoutalsocuttingtaxes.Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members tosupport these needed reforms by sup-porting the rule and the bill.1] 1300Mr. QUILLEN.

Mr. Speaker, theable gentleman from South Carolinahas explained the provisions of therile and it would be redundant for meto repeat those.Mr. Speaker, I want the Members ofthis House to listen to what I have tosay. This is not a fair rule. The Demo-crats are trying to muzzle the Republi-cans by disallowing them the opportu-nity to offer a substitute.I think It is time that we spoke outto present a budget alternative thatntakoa sense.Reductionin spending without newtaxes, that Is the philosophy embodiedin the Republican substitute. The gen.tieman from Ohio (Mr. Kfslcu) andthe gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Puxsaui labored hard and long withtheir task force to produce this sut.sti-tute, but the Committee on Rules hasdenied the opportunity to debate It onthe floor of the House.I think there should be a vote up ordown on the Republican substitute.I have been here 28 years. and very,very seldom, indeed, have I seen any-thing like this before. The Nation is atthe crossroads. We are facing crisisand chaos unless something Is done.There Is assurance, if the Democratproposal Is passed, that it will clearthe Senate, or that it will be signed bythe President of the United States. Ifhe vetoes It, then there is no assurancethat the veto will be overridden; quitethe contrary, I think It will be aus-tamed.October 16, 1990Inother words, the Democratic lead-ership In this House refusedto let youDemocrats vote to impose a 10-percentsurtax on incomes YourDemocrat leadership refusedto letyou a 1-per-cent on tax-free foreign corpora-tions.Vote no on this rule, Mr.Speaker,arid you may get that chance.The letter referred to follows:House or REPP.ESPFrA?1VE8.Wasrnngtofl, DC you make in order an amend-ment to the 1990 ReconcIliation bill to beoffered by either Rep. Purcell or Rep.Khsich.The amendment reduces the deficit by ap-proximately $400 billion ovcr five years. Itincludes a multl-'eat freeze on domestic dis-cretlone'y spending enforced by 8pefldingcaps. An additional $6billion is cut belowthe freeze for Internationalat faLs over thefive years. Entitlement savings and fee in-creases are equal to the amounts submittedby the various Committees. The amendmentcontains minimal revenue Increases primari-ly in the form of current law extensions.It is in my view a tragedy, for this institu-tion and for the country, that we were notable to agree on a compromise solution toour budget problems. Bothparties share re-sponsibilityforthisfailure, which hasshaken the faith of the people of the House.But since such compromise is not possibleIn the current frenziedatmosphere, theAmerican people should at least be giventhe oppoitunity to see the true nature ofthe opposing politicIphilosophies of ourparties.It has been wisely said thattaxes are whatwe pay for civilizedsociety. But excessivetaxes are what sochty pays for irresponsiblegovcrnment 8pendlng\u2014and they are toohigh a price. No matter what differences wehave on specific tactical issues, House Re-pubi..ans believe that the problem with thefederal budget Is not that the Americanpeople are taxes too Utile, butthat theirelected leaders have beensper4lng toomuch.Inthe war against the deficit, the firststrike, swift and hard, must be made egaiflatspending. This is where House Republicansstand and this Is the mesmge our amend-nient contains. It Is a messagethat theAmerican people deser.e to hear, loud andclear, or. thc floor of the House tomorrow.Sincerely,So here we are, just a few daysbefore October 19 when this Govern-ment of ours will come to ascreechinghalt. The Federal employees will beout of work again, our parks will beclosed, the Interior Department facili-ties downtown will be closed, and visi-tors will be denied the right tose fa-cilities that they should have.So what do we do here today? TheDemocrats being a proposal Includinghigher taxes to the floor that Is abso-lutely unacceptable to theRepublicanParty. I think that theDemocratsmade a serious mistake when they re-fused my amendment in the Commit-tre on Rules very early this morningabout 12:30 a.m. to provide that theRepublican substitutebe made inorder.I urge the Members of thisbody tovote down the previous question, todefeat the rule, so that theCommitteeon Rules can act againand brln arule to the floor allowing the Republi-can substitute.Mr. Speaker, I yIeld 3 mInutesto thegentleman from New (Mr. SoLo-?dON).Mr. SOLOMON. foryielding methis time.Mr. the Repub-lican leader's letter to thegentlemanfrom Massachusetts (Mr. MctxLZY)asking that his substitute be made inorder.

That was agreedto by the President. It was agreed toby the leadership on the minority side.It was agreed to in the summit. It wasagreed to in a budget resolution thatwe passed last week reaching $500 bil.lion in deficit reduction over 5 years.We have. just had in reconciliation12 House committees and chairmenbleeding, bleeding to meet with theirdirective on reconciliation.What does the Republican proposaldo? It would cut the reconciliationnumber over 5 years In half, In half.Instead of $250 billion over 5 years,which is part of this reconciliation billthat we debate, all they would comeup with is $125 billion.So suddenly those who argue andhave argued the strongest for deficitreduction, when it is time to put up,they come up with a mouse.The fact is we have been working totry to reach the targets established bythe President. As a matter of fact, thePresident himself, the President hasstated In the summit agreement it ishis intention that no bill, suspendingsequester beyond October 19 shall besigned until the following has oc-curred,areconciliationconferencereport on a bill fully reflecting thebudget summit agreement, fully reflecting the budget summit agreement.The Republican plan is a recipe fordisaster, because the President him-self,underhis own commitment,would have to reject this and continuesequester.Second, it is fundamentally unfair,fundamentally unfair. What they havedone is they have accepted the cuts Inreconciliation that go after the elderlyand after farmers and alter veteransand after Government employees.0 1310Then on top of that, they now add afreeze across-the-board. A freeze. Ahard freeze, that goes after what? Themost vulnerable in our society. The el-derly, students, Head Start, WIC, nu-trition, so they do a double hit on thepeople in the middle, and the lowerincome brackets. For what? to protectthe most wealthy in this country be-cause they are the ones that are noteven touched by this substitute.In the other body, the minority isworking with the Democrats to comeup with a credible deficit plan. Some-day my hope is that the minority herewill work with this side to help governthis Nation, not bring it down.Mr. QUILLEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield4 mInutes to the gentlewoman from U-linois (Mrs. Mxvnq).Mrs. MARTIN of Illinois. Mr. Speak-er, I appreciate that the Constitutiongives Congress the authority to de-clare war. But I did not think, until Isaw this rule, that the authority ex-tended to declaring war on the minori-ty party In the House.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014HOUSEThis rule shuts the minority partyout of the process not because of somearbitrary standard for amendmentslaid down by the Budget Committeechairman at the 11th hour last night.That was all pretense and we know ItThe real reason we were shutout ofthe process Is because we had a substi-tute in the Kasich-Pursell approachthat made real savings and came darnclose to the summit targets withoutraising taxes. I repeat: with no newtaxes.The Democrats could not stand thethought of permitting a Vote on a notax alternative\u2014one that clearly drawsthe line between the parties. Well, letit be noted that yoi have Issued yourdeclaration of war with this rule andyou have fired the first shot.If you want to bring down the Gov-ernment with your game of chicken,let there be no mistake that the re-8ponsibillty rests fully on your 8h0U1-ders.Do not lecture us about the fairnessof your reconciliation package while atthe same time trying to stick the mi-nority with this outrageously unfairrule. You have destroyed the credibil-ity of your package by the Incredibil-ity of your tactics.And what kind of standard has theBudget Committee been held to In thisprocess? This rule waives all points oforder against the bill\u2014all points oforder. That means that every Houserule and every provision of the BudgetActandGranim-Rudman-Houlngscould be violated with impunity bythis bill\u2014safe from points of order.And given the rushed consideration ofthis bill without proper printing andscrutiny, for all we know they are vio-lated. One thing is for sure: This vie-lates the 3-day layover for committeereports. Members will not have thebenefit of even a day to review thereport.So let us not talk about holding theminority party to one standard whenthe reconciliation bill itself, by thevery terms of this rule, is In violationof every standard we have ever con-ceived.Mr. Speaker, I think the way inwhich this measure has been rushedto the floor without proper printing oropportunity for scrutiny or analysisfurther bespeaks the confidence themajority party has In its package. Thisprocesshasthefingerprintsof Winkum., Bllnkum and Nod all over It.This reconciliation bill was reportedfrom committee on a wink; It wasrushed to the floor in a blink; and Itwill be passed by the Democrats onthe nod. And while that is all fine anddandy in nursery rhyme land. It is notgoing to cut It In the real world of def-icit reduction land. You are back toyour old tricks over there of promises,promises, smoke and mirrors. And it isall being played out In the dead ofnight. You know darn well this pack-age will not withstand the light of day.You are not just dancing In the darkwith this rule\u2014you are dirty dancing.H 9937And how do you justify this rushjob? \"We have to expedite It,\" you say;\"We're under the gun.\" Well I wouldsuggest you check just which end ofthe barrel you are on before you pro-ceed with this dangerously suicidalrule and bill.And what about the so-called budgetenforcement provisions of this bill.Well, if you like Gramm-Rudman-Hol-lings, you will love Panetta-Moakley-Conyers. They give us not just one se-quester but three\u2014an appropriationssequester, an entitlement sequesterand a deficit sequester. And then Itturns around and exempts half theGovernment. This new process Is socomplex it makes Rube Goldberg looklike a tinker toy.And yes, we have even got moiibudget pol,nta of order. Is that notenough to make you quiver? What w\u20acneed Mr. Speaker, Is fewer points olorder\u2014weroutinelywaivethem anyway. What we need Instead is morepoints of light, of common sense, andof real deficit reduction. This packagefalls on all counts. Vote down the ruleso we can have a fair rule and a goodbill.Mr. DERRICK. Mr. Speaker, I yield2 minutes and 15 seconds to the gen-tleznan from New York (Mr. SCHU-MxRJ.(Mr. SCHUMER asked and wasgiven permission to revise and extendhis remarks)Mr. SCHTJMER. Mr. Speaker, theNation is In crisis, and the Speakermust get the phone and call our Presi-dent. Here is what the Speaker mustsay to him.

YourHouse Republicans want to pass abudget that would force you, by yourown words, to close the Governmentdown.\"Yes, It Is true.

Then he askedMembers to do one thing. He said:I ask both Houses of Congress to allow astraight up or down vote on a complete $500billion deficit reduction package.The President's own words.

Mr. Speaker, I yield3 mInutes the gentleman fromMichigan (Mr. PuRsu.J.Mr. PURSELL. Mr. Speaker, overthe years as an athlete and coach, Ihad always thought that when we goInto a game, that we had the samenumber of players as our opponent,and we p'ayed by the same rules. Notin the House of Representatives.We have waived the budget rules Inthe 101st Congress 62 tImes. We violat-ed the rules that we voted for In theBudget Act. Now, we end up with fourtiers of government: The authonza-tion tier, the appropriation tier, thebudget tier, and now the summit tier.We were brought down because ofthe process here, not by personalitiesof the President or Republican or theDemocratic Party. The process Is whatcwsed this disaster tn this country.All I am suggesting here Is that we de-velop a game plan and present it tothe public. In the Cornxnlttee on Ruleslast night, au we &sked was to let ourgame plan be presented so the publiccan see it; not just the Committee onRules. Let the American public see it.Let the Members vote on it.The Democrats have a plan thatcalls for $148 billion in new taxes forthe next 5 years. I would rather seethat money stay in the private sectorthan bringing it to Washington. How-ever, that Is not for me to decide.If a person is a coach, they put thatgame plan on the table, and they putthe opponent'8 game plan on thetable, and they run with it. Let Mem-bersgivetheAmerican publica chance to look at two game plans forthis Nation. We are starting today aWorld Sertes, and yes, we may lose thefirst game, but the final game, fromthe Founding Fathers' point of view,will be the elections, to elect peoplethat can govern, that can offer abetter vision of America.0 1320So I say, let this fight atart. Let usfight It out, but let us play by thesame rules.

We set the policyand you respond.The bottom linc here today is, wewant to offer a plan that cuts $400 bil-lion without txes and you wt toraise taxes to the tune of $150 billionon the American people, without anyspending controls.Your entitlement cuts, our entitle-ment cuts are the same.

The Republicansoffered real reform.We are being told by this rulethat we cannot amend the faulty offeringof the Democratic Party, that we cannot participate in this debate, thatwe may represent half the Americanpeople, but as far as the majorityparty is concerned itis going to bebusiness as usuaL We are going to con. tinue breaking the law.Mr. DERRICK. Mr. Speaker, forpurposes of debate only, I yIeld 2 mlii-utes to the gentleman from Caiifornla(Mr. MILLER3.(Mr. MILLER of Caiilornia askedand was given permission to revise andextend his remarks.)Mr. MTLTR ofCalifornia.Mr. Speaker, we have listened to the Republicans all year tell us about howthey were prepared to make the toughchoices to reduce the deficit. Nowwhen the hour of truth has ap- proached, they have failed to comeforward. They have failed to come for-ward with a plan to reduce the deficitthat meets the measure that theirPresident has asked and that theDemocrats have met, and that is $50billion in reductions thIs year and $500billion over the next 5 years.This is the party whose policy hasled us to a decade of deficits. Over the last 8 years they have doubled the na. tional debt. They have increased us now to a point where we are the larg.est debtor nation in the world and our own national deficit starts to suffocateus as a nation, and yet when they wereasked to come forward to meet the standards,to meet thetest,they failed. Now they cry that It is unfairthat they cannot change the rules. They want to change the rules so they will not have to cut theprogram.They told us that they could eradi- cate the deficit. They told this Nation that they could go down toa balancedbudget if only they were allowed tomake the cuts. On their first attempt,they failed and they failed miserably.We ought to understand that. We ought to understand that under their proposal the deficit continues to in-crease over the next 5 years. We donot get to where this Nation wants to go In terms of deficit reduction underthe proposal they sought;Why not? Because they did not have the courage to pick and choose and make the difficult decisions that were necessary. The only thing they equatewith courage is pain, They started out these deficit negotiatior by puttingon the table a $90 billion cut In Medi-care. They thought It was courage topunish old people, to take away theirhealth care, to deny themaccess toheaith care, to deny themaccess to hospitals.TheyfinishedupthatCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 HOUSE H 9939budget summit by trying to take away and so do you and that is why you will social security from crippled children, not let this plan come to the floor.

In a few short days weagain face the dramatic shutdown ofGovernment.. Thiswillbe the thirdtime In the last month that we arefacing that possbillty. Yet, when Iwent before the Rules Committee Inthe company of others and proposed abudget process amendment that wouldend that Government shutdown for alltime, a commonsense amendment, theRules Committee flattened me downand shut the door.My amendment would simply saythat when we reach the end of thefiscal year on September 30, that auto-matically the next day that the Con-gress has not passed the budget, thatautomatically last year's budget goesInto effect for such period of time asthe Congress requires to pass a newbudget. That would end forever theshutdown of Government, would allowFederal employees to know that theycan go to their offices without the fearof being sent home without pay, withtheiroffices shut down. And theAmerican public will know that theirGovernment Is In session no matterwhat idiotic things th.t the Congressdoes In its failure to adopt a properbudget.You are talking about amending thebudget process. Why don't we startwith one that will end the shutdowmof Government? Can you think of abetter way to say we are going toreform the budget process, we aregoingtoprevent the Governmentfrom ending business arbitrarily?And if you are alter the President ofthe United States, as every speaker onthis floor seems to indicate, you willadopt this amendment and forever endwhat you say Is his tool for forcingaction, namely causing a shutdown ofGovernment.Take it away from him. Make itautomatic that the budget will be re-enacted automatically the next day,on October 1, until we reach an agree-ment.I am really disappointed In the Rules Committee forgiving shortshrift to this amendment.Mr. DERRICK.

Mr. Speaker, I amexcited about what we are going to dotoday In this House. I am excitedabout the Democratic budget proposal.It Is a good deal for working America,and for our Nation's elderly. TheDemocratic proposal Is going to makethe rich pay their fair share and pro-vides long-term investment In workingAmerica's future\u2014In small business, Intimber, and in homeownership.Over the past decade the rich havegotten richer and working Americahas paid for it.

Our tax policy should no longerbe a bail-out for the rich.I am excited, this House of Repre-sentatives Is going to stand up forworking America today.Mr. QUILLEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield3 mInutes to the gentleman from Min-nesota (Mr. FRrNZEL).(Mr. FRENZEL asked and was givenpermission to revise and extend his re-marks.)Mr. FRENZEL Mr. Speaker, there Isintense disappointment on this side oftheaislethat the Democrats areafraid to let us offer a substitute. Wethought they were serious when theyexpected us to be competitive. Now wefind that cowardice prevents themfrom allowing us to be competitive.I recall early In the year when thedistInguished gentleman from SouthCarolina, who is managing this rule,chided me for not offering the Presi-dent's budget. I had, of course, offeredit In the committee, and the chairmanof the Rules Committtee voted againstit, as did every Democrat on that com-mittee.0 1340Butnow,of course, when we want tooffer something, when we have a prop-osition, he Is not so generous. He is notchiding me now. I am chiding him.Thanks for the gracious opportunityfor us to be able to present a Republi-can alternative.The reason that we cannot presentIt, Mr. Speaker, is that it does notmake the $500 billion mark that thesummit agreed on. So that everybodyIn the world knows this, It must besaid that neIther does the Democratalternative. If we take the CBO scor-ing on the IRS collections, and If wetake the $1. billion poInt of order thatthe chairman of the Committee onWays and Means is going to make thisafternoon, and if we reduce the $500October 16, 1990millionof the Committee on Agricul-ture, we find the Democrat substituteand the committee bills both scoringbelow $500 billion.Yet Republicans score under $500billion, and they are not allowed topresent their alternative.We also find that the Rostenkowsklsubstitute does not meet the dictatesof the budget resolution. It overdoestaxes and underdoes entitlements. Butit gets a free ride, too. The answer isthat the only second-class citizensaround here are Republicans. Republi-can are always suppressed.Mr. Speaker, our friends on theDemocrat side say that we have con-trolled tax policy over the last 20years. We, the oppressed mInority, thesecond class citizens, the despised Con-gressional underclass, have somehowcreated an unfair tax environment.When Democrats will not even let usmake amendments on the floor of theHouse, how is the public going to be-lieve that we have made any policy ataMr. Speaker, the public does not be-lieve that. It thinks that the Democratmajority are Incompetent to managefiscal policy. And yet Democrats willnot give anybody else a chance even toIntroduce an amendment today.Mr. Speaker, In addition the enforce-ment agreement of the summit hasbeen seriously eroded in this particu-lar package. As a matter of fact, we didnot even see the enforcement sectionuntil last night. It may be worse thanwe suspect.The extraneous provisions amend-ment. which has been made In order,has not appeared yet. By my owncount I can find 116 extraneous provi-sions that our friends on the Commit-tee on Rules, so far, have allowed tostay in this bill. They have let the spe-cial Interests go into a feeding frenzy,and they will not let the taxpayers beheard on the Republican side.All I have to say, Mr. Speaker, isthat this is a shameful day In the his-tory of the House, and I am embar-rassed to be a witness In this processtoday.Mr. DERRICK. Mr. Speaker, I yield2 minutes to the gentleman fromNorth Carolina (Mr. HzvrxnJ.Mr. HEFNER. Mr. Speaker, this Is avery interesting debate, and, if we goback through the past 10 years, therehave been two Republican budgets of-fered.

The other got some 30 votes.And on May 6, we considered a budgethere, and our good friend, the gentle-man from Minnesota (Mr. Fxxsmlwho just spoke, who Is embarrassed tobe here, refused to offer the Presi-dent's budget.

Howdare they ay tlat they do not get afair sha1e when they get a chance tooffer a budget which has been 10years? They were afforded the respon-sibility. and they did not tate it.Now.

So, we have got a Demo-cratic Committee on Rules enforcingth Republican President's rules, andthey are yelling, \"Unfair\". We aresaying the same group scored bothproposals, and guess what?

They never did. ManyMembers on this side asked for unani-mous consent to brthg the President'sbudget to the floor so this side coulddebate it because they realized no oneon that side was going to, and guesswhat? It was objected to.Mr. Speaker, I do not think we cancontinue on saying tha the rules areunfair when it is their side that wrotethem and when the President ha saidthis Government is suffering from acancer, and it.is called debt.

Most of their savings over-all are in the discretionary spendingarea\u2014in a future black box not in thestructural area of entitlements andtaxes.Mr. Speaker. the reason the Repub-lican packageisreally much morethan 20 percent short Is because theirstructural are only about halfof reeonctliatlon's Msignlnent underthe budget blfl passed last week. Youare only halfway there my friends onthe Republican side, not 80 percentthere. It is like claiming a touchdownin football alter only 50 yards, not 80yards.

Mr. Speaker, Ido not know that Members can seethis, but I have here a cartoon thatwas recently published in the Arkan-sas Gazette which shows the windowsIn the Oval Office open and chickenscoming Iii to roost on the shoulders ofthe President, Mr. Bush.On all of these chickens there arenames, like S&L crisis, HUD, borrow-irg,nationaldebt,deficits,energy policy, and so on. On each one of thelittle chickens there is a caricature ofMr. Reagan's face.Mi-. Speaker, we are here today be-cause the chickens have come home toroost. The chickens of Reaganomicshave brought us here today.Mr. Bush is not the only head ofstate that has faced a crisis of confi-dence. Paradoxically, Mlkhail Gorba-chev faced a similar crisis when hecame to power in the Soviet Union afew years ago. He told the Sovietpeople that his predecessors had liedto them about the glories of commu-nism, that the policies of the past hadfailed, and that they had brought theSoviet Union to the brink of bankrupt-cy.Mr. Bush has a similar opportunity,to tell the American people the truthabout our fiscal crisis. I would hopethat Mr. Bush would Just flip back toa few years ago and pull out hisspeech on voodoo economics, so hecould change the fiscal direction ofthis country.October 16, 199iMeanwhile, Congress must take ajinitiative, and the Democrats have aialternative that deals with the failureof the Reagan deficit. We need an economic policy based on truth and a tapolicy based on fairness.Mr. Speaker, I support the rule.support the alternative that will bipresented here today by the Democratic Party.I am encouraged that more anmore of the American people ancoming to realize that Reaganomicwas built on the quicksand of creativbookkeeping, rosy scenarios and thifalse promise that we could somehohave more for less.We are left to pick through the cccnomic wreckage wrought during thiself-indulgent decade of the 1980's amthe first order of business Is dealiniwith the massive Reagan deficit.It must be done.

October 16, 1990So,Congress must certainly accepttheblame for enacting the Reaganprogram into law.A decade of Reaganomics saw thenational debt grow more than in allother Presidencies combined, but asthis happened we did not heed thewarnings.In fact, there Is a faction In both theRepublican and Democratic Partieswhich even today ignores the lessonembodied in the failure of supplysideeconomics.The gridlock we see in governmenttoday Is symptomatic of a nation foun-dering because Its policies are notworking, and many of Its leaders arestubbornly refusing to alter a danger-ous course.Reaganadministrationpolicies\u2014deep slashes In revenues nd huge In-crease In defense spending\u2014could onlybe financed by using the nationalcredit card\u2014and use It we did, untilthe numbers were worn off.Today, we face the mountain of debtcreated by that credit card philosophy.In fact, one of the largest increases inGovernment spending is Interest onthe debt th&t piled up as the result ofthe flawed economic policies of thepast decade.Congress has decreaed services anddomestic programs In order to helpmeet Interest payments on the debt,meaning less money to repair andmaintain our nIrastructure, educateand train our people and promote Jobgrowth.There has been no other choice.An energy policy was followed In the1983's which saw us become more andmore dependent on both foreign oiland foreign credit to buy that oil. ThisInsane practice must stop. We mustrely more on our own natural re-sources to, first, keep more money athome, and second, to Insure that oureconomy is not held hostage by thelikes of Saddam HusseIn.We alsofollowedtradepollcica which opened this Nation to a flood ofjob-costing Imports.And, the free market agriculturalpolicies of the 1980's sent both com-modities and land prices skidding\u2014leaving farmers unable to service theirdebt and driving many of them off theland.Our tax policy was tilted toward therich., but the money was borded. It didnot,assupply-sideproponentsclaimed. trickle down. It gushed up.The atmosphere these policies cre-ated raade mulionaries of Wall Streetspeculators, but left businessmen onMain StreetInpain. The buy-outmania fueled by Junk bonds left manycorporations so burdened with debtthey could not continue to operate andwe lost jobs.Tax policies left us with an over-heated real estate market arid helpedbring the savings and loan industry toits knees.In Government. the policies resultedin debt and more debt. In failing toadopt a pay-as-you-go policy, our onlyCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 HOUSEchoice in sustaining the Reagan poli-cies was on credit. And, now the bill Isdue. The party's over.Congress can adopt a fair pay backplan for the Reagan deficits. It shouldiso spend more time on what areviewed us mundane tasks, includingSound management of the bureaucra-cy.The scandals in the Department ofRousing and Urban Development andthe savings and loan frauds are intol-erable\u2014and must serve as a clear callto restore good management to gov-ernment.And, we must tighten foreign debtcollection procedures.Frankly, both the Reagan and Bushadministrations have done a lousy Jobof seeing to it that countries whichown the U.S. money pay it back.My feeling Is those debts should bepaid. Under an amendment which Isponsored in the House, known M the Aiexander-Brooke amendment, foreignaid Is cutoff if a country is 12 monthsin arrears in payment of its debt tothis country.The past two administrations, how-ever, have been able to circumventthis requirement by rescheduling thedebt which starts the clocks runningagain.We can also see to it that our alliesaccept more of the burden for theirown defense. The United States can'tguard the world alone, nor can UncleSam be a global Sugar Daddy anylonger.Our first priority must be to craft adeficit pay back plan which will befair, not failing more heavily on themiddle class, working families of theNation.I hope we would take the other ac-tions I have outlined to ensure thatthe decade of the 1990's sees a govern.ment on a sounder, fairer footing.Mr. DERRICK. Mr. Speaker, forpurposes of debate only. I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Kansas(Mr. SLAT].Mr. SLAri'Y. I thank the gentle-man for yielding.Mr. Speaker, the fact of the matteris today the Republicans have notbeen shut out, as they would like tomake the American people believe.The fact Is the President and the bi-partisan congressiona] leadership haveset the ground niles, and the groundrules are simple. We are going toachieve $40 billion in deficit reductionthe first year and we are going toachieve $500 billion in deficit reduc-tion over 5 years. Those were theground niles. set by the President ofthe United States and the bipartisancongressIonal leadership.0 1400The fact Is today the other side doesnot have a plan available to submit tothis body for a vote that achieveseither of those basic objectives.If the President of the United State3wants to change the niles, and if weare going to taik about a $400 billionH 9943plan, then the Democrats can go backand come up with a whole lot lesspainful plan than what we are goingto be talking about here today. AU Iamsaying to my friends Is let us liveby the rules that were set by thesummit agreement, $40 billion thefirst year, $500 billion over 5 years,and let us get on to the conference,and hopefully we can agree to a pack-age that will be acceptable to thePresident. Only by so doing will weavoid shutting the Government downlater this week.PAHLIALTA2YIIIQUIIYMr.ARMEY. Mr. Speaker, I have aparliamentary inquiry.The The gentleman inquiry.Mr. ARMEY.

Mr. Speaker, I riseto express my serious concern aboutthe rule as it affects the taxation ofgeneral aviation aircraft and the op-portunity to offer an amendment tothat particular provision.Mr.Speaker,Irise to expressmyseriousconcern package, I amtroubled that such a comprohensive packagewrh thousands of provisions can only be sup-ported or opposedin totalwith no opportunityfo( amendment. I was not eligible to offer ana'nerdment which would have modified thegonaral aviation 'luxury\" tax Included in theRc-stenkowsld amendment.In particular, I am concerned about the Im-pcsbon of \"luxury\" taxes on general aviationaircraft. It would be more accurate to refer tothis tax, inappropriately called a luxury tax, asa nuisance tax bcause ft will contribute littleto total deficit reduction. In the fIrst year of theHouse package, the amount raised from air-plane luxury taxes would be very small, yetthe damage done to the aviation Industryoutd be enormous. Further, small airplanesae not a luxury. They are not like expensivejewelry and furs, which are items of purechoice for purchase by the wealthy.Airplanes we bona tide depreciable busi-ness assets purchased by Individuals andcompanies to meet theIr transportation needs.In this era of aliline deregulation when manyCONGRESSIONAL RFCORD \u2014 HOUSEcommunities,particularly small ones, have lostsignificant levels of scheculed airline service,many businesses and individuals have deter-mined ft makes economic sense to purchasea small plane.Imposing a tax on these aircraft only deterstheir purchase. In turn, declining sales willcontribute to further job cuts In an Industry al-ready beset by productliability costs andother unfavorable changes in tax laws. (Them-ptoyod American aviation workers, Includingthose Iorkirg for component suppliers, willhave lower taxable Incomes and may beforcedtosecure unemploymentbenefits,causing two additional drains on our revenuesystem. This spi'al is unnecessary. And ft wifiparticularly be a problem for my district whichIs the headqucrters of Beech, Cessana, andLeaet.The best option Is to riot Impose anyluxurytax on airplanes.The future of thegeneralaviation industry may be at stake. If this taxbecomes law, the winners Will be foreign man-ufacturers and foreign workers. The losers willbe the thousands of American working menand women. Hopefuly this obnoxious provi-sion can be modified or repealed in a confer-ence with the other body.Mr.QUILLEN. Mr. Speaker, I yieldmyself the balance of my time.Mr. Speaker, I would like to remindthe Democrats that for the last 36years they ha'e controlled this House.They control It now. Why blame theRepublicans?The President has sent word that hewould vetothe Ways and MeansDemocratl alternative if It is present-ed in the form that it Is now.Try to muzzle us. Do what you canto shut us up, but you cannot. Our be-liefs are the beliefs of the Americanpeople, and we will win in the end.Mr. Speaker, I urge a no vote on theprevious question, and I urge that wedefeat this rule.Mr. Speaker, I yield back the bal-ance of my time.Mr.BUNNING. Mr. Speaker, when you tookthe dias for the first time after you were elect-ed Speaker of the House last year, you prom-Isod the Republicans\u2014and I quote\u2014\"A spiritof ccoperation and Increased consultation.\"Where Is that spirit of cooperation and con-sultation now, Mr. Speaker?The Members of the Republican Party hareIn the House of Represcntativos have urJfledbehind an alternate budget proposal; a budgetproposal which can meet the target of roducIng the deficit by $500 billion over 5 years,without raising taxos.And you will not allow the Rdpublican Partyto even bring this bill to the floor of the Houseforconsideration.That Is not cooperation. That Is not consul-tation.That Is not fair to the American taxpayer.Mr.DERRICK. Mr. Speaker, I yieldmyself such time as I may consume.Mr. Speaker, I sat on the BudgetCommittee In this body for 10 years. Imust say that I have heard nothingthis morning that I have not heardbefore from the minority,I sat there for 10 years, year in andyear out, and heard our party criti-Elzed, beard when we had a President,himcrttlzedaboutbalancingtheOctober 161990budget, we need to Cut this, we need tocut that. Yet, invariably they wouldnever, or most of the time would neverhave an alternative. This is just moreof the same.The rules, as has been pointed outhere this morning, were that we weregoing to try. The President said, theleadership in the Senate, both minorl-tyand majority, the leadership In theHouse, both the majority and the mi-nority said that we were going to cutby either cutting programs or raisingrevenue, we were going to try to bal-ance this budget. All Members know,Democrats and Republicans, that Ifthis country is going to continue tosurvive, economically, If we are goingto continue to be able to provide thestandardoflivingthat wehave become accustomed to for the citizensof our country, if we are going to con-tinue to remain the leaders of the freeworld, and to continue to do thingslike we are doing in Saudi Arabia andstand up for freedom, we are going tohave to balance this budget.The minority has been given thatopportunity.Unfortunately,andI regret very much they have simplyfailed. They are not willing to get outfront. They are not willing to exertany pain. They are not willing to sayno.We all know that there are two waysto balance a budget. We can eithertake in more revenue or spend less.They are not willing to make these de-cisions.This is a fair rule.

The House billremoves the indexation of tax rates, which would resurrect aninequity most Americans thought was a thing of the past: bracketcreep. n addition, the House bill raises the top tax rateto33%,adds an income tax surcharge, and contains other hiddenmechanisms that increase income taxes on all Americana.The Senate tax provisions are generally acceptable to theAdministration. The President's negotiators will be workingdirectly with the Conferees to express the Administration'sposition on specific tax provisions.In addition to the unacceptable tax provisions in the Mousebill, the President's senior advisors would recoend that thePresident veto the Reconciliation bill if it contained theGATT trigger provision in the MQU5* bill. This provision wouldcancel savings in the commodity price support programs on 7uly 1,1992, if legislation to implement a GATT agreement is not enactedby that time.Because th. savings are contingent upon theenactment ofuturs legislation, they c&not be scored. Theprovision will thus reduce the savings produced by the Committeeon Agriculture by $8 billion in FY 1993\u20141995 \u2014\u2014withthe resultbeing that the committee will have failed to aest itsreconciliation instructions. In addition, thi, provision wouldcreate a perverse incentive for the U.S. agriculture community toensure that a cxrragreementis never consummated.The Ad.ini.tration has concerns about many ether provisionsin the House and Senate bills.

The enclosure provides our views on selected other matters under your consideration.I should point out at the outset that because the purpose of Budget Reconciliation is deficit reduction, we can not support any new spending provisions other than the levels agreed to in the budget summit.HEALTHMEDI CAREHospital CapitalBoth the House and Senate bills have preserved HHS's authority to fold hospital capital paynents into the Prospective Paynent System (PPS).We thank the Committees and strongly support their position retaining our authority and flexibility in this area. The current system, cost\u2014based for capital and prospective for operating costs, distorts incentives andencourages inflationary capital spending. Under the Senate and House provisions, HHS will be able to produce regulations that will vastly improve capital paynent policy over time and protect hospitals that could be unfairly harmed by such a change in paynent policy.Graduate Medical EducationWe strongly support the policy direction of the Ways and Means graduate medical education proposal, which is similar to the President's FY 1991 budget proposal. This approach would encourage the training of primary care physicians. Secondary Payor Extensions and ImprovementsWe support provisions in both the House and Senate bills thatwould extend the Medicare secondary payer (MSP) provisions.These provisions would extend our authority to reduce medicarepayments by identifying situations when other primary healthinsurance can be held accountable.Physician Budget ProposalsWe support nearly all of the savings proposals associated withphysician and other Part B provider payments. Most representvariations on the President's budget proposals; they are soundpolicy; and they would help provide for a transition to theMedicare fee schedule on January 1, 1992. MEDICAIDQualified Medicare BeneficiariesWhile we certainly support the concept of protecting lowincome beneficiaries from new-cost-sharing requirements, we arestrongly opposed to the House provision which establishes a newpolicy for the Medicaid program of 100 percent Federal fundingfor Qualified Medicare Beneficiaries (QMB5).We strongly prefer the Senate provision, which uses thestandard Federal and State Medicaid matching rates now applied tocoverage for current QMB5 with incomes below the Federal povertylevel.First, the Senate provision would leverage Federalspending to help more near-poor beneficiaries per Federal dollar.And second, the Senate provision avoids making a major policychange in Federal-State responsibility without an opportunity forthe public debate it deserves. INCOME SECURITYSocial Security Independent AgencyWe are gratified that neither House nor Senate bill includes theprovision to establish the Social Security Administration (SSA)as an Independent agency. The Administration remains stronglyopposed to any provision which would separate SSA from theDepartment of Health and Human Services. 2 Restoration of Telephone Access to Local Social Security OfficesWe strongly oppose the Senate provision requiring the Department to publish in local telephone directories the telephone numbers of Social Security offices that provided teleservice as of September 30, 1989. Reestablishing direct telephone access to local offices would not improve service, but rather reduce levels of service to those who visit local offices because employees would be diverted from face\u2014to\u2014face interviews to answeringtelephones.RepatriationWe strongly support the provision in the Senate Reconciliation bill which temporarily repeals the $1 million spending cap for the repatriation program for two fiscal years, and permits HHS to receive gifts from those wishing to contribute assistance to repatriated Americans through the repatriation program.This program is essential to individuals leaving areas of strifebecause it provides the necessary temporary assistance upon their arrival in the United States. Sincerely, Louis W. Sullivan, M.D.SecretaryEnclosure 3 MEDICAREHospital Payment ProvisionsoPPB Payment AdjustmentsIn examining PPS payment adjustments such as the indirectteaching adjustment (IME), it is clear that the MedicareTrust Fund is financing costs associated with non\u2014Medicarebeneficiaries. While we are extremely concerned aboutthose who lack health insurance, we do not believe it isappropriate to use the Medicare Health Insurance Trust Fundto mitigate the serious uncoinpensated care problems thatface many hospitals. We therefore support the reduction inthe IME adjustment approved by the Senate, which resemblesa proposal made in the President's Budget.HHS is preparing a congressionally\u2014mandated report on theurban/rural payment differential and other issues ofhospital payment equity. Our report will suggest PPSpayment alternatives that more appropriately reflect costsproviders face in treating Medicare beneficiaries. oHospital CapitalWe strongly support the House and Senate provisionspreserving HHS's authority to fold hospital capitalpayments into the Prospective Payment System (PPS). Thecurrent system, cost\u2014based for capital and prospective foroperating costs, distorts incentives and encourages inflationary capital spending.Both bills also lessen the across\u2014the--board reduction incapital payments, which will help our efforts to craft an equitable regulation. Both bills would provide us flexibility to treat the moveable portion of capitalseparately from the fixed portion, should we deem thatapproach appropriate.Under the Senate and House provisions, we will be ableproduce regulations that will vastly improve capitalpayment policy over time and protect hospitals that couldbe unfairly harmed by such a change in payment policy.oBundling jflUnbundlingof Payment RatesWe support a House provision to include in the hospital DRG payment diagnostic tests performed two and three daysbefore the stay. This is an important policy to preventunbundling from the hospital DRG payment. :i In contrast, we strongly oppose a House provision to repealthe OBRA\u20141986 provision which allowed an offset to hospitalrates where physician assistants are separately billed fromthe hospital DRG rate. This repeal would encouragehospitals to unbundle payments from the DRG payment byutilizing physician assistants in place of other equallyqualified personnel. Encouraging this behavior underminesthe hospital DRG system. It also violates the principleestablished, when the physician assistant direct billingprovision was enacted, to make that provision budgetneutral.In the PPS regulation, HHS implemented the statutory offseton a hospital-specific basis. We believe that thisapproach is preferable because it discourages individualhospitals from unbundling.0GraduateMedical EducationWe strongly support the policy direction of the Housegraduate medical education proposal, which is similar tothe President's FY 1991 budget proposal. This approachwould encourage the training of primary care physicians.However, as a technical matter, we would prefer that thepolicy be based on the Secretary's estimate of residentsalaries or a national average, rather than the hospital-specific per resident amounts. We also recommend that theeffective date of the legislation be changed to correspondwith the fiscal year or cost reporting year. Part B Provider Payment ProvisionsoSavings Proposals that help the transition to the feescheduleThe Administration supports provisions to transition to thefee schedule, including those that would: freeze customaryand prevailing updates for non-primary care services;reduce payments for overpriced and unsurveyed procedures,including global fees; reduce payments for radiology,anesthesia and pathology; phase-in payment rates for newphysicians; reduce payments for assistants-at-surgery;limit technical components for diagnostic tests; andprovide for consistent treatment of interpretation ofelectrocardiograms as laboratory tests. Most of theseprovisions are based on proposals included in thePresident's Budget. 2 oPhysician Regulatory Relief ProvisionsWe share the concern that motivated these provisions and want to help reduce Medicare's paperwork burdens. For example, we support the provision in the Senate billthat would allow \"substitute billing\" for a physician covering temporarily for another physician.In addition, while we are conunitted to our current policy of consulting with interested physician groups throughout the policy development process, we are concerned about the House provision that establishes a formal PhysiciansAdvisory Council. As drafted, the provision could complicate the already complex process of issuing regulations and instructions. We would be happy to work with the Conferees to perfect this provision.However, due to a potential increase in the volume ofclaims that could result, we must oppose a House provision that would require the Secretary to release the parametersand criteria of our medical review screens. We prefer the Senate provision which calls for a study in a limited number of carrier sites. This would enable an objective assessment of the workability and potential costsassociated with releasing this information.oPRO Carrier CoordinationWe oppose the Energy and Commerce provision to require PROs and carriers to develop common claim edits and medicalreview criteria. Such a provision may only further impedeongoing PRO reform with the Medicare HNO program.Existing statutory authority is sufficient to provide for suchcoordination of activities. We plan to inform Congresssoon about administrative improvements underway planned tobetter coordinate PRO-carrier activities.oDirect Payment to Various ProvidersSeveral provisions would extend direct billing authority to practitioners or additional settings in an ad-hoc manner. We are concerned that granting direct payment facilitatesunbundling of facility payments by encouraging facilitiesto utilize these personnel in preference to other facility- employed personnel.If such provisions are retained, we believe that any Medicare payments otherwise made to the specific facilityshould be offset (similar to the OBRA '86 PhysicianAssistant offset) by the amount of the direct billinginvolved in an effort to discourage unbundling. oDurable Medical EquipmentWe support proposals in both the House and Senate bills timpose a national payment limit and floor on payment fordurable medical equipment (DME). These provisions wouldminimize the disparity in the current payinent amounts forDME across the country and reduce those payments that areexcessively high. The three bills include a number ofother changes affecting payinent for DME that theAdministration has proposed in the past and that wecontinue to support.Minor improvements, however, would simplify our ability timplement selected provisions within a short time periodwhile leaving the basis of the proposals unchanged. Wewould be glad to work with the Conferees to refine some othese provisions. MEDICAIDoQualified Medicare BeneficiariesWhile we certainly support the concept of protecting lowincome beneficiaries from new cost\u2014sharing requirements,are strongly opposed to the House provision as itestablishes a new precedent for the Medicaid program of 1percent Federal fundinq for the Medicare premiums ofQualified Medicare Beneficiaries (QMB5).In addition, QMB provisions enacted in past years coveredflMedicarecost-sharing expenses (i.e. premiums, co-insurance, and deductibles). The House provision onlycovers the premiums.We strongly prefer the Senate provision, which uses thestandard Federal and State Medicaid matching rates nowapplied to coverage for current QMB5 with incomes below tFederal poverty level. First, the Senate provision wouldleverage Federal spending to help more near-poorbeneficiaries per Federal dollar. And second, it avoidsmaking a major policy change in Federal-Stateresponsibility that has not been given the public debatedeserves. 4 oPrescription DrugsThe Administration supports savings through price discountsand rebates for States offering Medicaid prescription drugcoverage.We support the objectives of both House andSenate bills, but prefer the underlying structure of theSenate version. We favor some of the provisions in theHouse bill such as leaving intact States' ability to useprior authorization for new drugs, and to set pharmacyreimbursement. The Administration strongly supports fullaccess for Medicaid beneficiaries, but opposes federally-imposed open formulary requirements since they limit States'flexibility.We strongly oppose the Senate provisions toincrease State payments to pharmacists and to require theSecretary to make annual determinations on which drugs,based on their medical utility, would be allowed on Stateformularies.We would prefer that States retain even greater flexibilityon formularies and prior authorization. In addition, wewould prefer no mandate for drug use review, as we areconcerned that states will only be effective in theirimplementation if they want to pursue the approach. States have every ability under current law to implement DrugUtilization Review programs.We are strongly opposed to the House provision that wouldindex discounts for each and every sole source and once- patented multiple source drug to the CPI using the bestprice in effect as of September 1, 1990. This is tantamount to direct price control of Medicaid drugs. While someindexing feature is necessary to assure on\u2014going savings, we strongly prefer the Senate version which would index pricesacross a manufacturer's product line. oMedicaid Managed CareWe oppose the House provisions that would require a minimumenrollment of 5,000 members in a HN0 that serves Medicaidrecipients.We believe the existing enrollment compositionand insolvency provisions are adequate assurance ofsolvency.The 5,000 member level, may be difficult for many HNO5 that contract with Medicaid to achieve, hence a largenumber of providers would have to drop out of the program, severely disrupting beneficiaries and potentially harmingaccess.Finally, size alone does not give any assurance ofquality of care provided by an organization. 5 We also oppose placing the same requirements on sub-contracting organizations that are placed on theorganization that contracts with the State. We believe thatit is the contracting organizations responsibility toproperly enforce good management and quality of carerequirements on its sub-contractors and that it is thecontracting organization that must meet jJ Medicaidrequirements.oNurse Aide Training ProgramsWe support changes to the current statutory requirementsthat exclude most nursing home providers from being approvedto offer nurse aide training programs.We support the Senate provisions that would offer asignificant improvement to the current law. Given the manydifficulties inherent in determining which nursing homeproviders should or should not be approved to train nurseaides, the Senate package represents a fair balance.oProvisions related to Donated Funds and Provider SpecificTaxesThe Administration opposes the House provision on donatedfunds and provider-specific taxes. The arbitrary 10 percentlimit that it sets will raise federal Medicaid costs withoutincreasing services provided to the poor. We estimate thatthe House provisions would increase federal outlays by $100million in FY 91 and' $1.7 billion over 5 years.If legislation is deemed necessary, we prefer the Senateprovision that places a 9-month moratorium on publishing afinal regulation. The Department is developing a revisedregulation that will set for an improved, equitable policyin this area.oDisa].].owancesBoth Houses propose to limit disallowances of Federalmatching funds for cases in which certification requirementsfor Medicaid patients in inpatient psychiatric facilitieshave not been met. In the House provision, however, twoStates --Arkansasand Missouri \u2014-continueto be subject tothese disallowances simply because their disallowances havealready been issued, while all other States would have mostof their disallowances forgiven. We oppose this approach asit treats states inequitably. 6 The disallowance process is an integral part of the Department's effort to ensure program integrity. It should proceed on a basis that is fair to all States. oPreadmissjon Screening and Annual Resident Review (PASARR)Both House and Senate bills include provisions that would fundamentally alter PASARR requirements.While we agree that some changes would be useful we would like to work with the Committees to ensure that any reforms are equitable and administratively sound.ther Key Health ProvisionsoMedigapBoth House and Senate bills include provisions intended to improve the regulation of Medigap policies. The Senate provision better embodies our principles for reform: maintaining federalism, permitting managed care, informing consumers better, and ensuring consumer choice. The House unnecessarily mandates direct Federal regulation of individual policies; the Senate does not. While both chambers moved to limit choice in regard to Medigap benefits, the Senate standardization provisions permit more flexibility than the House.In addition, we support the Senate provision because it includes our Medicare SELECT proposal; the House does not.oSecondary Payor Extensions and ImprovementsWe support provisions in both the House and Senate bills that would extend the Medicare secondary payer (MSP) disability provision. These provisions would extend our ability to reduce medicare payments by identifying situations when other primary health insurance can be held accountable. oLiving WillsWe generally support the concept of making living willsmore widely available, but we oppose using provider conditions of participation to impose requirements unrelated to patient health and safety, as included in both the Senate and House provisions.The best time to make this information available is not when an individual is entering a hospital. 7 SOCIAL SECURITY AND INCOMESECURITY oRestoration of Telephone Access to Local Social SecurityOfficesThe Administration opposes the provision requiring theSecretary of Health and Human Services to publish in localtelephone directories the telephone nunibers of SocialSecurity offices that provided teleservice as of September30, 1989.Reestablishing direct telephone access to localoffices (rather than through the toll-free 800 number) wouldnot improve service. On the contrary, implementing theprovisions would require substantial sums for additionalstaff and equipment and could result in reduced levels ofservice for people who visit those local offices becausethe employees would be diverted from face\u2014to-face interviewsto answering telephones.Following a 20-percent reduction in full-time equivalentpositions over the past six years, the Agency has relied onadvances in technology, especially the widely acclaimedtoll\u2014free 800 number, to-process more than 1 million callsper week.To encourage callers to place those calls tolocal offices already burdened with complicated caseloadsrequiring more time and concentration would not only beunwise, it would be insensitive.If the Senate provision were enacted into law, the effectivedate would have to be a niinimuni of one year after enactmentto allow for implementation. oRepatriationWe strongly support the provision in the SenateReconciliation bill which temporarily repeals the $1 millionspending cap for the repatriation program for two fiscalyears, and permits HHS to receive gifts from those wishingto contribute assistance to repatriated Americans throughthe repatriation program. This program is essential toindividuals leaving areas of strife because it provides thenecessary temporary assistance upon their arrival in theUnited States. 8 16320CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEOctober 19, 199(hePRESIDING OFFICER.

As thegentleman from Minnesota knows,there has been quite a bit of concernexpressed on our side of the aisle inthe last couple of hours about the factthat there was not a printed documentavailable of what the Rouse actedupon the other evening, and so we hadno idea what it was we were going togo to conference on. I understand thatthe gentleman from Minnesota haslooked into the matter, has found thatwe will have copies of the available bylater on this evening, and that theproblems of the Government PrintingOffice is getting those matters to us donot appear to have been a deliberateaction to keep the Members fromhaving the appropriate information.I wonder 11 the gentleman would ex-plain the situation asheunderstandsit.Mr. FRENZEL Further reservingthe right to object.

Some telephonecalls had to be made to find out on aquestion of whether the Scotch tapewas over the proper word or one thatmight have followed, and in my judg-ment the GPO Is doing the best It can,that It has been given a properly en-rolled bill, that there have been noChanges made to the bill between en-rollment and the GPO.

Mr. Speaker, thegentlewoman is a member of the majority party here, and, I think, wouldcertainly be able to carry this requestto the leadership. I think the leader-ship would be sensitive obviously. Ifchild care is added on the other side ofthe bill and there is an agreementwith regard to child care provsions, Ithink that would be something thatwould, indeed, be included in the con-ference, and 11 the gentlewoman is alsoconcerned about mainniography andother sections related to Medicare andthose are part of the conference, Ithink the leadership would also bewilling to defend those issues in con-ference, as well.I think .that would be a better ap-proach than a motion to Instruct.Ms. OAKAR.

Mr.Speaker, the 101st Congress is nearingthe end of fts work. HovQever, beforewe adjourn In the next fei days, westill have numerous important fiscalmeasures to consider.Tofacilitatetheirconsideration,House Resolutjon 527 waives the two-thirds requirement in clause 4(b) ofrule XI against any resolution, report-ed from the Rules Committee on orbefore the legislative day of October27. provicUng for consideration or dis-position of a reconciliation measure, aJoint resolution making continuing ap-proprations, a bill to extend the tem-porary Increasein the public debtlimit, or amendments to or conferencereports on such measures. The two-thirdsrequirementisalso wB!vdagainst any such resolution providingfor consideratIon or dlsposlt.iori of aconference report and amendments re-ported from conference in disagree-ment on sny general appropraticnsbill.October 25,1990CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 HOUSE H 11732Mr. Speaker, this rule merely ex-tends through Saturday the two-thirdswaiver under which the House hasbeen operating for the last severaldays. It permits the House for thenext 3 days. by majority vote, to con-sider a rule on these fiscal matters thesame day that it Is reported from theRules Committee.In addition the rule also makes it inorder, through the legislative day ofOctober 27, clause 2 of rule XXVIIInotwithstanding, to consider confer-ence reports and amendments report-ed from conference in disagreement onany general appropriation bill if copiesof the conference report, the accompanying statement, and the text of anyamendment reported in disagreement,are available for 2 hours before consideration. The requirement that confer-ence reports be printed in the CoN-GRE55IONAL REcoiw and lay over 3 daysis waived against appropriation conference reports.Finally, the rule provides that theconferencereports, amendments indisagreement and motions to disposeof amendments in disagreement in thejoint statement of managers will beconsidered as read.Mr. Speaker, we are all working hardto complete the business of this ses-sion.I urge my colleagues to adoptthis rule so the House can expeditious-ly consider by majority vote its re-maining fiscal matters.Mr. QUILLEN. Mr. Speaker, I thankthe gentlewoman for yielding and Iyield myseLf such times as I may con-sume.Mr. Speaker, the gentlewoman fromNew York (Ms. Sz UGWrZR) has ablyexplained the provisions of the rule,and I see nothing wrong with the rule.If the Democrats do not work with theRepublicans and give us ample notice,then there is a problem. But I havebeen assured that that would not takeplace.As we near the end of the Congress,legislation reported to the House mayneed to move promptly. In my 28 yearshere,in the closing days this hasalways been an appropriate procedure,and I see nothing wrong with it today.It is a limited agreement that appliesonly, as the gentlewoman from NewYork (Ms. Sz.uGrrzi) said, to speci-fied issues.Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to thegentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.WALKER).Mr. WALKER.Ithank the gentle-man for yielding.Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition tothis rule. We found out last night onthe floor what happens when youwaive the two-thirds requirement andbring massive bills to the floor. Youfind out that there Is stuff burleddown in them that no one knows whatis there and we have no idea what thenature of the legislation is. In manycases it is legislation where a handfulof people have sat in a room and madedecisions that then we are supposed toratify without ever seeing.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 HOUSEThe defense bill last night, everyonewho voted for the defense bill last night voted to ratify the decisions ofthree people, two from the other bodyand one from this body, who made thefinal determinations, and no one wasexactly certain what it was they decid-ed to do.We did It without reading the bill,because no one had a chance to seethe bill before it came to the floor.Now, what we are deciding to dohere in this room, just so Members un-derstand, is we are deciding to do thesame thing on reconciliation. Reconcil-iation is going to be a massive package.As I understand it, the deal still hasnot been made. We have heard a lot oftalk about the parameters of thatdeal, but they still have reduced noth-ing to writing. So when they finallyget to that moment when they havedetermined how many taxes will beraised, who they will go on, how manyspecial interest groups willget thebreaks that they have been ardentlyseeking out in Gucci Gulch, and whenwe get to all of those things, then theywill reduce it to writing and they willrush it to the floor, and under thisrule we will not be able to stop it, norwill we be able to see it.I have got real concerns about that.I understand, for instance, that someof the language that is buried down inthe reconciliation bill right now maybe things that some of us would havesome trouble with. For example, it hasbeen reported, and no one has seenthe papers yet, of course, but it hasbeen reported that one of the deci-sions made by the people in reconcilia-tion has been to eliminate the lumpsum retirement benefit for all Federalemployees as a cost-saving measure.But not all Federal employees. Onegroup is specifically exempted, Mem-bers of Congress get to keep theirlump sum retirement benefit, down inthe bill, buried down in the language.0 1140Now are we going to be able to findsome of these things to see whether ornot they stayed in or whether nor notthey were taken out? Maybe not, be-cause under this rule they will bringthe whole big package, all several hun-dred pages of it, to the floor. No onewill have read it, no one will know ex-actly what is in it, and yet we will beasked to approve it sight unseen.I would suggest that when we aretalking about raising gas taxes, raisingincome taxes, raising taxes on Insur-ance, raising taxes acorss the board,that it might be a good idea to take alook at what it is in the bill before weapprove it.I would suggest that maybe If whatwe are going to do Is increase thehealthinsurancetaxonworkersacross the board, and raise it to highnew limits and so on that will impactmiddle class families across this country, we ought to be able to see it.I would suggest that when we aregoing to Teduce the Medicare benefitaOctober 25, 1990in this country by maybe as much as$40 billion or more, that maybe weought to take a look at how they aredoing that before we vote on it.But under this rule we may not getthat chance. This rule will say that wecan bring it to the floor, waive therules of the House and consider Itwithout very much in the way of ob-servatiori.I think that is a shame, and I wouldask that we turn down the rule.Mr. MAZZOLI. Mr. Speaker, will thegentleman yield?Mr. WALKER. I am happy to yieldto the gentleman from Kentucky.Mr. MAZZOLI. Mr. Speaker, I mightdisagree with the gentleman on thedetails of our tax package. I think it isa good package, I think it is generallyequitable and progressive and doesprotect the Medicare recipients.But I would join with what the gentleman just said a moment ago aboutthis incredible thing I read in thepaperyesterday,wheresomehowMembers of Congress who are retiringwill be able to get their lump sum pay-ments. But with rare exception, noother Federal employee who does soafter thIs corning November has thatopportunity. I would join the gentle-man. I am told that as of this morn-ing, that the conferees on that part ofthe reconciliation bill have not finallymade up their minds, and I hope thatmaybe our dialog and perhaps otherMembers' statements will have someeffect on It.I think that would be absolutely outrageous. I think that would be an un-called-for perk that I think is indefen-sible, and I join with the gentleman.Mr. WALKER. Well, I thank thegentleman, and that is my point. Iregard that as outrageous.My problem is that I am not certainthat we will know all of the outragesthat are in this bill. We happened tofind out about that one, and havingfound out about it, having exposed itto the light of day, now evidentlythere are some reconsiderations aboutkeeping it in there.But if we have a bill on the floorthat is hundreds of pages thick, andwe are not certain what is in it, we willhave no idea what the outrages are. Iwould venture to guess that for a weekor two alter this,alter the billis passed, if in fact it passes the House,we will have newspaper stories aboutall of the special tax benefits thatwere put into the bill that benefit oneside or one company, that we will havea whole host of stories about the indlvidual little items that people got 83perks in the bill, that we had no ideaabout.I do not think that Is a way to legis-late, and I thank the gentleman foTyielding.Mr. QUILLEN.Mr.Speaker, I haveno further requests for time. and Iyield back the balance of my time.Ms. SLAUGHTER of New York. Mr.Speaker, I have no requests for time. I October 5, 1P90CONGRESSIONALRECORD \u2014HOUSE H 11733yieldback the balance-ofmy WALKER. Mr. Speaker.

Mr. Speaker, by di-rection of the Committee on Rules, Icall up House Resolution 537 and askfor its Immediate consideration.The Clerk read the resolution, as fol-lows:H.

Thegentleman from South Carolina (Mr.DERRICK] is recognized for 1 hour.Mr. DERRICK. Mr. Speaker, forpurposes of debate only, I yield thecustomary 30 minutes to the gentle-man from Tennessee (Mr. QuIuEN],pending which Iyield myself suchtime as I may consume.(Mr. DERRICK asked and was givenpermission to revise and extend his re-marks.)Mr. DERRICK. Mr. Speaker, I askunanimous consent that the time spec-ifiedfor debate on the conferencereport on H.R. 5835 be extended from1 to 2 hours.The SPEAKER protempore.Is there objection to the request of thegentleman from South Carolina (Mr.DERRICK]?There was no objection.Mr. DERRICK. Mr. Speaker, underthe rules of the House, conference re-ports are privileged and are consideredin the House under the hour rule withno amendments in order. House Reso-lution 537 waives all points of orderagainst the conference report on H.R.5835, the Omnibus Budget Reconcilia-CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 HOUSEtion Act of 1990, and against its con-sideration. The ruleprovidesthat when the conference report Is calledup for consideration, it shall be consid-ered as read. The rule divides the 2hours of debate equally between thechairmanandrankingminoritymember of the Committee on theBudget, and provides for one motionto recommit if offered by Mr. MICHELor his designee. Finally, the rule speci-fies that after disposition of the con-ference report by the House, that nofurther motionisin order In theHouse related to H.R. 5835 except assubsequently ordered by the House.Mr. Speaker, we are all eager tofinish our work for the year, so I willnot take much time here. As my col-leagues are well aware, the conferencereport on the Omnibus Budget Recon-ciliation Act of 1990 is the legislationimplementing thedeficitreductionplan agreed to at the budget summitas reflected in House Concurrent Res-olution 310, the concurrent resolutionon the budget for fiscal year 1991. Theconference report achieves deficit re-duction totalingapproximately $40billion in fiscal 1991 and $500 billionover 5 years.Mr. Speaker, also included in theconference agreement, and equallyvital to this deficit reduction effort,are the reforms to the congressionalbudget process. As a conferee, I ampleased to report that the strong en-forcement provisions in the House-passedbillhave been further im-proved in the conference committee.These reforms will Impose the strictbudgetary discipline we need to en-force the summit agreement and keepus on the deficit reduction path weembark upon today.Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members tosupport the rule and the reconciliationconference report.0140Mr. QUILLEN. Mr. Speaker, I yieldmyself as much time as I may use.Mr. Speaker, here itis 20 minutestill 2 on Saturday morning. We havehad long sessions, more Saturday andSunday sessions than we had sinceWorld War II, as I understand it. Thisis a very critical period in the fiscalhistory of this Nation of ours.We are about to enter into an indepth debate on the omnibus budgetreconciliationbill.Iurge my col-leagues to weigh very carefully theissues we are about to confront.Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to thegentlemanfromCalifornia(Mr.DREIER)..Mr. DREIER ofCalifoinia.Mr. Speaker,I thank my colleague foryielding the time.Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition tothe rule. I am really hard pressed tounderstand why, as the gentlemanfrom Tennessee said, we are here atnow 19 minutes before 2 o'clock. Likeeveryone, I am very tired, I am veryfrustrated with this process.1113011We have just had a long and drawnout meeting In which we have tried toput these numbers together, and theydo not seem to mesh. We do not knowIf this package Is going to be a $473billiondeficitreduction package, a$488 billion deficit reduction package,a $492 billion deficit reduction pack-age, or even maybe a $410 billionbudgetdeficitreductionpackage,which we had in the Kasich-Pursellpackage, but which we were not ableto consider. Why? Because it did notreach the $500 billion level.So Mr. Speaker, it seems to me thatthere is no way that we can bring up arule that provides 1 hour of debate ona measure which is going to have suchsweeping changes when it comes topublic policy.I urge a vote against the rule, and Ithank my friend for yielding.Mr. DERRICK. Mr. Speaker, forpurposes of debate only, I yield 4 mIn-utes to the gentlaman from Ohio (Mr.TRAPICANT3.(Mr. TRAFICANT asked and wasgiven permission to revise and extendhis remarks.)Mr. TRAFICANT. Mr. Speaker, I amgoing to support the nile. Memberswant to vote. And I am going tooppose the bill. I think it is un-Amen-can. I think it is another budget in along line of American budgets that isgreat for Japan and Germany.Any budget that increases foreignaid with our deficit is un-American.Any budget that will allow our Gov-ernment to forgive a $7 billion loan toEgypt when we are going belly-up isun-American.Any budget that will continue toallow billions and billions of dollars tobe spent on the protection of Japanand Germany, who are in good fiscalorder, is un-American.Any budget that will allow our tax-payers money to be used to build anew NATO airbase in Italy isUn-American.Ladies and gentlemen, it is over. TheWarsaw Pact is dead. We have missileswith no spare parts. We do not need amodification ofpolicies, we need achange.Let me just tell you how bad it is. Itwas cited in the newspapers of thiscountry several days ago that Germa-ny is paying Soviet soldiers to leave,and they will not go back home toRussia.

I know that we are probablygoing to pass this token piece of badlegislation, brought about with a shot-gun at the last minute. But I am goingto tell you what, I do not like my tax-payers getting a big hit, because mineare at the bottom of the list, and thatgasoline tax and all of those othertaxes hit mine much harder than theyhit yours.I am against it. I am going to votefor the rule so youcanall have yourvote. But count me out. 1 cannot andwill not vote for a budget that contin-ues to tax morn and dad and thenships it overseas.Mr. QtT1LLEN. Mr. Speaker, to clearup some misunderstanding, the gentle-man from South Carolina tMr. Dza-RICK) asked unanimous consent thatthe debate time on the reconciliationbill be extended to 2 hours. I wantedto make that clear.Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to thegentlemanfromOklahoma(Mr.IicHoFxl.Mr. INHOFE. Mr. Speaker, 1 rise to-night to suggest that you can have Itboth ways. It is possible to be support-ing a man that I think is a truly greatPresident, President Bush, and yetvote against the rule and vote againstthis budget that is coming up that weare being asked to consider tonight.The President did not do this. Thisbudget was conceived by the majority,the same liberal majority that has runthis country for half a century. We arelookingata budget tonight thatmaybe somebody else saw. Here it isalmost 2 o'clock in the morning. I didnot see any of this until midnight.Maybe someone else did, but I did not.We are asked to look at this andmake a malor decision without havingany time when we could do this at anytime tomorrow.This has been characterized by oneof the think tanks, on Informationavailable to them, as the single great-est tax Increase In American history,and the greatest speding increase inAmerican history,I do not know who benefits. It cer-tainly Is not the veterans. It is not theolder people, Medicare recipients orbeneficiaries and not the providerseither. They say the providers are notgoing to be hurt, but I do not knowabout the providers In your district,but I have four hospitals in Tulsa, OKthat are just barely holding on andthey are losing massive amounts ofmoney on their Medicare treatments.The assumptions that this is basedon, as near as I can determine, is a 4percent growth, and as near as 1 candetermine it is $24 oil. Neither one Is arealistic assumption.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 HOUSESo what could we do as an alterna-tive? I think there is an alternative to-night. I think we could vote down therule, vote down the bill, pass a con-tinuing resolution to February. Wewould be saving approximately a half-billion dollars a day until then. Go tothe elections on November 6, and eleetsome conservatives who are not goingto come in here and tax and spend andtax and spend. That is a better chancefor America,0150Mr. DERRICK. Mr. Speaker, I yield2 minutes to the distinguished gentle-man from New Mexico [Mr. RIcmutD-SONLMr. RICHARDSON asked and wasgiven permission to revise and extendhis remarks.)Mr. RICHARDSON. Mr. Speaker, 1received a letter from a constituentfrom New Mexico today:Dxsa CONGRZSSMAN Rzcsiwsoa I havevoted for you in every elect\u00e3on In which youhave run. I wasgoingto do so this year, butevents In Washington In recent weeks makeIt clear that the country is suffering fromIncumbency. No principle has as much Ira-portance to the House, Senate, or WhiteHouse than that of preserving incumbency.The NatIons economy,principles,and young people in the Mideast are to be sacri-(Iced so no Incumbent Is blamed for prob-lems or the solutions of problems so every-one can maintain their power based uponIncumbency. As you might guess from theabove. I plan to vote against you In Novem-ber. If we throw all the rascals out, maybethere Issomehope for our future.Mr. Speaker, there is good reason tovote for this deficit-reduction package,because It Is deficit-reduction packageand tax fairness. But 1 have three rea-sons why I think we should vote forthis tax package today: First, becausewe can get out; second, because we canget out; third because we can get out.Mr. QIJILLEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield5minutes tothe gentleman fromPennsylvania (Mr. WALKER].Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I thankthe gentleman for yielding me thisUme.Mr. Speaker, it certainly would be aprinciple to stand for for all of us tovote for the package simply so wecould go home.But I am a little bit concerned aboutthe way In which we are consideringthis In the package that we are consid-ering. It Is my understanding that acopy of the package was not evenavailable when this rule was adoptedin the Committee on Rules. Is thatcorrect' Has the conference report onthis been filed'The conference report has not beenfiled. The chairman of the Committeeon the Budget shakes his head. It hasnot been filed.There was no copy available of thispackagewhen theCommittee onRules adopted this rule. I do not seeany copies available on the floor. Wehave been handed a few sheets ofpaper here and there telling us pur-portedly what Is in the bill, but whenOctober 26, 19.90you begin to ask questions about ape-cifies that somehow we are not quiteFor example, over In the Republicanconference, we were given at leastthree or four different figures of whatthe final product may be In terms ofthe 5-year projected savings. We weretold this was going to meet a $500 bil-lion target. in (act, Republicans weretold that they could not have a rulethat brought their bill to the floor be-cause It fell below the $500 billiontarget Guess what, so does the pack-age that isaboutto come to us to-night.The highest figure we heard for thispackage In the R.epubllcan conferencewas $49 billion, and It ranged down to$473 billion. No one is quite certain ex-actly what the figure Is, but we knowIt Is not $500 bflllon. and so this rule isa little bit out of order 11 you takewhat the debate was Just the otherevening when we were told that theRepublicans could not bring theirpackage to the floor that fell belowthe $500 billion figure.I also am a little bit concerned aboutcalling this a deficit-reduction pack-age, because If we look at the numberson the sheet we were given In terms ofthe nominal dollars over the next 5years, you take a look at just the firstyear, the first year is the only yearthat means anything; 1991, all of usknow, Is the only year that means any-thing In this package, because we aregoing to be back here next year doingall of this all over again.What happensin1990Inthis budget-deficit-reduction package? The1991 go Revenues go up $106 billion over1990. Every dime of revenue is going topay for new spending, and so we havenotbudget-deficitreduction,wesimply have taxes going to pay for newspending.What happens to the deficit? Thatdeficit goes up by in thefirst my friends' Soundslike budget-deficit increases to me, cer-tainly In the first year.Then we are a little bit concernedabout what may be down in this pack-age. We know, for Instance, that thereis a cigarette tax in it of 8 cents apack. However, we are also told downIn it Is a $100 million tax gift to largecigar manufacturers. Hit the consumerwith B cents give the companies a bigbonanza.We are also told that there is a winetax In it, but then we are also told thatsome wineries are going to get hun-dreds of millions of dollars worth ofbenefits down In the package.We are also told that benefits aregoing to go to some foreign and domes-tic Insurance companies, to some pri-vate foundations, to some titleholdingcompanies, to some tax-exempt bondunderwriters, to some rental-tuxedostores. There is one low-income Amer-lea will appreciate. Get those rental- October 26, 1990tuxedo stores geared up for all thelow-income people across the country;crop dusters are also going to get alittle bit of out of this; transactions;estate-tax treatment; Bedford fishermen and a coupleof other little items that have beenthrown down into the package.I do not know if all of thoseare in there. We have been told that some ofthose are in there.I would like toknow. It would be handy to have thepackage on the floor before we vote onit. It might even be handy to have thepackage on the floor before we vote on the rule for the consideration, becauseit would be awfully nice to know thatat this early hour in the morning weare voting on something that theMembers actuallyhave some ideawhat it is. I do not think that is goingto be possible.At some point here, hopefully beforethe debate begins, we are going to filethe package on the floor. It will comeout here, I assume, in a pile of Xe-roxed sheets, and any Member that so desires can probably go and rootthrough the Xeroxed papers to findout whether or not some of thesethings I just mentioned are down inthere.Who knows, you might find one ofthem. Then again, you might not. Butyou can bet one thing, some day in thevery near future there will be head-lines in the paper telling us all aboutsome of the things that were down inthis package that we votedon in thedead of night.I would suggest that that is probablynot a position that most of us shouldwant to be in.Mr. QUILLEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield2 minutes the gentleman fromMichigan [Mr. PUR5ELL].Mr. PURSELL. Mr. Speaker, ladlesand gentlemen, the summit packagewas voted on in the middle of thenight. The Democratic budget planwas voted on in the middle of thenight. The gentleman from Ohio [Mr.KA5ICH] and myself were asked towrite a GOP plan which we did in the middle of the day, brought it to theCommittee on Rules and, loand behold,theCommitteeonRules denied us the rule to offer our plan to the American public in the middle ofthe night. Tonight, again, No. 4, fourstrikeouts in a row, we are voting on thisreconciliationpackageinthe middle of the night, and allover the week in which we talk about the greatcivil rights bill, the minority has beendenied the opportunity to present a plan to America to govern with lesstaxes and less spending.I think some Membersnow on theDemocratic side regret that decision.Give us a change to vote onour pack.age. We should have had that oppor-tunity. We are now here tonight look-ing at all of the appropriation bills.As a member of the Committee on Appropriations, I have calculated it isabout $32 billion of new spending over1990, so we are asking the Presidentwill he or will he not vote those high.spending bills in order to bring downthe deficit, in order to save money forthe American taxpayer.But, no, we are going to increase thistax package by $135 billion to $140 bil-lion of new money, new taxes.When the economy is pretty shaky, Icannot for the life of me tell you anyeconomist that say raise taxes in aperiod where we have a downturn ineconomic conditions in this country.So I say, Mr. Speaker, the Americanpublic and my State of Michigan whohave had several tax revolts, it is a cat-astrophic error tonight to vote for apackage that produces $150 billion innew taxes and jeopardizes the Ameri-can economy for the next 5 years.Mr. QUILLEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield2 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio[Mr. KA5IcH].Mr. KASICH. Mr. Speaker, I guessall we were trying to ask for hereabout a week\u20142 weeks ago from theCommittee on Rules was a degree offairness.We went to the Committee on Ruleswith a package that had $410 billionworth of deficit reduction over 5 years,so there never was any real questionabout whether it was enforceable, be-cause we did not put any new taxes in,and we were denied the opportunity tobring this to the House floor.It was not a money package. It was apackage that was printed out andcosted out by the CBO and the 0MB,and it had $410 billion in cuts.We were told that we would nothave an opportunity to offer thatpackage for the simple reason that we did not reach the $500 billion in deficitreduction.Tonight we are going to vote on a package that is also not going to reachthe $500 billion package, but yet thispackage is made in order.0 0200I understand that it is very diffcultwhen time comes to try to move some-thing, sometimes we cannot get caughtby the details. However, this is really a question of fairness. Here we have a group of people who worked togetherfor a long period of time on this sideof the aisle, who produced a responsi-ble alternative that did not raise thetaxes on the American people. Westood up to the plate, and we made thehard cuts that were demanded ofMembers. We reached $410 billion,and they said no. However, tonight.just a short week later, we come to thefloor, and now the $500 billion hasbeen changed.Baseball season is over, but if thiswas baseball season, last week we on]ygot 2 outs, and this week they get 4outs. That just is not fair.Now, why are we operating here at 2o'clock in the morning? First of all,the reason we are operating here at 2H 13013o'clockin the morningisbecausethose who support this package arefighting a war of attrition. Basically,they just hope every person will fallasleep or fall over before the timecomes tovote, and therewillbe enough people standing who will votefor their package., I will not fall asleep.I will vote against the package if forno other reason than the fact that wedid not have an opportunity to offerour alternative.However, what the gentleman fromPennsylvania (Mr. WALKER] pointedout a few minutes ago is mind-bog-gling. In the first year, $109 billion inadditional spending, paid for by $106billion in additional revenues, with adeficit of $34 billion. If the Americanpeople knew this, and knew that wewere doing it at 2 o'clock in the morn-ing, and if Members think they havebeen angry until now, wait until theywake up tomorrow morning and readthe headlines.Mr. QUILLEN. Mr. Speaker, yield2 minutes Illi-nois [Mrs. MARTIN].Mrs. MARTIN of fllinois. Mr. Speak-er, early this morning, most televisionstations in America signed off by play-ing the National Anthem. I mentionedthis because for some reason the occa-sion brings to mind the opening wordsof the Star Spangled Banner:Oh say can you see by the dawn's early lightWhat so proudly we hail.Those words come back to me, Mr.Speaker, because, quite frankly, we arenot being allowed tosee \"by thedawn's early light,\" what it is that isbeing so proudly hailed. For somereason, we are being asked to considerand debate and vote on a multimilliondollar tax package in the dead ofnight.The previous speaker said, \"Wait tillthepeopleread tomorrow'shead- lines.\" But tomorrow's headlines havealready been written, which is themain reason we are debating in thedead of the night.That does Members not proud, whenwe have the most Important and big-gest package of tax increases, perhapsin the history of the Republic, weshouldhavedonebetter.Decent people are on both sides of this issue.That debate could have heard and un-derstood by the American people. Itshould have been heard and under-stood by the American people.However, I do want to thank theleadership for changing their respec-tive mind on both sides of the aisle, as tired as we all are, to have originallyplanned only 1 hour of debate on this,made a mockery of the entire process.This was changed to 2 hours. For thatI am grateful, becauseIthinkit speaks well for those who at least un-derstand there should be some betterdebate.Mr. Speaker, whether you are for oragainst this bill, the American peopieare not benefiting by the road onwhich we reach our decision. I do noCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014HOUSE H 13014happen to believe that new taxes rethe answer, but I do not think anyMember tias to believe this is the wayto get to our decision.Mr. QtJILLEN.Mr.Speaker, I yield1 minute to the gentleman from Mm-nesot [Mr. FREizE!J.Mr. FRENZEL asked and was givenpermission to revise and extend his re-maits.Mr. FRENZEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise insupport of House Resolution 537, pro-siding (or the consideration of theconferenoe report or H.R. 5835, theOmnibus Reconciliation Act of 1991.This rule waives all points of orderagainst the conferenee report. I sup-port this nile simp'y because the timehas come to stop posturing and enact aplan to reduce the Federal budget def-jeit.1 need not really remind anyone ofthe long and painful journey we havetaken toarriveat the conferencereport. It aU started almost 9 monthsago when the President submitted hisbudget. This bodyrespondedwith a partisan, parochial plan of its own. Wethen endured 5 months of summit ne-gotiations cu'minating incampout atAndrews Air Force Base. Three weeksago this body voted against this prod-uctofour labors,the conferencereport on the budget resolution. Aftersome fine tuning, a conference reporton the budget reso'ution was ultimate-ly passed. Lest week, the House passeda recon.ciliaUon bill to comply with thebudget resolution. Today, we finallyhave the opportunity to see the prod-uct of our labors enacted into law.1, as much *s anyone, have somedoubts about the reconciliation bill.Most importantly, it fails to make realreductAons in nondefense discretionaryspending.Itreliestooheavily ontaxes. It does not do enough to rein ingrowth in entitement programs otherthan Medicare and Medicaid. And itfails to reconcile $3 billion in deficitreduction not allocated to committee.Yet even with these shortcomings, itis stil& a package that deserves oursupport. it provides real deficit reduc-tion in the amounts of about $42 bil-lion infiscal year 1991, and about$49.2 billion over 5 years. Growth indiscretionary spending is held down tothe rate of inflation. Serious effortshave been made to slow down the ex-plosive growth in Medicare, one of thefastest growing Federal programs.. F-nafly, the enforcement provisions giveus a tool to control the explosivegrowth in entitlement programs.Let us not (orget the challengebefore us. We must rein in our deficitsbecause they threaten the vitality ofour Nation's economy. Our untamedbudget deficits serve only to drive upinterest rates, increase our dependenceon foreign capital, and push the econ-omy toward recession.If we are to gain contro' over thesedeficits we must take the compromisesthat the people demand of their elect-ed representAves.

I think theAmerican people recognize that..

We have talked about thisbubb'e. We re going to sock it to therich. Right, because when we get outof the bubble, and we finally get to a28-percent rate, those are the peopleIn the highest income bracket. Now wewill take them to 31 percent.Well, with the payraise that thisbody voted itself, next year we will bemaking about $12'7,000 a year, right?By putting a 31-percent top rate, mar-ginal rate, we are all going to enjoy &magnificent tax break. We will saveourse'ves about $1,000 in taxes thatotherwise we would have to pay. Now,of course, we are not rich. We are onlyIn the top 5 percent of income bracc-ets In this !ation.

Mr. Speaker, I yield2 minutes to the gentleman from Iowa(Mr. LIGHTFOOTLMr. Speaker, I spent this afternoonand tnost of this evening working withsome economic development peop'e,chamber of commerce folks, peopleworkingwiththecensus,countyagents, people with State tax roBs. October 26 1990Iwent through a little drill that Ithink will be instructive to anyiewho has not decided what they wantto do with this particular package.In my State of Iowa, a typical coin.munlty M about 5,500. It has about2,600householdswith a medianIncome of $26,860. With the IncreasesIn Income tax of about $107, coupledwith the excise taxes of around $269.multiplied by those homes, my littlecommunity, which has $13,000,000 Inretail mica, will lose $979,056 from thepeople who live In it.We also are In a farming area. If youreach out and take In the farmers Inthe trade area, which I figured at 945farms, based on one county, thosepeople will lose $450,349 through in-creased income taxes, and through thefarm bill which we passed this week,losing 6 percent off of a $67 milliongross, an additional $4,049,372.So this little rural community out InIowa Is going to lose $5,479,000.32 Incold hard cash, which Is 42 percent ofthat little community's annual retailsales.So I would suggest to any of youwho have not taken timeto go through thIs package and see what Itdoes to you and your community, todo it.Mr. Speaker, I urge a no vote on therule, a no vote on the package, and Ihavealready voted no on the farm bilLMr. QUILLEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield2 mInutes to the gentleman from Flor-ida (Mr. JAMES].Mr. JAMWR.Mr.Speaker, I am con-cerned. We are told we have a deficitreduction package. Yes, a deficit re-duction package from $300 billion, al-legedly. It Is a $46 billion reduction,one-sixth of the $300 billion Is cut. ItIs not much of an effort.Then there was some argument fromthegentleman from Pennsylvania(Mr. Wauczs] that that does not evenexist, that you are still worse off be-cause there Is more spending than rev-enues. I do not know which Is correct,nor will I presume to say which Is cor-rect.But what I sin- concerned about Isthe process that we are followingunder this rule in the1 hour ofdebate, based on a presentation of fig.ures and feets that none of us havehad time to examine.What I am concerned about Is theso-called hidden bills that will benefitspecific corporations that Mr. Darmancould not answer for us today. Weasked him that question point blank,\"Can you promise us there is no spe-cial benefit to a corporation that wewill later find out about by listening tothe news?\"No such representation could bemade.Indeed, we could have the equivalen-cy of a catastrophic health Insurancetype problem or somethIng almost asembarrassing as Barbados or some-thing of that nature In relationship tothe breaks that may occur in that bill,and yet we are doing It at this hour ofCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014HOUSEthemorning.ThatIsabsolutelyabsurd when you are staring eyeball toeyeball at no less than $250 billion Indeficits in this next year.In 5 years, we will have a $5 trilliondeficit., some say. If we are admittingthat It Is $5 tzilllon now, what Indeedwill it be in 5 years?You cafl it a deficit reduction pack-age? That Is almost an obscenity touse that terminology when you have a$250 billion debt, and to follow thisrule with a 1-hour debate Is absurd.Mr. Speaker, I will vote against therule. I will vote against the bill, and Isubmit that anyone with one degree orounce of sanity will do likewise.Mr. QUILLEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield1 minute to the gentleman from Arizo-na tMr. Kri.J.Mr. KTh Mr. Speaker, this Is a sadnight in the Rouse of Representatives.When prisoners are held, they aremade more compliant by two tech-niques: deny them sleep and denythem information.IfthisruleIs adopted, we will be denied both whenwe debate and have to ultimately actupon this bill.What Is lost In allowing this bill tolay over just a few hours that It wouldtake to at least print It 80 that peopleCould read It to know what Is In It? Iam afraid we know the answer. Wewill know what Is In ft and It is likelyto pass.That is why this rule must be adopt-ed, so we get on with the business ofpassing a bill before the Americanpeople can find out what we are doing.But as one of my colleagues pointedout, In a couple weeks the editorIallst.will be pointing out what we did andthen many of us will regret that wevoted aye on the bill.For that reason, Mr. Speaker, I sug-gest a no vote on the bill.Mr. QUILLEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield2 mInutes to the gentleman NewMexico tMr. Scuir,].Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, for thelast number of hours I have beenwatching and listening to news corn-inentators discuss this new proposedconference report and debate the prosand cons of It, just a., It they have ac-tually read It.Mr. Speaker, I do not think anyone,except perhaps a few chosen, have ac-tually read this agreement. It is noteven available here on the House floortonight for us to look at at this time.What I would like to tell the Ameri-can people Is what we do have to lookat. I received a printout listed at 4:43p.m. that said the total tax revenues Inthe conference report would be $J.37,2billion. That was at 4:43.About almost 3 hours later, at '110,there was a new printout that said thetotal tax Increase of the conferencereport would be $146.6 billion. Thatmeans In about 3 hours, taxes justwent up by about $13 billion, or Itmeans the Information In one or bothof these reports is not accurate.The final sheet I have suggests thatthe actual budget reduction proposed1113015Is $4'73 billion, but the distinguishedchairman of the Budget Committeesays that the actual budget reductionis $490 billion.If the distinguishedchairman Is correct, where is the other$17 billion coming from? We just donot know. That is why the rule shouldbe defeated and we should examinethis conference report in the light ofday.Mr. QUILLEN. Mr. Speaker, I yieldmyself 30 seconds.Mr. Speaker, I urge the Members tovote for the rule. After *11, 2 hours ofgeneral debate might be enlighteningto all of us.Mr. Speaker, I yIeld 2 minutes to thegentleman from Virginia (Mr. BATE-MAN].Mr.BATEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, the gentlemanfrom Tennessee (Mr. QuILLsii] foryielding me this time.Mr. Speaker, It has been indeed a bi-zarre session, this Second Session ofthe 101st Congress. All of us need tobe disappointed and concerned at ourfailure to have acted more timely thanwe have acted, but this bizarre sessionhopefully is coming to aclose.It must come to a close.This Is Saturday, October 21,21 daysInto the Federal fiscal year. At mid-night of this day, the Government ofthe United States closes up again,unless we either enact this resolutionor another continuing resolution.0 0220The people of the United States areweary of this struggle. They are wearyof our Indecisiveness. You can pick upthis package, you can tell all of thethings that are bad about it, but Iwould suggest, especially to my col-leagues on this side of the aisle, thatthere Is no other package left. TheAmerican people are looking to us togive them a deficit reduction package,and they will take some flaws if theyget the package, and this Is that pack-age.It has been said this is not the full$500 billion, but do we have a packagethat we can muster a majority of thevotes In this [louse or the other Houseto pass that $500 billion package? Is Itany better than this package?The time has come, the Americanpeople will hold those who make It Im-possible for deficit reduction to be en-acted accountable for our failure to doso and bringing the Government oncemore to a state of crisis and to closure.Mr. Speaker, I would urge supportfor this rule, I would urge support forthe package.pALriMuwIyI1QUmYMr.HENRY.

Mr. Speaker, I movethe previous question on the resolu-tion, as modified.The previous question was ordered.The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr.Speaker,I object to the vote on the ground thata quorum is not present and make thepoint of order that a quorum is notpresent.The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I yield2 minutes to the distinguished chair-man of the Committee on the Budget,the gentleman from California (Mr.PrnJ.(Mr. PANETI'A asked and was givenpermission to revise and extend his re-marks.)Mr. PANETIA. Mr. Speaker, we arein these last final hours. I, too, recog-nize that we are tired and exhausted.It has been a long road.The rule is, obviously, essential tothe process of taking up the confer-ence report on reconciliation.I would urge Members to pass andadopt the rule so that we can proceedto that debate.I guess what I would hope is that aswe enter that debate, maybe for justone moment in this session, that onemoment on the debate, we could setaside the political differences and thepartisan attacks and all the finger-pointing andalltheexcuses andmaybe just for that moment focus onthe interest of the country and debatethe fact that we face a very seriousproblem that has to be confronted, adeficit approaching $300 billion, a na-tional debt over $3.2 trillion.The Americanpeoplehave hadenough of fooling around in the sensethat we try to kid them that somehowwe can confront the deficit and it doesnot Involve pain, it does not involvesacrifice.The fact is it does.That is what this package is all about. We have a very large deficit re-duction package, It consists of 70 per-cent spending savings and about 29percent in revenues.It is balanced, It is fair. In terms ofthe package itself, it largely reflectsmany of the elements in the summitagreement, many of the elements obvi-ously adopted in the budget resolu-tion, in budget reconciliation, and allof the Members have seen those pack-ages and seen what the elements ofthose are.We have had 12 committees workingto come up with these savings and pro-ducing them, with the last 2 havingcompleted her vote from\"yea\" to \"nay.\"So the resolution as modified, wasagreed to.The result of the vote was an-nounced as above recorded.A motion to reconsider was laid onthe table. LEGJSLITJIE1)I J SOCIAL SECLj/Ti\" i I I 11a1I I I ADM/N/STATION--- fw_Nuixther101\u201414 May 2, 1990SOCIAL SECURITy 2,1990 Waysand Means' Subcommittee on Social Securityapproved and orderedreported to the full comiitteea package of social security proposals.It is unclear whenthe committee will act on the proposals.The subco1nitteeprepared suxnary of the proposals is attached.Attachment SUMMARY OF SOCIAL SECURITY PROPOSALS1.Establishment of the Social Security Administration as anindependent agencyThe Social Security Administration (SSA) would be removedfrom the Department of Health and Human Services (HBS) andestablished asan independent agency with responsibility for theOld Age, and Survivors Insurance and Disability Insurance(OASDI) programs and the Supplemental Security Income (SSI)program.The new agency would be under the authority of athree\u2014member, bipartisan Social Security Board appointed.by thePresident.The Board would formulate policy for the independentagency and would appoint an Executive Director to direct itsday\u2014to\u2014day operations.2.Improvements in Social Securiy Administration services andbeneficiary protectionsImprovements would be made in SSA procedures for recoupingoverpayinents, responding to telephone requests, providingoutreach to homeless individuals, and issuing notices toclaimants and beneficiaries. In addition, in cases where aclaimant who is denied benefits reapplies rather than appealingbased on inaccurate or misleading information from SSA, thefailure to appeal would not constitute a basis for denial of thesecond application. 3.Restoration of telephone access to the local offices of theSocial Security AdministrationSSA would be required to reestablish telephone access toits local offices at the level generally available on October 1,1989, the date on which it established a national 800 number andcut off most of Its local office telephones. 4.Improvements in the representative payee systemThe proposal would improve the representative payee systemby: 1) requiring the Secretary of Health and Human Services toconduct a more extensive investigation of the representativepayee applicant; 2) providing stricter standards in determiningthe fitness of the representative payee applicant to managebenefit payments on behalf of the beneficiary; and 3) directingthe Social Security Administration to compile and maintain alist of those serving as representative payees including thebeneficiaries they serve.5.Streamlining of the attorney fee payment processThe process by which SSA approves any fee charged by anattorney representing a claimant before the agency would bereformed.The current fee petition process would be replaced by a streamlined procedure under which fees would be paid up to alimit of 25 percent of past-due benefits not to exceed $4,000unless the attorney or claimant objects. 6.Paymentofbenefits to a child adopted by a surviving spouseAchild adopted by the surviving spouse of a deceasedworker would be entitled to benefits regardless of whether he orshe was receiving support from anyone other than the worker andthe worker's spouse, so long as the child had either lived withthe worker or received one-half support from the worker in theyear preceding the worker's death.7.Use of the social security number by certain legalizedaliensCertain aliens who applied for, and were granted, amnestyunder the provisionsof theIninigration Ref orixi and Control Actof1986would be exempted from criminal penalties for fraudulentuse of a social security card. The exemption would not apply tothose individuals who sold social security cards, possessed.cards with intent to sell, or who counterfeited or possessedcounterfeited cards with the intent to sell. 8.Make permanentthecontinuation of disability benefitsduring appealThe provision in current law permitting disabilitybeneficiaries to elect to have their disability continued duringappeal would be iade perixianent. 9.Improvement of the definition of disability applied todisabled widow(er) sThe stricter definition of disability which is now appliedonly to widows would be repealed. A disabled widow would besubject to the same definition of disability as is alreadyapplied to disabled workers.10.Waiver of the two-year waiting period for certain divorcedspousesThe two-year waiting period for independent entitlement todivorced spouse's benefits would be eliminated for individualswho were entitled to benefits on their former spouse's recordprior to the divorce.11.Paymnent of benefits to a deemed spouse and a legal spouseEligibility requirements for payment of benefits to a\"deemed spouse\" \u2014\u2014thespouse whose narriage is found to beinvalid \u2014\u2014wouldbe changed so that the entitlement of theworker's legal spouse would no longer teriinate benefits to adeemed spouse. 12.Increase in the retirement test for workers ge 65\u201469The retirement test exempt amount for beneficiaries age65\u201469 who work would e raised by $240 in 1991 and $480 in 1992.This increase would be in addition to the automatic annualincrease in the exempt amount, which reflects the annualincrease in wages in the economy. The projected thresholdswould ke raised in 1991 from $9,960 (under current law) to$10,200, and in 1992 from $10,440 (under current law) to$10, 92Q.13.Creation of a vocational rehabilitation denionstrationproj ectSSA would be required to carry out a demonstration projectat three separate sites testing the advantages and disadvantagesof perndtting disabled social security beneficiaries to select aqualified vocational rehabilitation provider, either public orprivate, from which to receive services aimed at enabling themto obtain work and leave the disability rolls.14.Reduction in wages needed for a year of coverage toward thespecial inirnurn benefitThe amount of earnings needed to earn a year of coveragetoward the special minimum benefit (designed to assistlong\u2014term, low\u2014wage workers) would be reduced from 25 percent ofthe old\u2014law contribution and benefit base ($10,125 in 1991), to15 percent of the base ($6,075 in 1991).15.Collection of eniployee social security tax on group-ternlife insuranceIn cases where an employer continues to provide taxablegroup-tern life insurance to an individual who has left hiseniploynent, the former employee would be reuired to pay theemployee portion of the social security tax directly. (Toaccomplish this, the owed tax would be listed separately on theforner eniployee's W-2, and 1040 filing instructions wouldmodified to direct filers to add this amount to their taxliability).16.Charging of earnings of corporate directorsThe provision of current law that treats directors'earnings as taxable when the services to which they areattributable are performed would be repealed. Directors'earnings would continue to be treated as received when theservices are performed for purposes of the social securityretirement test. 17.Recovery of overpayments frou former social securitybeneficiaries refund offsetSSAwouldbe perzitted to recover overpayinents from forzerbeneficiaries through arrangements with the Internal RevenueService (IRS) to offset the forzer beneficiary's tax refund.This authority would remain in effect so long as the existinggovernment\u2014wide offset program remains in effect (currently,until January 10, 1994).38.Preeffectuation review of favorable decisions by the SocialSecurity AdministrationThe percentage of favorable decisions made by Statedisability deterzination services that rust be reviewed by SSAwould be reduced from 65 percent of all such decisions to 50percent of allowances and as many continuances as are requiredto maintain a high level of accuracy in such decisions. Thereviews would be targeted on those cases most likely to containerrors.19.Repeal of retroactive benefits for certain categories ofindividualsRetroactive benefits would no longer be available for twocategories of individuals eligible for reduced benefits: (1)those with dependents entitled to unreduced benefits, and (2)those with pre-retirenent earnings over the auount allowed underthe retirement test who may use the retroactive benefits tocharge off their excess earnings.20.Consolidation of old computation of dependent's benefits when a disabled workeris in an extended period of eligibilityThe proposal would codify current SSA practice regardingthe non-paynent of benefits to a disabled worker's dependentswhen that worker is in an extended period of eligibility due towork and thus is not receiving nonthly social security benefits.22.Technical auendinentsThe proposals would correct a number of technical errorsrelated to social security.

The current estimates are that an increase inthe debt ceiling is necessary for the Government to continueto meet its obligations beyond mid-August; the proposedincrease is expected to suffice through September 1991.In addition, the committee agreed to a short-term increase inthe debt limit to $3.195 trillion that would carry theGovernment until October 15. The short-term extension isdesigned as a faliback if the longer term extension stalls.The committee also agreed to seek a rule for House floorconsideration of the committee-reported legislation thatwould allow for consideration as a single floor amendment oftwo Social Security-related proposals:\u2014-aproposal by Representative Dorgan that would excludethe Social Security trust funds from the calculation ofthe budget deficits for purposes of the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings (GRR) Balanced Budget Amendment.\u2014-aproposal by Chairman Rostenkowski which would requirethat future Social Security benefit increases or taxreductions be cost-neutral and require that annualtrustees reports include a statement about closeactuarial balance.

OBRA of 1989 required IRS, SSA, and HCFA to exchange information to improve identification and collection of Medicare secondary payer cases; this requirenient expires September 30, 1991. The secondary payer requirement for the disabled expires January 1, 1992. The committee's bill extends these two provisions through fiscal year 1995.19.Part B Premium. \u2014-Thecommittee agreed to set Medicare Part B premiums at 25 percent of estimated outlays for 1993 through 1995, with the stipulation that no individual's preniium increase could exceed the increase in Social Security cash benefits. 70.Cost sharing for qualified Medicare Deneficiaries. \u2014\u2014The conunittee agreed to require State Medicaid plans, effectiveJanuary 1, 1991, to pay all Medicare cost sharing charges forQualified Medicare Beneficiaries who have incomes up to 100 percent of the Federal poverty level.

A.Social SecurityMake Penianent the Continuation of Disability BenefitsDurinq Appeal. \u2014 Theprovision would permanently extend anexpiring (December 1990) provision of law that allowsbeneficiaries to have disability benefits continued pending anappeal of an adverse decision. Benefits are subject.to repayittentif the appeal is denied.Improvement of the Definition of Disability For DisabledWidows. \u2014Widow(er)sare now able to claim disability benefits atage 50, but must meet stricter definition than workers. Thischange would make the definition for widow(er)s the same as forworkers.payment of Benefits to a Child Adopted by a SurvivingSpouse.\u2014Thepresent law rules for payment of survivor'sbenefits to a child adopted after a worker's death would be easedto allow payment if the child either lived with the worker orreceived one-half support from the worker in the year prior todeath.Improvements in the Representative Payee System. \u2014Rulesforselection of representative payees would be tightened to providebeneficiaries with greater protection. In addition, certain non-profit social service agencies would be allowed to charge feesfor providing representative payee services. 3t.raiilining of the Attorney Fee Payment Process \u2014The process for payment of attorneys' fees in cases where recipients are awarded past\u2014due benefits would be si]nplifjed to expedite payment of fees.1rovements in Social Security Administration Servicesand beneficiary'Protections. \u2014Theprovision establishes a SSA's toll\u2014 free telephoneservice, andprotects the rights of individuals to reapply for benefits if they have been given incorrect information by SSA.Restoration of Telephone Access to the Local Offices ofthe ocial Security Adniinistration. \u2014Telephoneaccess to local Security offices would be restored to the level in effect on Septenther 30, 1989, (the date prior to the cut\u2014off of direct telephone access to most local offices).Irnprovement in Earnings and Benefit Statements. \u2014Current law requiresSSA, beginning in the year 2000, to send all workers covered by Social Security a statenient concerning earnings and potential benefits at least every 2 years.This anlendnientwould require that the statenients be sent annually, rather than biennially.continuation of Benefits on Account of Participation ma Non-State Vocational Rehabilitation Procram. \u2014Thisprovision incorporatesa recommendation of the 1988 Disability Advisory Council.it allows beneficiaries who medicallyrecover while participating in an approved non-State vocational rehabilitation prograni the sanie benefit continuation rights as those who niedicllyrecover while Participating in a State-sponsored prograni.Provide a Rolling 5\u2014Year Trial Work Period for All Disabled Beneficiaries. \u2014Currentrules would be liberalized to provide that a disabled beneficiary will exhaust his 9\u2014nionth trial work period only if he performs substantial gainful activity in any 9 months ina rolling 60\u2014month period (rather than being linilted to a single trial work period inany one period of disability).Limitation on New Entitlement to Siecial AcTe-72 Payments. \u2014 Theprovision would preclude the unintendedpayment of so\u2014called \"Prouty benefits\" enacted in 1966 to help workers who were too old to qualify for regular benefits. Because of subsequent amendnients, it is theoretically possible for some workers to qualify for Prouty benefits after 1999, even though, when enacted, theywere not expected to be paid to anyone who reached age 72 after 1971. 4 Modification of Advance Tax Transfer \u2014Thetrust fundswould be credited with tax receipts as they are collectedthroughout the month, rather than in advance (at the first of themonth), as under current law.However, the advance tax transfernechanisin (enacted to help meet the Social Security fundingemergency that existed prior the the 1983 amendments) would beretained as a contingency to be used if the trust funds drop tosuch a low level that it is needed in order to pay currentbenefits.The present crediting rules can present Treasury witha situation inwhich trust fund assets cannot be invested becausethe debt limit has been reached.Reea1 of Retroactive Benefits for Certain Catecories ofIndividuals \u2014\"Windfall\"retroactive benefits, currently payableto workers aged 62 to 64, and their eligible dependents, would beel unmated.Consolidation of Old Computation Methods. \u2014Oldcomputationiethods which require ianual intervention would be eliminated,and newer computation methods which ay be fully processed bycomputer would be substituted.No benefits paid to individualsalready on the rolls would be reduced.Suspension of Dependent's Benefits When a pisabled Worker isin an Extended Period of EligibilitV -Theprovision wouldcodify current SSA policy. A dependent of a disabled beneficiarYcould receive benefits for a month only if the disabled workerreceived benefits for that nonth.Cross-Referencina of Railroad Retirement Tier 1 Tax Rate tQthe Federal Insurance Contributions Act. -Theprovision wouldamend the Railroad Retirement Tax Act toprovide that therailroad retirement tier 1.taxrate would bedetermined by cr055reference FICA.Budgetary Treatment of Social Security. \u2014Thecommittee willinclude in itsreconciliation submission a recommendation thatthe income and outgo of the SocialSecurity trust funds,including Social Security tax revenues and other elements oftrust fund income such as interest, transfers of receipts fromthe income taxation of benefits, and other payments to the trustfund, be excluded from any calculations of the surplus or deficitof the generalgovernment including the deficit totals used forpurposes of applying the sequestration provisions of the BalancedBudget and Emergency Deficit control Act (\"Gramnm-Rudlflan\"). 5 B. Supplemental Security IncomeWork Incentives. \u2014Theseamendments to the SS1statuteare designed to remove disincentives to employment for disabled SSX recipients.They would:oallow disabled recipients to continue to participate in a special work incentive provision (\"section 1619\") even after they reach age 65;oexpand the provision under which benefits are not reduced because of earnings that are needed to pay for impairment-related work expenses (the expansion would apply this rule for initial eligibility and would also require States to apply it for purposes of State supplements to SSI);otreat certain royalties as earned income. (Unearned income causes a dollar-for\u2014dollar reduction in benefits. Earned income is partly disregarded. This provision would apply the more favorable treatment to royalties which are based on an individual's personal efforts.)Evaluation of Child's Disability by Pediatricians. \u2014This provision would direct the Secretary to make reasonable efforts to ensure that a qualified pediatrician or other specialist in a field of medicine appropriate to the disability of the child evaluate the child's disability for purposes of determining eligibility for SSI.Concurrent ATrnljcatjons for SSI and Food Stamps. \u2014The198'6 Drug Abuse Act directed HHS andAgriculture to take a single application for SSI and food stamps from institutionalized individuals who are about to be released.That Act requires a single application form. This amendment would give the Administration the option of using a single form or two separate forms in taking a joint application.Disregard of Trust Contributions. \u2014Atrust established for an SSI recipient to which the recipient does not have legal access would not be counted as a resources, and certain non-cash contributions to the recipient from that trust would not be counted as income. The Social Security Administration would be required to inform the family of a child who receives a retroactive payment as the result of the Supreme Court decision in Sullivan v. Zebley that they may be able to place that payment in a trust for the child. 6 TAX CREDITS/CHILD CAREThere wouldbe three refundable tax credits for low an expansionofthe earned income tax credit(family size adjustment); a child health insurance credit; and arefundable dependent care credit. An expansion of funding forchild care under title IV of the Social Security Act and childcare provisions under the jurisdiction of the Labor and HumanResources Committee would also be included.DEBT LIMIT EXTENSIONThe committee's reconciliation submission includes a debt limitextension in accordance with the budget resolution directive toprovide for an increase in the debt limit not exceeding$1,900 billion.
