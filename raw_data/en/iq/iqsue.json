If tunneling begins, extinguish flame, and use fingers to mold warm wax walls towards the wick. This will allow for optimal use of the wax and will raise wax level to help lessen an over-sized flame. - To prevent excessive smoke and wick charring, extinguish wick by using a tool to dunk the wick in the wax pool and return the wick to an upright position. - Always burn on a level surface and NEVER leave unattended.
