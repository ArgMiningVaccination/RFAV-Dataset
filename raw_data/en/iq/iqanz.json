Material and methods: Totally 42 patients with various thyroid diseases were selected for the prospective research of carbon nanoparticle injection used in thyro i- dectomy. Another 42 patients without receiving carbon nanoparticle injection were selected as the control group. All cases underwent total or subtotal bil a- teral thyroidectomy. Before the ligation of the superior and inferior poles of the thyriod lobes , 0.1 mL of a carbon nanoparticle suspension was injected into the two poles. Important tissues such as the recurrent laryngeal nerve, parathyroid gland with blood supply and the inferior thyroid artery were identified and protected. Results: The parathyroid glands with vasculature were not stained and thus remained the primary color in all cases , while a b- normal thyroid tissues wer e stained black. After 5 minutes , thyroid lobes were injected with the carbon nanoparticle suspension and the original color of parathyroid glands was unchanged. Even the parathyroids with blood supply can be identified and protected. The number of parathy roid glands for aut o- transplantation was one in the test group and six in the control group. At one day after the thyroid surgery, hypocalcemia became detectable in four p a- tients of the test group and in five of the control group. Twenty- four i n- stances of h ypoparathyroidism occurred at 1 day after surgery in the control group , while ten instances in the test group. Conclusion: Intraoperatvie car- bon nanoparticle suspension injection is an effective and safe technique for guiding thyroid surgery. The carbon na noparticle suspension plays an im- portant role in identifying the vasculatural parathyroid glands , while protec t- ing the physiologic function of the parathyroid glands during surgery.

DOI: 10.4236/ym.2021.52009 parathyroid gland (PTG) is one of the most important parts during the parathyroid and thyroid surgery. The main cause for postoperative hypocalcemia complication is the iatrogenic i njury and inadvertant excision of PTG or vasculature. About 9.9% of thyroid patients undergoing surgical trea t- ment suffer from postoperative hypocalcemia for parathyroid dysfunction a c- cording to a multicenter survey of Europe [1] . Until now , identification and preservation of PTGs have mostly relied on the experience of surgeons [2] . The effective methods for identification of PTGs are parathyroid hormone (PTH) assay and pathyologicalexamnation [3]. However accurate and quick intraope r- ative localization of PTGs is the key po int to protect vasculatural PTG for min i- mizing postoperative complications and improv e the quality of life of pati ents. Recently, Jindong Li et al. found a negative s taining method of PTGs through carbon nanoparticle (CNPs) diffusion in the lymphatic vessels [4]. In our study , we aimed to safely identify and protect PTGs and blood supply by using CNPs suspension in thyroid surgery. Herein , we demonstrate an easy and rapid negative staining approach for intraoperative identification of vasculatural PTGs using a read y-made CNPs suspension (0.5 ml ampol , Lai Mei Pharmaceutical Co ., Chongqing, China). 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Patients This clinical study was approved by the local ethic committee. All informed consents were signed by the patients before surgery. Between January 2017 and January 2020, 84 thyroid tumor patients underwent thyroid surgery at the First Affiliated Hospital of Yangtze University ( Table 1 ). Surgical indications for treatment were as follows: thyroid carcinoma (n = 47) and benign thyroid tumor (n = 37). Exclusion criteria were as follows: preoperative neck surgery, preopera- radiotherapy. An e- rienced operation team conducted a ll the surgeries with the general anesthesia. Serum calcium and PTH levels were checked before surgery to assess hypopara- thyroidism or hypocalcemia. Hypocalcemia was defined as serum calcium level < 2 mmol/l (normal range 2 - 2.8 mmol/l) with oral paresthe sia or laryngospasm [5]. The serum PTH level < 15 pg/ml (normal range 15 - 68.3 pg/ml) means h y- poparathyroidism [6] [7]. The clinical manifestations of hypocalcemia were re c- orded , such as laryngospasm , seizure and oral paresthesia. Pathological findings C. C. Yin et al.

Intraoperative Identification of PTG All patients underwent total thyroidectomy with a trandional ly low-collar inc i- sion. For each patient, the anterior muscles of the neck were retracted to expose the surgical thyroid lobe ( Figure 1 ). Without excessive dissection , a nanocarbon suspension (0.5 ml ampol ) was slowly injected into the abnormal lobe using a 1-mL syringe with a skin test needle in the upper and lower poles of the gland (0.1 ml each pole , if the abnormal thyroid was small , the injection point was only one). Before injecting the suspension , we pulled back on the syringe to avoid the injection of CNPs into the blood vessels ( Figure 1 ). Then the puncture point was gently pressed for 1 minute with gauze. We can observe and localize the PTG a f- ter the nanocarbon injection, despite the hardness to find and the tiny size. Ti s- sues, such as the vascular PTG , were identified and dissected ( Figures 2 -4), while the thyroid gland was stained black. The superior pole was ligated and cut close to the thyroid capsule by preserving the posterior branches of superior thyroid artery (STA) for superior PTG after the gland developed completely within 3 - 5 minutes. The terminal branches of the inferior thyroid a rtery (ITA) were preserved for the inferior parathyroid after cutting of ITA ( Figure 2 ). If the frozen -section diagnosis was confirmed as thyroid cancer , total thyroidectomy with central lymphy node dissection was performed. 3. Statistical Analysis Data were analyzed by SPSS 23.0. The preoperative and postoperative data were expressed as mean \u00b1 standard deviation (X \u00b1 s) for analysis, and compared b e- tween groups using Student's t test and the 2 test. When P was <0.05 , the v a- riance between preoperative and postoperative data of the two groups was si g- nificant. C. C. Yin et al. DOI: 10.4236/ym.2021.52009 82 Yangtze Medicine Figure 1 . After carbon nanoparticles suspension injected . We retracted the anterior mus- cles of neck to expose the surgical thyroid lobe. Without excessive dissection , the n a- no-carbon suspension (0.5 ml ampol , Lai Mei Pharmaceutical Co , Chongqing , China) was slowly injected into the abnormal lobe using 1- mL syringe with a skin test needle in the upper and lower pole of gland (0.1 ml each pole , if the abnormal thyroid is small , the i n- jection point only one). Before injecting the suspension , we pull back on the syringe to avoid the carbon nanoparticles injected into the blood vessels. Then , the puncture point should be gently pressed for 1 minutes with gauze. For unexperienced surgeons , these procedures are easily done. Figure 2.

Tissues , such as the parathyroid gland with vascular were identified and dissected through membrane dissection method. For unexperienced surgeons , these PGs are easily found superior and inferior. Therefore, these types of PGs are also easily identifiable with integrated dissection. Figure 3. Un-developed superior parathyroid gland (white arrow) , The parathyroid gland with vascular was easily identified and dissected. According to the terminal branches' number of PG vascular , It is further identified surrounding structures , especially the main blood vessel for PG. The identification and exposure of PGs usually begin at the inferior vein of the gland by standard inferior approach. For experienced surgeons , these PGs are easily found at the membrane of thyroid gland. Therefore , these types of bifurcation into PGs are also easily identifiable with integrated dissection.

The superior PGs' vasc u- lature was characterized by the entry of combing downward branch of posterior arteries and veins from superior vasculature of thyroid glands. The inferior PGs' vasculature was characterized by the entry of com bing upward branch of terminal arteries and veins from inferior vasculature of thyroid glands. For experienced surgeons , these PGs could be found superiorly to confirm the combing their vasculature of downward branch of the STA and STV into the PGs and fou nd inferiorly to confirm the combing their vasculature of downward branch of the ITA and ITV into the PGs. The superior pole was ligated and cut close to the thyroid capsule by preserving the posterior branches of superior thyroid artery (STA) for superior PT after the gland developed completely within 10 minutes. The terminal branches of inferior thyroid artery (ITA) were preserved for the inferior PT after ITA cut. 4. Results The average age of the patients was 52.2 years , ranging from 27 to 85 years. The gender ratio was 2:7 (19 males/65 females , Table 1 ). The PTGs with vasculature were not stained and hence showed the primary yellow color (Figure 3 and Fig- ure 4). In our cases , the staining diffusion time of the non -nodular thyroid lobes was within 5 minutes after injection. In comparison , the staining of the nodular thyroid lobe was not well diffused , and the post- staining diffusion time was more than 5 minutes. All patients had no significant complications and were discharged within 7 days on average. One PTG being seen as adipose tissue or lymph node in the test group was removed , which had been verified by t he p a- thological results , but six PTGs were removed in the control group ( Table 2 ). Six PTGs (14.29%) in the control group and one (2.38%) in the test group were autotransplanted during thyroidectomy ( Table 2 ). Ten pa tients suffered hyp o- parathyroidism in the test group at 1 day after surgery and 24 patients of the control group with less than 15 pg/ml PTH. The hypoparathyroidism numbers were significantly different between the two groups (23.81% vs. 51.14% , P < 0.05) , as verified by the 2 test. There was no mortality after surgery, and the incidence of transient hypoca l- cemia was 9.5% (4 patients) in the test group and 11.9% (5 patients) in the co n- trol group. All patients of hypocalcemia developed transient paresthesia or tet a- ny, lasting up to 3 days ( Table 2 ). Oral calcium and calcitonin capsules were given to improve the hypocalcemia , and subsequently , normal serum PTH levels and hypocalcemia were improved in patients with postoperative 30 -day fo l- low-up (Table 2 ).

But serum PTH levels were significantly higher in the test group than in the control group at 1 day after surgery, according to Stu- dent's t test (28.17 \u00b1 2.87 vs. 19.50 \u00b1 , no significant dif- ference in serum PTH levels between the two groups remained at 30 days after surgery ( Table 2 ). Furthermore, the patients were not afflicted with vocal cord paralysis or persistent hypoparathyroid ism. 5. Discussion The post -thyroidectomy hypoparathyroidism and hypocalcemia caused a ha n- dicap on patients' life with no low incidence , and the rates of transient hypoca l- cemia and permanent hypocalcemia were reportedly 9.9% and 4.4% respectively in a Scandinavian multicenter study [8] . We introduced an easy technique for intraoperative identification of PTGs using ready -made nanocarbon particles. Identifying and localizing PTGs in an accurate , safe and efficient manner are challenging. Methylene blue , a heterocyclic aromatic compound , has been widely used by thyroid surgeons in recent years [9]. After being found to have potential teratogenic effects , methylene blue leading to higher incidence rat e of PTG i n- jury in thyroid operation was replaced by the CNPs suspension [10]. Nanocar- bon particles were used in intralymph vessels for the negative d eveloped ident i- fication of PTGs. Nanocarbon suspension was considered safe for humans, and side effects such as toxicity were not directly related with the volume and co n-C. C. Yin et al. DOI: 10.4236/ym.2021.52009 85 Yangtze Medicine centration used [11] . Nanocarbon suspension is the only lymph tracer approved for clinical application. Nanocarbon particles provide the thyroid surgeon with direct information about the identification and location of PTGs without stai n- ing, but thyroi d glands and lymph nodes were developed. This technique was adopted in thyroidectomy during the thyroid carcinoma surgery by Hagiwara A et al. , who reported the first case series using nanocarbon particle injection for localization and preservation of PTGs [12]. We also tested the adequacy of the identification by using the pathological results of frozen -section or intraoper a- tive PTH determination. As reported , frozen -section diagnosis and intraoper a- tive PTH increase the success rate of PTG preservation in thyroid surgery [13] [14]. The PTGs maintain the original reddish- brown color , and thus can be eas- ily found and distinguished from the black -stained structures such as thyroid tissues and lymph nodes during the surgery. Therefore , the lack-stained tissues as well as surro unding vasculatures should be preserved for their blood supplies (Figure 3 and Figure 4), especially lymph nodes were dissected in thyroid ca r- cinoma operation. The particles of nanocarbon suspension have strong tropism of lymph in diameter of 150 nm. They can pass through the space between the lymph capillary cells in range of 120 - 150 nm, but cannot enter the blood vessels in range of 20 - 50 nm between capillary endothelial cells [4] . As a result , the CNPs will enter the lymphatic vessels after being injected in the peri -tumor th y- roid lobe. Then macrophages swallowed nanocarbon particles and entered the lymphatic capillaries , finally accumulating in the lymph nodes and lymphatic vessels. Hence , the thyroid gland and lymph nodes were stained black , but the recurrent laryngeal nerves maintained the original white color , while the vasculatural PTGs remained reddish- brown. Therefore, after being injected into the thyroid tissues, the CNPs will not enter the blood vessels. Instead , they will rapidly enter the lymphatic vessels , then enter the lymphatic capillaries after b e- ing internized by macrophages , and finally will accumulate in the lymph nodes , resulting in the black staining of the lymph nodes. Meanwhile , the parathyroids maintain the original reddish- brown and thus are remarkably d istinguished from the adjacent black -stained thyroid and lymph nodes. We hypothesize that the difference in the development results is due to the lympho -vascular structure of these tissues. In histology , the lympho -vascular structure of the PTGs is e x- tremely sparse. The recurrent laryngeal nerve was not stained because it was covered by the schwann sheath and had no vascular structure of lymph. A c- cording to recent studies and our using experience, CNPs do not cause serious reactions to our body; we recommen d that 1 - to 2-point peritumoral injections with a dose for each point do not exceed 0.1 ml and a 3 - to 5-minute waiting time after the injection of CNPs will be impaired when tumor cells or inflamm a- tion blocks lymphatic channels. If the lymph vessels were sparse , the staining result was not diffused well , such as the nodular thyroid lobe. We specifically emphasize that we did the injection just after pulling back to prevent the CNPs injection into blood vessels , and pressed the puncture point for the CNPs not to spill out of the tissues. Some findings in a study cohort show no significant di f-C. C. Yin et al. DOI: 10.4236/ym.2021.52009 86 Yangtze Medicine ference in the complication rates between total/subtotal thyroidectomy with CNPs injection and that without CNPs injection [15] . The reason was that the identification rate of vascular PTGs was higher in the CNPs staining group , but the successful preservation of PTG function relies on the skills of surgeons. Fu r- thermore, our research showed a significant difference. We firstly used CNPs injection to identify the PTGs with blood supplies from other tissues, combined with the parathyroid vasculature -preserving technique to protect the function of PTGs , and reduced the incidence of postoperative decrease of PTH levels and lower serum calcium. However, the rates of postoperative transient hypopara- thyroidism , hypocalcemia , and accidental parathyroid removal were lower in our test group. But a larger number of samples will be accumulated f or clarifying this controversy. In conclusion , visual parathyroid identification and its blood supply protection , in respect to parathyroid treatment , have emerged as the \"gold stan- dard\" of care. The serum PTH level was less than 15 pg/ml in 24 patients of the control group (51.14%) and 10 patients of the test group (23.81%). Hypocalcemia o c- curred in 5 patients of the control group (20%) and 4 patients of the test group (4%) at 1 day after surgery. No between -group significant difference was found in hypoca lcemia at 1st day , which was different from the results of hypocalcemia at 48 hours after surgery reported by Luo [16] . This was because every patient immediately go t calcium supplementation after total thyroidectomy , which a f- fected the calcium serum level at 1 day after surgery. At 30 days after surgery, 2 patients of the control group still exhibited hypocalcemia after the PTG co m- pensation , but no patients of the te st group underwent hypocalcemia. The di f- ference of hypoparathyroidism number between the two groups was significant (23.81% vs. 51.14%, P < 0.05) , as verified by the 2 test. In addition , serum PTH levels were significantly higher in the test group than in the control group at 1 day after surgery (28.17 \u00b1 2.87 vs. 19.50 \u00b1 2.84, P < 0.05) , as indicated by St u- dent's t test. This suggests that PTG damage was significantly reduced in the test group , in which the patients received nanocarbon suspension. The incidental removed numbers and autotransplantation numbers of PTG were more less in the test group , which means the surgeons using the nanocarbon particles made less iatrogenic injuries to the PTG. There are some limitations in our study. First , the number of female patients was more than three times that of male patients , so we need to improve the number of males in future studies. Second , the necessary steps were not eluc i- dated clearly for protection of PTG with vasculature during thyroid surgery. Hence the i ncidence rates of hypoparathyroidism were higher in the two groups. Finally , iatrogenic PTGs with the anatomical blood supply were not evaluated. Future multi -institutional studies in larger sample size are needed to clarify whether the lower frequency of post -thyroidectomy hypoparathyroidism relates with the increasing rates of nanocarbon suspension. Despite these limitations , our study has elucidated the safe way of preventing hypoparathyroidism is to identify and dissect vasculatural PTGs by using a read y-made CNPs suspension. C. C. Yin et al. DOI: 10.4236/ym.2021.52009 87 Yangtze Medicine In conclusion , intraoperative CNPs injection is a safe , useful and easy tool in identification and preservation of vascular PTGs during thyroidectomy , and even inexperienced surgeons can easily identify the recurrent laryngeal nerve, vascular PTG and ITA. CNPs negative localization facilitates the identification and successful preservation of vascular PTGs, even in the reoperative thyroid. There are no systemic complications related to the dye injection. Through identification of PTG s using a negative development technique , the injury of parathyroid blood supply and accidental removal of parathyroids effectively de- creased , thus improving the quality of life in patients. 6. Conclusion One major concern for surgeons is to preserve the p arathyroid glands with intact structure and undamaged function. In our opinion , the safety for thyroid su r- gery is based on the protection and visualization of the normal anatomy of p a- rathyroid glands and their blood supplies according to the CNPs injection tech- nique , as verified in our research. This technique can identify the undeveloped parathyroid glands and their blood supplies within 3 - 5 minutes , and recognize the undeveloped recurrent laryngeal nerves and developed lymph nodes. To v e- rify the reliability of CNPs injection , this technique should be applied by more surgeons to study more cases in furture. Acknowledgements The author would like to thank Prof .

Methods : The potential active constituents and targets of Dr y- nariae Rhizoma -Epimedii Folium were screened plat form (TCMSP). Genecards database is used to find relevant targets of OA. The ta r- gets of \"Drynariae Rhizoma -Epimedii Folium\" were mapped to the targets of OA, and use d Cytoscape software to build a \"drug -ingredient -target -di- sease \" regulatory network and protein protein interaction (PPI) network. R software was used to analyze the Gene ontology (GO) function and Kyoto e ncyclop e- dia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment of traditional Ch i- nese medicine -disease targets . Results: Thirty -four effective ingredients and 130 traditional Chinese medicine -disease targets were screened out for the treatment of OA. The GO functions of traditional Chinese medicine -disease targets mainly included cytokine activity, cytokine recept or binding, nuclear receptor activity, transcription factor activity, proximal promoter DNA -binding transcription activator activity, DNA -binding transcription a ctivator activ i- ty, phosphatase binding and so on. KEGG pathways involved in traditional Chinese medicine -disease targets mainly included TLR4 signaling pathwa y, TNF signaling pathway, IL -17 signaling pathway, MAPK signaling pathway, PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, apoptotic signaling pathway and so on.

Dai et , Osteoarthritis, Network Pharmacology, Target, Signal Pathway 1. Introduction Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common and complex chronic degenerative disease. It is mainly related to factors such as age and weight [1]. Clinically, patients with OA often present symptoms, such as injury, pain and stiffness of articular cartilage. Eventually, it leads to the inconvenience of patients ' mobility and the decrease of patients ' quality of life, and the social and medical burden is also increased [2] [3]. At present, the treatment of early OA is mainly bas ed on symptomatic and drug -based palliative treatment such as alleviating pain, relieving symptoms and preventing disease progression. The guideline first chooses non -steroidal a n- ti-inflammatory drugs, but for older patients, long -term use of non -steroidal drugs , the risk of drug -like gastrointestinal bleeding is greatly increased, and se- vere cases can be life- threatening. Surgical treatment of artificial joint replac e- ment is feasible for patients with advanced bone and joint damage. However, this method is only suitable for a small number of patients, and is not suitable for older patients with cardiopulmonary insufficiency. Therefore, it is still suit a- ble for the treatment of osteoarthritis. Therefore, there is no substantial progress in the treatment of o steoarthritis [4]. Therefore, it is of great practical signifi c- ance to study the pathogenesis and treatment measures related to OA. With a history of thousands of years, Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is safe, cheap, effective and suitable for the national physique. The treatment of OA with TCM has become a hot topic for many researchers [5] . As the prescription Rhizoma -Epimedii Folium has the functions of tonifying liver and kidney, strengthening muscles and bones [6] . Research suggests that the total flavonoids in Drynariae Rhizoma ha ve a variety of a n- ti-osteoarthritis mechanisms [7] ; epimedii Folium has the functions of invig o- rating the kidney and strengthening yang, strengthening the muscles and bones etc. They are all common TCM for the prevention and treatment of OA [8]. Stu- dies have shown that Drynaria Fortunei is often used for bone repair after tra u- ma. Yang et al. [6] found that Gusuibu inhibits the NF -B/IB /IKK signaling pathway, and then down regulates the expression of cell adhesion molecules and chemokines. It is believed that Drynaria Fortunei may be an effective treatment for osteoarthritis. We know that osteo arthritis is a kind of articular cartilage damage. Zhou et al. [9] found that the main extract of Epimedii Folium can i n- terfere with the chondrocyte damage induced by IL -1 by inhibiting cell apopt o- sis. Icariin is an active flavonoid component of Epimedii Folium, studies have shown that Icariin treatment promotes chondrocyte viability by promoting HIF- 1 expression and anaerobic glycolysis [10] . Due to the large number of Z. H. Dai et al. DOI: 10.4236/ym.2021.52010 92 Yangtze Medicine chemical components of traditional Chinese medicine, it has been a heavy workload to use animal experiments to screen anti -osteo arthritis active ingr e- dients and targets, and current studies have failed to fully elaborate its mecha n- ism of action. Network pharmacology is a new method of pharmacological data analysis, which forms an interactive network between \"drug - gene - disease \" to establish the interaction between multi -compound, multi -target and multi -pathway, and to clarify the pharmacological mechanism or disease pathogenesis mechanism of \"multi -component, multi -target and multi -pathway\" [11]. From the systems perspective and at molecular level, with the method of network pharmacology, this study studies the main effective components and potential molecular m e- chanism of Drynariae Rhizoma -Epimedii Folium in the treatment of OA and analyzes its key targets and signal pathways to provide theoretical basis for the follow -up mechanism of drug treatment. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Research Ideas Refer Figure 1 for the experimental flow chart of the treatment of OA with Drynariae Rhizoma -Epimedii Folium based on network pharmacology. 2.2. Screening of Active Ingredients and Target Prediction of Drynariae Rhizoma -Epimedii Folium Traditional Chinese Medicine Syst ems Pharmacology and Analysis Platform (TCMSP) [12] is a unique pharmacological platform of Chinese herbal medicine system. It uses the relationship between drugs and disease to provide a platform for the study of the active ingredients of Chinese herbal medicine. First, retrieve on TCMSP platform ( http://tcmspw .com/tcmsp.ph p ) ingredients of \"Drynariae Rhizoma -Epimedii Folium\"; second, set the screening condition as: drug oral bioavailability (OB) 30%, drug likeness (DL) 0.18 to finally obtain the active ingredients of \"Drynariae Rhizoma- Epimedii Figure 1. Network pharmacology research flow Drynariae Rhizoma -Epimedii Folium in treatment of OA. Z. H. Dai et al. DOI: 10.4236/ym.2021.52010 93 Yangtze Medicine Folium\". Based on the obtained active ingredients above, select \"Related Ta r- gets\" to col lect the target of active in gredients of Drynariae Rhizoma -Epimedii Folium. Then, add gene names to the targets with online database Uni- prot ( https://www.uniprot.org/ ). GeneCards ( https://www.genecards.org/ ) is a comprehensive database of di s- ease- related genes. It contains human gene annotation and prediction inform a- tion. By inputting \"osteoarthritis\" into the retrieval box, the disease -related tar- gets are obtained. With R language software (V3.5.1), the target of Drynariae Rhizoma -Epimedii Folium is mapped with OA related genes, and the Venn di a- gram of the common target of TCM and disease is obtained, hence, the relative targets of Drynariae Rh izoma -Epimedii Folium in the treatment of OA are o b- tained. 2.4. Construct \"Drug - Ingredient - Target - Disease\" Based on the active ingredients of Drynariae Rhizoma -Epimedii Folium, the target regulated by the active ingredients, and the correlation betw een the target and OA, the regulatory network of \"Drug - Ingredient - Target - Disease\" is co n- structed with cytoscape (Version 3.7.1). In this network, node represents drug (Drynariae Rhizoma -Epimedii Folium), active ingredient, disease (osteoarthritis) and target. And edge represents the interaction between the drug and the active ingredient, the active ingredient and the target, and the target and OA. 2.5. Target Protein Interaction Network of Drynariae Rhizoma -Epimedii Folium in the Drynariae Rhizoma -Epimedii Folium -db.org/ ) online database, click \"Homo sapiens\" to r e- trieve. Take the confidence score greater than 0.7 as the screening parameter, download the corresponding result data. By analyzing the data with R language, the degree of the target in the protein protein interaction (PPI) network is o b- tained, and it is presented in the form of a bar graph. Finally, import the dow n- loaded PPI result file into the Cytoscape software for visualization. The size and color depth of the node can both represent the size of the target degree value. 2.6. Gene Ontology (GO) Functional Enrichment Analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) Pathway Enrichment Analysis The obtained TCM -disease targets are calculated using R language to obtain the GO (gene ontology) functional enrichment analysis and KEGG (Kyoto encycl o- pedia of genes and genomes) pathway enrichment analysis. First, inst all the Bioconductor package on R software ( http://org/biocLite.R ) and set p < 0.05, q < 0.05, and present the analysis results in the form of bar chart and bubble chart. Z. H. Dai et al. DOI: 10.4236/ym.2021.52010 94 Yangtze Medicine 2.7. Statistical Analysis The collected drug data of Drynariae Rhizoma -Epimedii Folium use Perl la n- guage to run the relevant script file to obtain the target gene name of the drug. Use Uniprot as the drug target protein to screen, and then annotate the drug gene name to get the abbreviation of the drug g ene. After removing the repeated genes, 214 drug -related genes were finally obtained. The obtained 214 drug genes and 2854 disease genes of osteoarthritis were used to draw Venny di a- grams using Perl script files, and the common genes of drugs and osteoarthritis were obtained, that is, the intersection genes. Import the obtained drug -disease intersection genes into the Cytoscape 3.7.1 software for visual network constru c- tion, display the drug -active ingredient -target -disease network interaction ne t- work diagr am, and import the intersection genes into String Database, and select the detection species as \"Homo sapiens\", select \"medium confidece as 0.07\" as the screening criteria, and delete discrete or unrelated gene nodes. Finally obtain the corresponding PPI network. Finally, the key genes were imported into R language, and GO enrichment analysis and KEGG pathway analysis were pe r- formed. 3. Results 3.1. Screening and Target Collection of Active Ingredients of Drynariae Rhizoma -Epimedii Folium Retrieve from TCMSP database to obtain ingredients and related tar-gets of Drynariae Rhizoma -Epimedii Folium, select ingredients with OB 30% and DL 0.8. Combined with literature reports, a total of 34 active ingredients were obtained, as shown in Table 1 . 3.2. Prediction of the Target of Drynariae Rhizoma -Epimedii Folium in the Treatment of OA By taking the intersection of the OA related target and the Drynariae Rhiz o- ma-Epimedii Folium target with R language software, a total of 130 targets of Drynariae Rhizoma -Epimedii Folium in the treatment of OA were obtained. There were 2 854 OA related targets, and 214 targets of active ingredients of Drynariae Rhizoma -Epimedii Folium. Refer Figure 2 for more details. 3.3. Construct \"Drug - Ingredient - Target - Disease\" Network and Analyze The corresponding relationship between Drynariae Rhizoma -Epimedii Folium and its corresponding active ingredients, active ingredients and target genes, and target genes and osteoarthritis and its properties were imported into Cytoscape software to construct \"Drug - Ingredient - Target - Disease\" regulatory network. Refer Figure 3 for more details. In the network, the blu e quadrilateral represents the drug \"Drynariae Rhizoma\", \"Epimedii Folium\", the green inverted triangle represents the active ingredients, the red hexagon represents osteoarthritis, and Z.

When a node connects more points in the network, it indicates that this node has a higher degree value, and it may play a key role in the network. The network consists of 165 nodes, including 32 nodes representing the active ingredients of Drynariae Rhizoma -Epimedii Folium (compound Magnograndiolide (MOL000622), and 130 nodes repr esenting the target and 568 edges. From the regulatory network diagram, it can be seen that multiple active ingre-dients can correspond to one target, or one active ingredient corresponds to multiple targets. This indicates that Drynariae Rhizoma -Epimedii F olium can Z. H. Dai et al. DOI: 10.4236/ym.2021.52010 97 Yangtze Medicine play a pharmacological role through the synergy of multiple ingredients and multiple targets. The top 3 compounds according to the ranking of degree value are: quercetin (degree value: (de- gree value: 68). 3.4. Construct and Analyze PPI network of Key Targets From Figure 4 , it shows that PPI network consists of 130 nodes and 1054 edges. The darker the color and the larger the shape of the node represent the greater the degree value of the node. The higher the degree value of the target in the network, the more likely it is to become the core target in the PPI network. The degree values of the targets in the network are ranked as AKT1, IL6, JUN, MAPK8, MAPK1, VEGFA, etc., please refer Figure 5 for more details. The anti OA mechanism of Drynariae Rhizoma -Epimedii Folium may be related of AKT1, IL6, JUN, MAPK8, MAPK1, VEGFA Drynariae Rhizoma -Epimedii Folium and OA targets. Figure 5.

Discussions As a relatively common joint disease, OA often causes middle -aged and elderly people to lose their ability to exercise, and brings great inconvenience to p a- tients. According to the study, the incidence of OA in the global population aged Figure 6. Barplot for GO functional enrichment analysis.

The letters on the left represent the name of the KEGG signaling pathway; the numbers represent the proportion of genes; the size of the circle represents the number of enriched genes; the c olor represents the P value . over 65 years is as high as 50% [13] . In traditional Chinese medicine, OA b e- longs to the scope of \"Bi disease,\" middle aged and elderly people tend to have incoordination between the liver and the spleen, and deficiency of kidney e s- sence, resulting in the body imbalance of Yin and Yang, deficiency of Qi and blood, loss of nourishment of bones, and eventually have arthralgia syndrome [5]. Due to the convenience and safety of application and the small side effects, TCM in the treatment of OA has achieved remarkable efficacy. In the early treatment of patients, it can improve the efficacy, slow down the developmen t of Z. H. Dai et al. DOI: 10.4236/ym.2021.52010 100 Yangtze Medicine the disease, as well as significantly improving the quality of life of patients. Drynariae Rhizoma is the dry rhizome of Dryopteris crassipes. With the fun c- tions of strengthening bone, tonifying kidney, relieving pain, regulating lipid and anti-inflam mation, it has a certain effect on the treatment of OA [7] . Epi- medii Folium has the -yang, strengthening muscles and bones, dispelling w ind-damp, and is extensively applied in the clinical treatment of OA, osteoporosis and other diseases [14] [15]. At present, TCM has good clinical efficacy in the treatment of OA, but its molecular mechanism in the treatment of OA remains unclear. Therefore, from the perspective of mu l- ti-ingredient, multi -target and multi -pathway of Drynariae Rhizoma -Epimedii Folium, this paper clarifies its mechanism with the method of network pharm a- cology. Based on this study, Drynariae Rhizoma -Epimedii Folium has the following chemical components with OA : querce tin, kaempferol and luteolin. The quercetin has many functions such as antioxidant stress, anti -inflammatory, i n- hibition of osteoclast activation, etc. Some studies have shown that quercetin mainly slows the development of chronic diseases such as OA, rheu matoid art h- ritis, osteoporosis etc . by reducing the release of pro -inflammatory factors, re- ducing oxidative stress, and inhibiting the degradation of extracellular matrix [16]. According to relevant experimental studies, quercetin can play a better role in the treatment of OA by down -regulating the expression of TNF -, IL-1, IL-6 and other inflammatory factors [17] . In the rat model of OA, Qiu et al. [18] found that quercetin could down -regulate the release of MMP -13 mediated by IL-1, so as to improve the degeneration of OA by inhibiting the degradation of cartilage extracellular matrix. Kaemp ferol has the function of inhibiting adip o- genesis, inflammation, osteoblast apoptosis etc . It can also protect bones by r e- gulating the semaphore receptor, bone morphology protein 2 (BMP -2), nuclear factor -B (NF -B), and mitogen activated other signaling pathways [19] . Other studies have found that by down regulating the expression of JNK, p38 and MAPK genes, luteolin can inhibit the prolifer ation of chondrocytes. At the same time, it can also down regulating the release of i n- flammatory factors such as NO, TNF - and IL-6, so as to reduce inflammation and protect articular chondrocytes [20] . Therefore, it can be seen that the active ingredients in Drynariae Rhizoma -Epimedii Folium are diverse in protecting OA and play a major role in terms of anti -inflammatory, oxidative stress, apo p- tosis. From PPI network analysis, the core targets obtained mainly include AKT1, IL6, JUN, MAPK8, MAPK1, VEGFA, etc. These core target genes may partic i- pate in the development of OA through various biological processes such as c y- tokine activity, cytokine receptor binding, nuclea r receptor activity, transcri p- tion factor activity, proximal promoter DNA binding transcriptional activator activity, DNA binding transcription activator activity, phosphatase binding etc . for anti is the protein kinase encoding serine/ threonine. It can be activated by extracellular signal depending on PI3K. In OA, chondrocytes can Z. H. Dai et al. DOI: 10.4236/ym.2021.52010 101 Yangtze Medicine inhibit bone growth, cartilage calcification, and osteophyte formation through the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway [21]. Knocking out the AKT1 gene delays bone formation [22]. IL-6 is a significant inflammatory molecule for inflammation and immune responses. Relevant research reports show that IL6 is associated with pain in hip OA , and is highly expressed in the patient 's chondrocytes and synovial fluid [23] . JUN is also called as transcription factor AP -1, which is a dimer composed of c -jun protein and c -fos protein family members. With the function of regulating the release of many inflammatory factors, such as IL -1 , TNF -, IL-6, IL -8, etc., activated AP -1 is called the third messenger of intrace l- lular signaling, and it also plays a regulatory role in cell proliferation, differentia- tion, apoptosis and inflammation [24] . Lim et al. [25] study found that the blocking of the signaling pathways p38 MAPK/AP -1 and JAK2/STAT1/2 can significantly reduce the release of MMP -13 in chondrocytes treated by IL -1, thus exerting the effect of protecting cartilage degeneration [26] . Vascular e n- dothelial growth factor (VEGF) family has been shown to play a crucial role both in the control of catabolism of articular cartilage and angiogenesis. This is a key step in the end ochondral ossification of mesenchymal progenitor cells [27]. The KEGG signaling that Drynariae Rh i- zoma -Epimedii Folium can play its r ole through multiple signal pathways, mainly including TLR4 signaling pathway, TNF signaling pathway, IL -17 si g- naling pathway, MAPK signaling pathway, PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and apoptosis signaling pathway, etc. TLR4 signaling pathway, TNF signaling pathway, IL -17 signaling pathway, etc. are closely related to inflammation. Both IL -1 AND TNF -are key inflammatory factors in the OA. TLR4 signaling pathway activates downstream NF -B, regulates the release of pro-inflammatory factors such a s IL-1, IL-6, IL -17, TNF -, and produces an in- flammatory cascade reaction. Many studies found that by inhibiting NF -B and blocking the inflammatory signal pathway, the destruction of cartilage in OA can be significantly reduced [28]. MAPKs signaling pathway is one of the most important signaling pathways in regulating OA. It may be involved in the growth, differentiation and apoptosis of chondrocytes, and it may also induce the secretion of MMPs, which can lead to the degradation of cartilage matrix [29]. MAPKs signaling pathway can also regulate the differentiation and mat u- ration of osteoblasts to improve bone density and calcification; by linking with other signaling pathways such as downstream ERK, p38, JNK, it regulates the production of inflammatory factors, promotes cartilage dexterization , oste o- phyte formati on and extracellular matrix degradation, which plays a in the pathogenesis of OA [30] . PI3K -AKT signaling pathway is a common regulation of apoptosis -related signaling pathway. Some studies demonstrates that by acti- vating the PI3K -AKT signaling pathway, the expression of Caspase -3 and Ca s- pase-8 can be increased, and the anti- apoptosis protein Bcl -2 is of OA degeneration. The unbalanced development between excessive apoptosis of cartilage cells and osteoclast proliferation le ads to bone reconstru c-Z. H. Dai et al. DOI: 10.4236/ym.2021.52010 102 Yangtze Medicine tion [32] [33]. With collaboration between apoptosis signaling pathway and u p- stream signaling pathway of MAPKs, PI3K -AKT and NF-kB and downstream signaling pathway of exogenous death receptor and endogenous mitochondrial pathway, so the apoptosis signal is released to regulate apoptosis of chondrocytes [34]. In this study, we used data mining and network pharmacology to explain the possible mechanism of Drynariae Rhizoma and Epimedii Folium in the trea t- ment of osteoarthritis. M oreover, our results give a scientific basis to further e x- plore the mechanism of Drynariae Rhizoma and Epimedii Folium in the trea t- ment of osteoar thritis, and reduce unnecessary time and economic cost. Howev- er, the relevant pathological mechanism needs to be further verified in exper i- ments. 5. Conclusion In conclusion, this paper studied the molecular mechanism of Drynariae Rhi- zoma -Epimedii Folium protecting OA based on network pharmacology. The mechanism may function mainly through targets of AKT1, IL6, JUN, MAPK8, MAPK1, PI3K/AKT, apoptosis , etc. This study has laid the foundations for la ter study on the m e- chanism of the treatment of OA with Drynariae Rhizoma -Epimedii Folium, and provided a new idea and direction for the R & D of TCM and clinical medication guidance.

The second oncolytic virus d rug was 34.5 (ICP34.5) and latency -associated transcript (LAT) genes are closely related to virus selective infection and latent infection. Their eng i- neering is essential for constructing efficient and safe oHSV . We summarized the mechanisms of ICP34.5 and LAT in the course of HSV -1 infection and reviewed the engineered oHSVs . We are aimed to provide an insight in de- veloping oHSV in the Simplex Virus, Latency- Associated Transcript, ICP34.5 1. Introduction Cancer is a serious disease which threa tens human health and life. Traditional chemotherapy, radiotherapy or surgical procedure is accompanied by toxic side effect , drug resistance [1] . With th e development of precision medical technolo- gy, chimeric antigen receptor T cell immunotherapy (CAR -T), immune chec k- point suppression therapy, oncolytic virus (OV) therapy and other therapies have also made significant progress [2]. OVs are promising treatments for many kinds of tumor [3]. They can kill tumor cells without cross -resistance with other *Authors contributed equally. #Corresponding author.

In clinical trials, adenoviruses, alphaviruses, herpes simplex viruses, newcastle disease viruses, etc. have been applied as engineered OV vectors. HSV -1 is a double -stranded DNA virus a long genome (152 kb) [5] . HSV -1 can carry multiple foreign genes because it has about 30 kb of non -essential genes [6] . In addition , the replication of HSV -1 in the host cells does not cause insertional mutagenesis. Above -mentioned factors make HSV- 1 a good candidate for onc o- lytic virus engineering [7]. The modified oncolytic herpes simplex virus (oHSV) can specifically target tumor cells without damaging normal tissue cells and fu r- ther release progeny viruses after replicating in tumor cells [8]. oHSV- 1 has been confirmed to ha ve the positively therapeutic efficacy and safety in clinical trials [9]. 2. Structure and Function of ICP34.5 and LAT A wild type HSV- 1 enters a host cell through the binding of virus surface glyc o- proteins and host cell surface receptors ( Herpes virus entry mediat or) [10]. Hu- mans infected with HSV- 1 may produce a series of skin lesions and neurotoxic i- ty. Subsequently, HSV -1 establishes latency infection in the nervous system [11]. HSV -1 can be latent for several years or even a lifetime [12]. ICP34.5 is a neurovirulence factor. It plays a crucial role in viral replication and anti -host response [13]. The viral protein ICP34.5 contains four domains [14] [15]: 1) Beclin 1 region can inhibit the initiation of host autophagy; 2) TANK -binding kinase (TTBK1) region can inhibit of type inte r- feron (IFN) response; 3) The C -terminal domains and host phosphatase tion. Recently, Rubio RM et al. reported that NOP53 could directly the interact ion with ICP34.5. Cytoplasmic NOP53 promotes the recruitment of PP1 through ICP34.5, which leads the dephosphorylation of eIF2 for effective Figure 1. ICP34.5 is involved in anti- host innate immune response. W. Q. Cai et al. DOI: 10.4236/ym.2021.52011 108 Yangtze Medicine virus replication [16] . During HSV infection ( Figure 1 ), the host cells bind type I IFN t hrough the IFN receptor, activate the JAK -STAT pathway and upreg u- late protein kinase R (PKR). Then PKR is activated by its ligand, which will cause phosphorylation of the host's translation initiation factor eIF2 , thereby inhibiting HSV replication and host protein synthesis [17]. However, the C-terminal domain of HSV ICP34.5 protein can bind to host phosphatase PP1 and relocate it to eIF2 , leading to dephosphorylation and restoration of mRNA translation [18] [19]. Type I IFN response is blocked by ICP34.5 while antagonizing the PKR IFN response, which a- tion in sensory neurons [22], which is related to the genetic structure of LAT [23]. LAT consists of 8.3 kb primary transcripts. Previous studies have shown that the 2.0 kb major LAT is an intron of the 8.3 kb transcripts, which is extraordinarily stable during lytic and latent infection due to its special non-consensus guanosine branchpoint [13]. Furthermore, the 2.0 kb major LAT RNA undergoes further splicing within the neuron during HSV -1 latent period, eventually producing another 1.5 kb stable RNA species. The 6.3 kb exon product of the first splice in LAT and the 0.5 kb intron product of the second splice are difficult to detect [24]. A study has shown that exon 1 region of LAT is a critical factor to block apoptosis [25]. LAT functions as a primary microRNA (miRNA) precursor that encodes several distinct miRNAs in HSV -1 infected cells. A study has shown [26] that at least two primary miRNA precursors were found in the latent infected neurons, which may be related to the activation and maintenance of the latentcy of the virus. Another study has shown [27] that the miRNA encoded by HSV -1 LAT gene can suppress the apoptosis of infected cells by regulating the transforming growth factor - sig- nal transduction, thus promoting the lat ent infection of the virus. In addition , a study has shown [28] that HSV -1 latency dendritic growth in sy m- pathetic neurons. HSV latency and toxicity in neurons are crucial issues in the treatment of HSV infection and engineering of effective and safe oHSVs. HSV LAT and ICP34.5 r e- lated research provided an important basis for HSV treatment and oHSV engi- neering in the future. During the period of viral infection, the host cell activates the JAK -STAT pathway, up- regulates PKR kinase via IFN receptor and eventually pho s- phorylates eIF2 , which cause the host cell synthesis inhibition. However, the HSV -1 ICP34.5 can prevent this p PP1 and depho s- phorylating eIF2 . At the same time, NOP53 can promote the binding of ICP34.5 to PP1 . The domains 1 - 4 of ICP34.5 are shown. 3. Oncolytic Engineering of ICP34.5 and LAT of HSV Studies have shown that the deletion of the ICP34.5 gene allowed oHSV to rep-W. Q. Cai et al. DOI: 10.4236/ym.2021.52011 109 Yangtze Medicine licate selectively in specific tumors, which is related to PKR activity [29]. Speci f- ically, this is caused by the fact that the activity of PKR inhibitor MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK) is generally high in tumor cells. ICP34.5 and LAT are key genes for HSV -1 neuroinvasiveness reactivation of latency [30]. [31] reported the deletion of HSV -1 LAT genes. T he absence of LAT and ICP34.5 prevent s the virus from latency and reactivation, which means there has a long -term safe margin after treatment [11] . Therefore, LAT and ICP34.5 eng i- neering are essential fo r the construction of oHSV. More importantly, HSV -1 ICP34.5 is overlapped with LAT at their gene locus. LAT and ICP34.5 are e n- coded on the opposite strand. Here we review the relevant oHSVs with LAT and ICP34.5 engineering ( Table 1 and Figure 2). At the same time, we also illustrate a new 93aa open reading frame (ORF) RL1A that has been found to be overlap with the ICP34.5 locus [32]. Currently, HSV -1 strains F and 17 are typically used as vectors in clinical practice and clinical trials. Table 1. Oncolytic engineering of ICP34.5 and LAT of HSV- 1.

Q. Cai et al. DOI: 10.4236/ym.2021.52011 110 Yangtze Medicine Figure 2. The relative positions of the ICP34.5, LAT and RL1A in different HSV strains. Previous studies have shown that people have carried out different engineering on the HSV -F strain: NG34, G47, NV1020 to the second generation oHSV, with several gene deletions or insertions. oHSV NG34 contains the ICP6 and ICP34.5 deletions, and additionally inserts the hu- man growth arrest and DNA damage -34 (GADD34) gene. Research by Nak a- shima H et al. showed that oHSV NG34 was safe and effective in a glioblastoma (GBM) mouse model [33] . G207 contains a deletion of the ICP34.5 gene and a disrupting lacZ insertion within the UL39 gene. Rencently, Bernstock JD et al. [34] demonstrated the safety and effectiveness of G207 in advanced cerebellar malignancies. Similarly, G47 further deletes the gene based on G207. The research's result of Todo T et al. showed that G47 comparing with G2 07 had a higher amount of replication in test cells and a stronger killing effect of tumor cells. ICP47 has the function of blocking the major histocompatibility complex class I antigen presentation pathway. Deletion of ICP47 enhances T cell activity and p roduces a stronger killing effect of tumors. G47 has become one of the most promising oncolytic virus [35]. In addition , oHSV -1 gene and ICP0). The results of Eevarg- hese SK showed that NV1020 stabilized liver metastases in M032 also contained ICP34.5 del e- tion, but the difference is that it contained an extra insertion of gene IL12. It was shown that M032 was safe and effective [37]. The HSV- 1 (17) strain is also one of the most common strain s for oHSV construction. Seprehvir (HSV1716) contained ICP34.5 deletion and cannot replicate in normal cells, which belongs to the first generatio n of oncolytic HSV . At the same time, HSV1716 can also express thymidine kinase. Recen t- W. Q. Cai et al. DOI: 10.4236/ym.2021.52011 111 Yangtze Medicine ly, the research's result of Streby KA et al. had shown that HSV1716 wa s safe and effective in treating juvenile malignant tumors [38]. HSV -1 RH018 co n- tains the deletion, and additional insertion of the glyc o- protein of the tumor ef fect when it is used in combination with the immune checkpoint PD1/L1 inhibitor. The phenomenon reconfirms that the oncolytic virus can effectively combine with other treatment methods to treat patients [29]. Other oHSVs deletion of two ICP34.5 genes and ICP47 gene. Meanwhile, the g ene encoding human granul o- cyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM -CSF) replaced the ICP34.5- encoding sequences. The t herapeutic effect of T -VEC on melanoma in clinical trials has been demonstrated [39]. In addition, OrienX010 is based on the HSV -1 CL1 strain, and expresses GM -CSF. Studies have shown that OrienX010 treatment has a well toleration and effect iveness [40]. Samoto K. et al. constructed oHSV- 1 DM33 which contained ICP34.5 and LAT deletion and the green flu- orescent protein gene insertion. A study showed the efficacy and safety of DM33 in the treatment of gliomas [12] . A series of mutations in the oHSV HF10 genome lead to the non -expression of multi ple gene products including LAT [30]. Recent studies have shown that the treatment group of HF10 and da- carbazine has more IFN - secretion , and HF10 has shown its efficacy in a variety of tumors [41]. We have further detailed the specific sites of ICP34.5 and LAT deletion in Ta- ble 1 and Figure 2 , which will help the engineering of oHSVs using different strains in the future. At present, we have done a great deal of researches on the comparison between the same genes of different strains [11] [42] [43] [44], which will help construct new oHSVs in the future. 4. Conclusion and Perspective Views We summarized the s tructure and f unction of ICP34.5 and LAT in HSV -1. We also reviewed the engineering of genes related to latent infection and neurovir u- lence, ICP34.5 and LAT. These are crucial for the construction of oncolytic v i- ruses in the future. The deletion of ICP34.5 leads to oHSV select ively replicate in tumors, but the amount of oHSV replication also decreases significantly [45]. In order to cope with the decrease of oHSV replication caus ed by the lack of ICP34.5, some strategies need to be developed. The absence of HSV -1 ICP47 enhances the presentation of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I antigens on infected cells, while increas ing the anti -tumor effects of HSV [46] [47]. Most [29] with delet ion of the gene encoding ICP34.5 (part of LAT) pro mote tumor selectivity and reduce virus toxicity, while inse r- tion of therapeutic genes (such as GM -CSF) increase s the anti -tumor effect of oHSV. According to previous research, HSV -1 has approximately 80 ORFs [48] . W. Q. Cai et al. DOI: 10.4236/ym.2021.52011 112 Yangtze Medicine Recently, a report at NUTURE COMMUNICATI ONS [32] showed about 284 ORFs in HSV -1, among which 46 novel large ORFs are found. A 93aa ORF (RL1A) was found in the ICP34.5 locus. T-Vec has shown ideal efficacy and safety in clinical practice [49] . In clinical studies [50], researchers found that the efficacy of oncolyti c virus monotherapy varies greatly, which may be related to the host 's antiviral response. In order to overcome the shortcomings of oncolytic virus single -agent therapy, people co n- sider the combined application of oncolytic virus with other immunotherapies, and obvious curative effects have been observed [51]. New discoveries above will provid e powerful basis for the future development of oHSV .

Keywords Ji Desheng Snake Pills, Hypertonic Glucose, Pressure Ulcer, Pressure Ulcer Scale for Healing Tool 1. Introduction Pressure Injury (PI), commonly known as Pressure Ulcer (PU), or bed sore or decubitus ulcer, is a localized injury of skin and deep soft tissue s caused by pe r- sistent ischemia and hypoxia originated from the pressure on local tissues of the body due to long -term maintenance of a fixed posture [1] . It often occurs at the bone carina, which is characterized by a long course of disease , slow healing, and high treatment costs, affecting the life quality of patients, even resulting in the death of patients due to the serious secondary infections [2] . Stage III and IV pressure ulcers will have full -thickness skin loss, accompanied by exposure of bones, tendons or muscles, and even the ulcers reach muscle and supporting systems (e.g. fascia, tendons, joint capsules), causing osteomyelitis [3] , and the condition is often more serious. Ji Desheng snake pills, as a special antidote with more than 300 years of application history, consist of dozens of animal and plant medicinal materials . It is easy to use, both internally and externally, with the ef- fects of anti -inflammat ion and anti -bacteria, detoxification and detumescence, relieving pain and promoting granulation, and strengthening the body 's immun- ity [4] [5]. In clinic , its external application is commonly used in the treatment of mosquito bites, herpes zoster, phlebitis, and drug leakage at the injection site [6]. In this study, patients with stage III and stage IV pressure injur ies, who r e- ceived treatment in the First Affiliated Hospital of Yangtze University between December 2018 and December 2019 were selected and given Ji Desheng Snake Pills combined with hypertonic glucose ex ternal application, moist dressing e x- ternal application and surgical dressing change, respectively. The safety, ther a- peutic effect and cost benefit of the three treatment methods were compared to explore the feasibility of Ji Desheng s nake pills combined w ith hypertonic gl u- cose external application in the treatment of stage III and IV pressure injur ies. The report was as follows . 2. Method Part 2.1. Research Subject The study population were selected by convenience sampling method and co n-R. T. Liu et al.

Patients in the exper i- mental group, the conventional treatment group and the control group were treated with Ji Desheng snake p ills combined with hypertonic glucose external application, moist dressing external application and surgical dressing change, respectively. During the treatment, the pressure ulcer area, wound tissue type, would effusion, pain degree, adverse actions and pressure ulcer treatment costs were observed and recorded on the 1 st, 7th, 14th, and 28th days. This study was approved by the hospital ethics committee. 2.2. Inclusion Criteria and Exclusion Criteria 1) Inclusion criteria: a) age 18 years; b) first press ure ulcer treatment; c) st a- ble control of primary disease or complications; d) compliant with the National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel (NPUAP) diagnostic criteria for stage III and IV pressure ulcers [3] ; e) patients and their families voluntarily participated in the clinical efficacy observation study and signed informed consent. 2) Exclusion criteria: a) patients with abnormal blood glucose levels during treatment; b) patients with active wound bleeding or coagulation dysfunction; c) patients with drug allergy; d) serious heart, liver, and kidney insufficiency; e) sepsis; f) immunosuppressant or hormone therapy; g) refusal to continue the r e- search. 2.3. Treatment Plan In the control group, the skin around the wound was disinfected with 0.5% iodophor, and the wound was lightly moistened with a cotton ball of normal sa- line. If there was obvious necrotic tissue, it needed to be debrided and applied with vaseline gauze and sterile gauze. As to the experimental group, after trea t- ing the wound with the above method, 20 Ji Desheng snake pills were crushed and stirred into a paste after adding 50% glucose solution, and then evenly smeared on the wound which was then covered with sterile gauze. For the co n- ventional treatment group, the common moist dressing was used. The choice of dressings was based on the treatment principles of stage III and IV pressure ul c- ers [7]. Alginate dressings were used as inner dressings to cover the pressure ulcer wounds. The size and shape of the dressings were tailored according to the size of the wound, 1 - 2 cm beyond the edge of the wound. The outer layer was adhered and fixed with a hydrocolloid dressing. If the wound was infected, silver ion dressing was then used as the inner dressing, and the outer layer was covered with gauze or cotton pad after being fixed with a hydrocolloid dressing. The dressing wa s changed daily in the early stage of the treatment, and the frequency of dressing changes was gradually reduced according to whether the wound had effusion, peculiar smell, and whether the dressing was clean and dry. The air bed R. T. Liu et al. DOI: 10.4236/ym.2021.52012 120 Yangtze Medicine was usually used and the p atients were turned over every 2 hours. The treatment cycle was 28 days. 2.4. Evaluation Indices The observation record table of pressure ulcer therapeutic effect was set up with the 1st, 7th, 14th, 21st, and 28th days as the observation points. The patien t's pre s- sure ulcer area, wound tissue type, would effusion, and pain degree were rec- orded to calculate PUSH score, VAS pain score and wound healing rate on the 28th day as evaluation indices of therapeutic effect. Meanwhile, the adverse a c- tions during the treatment were recorded as safety evaluation indices and pres- sure ulcer treatment costs were counted as evaluation indices of cost benefit . The calculation method of pressure ulcer area (cm2) was to multiply the length of the wound (cm, take the patient's head to toe as the vertical axis) by the width of the wound (cm, the horizontal axis was perpendicular to the vertical axis). The fo r- mula for calculating the wound healing rate on the 28th day was: healing rate = (original wound area before treatment wound area on the 28th day)/original wound area before treatment \u00d7 100%. 2.5. Statistical Methods SPSS26.0 software was utilized for statistical analysis. The measurement data was expressed as xs\u00b1, using the single -factor ANOVA test . The count data was expressed by the number of cases and percentage (%). The comparison between groups used 2 test, considering p < 0.05 as statistically significant. 3. Results 3.1. Patient Baseline Data In this study, the experimental group included 18 male patients and 12 female patients, with the average age of 73.80 \u00b1 3.41 years; the conventional treatment group 16 males and 14 females, with the average age of 72.47 \u00b1 7.55 years; the control group included 13 males and 17 females, with the average age of 74.73 \u00b1 5.48 years. There were no statistically significant differences between the three groups in sex, age, BMI index, hemoglobin, albumin, mean arterial pressure, pressure ulcer location distribution, and Braden score (p > 0.05) ( Table 1 ), in- dicating that the three groups of patients were comparable. 3.2. Safety, Therapeutic Effect and Cost Benefit During the treatment, no adverse reactions occurred in the three groups of p a- tients. On the 14th, 21th, and 28th day, the PUSH scores of the experimental group and the conventional treatment group were significantly lower than that of the control group, and the result was statistically significant (p < 0.05), while there was no significant difference between the exp erimental group and the conve n- tional treatment group (p > 0.05) ( Table 2 ).

Discussion As a common surgical disease, pressure injury has become a long- standing problem in clinical treatment and nursing process due to the fact that patients are bedridden for a long time and may be combined with unfavorable factors such as hypotension, low protein and edema , plus fixed position, improper care, etc., which makes the wound easily infected and difficult to heal [8] [9]. In mo d- ern medicine, moist dressings are used in the treatment of pressure injuries. Stu- dies have shown that its effective rate reaches 92.11%, which can significantly improve the therapeutic effect. H owever, the new type of moist dressing is ex- pensive, which imposes an unbearable burden of medical expense on patients with difficult family condit ions [10] [11] [12]. Many Chinese medicine scholars have conducted substantial basic research and clinical experimen ts, and opine that the method of external application of Chinese medicine preparations can effectively treat pressure ulcers, with obvious curative effects, small side effects and other advantages [13]. Our research team previously used Ji Desheng snake pills combined with 50% glucose solution ex- ternal application to treat superficial phlebitis and achieved favorable results R. T. Liu et al. DOI: 10.4236/ym.2021.52012 123 Yangtze Medicine [14]. However, due to no finding that Ji Desheng snake pills have been used in the treatment of pressure ulcers at home and abroad, there is currently a lack of comparison in e fficacy and cost -effectiveness. In this study, we also took advantage of the above -mentioned characteristics of Ji Desheng snake pills, combine d with the hypertonic characteristics of 50% glucose solution that can reduce tissue inflammation and exudation, to achieve the effect of promoting wound healing. N o adverse reactions were observed in this research. T he results showed that after one week of treatment, there was no significant difference in the PUSH score, wound healing rate, VAS pain score between t he cases treated with Ji Desheng snake pills combined with hypertonic glucose external application and those treated with moist dressing external a p- plication, both of which were significantly better than the surgical dressing in the aforementioned indices. On the other hand, the treatment cost of Ji Desheng snake pills combined with hypertonic glucose external application was signif i- cantly lower than that of moist dressing external application. The reason is that almost all the moist dressings used in domestic hospitals are imported products, so it is difficult to reduce the use cost. This makes Ji Desheng snake pills show obvious advantages in cost -effectiveness. The above results indicate that Ji D e- sheng snake pills combined with hypertonic glucose externa l application, as a new type of treatment with characteristics such as simple operation, significant therapeutic effect and low price, has potential cost benefit advantage especially for pressure ulcer patients with poor economic conditions. 5. Conclusion This research explored the feasibility of Ji Desheng snake pills combined with hypertonic glucose external application in the treatment of stage III and IV pressure injuries. The results showed that for the treatment of stage III and IV pressure injuries, Ji Desheng snake pills combined with hypertonic glucose ex- ternal application w ere not significantly different from moist dressing external application in the therapeutic effect and safety, while the former method ha d significantly better cost benefit . However, this study is exploratory and there are still certain limitations in terms of research time, research methods, patient compliance, sample size, pharm acological mechanism research, and TCM sy n- drome differentiation treatment. Therefore, the follow- up research still needs to be improved and deepened in the above regards so as to make the research re- sults more convincing.

Introduction Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a common and frequently -occurring disease in the oto r- hinolaryngology head and neck surgery department, and it is a type -I allergic disease resealed by the IgE -mediated mediators, and involved with multiple immune cells and cytokines after the body is exposed to the allergen [1] . Its p a- thogenesis is complex and is not clear, wherein, the balance disorder of Th1/Th2 cytokines is the key for the development of allergic diseases [2] . In recent years, the studies have shown that NF -B can adjust the release of Th cytokine and i n- terfere the balance of Th1/Th2 cytokine afte r activation, so as to be involved in the occurrence and development of immunity and inflammation [3] . Yupi n- fengsan Oral Liquid, which is originated from Yupinfengsan, is a classic pr e- scription for reinforcing the vital energy and consolidating the constitution, and it is functioned with treat ment, prevention and good immune regulation [4] . By establishing the mice AR model and detecting the cytokine contents of IL -4 and IFN- in serum, and NF -B protein a nd gene expression level in the nasal mu- cosa, this experiment discusses the regulatory role of Yupinfengsan Oral Liquid on the expression of related cytokines of the mice AR model. 2. Main Experimental Material s Experimental animals: 40 clean- grade BALB/c mice, female, age of 5 - 6 weeks, weight of 18 - 20 g, were not fed by OVA -containing food and came from the animal center of China Three Gorges University with the production certificate No. of the experimental animal of SYXK (E) 2019 -0083. They were rais ed in the SPF-level environment of Hubei College of Chinese Medicine. Hubei Dongxin Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Loratadine Tablets were purchased from Hainan Hishen Tongzhou Pharmacy Co., Ltd, IL -4, IFN - test reagents were purchased from Ruixin Biotech. Primer was purchased from Wuhan G e- neCreate Biological Engineering Co., Ltd. Trizol was purchased from Tiangen Biochemical Technology Co., Ltd. Experimental institution: High speed freezing centrifuge (Eppe ndorf comp a- ny, Germany), paraffin embedding center, tissue freezing machine, paraffin sli c- ing machine, microscope (Leica company, Germany), microplate reader (DR -200Bs, Diatek company), fluorescence quantitative PCR instrument (Shanghai Hongsh i Medical Technology Co., Ltd .). 2.1. Model Preparation This research adopted OVA to establish the AR model of mice. Except the no r- mal group, other groups were inject ed with 0.05 mg OVA and 5 mg AL (OH)3 intraperitoneally and 1 ml normal saline was added for mixing o nce every other day; after the basic sensitization, the mice received the nasal sensitization on the 15th day, and the nasal cavity was dripped with 5% ova solution, with 0.02 ml/side, once/day and consecutive 7 days [5]. The normal group received the intraperitoneal injection and nasal drip with the equal volume of normal saline. B. Y. Chen et al. DOI: 10.4236/ym.2021.52013 127 Yangtze Medicine The successful judgement method of the model is subject to the literature [6] . After the last nasal provocation, the uninformed personnel recorded the times of sneezing, nose scratch and nasal mucus volume of each group in 30 min. One point shall be recorded for 1 - 3 times of sneezing/1 - 2 times of nose scratch/nasal discharge to anterior nostril, respectively, two points shall be re c- orded for 4 - 10 times of sneezing/rubbing between the two nostrils/nasal di s- charge from anterior nostril, respective ly and three points are recorded for sneezing > 10 times/rubbing around the nose/covering tears on the face, respe c- tively. If the total score is > 5 points, it showed that the model was successfully established. 2.2. Experimental Grouping and Intervention Forty BALB/c mice were selected and divided into four groups based on the random number method: normal group, model group, Yupinfengsan Oral Li q- uid group (6 g/kg), Loratadine group (3 mg/kg), with 10 mice per group. The normal group and model group receiv ed the intragastric administration with the equal volume of normal saline, and the Yupinfengsan Oral Liquid group and Loratadine group received the intragastric administration with Yupinfengsan Oral Liquid and Loratadine, respectively. The body mass of the Yupinfengsan Oral Liquid group and Loratadine group was 6 g/kg and 3 mg/kg, respectively (Clinical commonly -used dose was chosen and the intragastric dose in mice was gotten in accordance with the dose conversion method of experimental zoology), with onc e a day for 7 consecutive days. 2.3. IL-4 and IFN- Levels of Serum in the Four Groups of Mice Were Detected According to the ELISA Method After the last administration, the blood was collected after removing the eyeball, and placed under the room temperat ure for 2 h. It shall be centrifuged for 15 minutes under 4C 3000 r/min, and the liquid supernatant was taken and stored under the 80C refrigerator for testing. ELISA shall detect the IL -4 and IFN - contents in serum in strict accordance with the kit in structions. 2.4. Observation for Morphology of Nasal Mucosa After collecting the blood, the mice were killed immediately to collect the nasal mucosa tissue. It was fixed by paraformaldehyde and dehydrated for multiple layers to prepare the paraffin sectio n. The HE dyeing was carried out to observe the pathologic change of the tissues. 2.5. NF -B p65 Protein Expression Level Was Detected in Accordance with the Western Blot Method The nasal mucosa tissue of mice was lysed with the lysate liquid, and the sa mple treatment liquid was taken for SDS -PAGE electrophoresis and rotary die. After sealing, the primary anti -body was blocked overnight. Then, the secondary a n- ti-body was carried out with NF -B (concentration 1:1000) and internal refe r-B. Y. Chen et al.

The recent researches has shown that Yupingfengsan can give the role of i m- mune regulation, anti -inflammatory, antibacterial and other effects via different mechanisms, and it can prevent and treat the allergic rhinitis, upper respiratory tract infection and other diseases. Clinically, there are numerous kinds of drugs in treatment of AR, and it mainly includes glucocorticoids, antihistamines and other drugs. There a re little research on the r elevant mechanism for AR treat- ment by Yupingfengsan, so it has no available support for Yp ingfengsan on AR treatment [7] . AR is a type -I allergic disease resealed by the IgE -mediated mediators, and involved with multiple immune cells and cytokines after the body is exposed to the allergen . Now, it is generally accepted that the balance disorder of the T he l- per cells (Th1 /Th2) is the key to cause AR. IFN - is the key effect factor of Th1 secretion, and it can inhibit the synthesis of IgE by B cells and the differentiation of Th0 cells into Th2 cells. IL -4 is mainly generated from Th2 cells, and it pr o- motes the synthesis of IgE. Besides, it can induce the isomorphic transformation of immune globulin, which is secreted by B cells, from IgM to IgE, and enhance the degranulation of mast cells [8] . The abnormal expression of IL -4 and IFN - suggests the differentiation deviation of Th cells. NF -B is a transcription factor with the nucleated cells that are located in the TLR downstream signaling hub, which plays a pivotal role in the inflammation and immune response through regulating the cascade amplification waterfall effect among relevant factors of immunity, inflammation and inflammatory transmitter [9] . The numerous st u- dies showed that TLR -NF- B signal pathway plays an important role in the bal- ance disorder of Th1/Th2 cytokines. In this experiment, OVA and aluminum hydroxide adjuvant s stimulated the mice repeatedly to generate the allergic reaction, to successfully establish the AR mice model according to the score of the mice's symptoms. The result showed that Yupinfengsan Oral Liquid can improve the clinical symptoms and histop a- thological manifestations of AR mice. Compared with the normal group, the studies observed that the IL -4 level in the serum of AR model group was signifi- cantly increased and the IFN - level was significantly decreased. After the trea t- ment of Yupinfengsan Oral Liquid, the IL -4 level in serum was decreased and IFN- level was increased when compared with the model group. It indicated that the Yupinfengsan Oral Liquid can effectively regulate the AR mice's cyt o- kines, and play the immunomodulatory effect on the all ergic rhinitis, which was consistent with the studies of immunologic equilibrium mechanism of Th1/Th2 cytokines of the most allergic rhinitis. Through the further research, it was found that Yupinfengsan Oral Liquid can inhibit the NF- B expression, and it was speculated that it treated the allergic rhinitis by inhibiting the NF -B activation and maintaining Th1/Th2 cytokines balance. This study carries out the prelimi-nary discussion for the mechanism of action of Yupinfengsan Oral Liquid on the B. Y. Chen et al. DOI: 10.4236/ym.2021.52013 132 Yangtze Medicine treatment o f AR. However, it remained to be studied for the method to inacti- vate NF -B, so as to block in flammation and immune response.

Methods : In the GEO dat a- base, the differential ge ne expression s of liver sinusoid al endothelial cells in cirrhotic rats w ere obtained. The screening was performed according to P < 0.01 and differential multiple factor 4. The obtained genes were input into the DAVID database for enrichment analysis of genes and pathways. The GeneMania and string databases were then used for protein interactio n anal- ysis. Results : The GSE1843 dataset was obtained in the GEO database, and three pathways significantly associated with cirrhosis and 13 differential genes enriched in three pathways were screened. Text mining revealed that 11 differential genes were d irectly associated with cirrhosis. The other two were indirectly linked by other genes. The screened genes and known gene form a- tion networks were discovered by the GeneMania tool. Conclusion: CDH2 and COL1A1 may be important target genes for cirrhosis.

Introduction Cirrhosis is the intermediate pathological process of chronic liver disease, which will turn into liver failure and liver cancer if not controlled and reversed [1] . Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is the main cause of liver cirrhosis in China [2] . About 2 billion people in the world have been infected with the HEPATITIS B virus (HBV), 240 million of whom are chronic HBV infected. About 650,000 people die every year from diseases such as cirrhosis and liver cancer caused by HBV How to cite this paper: Zhao, X., Lu, H.F. and Li, M.

Liver sinusoidal Phagocytic cells (LSEC) are the sinusoidal morphological characteristics; fenestra ACTS as a barrier du r- ing material exchange [4] . Under the action of chronic liver injury factors, a continuous basal membrane will form at the junction between LSEC and hep a- tocytes, which will damage the liver microcirculation and accompany the disa p- pearance of window holes. LSEC is closely related to liver diseases [5] . Currently, there are no specific drugs for the treatment of cirrhosis, mainly because the p a- thogenesis of the disease is very complex, there is no appropriate target for ta r- geted therapy. In this study, gene c hips of hepatic sinuses endothelial cells of cirrhotic rats were obtained from the GEO database to screen differential genes, and enrichment pathways, functions, and interactions of differential genes were analyzed through the DAVID GeneMania database, to provide a scientific basis for in- depth research on the molecular mechanism of cirrhosis. 2. Material and Methods 2.1. Acquisition and A nalysis of D ata Set Taking Sinusphagoid Cells as the keyword and expression profiling by Array as the research type restriction, we search -relevant gene chip information in the GEO database and obtain GSE1843 [6] data set, which is derived from the Ce n- ter for Biochemical and Molecular Genetics in Barcelona, Spain, and platform GPL341 . 2.2. Screening of Differential Genes GEO2R [7], an online analysis tool from the GEO database, is a data analysis tool based on the R language that was created in 2012 to perform statistical analysis to screen out differential genes. In this study, liver sinusoidal endothelial cells of cirrhotic rats and normal rat sinusoidal endothelial cells were used as experimental group and control group respectively to analyze the differentially expressed genes in the samples of the two groups. The differentially expressed genes were screened by 0.05 and the differentially expressed multiple of 4. 2.3. Bioinformatics Ana lysis of Differential Genes Gene and pathway function annotation was carried out by DAVID [8] (https ://david.ncifcrf.gov/ ), text mining was carried out by COREMINE, and protein interaction analysis was carried out by GeneMania [9] (https ://www.gen emania.org/ ). H epatic Sinusoidal Endothelial Cells in Cirrhotic Rats Firstly, background correction and standardization were carried out for the chip data of each sample. As can be seen from Figure 1, the chip data after processing X. Zhao et al. DOI: 10.4236/ym.2021.52014 135 Yangtze Medicine Figure 1. Box chart from processing chip data of sample. had good distribution. There are 15,924 genes in the GSE1843 dataset, and we call them P < 0.01 and diff. 4 were used as screening conditions. Without e n- coding genes and duplicating genes, we obtained 120 differentially expressed genes, including 100 up -regulated genes and 20 down -regulated genes. 3.2. Pathway Analysis of D ifferentially Expressed Genes 120 differentially expressed genes were input into DAVID data base, and the si g- naling pathways enriched with differentially expressed genes could be obtained by KEGG analysis, according to P < Three pathways with significantly enriched genes were screened out, as shown in Table 1 . 3.3. Interaction Analysis of D ifferentially Expressed Genes Enrichment on the three pathways of 17 genes has four is repeated, so we focus on the 13 genes, Protein digestion and absorption on the enrichment of the gene for Col1a1 Col1a2 Alcam, Cdh2, Cldn3, Cldn5, Ncam1, Nrxn1, and Sel p. CARMINE was used for text mining to further explain the correlation b e- tween 13 different genes and cirrhosis diseases. The keywords of each gene of cirrhosis were searched, and it was found that in addition to ALCAM NRXN1, the other 11 genes were directly related to the disease of cirrhosis, and these genes also had interact ion, for example, COL1A1 and COL1A2 had significant interaction, as shown in Figure 2 .

Differential Genes Interact with Known Genes Literature search was conducted on PubMed with cirrhosis and gene as ke y- words, and every relevant literature was screened and reviewed. Eight genes were found to be closely related to cirrhosis, and GeneMania was used to analyze the interaction between differential genes and known genes, as shown in Figure 3 . It can be seen from the figure that the differentiated genes are directly or indirectly related to the known genes, forming a relational network, indicating that these genes are functionally correlated, indicating that the differentiated gene s may also be closely related to cirrhosis. CDH2 interacts directly LCAM interacts directly with EGFR and BCL2. Different genes also interact with each other. and COL1A2 SELP LAMB1 CLDN5 SLC8A1 COL5A1 COL6A3 have a direct effect. The bar chart is made according to the number of genes directly interacting b etween di f- ferent genes, as shown in Figure 4 . 4. Discussion Bioinformatics is a new subject that is formed by the cross of many subjects. Bioinformatics data mining at the molecular level provides a new direction for the study of molecular mechanisms of various diseases. In this study, gene chips related to liver c irrhosis in the GEO database were searched, mRNA expression X. Zhao et al. DOI: 10.4236/ym.2021.52014 137 Yangtze Medicine Figure 3. Interaction diagram between known genes and screened genes. Figure 4. Gene interaction in bar. X. Zhao et al. DOI: 10.4236/ym.2021.52014 138 Yangtze Medicine profiles were analyzed, differential genes were screened out, and genes and pathways related to liver cirrhosis were further mined through biosignal pat h- way enrichment text mining protein interaction analysis methods. Cirrhosis is a chronic progressive disease, and Friedman [10] believes that cirrhosis, like fibr o- sis, can be reversed. The pathogenesis of cirrhosis is very complex. At present, no marker can accurately reflect the occurrence and development of the disease except pathological examination, so it is very necessary to study the pathogenesis at the molecular level. This study is based on a GEO database mining differences in cirrhosis of the liver sinus endothelial cell genetic data sets, use all kinds of bioinformatics database and software analysis, selected three pathways asso- ciated with liver cirrhosis was significantly protein digestion and absorption of ECM receptor pathways in cellular adhesive molecular pathways and enric h- ment of 13 of the differences in these th ree pathways genes, including CDH2 and COL1A1 gene may be important targets of cirrhosis of the liver disease. Three significant correlation on the path of 13 different genes, the discovery of literature retrieval, is rare in most of the genes in cirrhosis of the liver, such as Wang Junhua [11], the study found in the liver of mice injected foam ball larva of liver fibrosis model is set up, in the extracellular matrix (ECM) accumulation in the process, the detection COL1A1 expression increased significantly, COL1A1 and closely related to liver fibrosis, and liver fibrosis and cirrhosis of the liver is a chronic liver disease in a different period, the performance of COL1A1 and cirrhosis are likely to exist close ties. Retinoic acid can inhibit the activation of hepatic stellate cells and regulate the expression of TGF -1. Studies by Fu Yu et al. found that the expression of TGF -1 was down -regulated and the expression of COL1A1 was decreased when retinoic acid was used in rats with chronic alcoholic liver injury, indicating that r etinoic acid can protect the liver to a certain extent [12] [13]. Epitheliu m mesenchymal transition (EMT) has b e- come a hot topic in the study of tumor invasion and metastasis [14] . Cao Gu a- ngxin et al. found that EMT expression in bladder cancer tissues was signif i- cantly higher than that in normal bladder tissues, and upregulation of CDH2 was one of the markers of EMT [15] [16]. Studies on CDH2 and cirrhosis have not yet been reported. Whether CDH2 can be used as a marker molecule for the development of cirrhosis remains to be further studied. To sum up, this study by GEO database mining a gene chip bioinformatics analysis, selected three liver cirrhosis was significantly related signaling pat h- ways, three signaling pathways enriched in 13 different genes, including CDH2 and COL1A1 may be important target genes, and molecular mechanism of liver cirrhosis, using bioinformatics analysis method can be carried out on the data of gene chip analysis and screening again, thus effici ently on a large scale for bi o- logical internal information, it provides some new mentality on the molecular mechanism for the study of liver cirrhosis. However, only one set of related gene chips was found, which limited the screening of different genes. T herefore, it is necessary to obtain the latest chip for analysis and conduct experimental verifi- cation of the screened different genes. X. Zhao et al.

STAD is the fifth most prevalent cancer and the third leading cause of cancer -related death in the world. Gastric cancer is more co mmon in Asia than in most Western countries. The incidence in East Asia is about 50 cases per 100,000 people, about 10 times more than that in North America [1] [2]. There is an urgent need to iden tify p o- tential novel oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, and bio markers of diagno- sis, therapy and prognosis specifically for Asian STAD. Weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) [3] is a data reduction and unsupervised classification method. It simplifies the interpretation of many gene responses to multiple synthetic genomes (or modules). The net establishes a link between genes whose expression is related. There will be connections between genes, depending on the value of t he correlation (weight). Connectivity between genes is then interpreted as distance, with which genes are grouped into mo d- ules. This is the way to reduce many genes to several clusters, the expression of which is quantified by Eigengenes (the first princip al component in the module). It assumes that highly related genes in the module are involved in a common b i- ological process. At present, there are only 4 articles in PubMed in which WGCNA was used to study the gastric cancer transcriptome and none of the 4 articles specifically st u- died the Asian human STAD transcriptome [4] [5] [6] [7]. Her e we used WGCNA together with other bioinformatic tools to identify potential novel o n- cogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and biomarkers of diagnosis, therapy and prognosis specifically for Asian STAD. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Installation of R and Perl R x64 4.03 language installation package were downloaded from https://www.r -project.org/ , Perl installation package downloaded from https://www.perl.org/ , and they were installe d as instructed. 2.2. Datasets from TCGA With filters Cases (Stomach, TCGA, TCGA Adenomas and Adeno Carcinomas and Gene E xpression Quantification, HTSeq -Counts and Txt), 74 samples (7 normal tissues and 67 tumors) were filtered out from the TCGA database ( https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/ ) and the required files were exported via Cart. The exported files were deco m- pressed, and the 74 samples were processed through Perl to merge them together and calculated to get a Matrix file. The matrix file ENSG ID then was converted into Symbol ID by R language. With filters of Cases (Stomach, TCGA, TCGA -STAD, Adenomas and Adeno Carcinomas and Asian) and Files (Clinical and Bcr xml), then clinical datasets of Y. Zhou et al. DOI: 10.4236/ym.2021.52015 143 Yangtze Medicine 443 samples were obtained from TCGA. Clinical information of ge ne ID, futi me, fustat, age, gender, grade, stage, T, M and N was obtained through Perl. 2.3. Datasets from GEO The Expression Profiling by Array (Series GSE 54129) was obtained from GEO (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ ). We contained information on 111 human gas- tric cancer tissues and 21 non -cancerous gastric tissues, which were collected in Ruijin Hospital, SJTU, Chin a. Through Perl processing of the GEO file, we o b- tained one probe, one matrix file, and one annotation file. 2.4. Differential Expression Analysis The differential expression analysis environment was constructed with four packages including limma, edgeR, p heatmap and ggplot2 through R software to output the analysis results. Take logFC filter conditions as logfcfilt er = 1; After correction, t he P value filteri ng condition was set as fdrFilter = 0.05. TCGA d a- tasets and GEO datasets were analyzed, respectivel y. 2.5. Construction of WGCNA and Identification of Important Modules Data was processed using R 4.0.3 software. To ensure the reliability of the ne t- work construction, the abnormal samples were deleted. Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated to as sess the similarity of gene expression profiles, and then the correlation coefficient between genes was weighted by a power function to obtain a scale -free network. In terms of co -expression, gene modules are densely interconnected gene clusters. WGCNA uses hierarchical clustering to identify gene modules and colors to indicate modules. Dynamic tree cutting was used to identify different modules. In the module selection process, the adjacen- cy matrix (a measure of topological similarity) was converted into a topological covering matrix (TOM, no graph was output due to the limited function of the computer), and the modules were detected by clustering analysis. The WGCNA and limma packages of R were used. The minimum gene mo d- ule size was set to 50 to obtain mod ules of appropriate size and the threshold for merging similar modules was set to 0.25. TCGA datasets and GEO datasets were analyzed, respectively. 2.6. Venn Diagram TCGA differential expression analysis results, GEO differential expression anal- ysis result s, TCGA turquoise module and GEO black module were made into Venn Diagram by Venn Diagram package in R, and the intersection gene data text of the four kinds of data were output at the same time. 2.7. GO (Gene Ontology) and KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Gene s and Genomes) Enrichment Analysis Intersection gene data text showed gene by symbol ID. We translated it into e n-Y. Zhou et al. DOI: 10.4236/ym.2021.52015 144 Yangtze Medicine trezID with R's org.Hs.eg.db package. Then the enrichment analysis was done by R to library clusterProfiler, org.Hs.eg.db, enr ichplot and ggplot2 packages. p value filter condition was set as p value filter = 0.05; t he adjusted p -value filter condition was set as q value Filt er = 1. 2.8. PPI (Protein Interaction Network) Analysis On the website https://string -db.org/ , we input the intersection genes of Venn, selected species, and then got the network diagram of protein interaction. We highlighted the connection of these genes by setting the minimum required i n- teraction score. It can also set medi um confidence (0.400) or hide disconnected nodes in the network. We output proteins interactions file and protein intera c- tion diagram. 2.9. Cytoscape We installed java, then installed Cytoscape. We imported the files obtained from PPI processing into Cytos cape to obtain hub genes. 2.10. HPA The obtained ten hub genes were introduced into the http://www.proteinatlas.org/ , to obtain immunohistochemical images related to the target genes and diseases. 2.11 . Survival and Clinical Analysis Overall survival of STAD patients was analyzed using the Kaplan Meier plot (http://kmplot.com ). 3. Result 3.1. 6652 Differentially Expressed Genes Were Identified between STAD and Normal Samples A tota l of 4859 differentially expressed genes from TCGA and 1793 differentially expressed genes from GEO were identified between STAD and normal samples as shown in Figure 1 (a) and Figure 1 (b) (TCGA) and Figure 1 (c) and Figure 1(d) (GEO). 3.2. 13 key Modules Were Identified in STAD by WGCNA Analysis The first 25% differentially expressed genes in TCGA and GEO data were sep a- rately used for cluster analysis through WGCNA package. Hierarchical cluste r- ing trees were constructed using the gene expression data with the height thr e- shold limit and screen out outliers. The rest of the data was used to construct and weight the co -expression network. To determine the optimal value of soft threshold (power), the analysis n eeds w ere made in a certain range and the scale -free condition. When the power value was set to 1 and 8 ( Figure 2 (a)), the connectivity between genes in the network satisfied the scale -free network di s- tribution. By combining the modules with higher similarity of characteristic Y. Zhou et al. DOI: 10.4236/ym.2021.52015 145 Yangtze Medicine (a) (b) Y. Zhou et al.

We found that the expression of the genes in turquoise modules of TCGA samples and in black modules of GEO samples have the greatest correlation with the tumor tissues ( Figure 2 (d)). 3.3. 293 Potential STAD Associated Genes Were Identif ied from Intersection by Venn Diagram To reduce the false positive rate of the results, the Venn diagram of the above four data sets (TCGA turquoise module, GEO black module, TCGA differentia l- ly expressed genes and GEO differentially expressed genes) was used for inte r- section. There are 293 genes that are intersected in all 4 group s, and pictures and text files were output ( Figure 3 ). Y. Zhou et al. DOI: 10.4236/ym.2021.52015 149 Yangtze Medicine Figure 3. 293 STAD associated genes were identified from intersection by Venn Diagram. 3.4. The 293 Intersected Genes Were Enriched in Cell Cortex and Infection by GO and KEGG Analysis GO and KEGG analyses were carried out to explore their biological function of the 293 intersected genes identified by Venn Diagram. GO analysis showed that these genes are mainly involved in the processes of cell cortex, secretory granule lumen, carbohydrate binding and actin binding. KEGG analysis showed that these genes were highly correlated with Hepatitis C, pathogenic Escherichia coli infection, amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism, complement and coastal cascades, and Histidine metabolism ( Table 1 and Figure 4 ). 3.5. 10 Hub Genes Were Identified from PPI and Cytoscape Analyses of the Intersected Genes PPI analysis of the 293 intersected genes identified by Venn Diagram sorted out 354 pairwise links and deleted the genes that were not connected with the su b- ject network ( Figure 5 ). Then we imported the interactive file obtained from th e PPI analysis into Cytoscape to construct a gene network and screened out 10 hub genes (KLF4, to their degree of associations ( Table 2 and Table 3 , Figure 5 ). Among the 10 hub genes, KLF4 and CGN expression was decreased while other 8 gene expression was increased in STAD tumors compared to no r- mal tissues ( Table 3 ). When we imported into the HPA official websit e, imm u- nohistochemical images of malignant gastric cancer tissues verified the expre s- sion of these hub genes. 3.6. KLF4/CGN Low and SHH/LIF High Expression Were Associated with Short Overall Survival of Asian STAD Patients Interestingly, using the Kaplan Meier plot, we found that SHH/LIF high expre s- sion among tumors was associated with short overall survival of Asian STAD patients, while low expression of KLF4/CGN and the other 6 hub genes among tumors was associated with short overall survival of Asian ST AD patients ( Table 4 and Figure 6 ). The association of the gene expression among tumors and Y. Zhou et al. DOI: 10.4236/ym.2021.52015 150 Yangtze Medicine Figure 4.

Discussion and Conclusion STAD is a kind of high incidence and mortality tumor in adults, especially in Asian, and there is a n urgent nee d to identify potential novel oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and biomarkers of diagnosis, therapy and prognosis, specif i- cally for Asian STAD. In this study, the gene expression data of the STAD tra n- scriptome were analyzed, and a total of 4859 differentially expressed genes from Y. Zhou et al. DOI: 10.4236/ym.2021.52015 154 Yangtze Medicine TCGA and 1793 genes from GEO were identified in STAD, fo llowed by identif i- cation of the five modules of TCGA and eight modules of GEO. These differe n- tially expressed genes and the tumor 's associated module genes were subjected to Venn intersection, and 293 intersected genes were obtained. These intersected gene s are enriched in a few biological processes and biological functions, such as chemotaxis, inflammatory reactions, angiogenesis, cell cycle, etc., which may be related to the occurrence and development of the cancer. Ten hub genes were screened out from th ese 293 intersected genes for association analysis with su r- vival in patients with STAD. Our results showed that KLF4/CGN low and SHH/LIF high expression were associated with short overall survival of Asian STAD patients. Our bioinformatics analysis reveale d potential novel tumor su p- pressors (KLF4/CGN) and oncogenes (SHH/LIF) and biomarkers for diagnosis, therapy and prognosis of STAD, specifically for Asian patients [8] [9] [10] . In our study, the system biology -based methods, including WGCNA, were used to identify the 10 network hub genes related to STAD high expre ssion were associated with short overall survival of Asian STAD patients, the other 6 hub genes (GATA6, FOXA2, OCLN, FOXA1, CLDN1 and NQO1) were all expressed higher in STAD tumors compared to the normal tissues, but higher expression in tumors showed long er overall survival of STAD patients. The inconsistence may suggest that the 6 hub genes may be passenger genes or expressed as an active compensation to su p- press tumor progression. It has been shown that KLF4, CGN, GATA6, FOXA2, OCLN, FOXA1, CLDN1 and NQO1 occurrence and development of tumor s [11]-[17], while SHH and LIF promote tumor occurrence and deve l- opment [18] [19]. LIF promotes tumorigenesis and metastasis breast cancer, Shh Bladder promotes cancer stemness and tumorigenesis. At present, exper i- mental studies on CGN are not found. KLF4 can inhibit prolife ration and inv a- sion of breast cancer [20] , reduce the impact of chemotherapy on colon cancer cells [21]. As an important signal transduction pathway for the occurrence and development of cancer, SHH has become an important target gene for the treatment of medulloblastoma and pancreatic cancer [22] [23]. LIF can be i n- duced by HIF -2 and promotes tumor progression, metastasis, and chemical r e- sistanc e in a variety of solid tumors [24] [25]. The potential novel tumor su p- pressors and oncogenes and biomarkers identified here need to be further val i- dated. Some limitations of our study should be mentioned. First, this was a retro s- pective design study, not a prospective cohort study. In addition, a large sa mple size was requir ed to verify our findings. Thirdly , these results may be validated experimentally in future. Funding This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (81872412). Y. Zhou et al.
