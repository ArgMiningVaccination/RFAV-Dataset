EDITOR'S NOTE ^X^A2 Russia, an Orwellian Nightmare, the pseudosciences rampant in Russia have an exotic sound and flavor. But looked at a little deeper, they are the same kind of nonsense that afflict the West. In Russia many of these claims and gadgets have made inroads into die ministries of government. Now high-level scientists are fighting back. In October CSICOP and the Russian Academy of Sciences sponsored a spe\u00ad cial conference in Moscow on \"Science, Anti-Science, and the Paranormal.\" We have three reports in this issue. CSICOP chairman and conference co- chairman Paul Kurtz gives an overview. Astronomer Yuri Efremov expounds on how the achievements in astronomy in recent years quickly outstrip all pseu- doscience and give the lie to postmodernist claims of a \"crisis in science,\" and a need to \"overthrow die scientific paradigm.\" Prominent physicist Edward Kruglyakov chronicles the rise of pseudoscience and antiscience in Russia\u2014 including some of the wacky claims that have made their way into the halls of government\u2014and reports on the special Russian Academy of Sciences com\u00ad mission against pseudoscience that he heads. In this issue we publish the conclusion of \"Who Abused Jane Doe?\"\u2014Elizabeth Loftus and Melvin Guyer's narrative report on their efforts to evaluate a claim of the recovery of a repressed memory and find the real truth behind it. A short postscript hints at the legal obstacles put in their way, denying what we used to [hink of as free speech, open debate, and academic freedom. CSICOP Fellow Carol Tavris follows with her own behind-the-scenes look at the travails they were put through. Her article \"The High Cost of Skepticism\" chronicles \"an Orwellian nightmare,\" in which their universities, rather than supporting their rights to open free scientific inquiry, obstructed and harassed them. It is a trou\u00ad bling indictment of new, burdensome, instittitional barriers to free inquiry. Stephen Jay Gould is gone. His death May 20 at the age of 60 (see page 8) is a loss to science, skepticism, and the public. The best-known scientist and writer in recent times on paleontology and evolution, Gould was a first-rate evolution\u00ad ary scientist, a steadfast defender of scientific ideals (and critic of creationism), and a prolific author of both scholarly works and elegant essays for the educated layman on evolutionary science (in all its wondrous aspects). Much has and will be written about him, including his brilliance, his occasional arrogance, the var\u00ad ious views of evolutionary colleagues about his scientific work, but what I most appreciated was his writing about science for the layman. He chose to write about science for the public in a substantive way diat never talked down to his audiences. He portrayed the marvelous complexity of both life and of the very human scientific enterprise, while finding wonderful humanistic connections between science and nature and everything from opera to baseball. His monthly essays in every issue of Natural History for twenty-seven years from January 1974 through December 2000, collected into a series of memorable books, educated several generations of us about evolution and a dazzling array of topics in the his\u00ad tory of science. First Asimov, then Sagan, now Gould. All brilliant popularizers and interpreters of science for the layman. All taken from us prematurely.

Binga The SKEPTICAL INQUIRER is the official journal of the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal, an international organization. 4 May/June 2002 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER NEWS AND COMMENT New Age, Paranormal Topics Influenced Alleged Domestic Pipe Bomb Terrorist Luke Helder BENJAMIN RADFORD At a time when international terrorism was on Americas collective mind, it was an American terrorist who panicked many in the heartland in May of 2002. Six people were injured when pipe bombs left in their rural mailboxes exploded. Over the course of a week, eighteen pipe bombs were found in Iowa, Illinois, Nebraska, Colorado, and Texas. Finally the bombs were traced to Luke J. Helder, a twenty-one-year-old college student from Pine Island, Minnesota. Following a high-speed car chase, he was armed with a shotgun when he was arrested in Reno, Nevada, on May 7. According to messages and material Helder left near the attacks, the bombs were \"attention getters.\" Though many news reports characterized Hredler's messages ic onn-irowrnmcnf in fact many of diem deal with his philosophical views and the paranormal. In a six-page typed letter to The Badger Herald, a student newspaper at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Helder discussed his belief in various paranormal topics and that death is an illusion. A friend of his was quoted by ABC News as saying that Helder \"seemed really obsessed about New Age religion and death and the fact that death really doesn't mean an end to existence.\" His motivation to plant bombs to kill and injure people came from his desire to enlighten the world to his beliefs and revealed truths: \"I'm doing this because I care. ... In the end you will know I was telling you the truth anyway. . . . I'm taking very drastic measures in attempt to provide this information to you.\" Helder writes rJiat each person can create his or her own reality, and that \"once you begin to realize the potential you have as a consciousness/soul/spirit, you will begin to harness the abilities you have to produce realities. . . . Because you are producing the reality entirely, you are not confined to the laws Luke Helder, a 21-year-old college student, is taken into the Washoe County Jail in Reno. Nevada. of physics. ...\" Helder discusses the New Age idea of lucid dreaming, in which, he says, \"you enter a reality within your body.\" Helder mentions astral projection as a parJi to knowledge, writing \"Whether it's logic, meditation, channeling, astral projection, or ghosts, all are ways of knowing.\" An ex- girlfriend of Helders said that he was fascinated with astral projection, or out- of-body experiences, and tried unsuc\u00ad cessfully to achieve one several times. Helder also had a strong interest in ghosts: \"Many consciousnesses linger around on earth, clutching to material things; this is what ghosts are. . . . You may hear ghost stories, but have you ever seen one? If you haven't, get out the cam\u00ad era and start seeing. ... I was curious about the existence of ghosts, and my curiosity led me to further investigation, which in turn allowed me to know ghosts truly do exist. Needless to say, it was an exciting occasion to finally see one! When I got my film developed to find orbs, the week was even more exciting!\" Here Helder is referring to the idea that ghosts can be photographed, and appear as small unexplained blurs, lights, or \"orbs\" in photographs that were unnoticed when the photo was taken. As CSICOP Senior Research Fellow Joe Nickell notes in this book Camera Clues, there are many perfectly ordinary, photographic explanations for such phenomena. \"Orbs\" are often simply the result of a flash reflecting dust particles or mois\u00ad ture droplets near the lens, or an unno\u00ad ticed shiny surface. Nonetheless, many self-styled \"ghost experts\" write books and give seminars on such \"orbs\" as a way for people to confirm the existence of spirits. Had Helder looked for science-based, skeptical infor\u00ad mation on ghosts instead of to the rafts of uncritical, pro-paranormal books, he might have come to different conclusions. The paranormal cannot be said to have caused Helders bombing attacks, just as belief in UFOs did not directly cause the mass suicide of the Heaven's Gate cult in March of 1997. But clearly belief in and fascination with the para\u00ad normal played a large role in these crimes and tragedies. Magical thinking in one part of a person's life can easily lead to a lack of critical thinking in oth\u00ad ers as well. As usual, diose who knew Helder appeared in the media to express shock and puzzlement over his actions. Helders parents said that the only odd thing they'd seen him do recently was ask for his mother's Bible, then sit and read it for an hour, something diey had never seen him do before. Within a week he was off making pipe bombs to maim or kill innocent people. Benjamin Radford is a writer and Managing Editor of the SKEPTICAL INQUIRER. SKEPTICAL INQUIRER July/August 2002 5 NEWS AND COMMENT Rise of the Raelians: Flying Saucers, Science, Sex, and Religion In 1973 Claude Vorilhon, then twenty- seven and editor of a minor auto racing magazine, was (he says) taken onto a fly\u00ad ing saucer while hiking in the dish of a French volcano in a wooded area in France. There he met a four-foot humanoid extraterrestial with olive- colored skin, almond-shaped eyes, and long dark hair. The first words he heard from the humanoid was a question whether he regretted not having brought his camera. For the next six days, Vorilhon had conversations with the extraterrestrial, who explained that humanity had been created by means of DNA manipulation by beings known as the Elohim\u2014a Biblical term, usually translated as God, but which actually meant \"those who came from the sky.\" Past prophets including Moses, Buddha, Jesus, and Muhammed had been given their revelations and training by the Elohims who had selected them. The reason for the present mission was to remove previous distortions in the inter\u00ad pretation of their message and to get to know their creations on equal terms and to demystify \"die old concept of God.\" Vorilhon, who then took the name of Rael, had been selected to pave the way for a second coming of the creators from outer space. This required teaching all humans the Raelian beliefs, which emphasized peace, tolerance, a love of science, and sexual freedom. The ques\u00ad tion is what kind of science? [CONDONS^? Vorilhon began teaching the \"true\" account of the creation of humans and as of this writing claims to have about 50,000 followers in eighty-four coun\u00ad tries. Most of the believers are in French- speaking areas of Europe and Canada. Vorilhon, however, modesdy says diat only about 10 percent of his followers are active members. In the small farming community of Valcort (northeast of Montreal) the group has established UFOland as their headquarters and embassy to the world. The building itself is part office complex and part museum. For two weeks every summer Raelians gather there for meetings and meditation. In 1998 Vorilhon announced to his followers that the alien creators of Earth would soon return to Earth and it was necessary to expedite preparations for this second coming. One of the essential first steps was the recruitment of a num\u00ad ber of young women members into the Order of the Angels to serve as hostesses and sexual mates for the arriving prog\u00ad enitors of humans. Within this order was a select group who agreed only to sleep with the aliens and their prophets, including of course Vorilhon. Vorilhon, however, emphasizes that the angels are under no pressure to sleep with him, since the Raelians teach sexual freedom and not coercion. The movement thrives on media attention and Vorilhon deliberately seeks it out, especially on sex issues. For example, to protest a 1992 decision in Quebec barring condom machines at certain Quebec high schools, the Raelians passed out condoms to stu\u00ad dents from a van adorned with large spaceships. The group also bought billboard space in Toronto to welcome extraterrestrial vis\u00ad itors. Vorilhon also makes pronouncements about some world-shaking events which will take place but which only true Raelians will know of. Like others I 'Jbj'k . .zx-;x kN^i who make such state\u00ad ments, those which have become known are sufficiently vague to meet almost any chance occurrence. But it is die science part of the Raelian agenda where the group seeks and gets publicity. After the cloning of the sheep Dolly in 1996, Vorilhon created a com\u00ad pany, Clonaid, to do human cloning and help any gay or infertile couple have chil\u00ad dren for a $200,000 fee. He then opened a post office box in the Bahamas and sev\u00ad eral of the women in the Order of Angels volunteered to serve as the proxy morft- ers. Most daringly and most troubling, he also moved into cloning when one of his followers, Brigette Boisseler, who held two doctorates in chemistry, became the scientific director of Clonaid. Another follower, Mark Hunt, who had lost his ten-month-old son earlier, agreed to stock a lab to do DNA research and pos\u00ad sible human cloning under the direction of Boisseler in Nitro, West Virginia, in the office building where his law firm was located. A more-or-less secret lab was being set up with equipment for research into DNA and with an ultimate goal of cloning a human. When this secret effort found its way into the press through a television appearance by Boisseler, the lab was closed by Hunt who complained that Boisseler was more a \"press hog\" than a researcher. She still maintains she has an interest in human cloning, and so appar- endy does Vorilhon. Just how serious the effort might be is uncertain, and it is complicated by the fact that Vorilhon bragged he got mil\u00ad lions in media publicity from his stunt. More importantly he attracted congres\u00ad sional attention. Rep. James C. Green\u00ad wood (R-Pennsylvania), as chairman of a House Energy and Commerce sub\u00ad committee, invited Raelians to testify before his committee last year as he pre\u00ad pared legislation to ban any cloning that would produce children. Vorilhon, who appeared as an expert witness in a white jumpsuit with his hair tied atop his head in a knot, testified that people one day would clone themselves and then download their personalities into the clones, achieving a kind of eternal life. Greenwood later said that Vorilhon's 6 July/August 2002 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER NEWS AND COMMENT testimony convinced lawmakers that \"even kooks may have the capacity to make human beings\" and that it was necessary to act against cloning. Clearly, Vorilhon was used by die anti-cloning forces to emphasize the potential dangers of cloning without really giving it a fair hearing. Vorilhon agreed he was used, but held that die publicity was worth it and that his orga\u00ad nization was growing. What bodiers his critics die most is that in spite of his publicity stunts, his belief in flying saucers, his free love, is that he claims to be a scientist and that his religion is based upon it. Worst of all, the anti- cloning forces use him as an example of science at work. \u2014Vern Bullough Vern Bullough is an adjunct professor of nursing at the University of Southern California and SUNY Distinguished Professor Emeritus. Controlled Study Finds No Efficacy for St. John's Wort in Major Depression The lead News & Comment article in our May/June 2002 issue reported that a major, multicenter, controlled study of the effectiveness of St. John's Wort in treating major depression was under\u00ad going final peer review and about to be published. That study has now been published, in the Journal of the American Medical Association (287 [14]: 1807-1814, April 10, 2002). The results are not good news for advocates of the herb's value in treating depression. \"This study fails to effi\u00ad cacy of [St. John's major depression,\" the authors conclude. \"The result may be due to low assay sensitiv\u00ad ity of the trial, but the complete absence of trends suggestive of efficacy for H. perforatum is noteworthy.\" The double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in twelve academic and community psychi\u00ad atric research clinics in die United States. It involved 340 adult outpatients with major depression. Pauents were randomly assigned to receive St. John's Won, a placebo, or sertraline (as an active com\u00ad parator) for eight weeks. After eight weeks pauents could continue with blinded treatment for anodier eighteen weeks. Of the two primary outcome mea\u00ad sures, neither sertraline nor St. John's Wort was significantly different from the placebo. At the American Association for the Advancement of Science meeting in February in Boston, the study's principal investigator, Jonathan R.T. Davidson, M.D., of the Duke University Medical Center, described the study protocol as \"a kind of model for studies of depres\u00ad sion.\" He said it overcame limitations and uncertainties of earlier studies. The study results were reported in JAMA by Davidson and twenty-five col\u00ad leagues at the twelve research clinics, comprising the Hypericum Depression Trial Study Group. \"We have found no evidence for a superior effect of hypericum relative to placebo,\" say the authors. \"Hypericum should not be substituted for standard clinical care of proven efficacy, including antidepressant medications and specific psychotherapies, for the treatment of major depression of modern severity.\" The research was funded by the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine and the National Institute for Mental Health. \u2014Kendrick Frazier Kendrick Frazier is Editor of the SKEPTICAL INQUIRER. Eloquence on Western Medicine, Alternative Medicine A colleague of mine at Old Dominion University (Martha Walker, associate pro\u00ad fessor of physical therapy) has written one of the most eloquent Utters about alternative medicine that I have seen. This was written to the ODU Courier as a rebuttal to a Ut\u00ad ter in favor of Deepak Chopra's recent appearance at Old Dominion University, sponsored by the Continuing Healthcare Education Center of the College of Health Sciences. Professor Walker has given me her permission to submit her letter to CSICOP for possible publication. \u2014Larry Weinstein, Associate Professor of Physics, Old Dominion University, Norfolk, VA 23529 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER July/August 2002 7 NEWS AND COMMENT A shortened text of Walker's letter follows: Letter contained 'mistaken idea about both science and Western medicine' In her letter to the editor on March 22, Amanda Damron states that the \"scientific attitude relies on the Western medical model of always 'prescribing' a scientific cure (either pills or surgery) for the symptoms.\" This is a mistaken idea about both science and Western medicine. I and many other faculty mem\u00ad bers in the College of Health Sciences have worked with patients as an integral part of Western medi\u00ad cine for more than twenty years. What we do cannot be summarized as \"pills or surgery.\" I wonder how Ms. Damron can work alongside us and then dismiss us so readily. Does she really think that we do not offer 8 July/August 2002 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER hope or compassion or improve\u00ad ment in quality of life? Does she think we are cold, mean people because we practice Western-based medicine? Where does that stereo\u00ad type come from? Western medicine has been trying for years to get the average American to eat right, exercise regularly, floss, get enough sleep, stop smoking, and deal with stress. Can anyone have missed the massive public health cam\u00ad paigns in this regard? As for science, it is not the opposite of caring. It is sim\u00ad ply a methodical way of looking at the world without regard to the subject that is being looked at. Western med\u00ad icine has aspirations of being scientif\u00ad ically based, but no one would say that we have arrived yet. Health care is a work in progress. You will find that when Western medicine has, using the scientific method, found a good solution for an illness, the alternative therapies addressing that illness disappear. For example, if you were exposed to anthrax would you scoff at mere \"pills\" for treatment? I think you would welcome the Cipro. For arthritis, however, we don't have such a great solution. Physicians usually recommend a combination of pills, exercise, weight loss, and, finally, surgery. In this area, there are loads of alternative therapies. These alternative therapies will con\u00ad tinue to thrive until scientific method finds a really good solution to arthritis. And what if one of the alternative therapies is a good solu\u00ad tion to arthritis? Scientific method can be used to investigate it and show its effectiveness! \u2014Martha Walker, Associate Professor of Physical Therapy Stephen Jay Gould 1941-2002 Skeptical inquirers deeply regret the passing of Stephen Jay Gould. He played a unique role in the public square, for he was an eloquent exponent of the scientific outlook. His prolific writings and brilliant lec\u00ad tures at Harvard and universities far and wide on evo\u00ad lutionary paleontology and biology and his forthright criticisms of creationism cast him as a powerful defender of science. At a time when pseudoscientific and fringe claims continue to grow, there are all too few scientists willing to enter into the fray. Gould's death leaves a void and it dramatizes anew how important it is to have popularizers of science. This role was played by Carl Sagan and Isaac Asimov, CSICOP Fellows of the past. We need to encourage new and daring defenders of science, gadflies in the name of critical inquiry; interpreters able to extend the public's understanding of science and its methods. All too few scientists and scholars today are willing to venture beyond their specialties in order to communi\u00ad cate with a wider audience. Gould offered his own often controversial theories on how evolution occurred\u2014such as his punctuated equilibrium hypothesis\u2014and he suffered criticisms as a result. A veteran polemicist, he stood his ground in many debates with scientific colleagues. Throughout, he demonstrated that science grows by constant ques\u00ad tioning and peer review. Stephen Jay Gould was a Fellow of the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal and a recipient of its highest \"In Praise of Reason\" award. He was a frequent speaker at our con\u00ad ferences. He will be sorely missed. Paul Kurtz Chairman, CSICOP NEWS AND COMMENT Kansas Scientist Who Fought Creationists Honored by American Physical Society Adrian Melon, die University of Kansas professor of physics and astronomy who led the successful fight against creationist- led anti-evolution education standards in Kansas, has been honored by the American Physical Society. Melon, a founding board member of Kansas Citizens for Science, received the American Physical Society's Joseph A. Burton Forum Award during the spring APS meeting April 20-23, 2002, in Albu\u00ad querque, New Mexico. The award hon\u00ad ored his effons leading to reinstating qual\u00ad ity science education standards in Kansas. His Burrn Forum Award citation reads: \"For his outstanding efforts in helping to restore evolution and cosmology to their proper place in the K-12 scientific curriculum. As both a distinguished cos- mologist and a respected member of the clergy, he played a key role in helping the people of Kansas reverse their State Board of Education's anti-science action.\" Melott, a Fellow of the American Physical Society and a prominent cos- mologist, gave two talks at the APS meet\u00ad ing. He also gave a special public talk titled \"Intelligent Design is Creationism in a Cheap Tuxedo\" April 22 in Albuquerque. That talk was sponsored by three New Mexico science organizations: the Coalition for Excellence in Science and Math Education, New Mexicans for Science and Reason, and the New Mexico Academy of Science. Conspiracy Book About Sept. 11 Attacks a Best Seller in France The president of the French leftist orga\u00ad nization Reseau Voltaire, Thierry Meys- san, is rising to the auteur one of France's best-selling books: L'Effroyable Imposture (The Frightening Deception). Meyssan claims that the destruction at the Pentagon on September 11, 2001, was not caused by the impact of hijacked American Airlines Flight 77, but rather a truck bomb. He alleges that the U.S. govern\u00ad ment covered up this fact from the world as part of a larger scheme by the U.S military-industrial complex to covertly orchestrate the September eleventh massacres in order to justify the campaign in Afghanistan and elsewhere in the Middle East. Although sales have been brisk, it is uncertain how many French readers actually buy into Meyssan's claims. He jump-started the book's popularity in an appearance on the French TV info\u00ad tainment talk show Tout le Monde en Parle (Everybody's Talking About /f). However, the more respectable French media have been unforgiving in their criticism. According to the weekly journal Le Nouvel Observateur, \"The theory suits everyone\u2014 there are no Islamic extremists and everyone is happy. It eliminates real\u00ad ity.\" Liberation renamed the book \"A Frightening Confidence Trick\" and called it \"a tissue of wild and irresponsible allega\u00ad tions, entirely without foundation.\" An English-language synopsis of Meyssan's arguments is available on a Web page titled \"Pentagon: Hunt the Boeing and Test Your Perceptions!\" at www.asile.org/citoyens/numero 1 3/ pentagone/erreurs_en.htm. The Web page suggests that an early, misinformed report by the Associated Press was the true explanation and that subsequent corrections are actually part of a coverup: \"As everyone knows, on 11 September, less than an hour after the attack on the World Trade Centre [sic], an airplane collided with the Pentagon. The Associated Press first reported that a booby-trapped truck had caused the explosion. The Pentagon quickly denied this. The official U.S. government ver\u00ad sion of events still holds.\" Meyssan assumes that the impact of a Boeing 757, weighing 100 tons and laden with fuel, would have caused far more damage to the Pentagon. The \"hole\" from die impact seems too small to him, and the most dramatic devastation didn't pen\u00ad etrate far enough into the \"rings\" of the building for his satisfaction. Where Meyssan has acquired the expertise to determine how much damage an aircraft can do to large buildings is an open ques\u00ad tion. Given the enormous deadi toll, die collapse of die roof and structure on the outermost ring and the incineration and damage to die outer three rings, a critic can only wonder what degree of damage would seem plausible to Meyssan. Meyssan also muses about a lack of wreckage from the air\u00ad liner, ignoring the experts' explanation that such a high-speed impact and the subsequent explosion and inferno amply explain how the Boeing jet was pulverized and incinerated. Meyssan shows no inclination ro offer an alternative that explains key questions, such as what happened to Flight 77 and high-profile pas\u00ad sengers like Barbara Olson, TV commentator and wife of Solicitor General Ted Olson, if they didn't crash into the Pentagon. Thus die Pentagon attack is added to the rumors and conspiracy theories fol\u00ad lowing the Sept. 11 attacks. In a war in which truth and reality mix easily with rumor and deception, Meyssan's book can only fuel mistrust. Further Reading: The Urban Legends Reference Pages: www.

SKEPTICAL INQUIRER luly/August 2002 9 The Bunk 47/3 hiijK, i ml m It's the Ultimate i3\u00ab HM ***: CENTER FOR INQUIRY West and the Center for Inquiry National Media Center THE PROJECT IS LAUNCHED. No longer a dream, reality has begun for our permanent Center for Inquiry - West. After a five-year search we have purchased a building at 4773 Hollywood Boulevard, in the heart of Hollywood. This ultimate Rallying Point for skeptics will house CFI-West's regional pro\u00ad grams as well as Center for Inquiry's new national Media Center. This development has enormous importance for supporters of critical thinking everywhere, especially readers of Skeptical Inquirer. And now it's up to our readers and friends. Only you can help us fulfill this bold potential. Purchasing the building took $1.6 million, which we must pay back over three years. Renovation will require another $500,000 - creating a 99-seat auditorium, library, exhibit area, media production center, and offices. We're even looking into solar panels so we can generate our own electricity! An additional $495,000 will equip the Media Center and fund its first three years of operation. Finally we must add millions more to endowment, so the new Center will always be fiscally stable. All told, we need $5.85 million, of which less than $2 million has already been raised. It's the great\u00ad est challenge skeptics and secular humanists have faced since our community gave more than $5 mil\u00ad lion to build and endow the Center for Inquiry - International in Amherst, N.Y, from 1991-1995.

Charged with formulating recommen\u00ad dations for \"assuring that public policy maximizes the benefits to Americans of Dr. Gorski is an ob/gyn physician in prac\u00ad tice in Arlington, Texas, president of the DFW Council Against Health Fraud, and an associate editor of the Scientific Review of Alternative Medicine. E-mail: gorski@ohgdoc. com. complementary and alternative medi\u00ad cine\" [CAM], the group was over\u00ad whelmingly dominated by the most extreme CAM ideologues, including its chair, psychiatrist James S. Gordon M.D., a follower of the late Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh whose cult carried out bioterrorism attacks on U.S. citizens in Oregon in the 1980s.1 Soon after the commission's creation, Gordon made it clear just what his intentions were. The report of his com\u00ad mission, he boasted, would be \"for med\u00ad icine in the twenty-first century, as important as the Flexner report was to medicine in the twentieth-century. ... I believe this commission has an opportu\u00ad nity to look at medicine and health care from a different perspective that can lead to a new model of medicine and even a new model of human biology.\"2 This agenda was borne out as a series of speakers at the WHCCAMP's \"town hall meetings\" assailed the \"Western,\" \"allopathic,\" \"reductionistic,\" scientific and, several occasions, the Flexner Report specifi\u00ad cally. The Flexner Report was published in 1910 as Medical Education in the United States and Canada: A Report to the Carnegie Foundation for the Advance\u00ad ment of Teaching. It revolutionized med\u00ad icine in the twentieth century by 12 luly/August 2002 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER exposing the deficiencies and unscien\u00ad tific elements of medical education and spurring reforms in medical school edu\u00ad cational standards. A preliminary draft of the WHCCAMP's anticipated rec\u00ad ommendations consisted of a laundry list of demands for more money, more privilege, and more power and prestige for CAM practitioners.1 The final report of the Gordon Commission was therefore, as one former National Institutes of Health (NIH) offi\u00ad cial put it, \"preordained.\" It is a paean to die unproven wonders of CAM, which are never defined but claimed to \"focus on individualizing treatments, treating the whole person, promoting sclf-carc and self-healing, and recognizing the spir\u00ad itual nature of each individual.\"' It iden\u00ad tifies preventive medicine with CAM even diough proven preventive measures such as vaccination and fluoridation are routinely disparaged by proponents of CAM. Likewise, nutrition is swept into the mix despite die fact that a huge num\u00ad ber of mutually contradictory nutritional claims are made by CAM advocates. Most of all, the Gordon Commission report is an agenda for the wholesale medicalization of Americans' spirituality along New Age (and die Bhagwan's) lines. The Gordon Commission report makes die usual demand for increased funding for research on the implicit assumption that everything that CAM proponents are certain of can be proven if only enough money is spent on it, ignor\u00ad ing the fact diat all such work has been, to date, spectacularly unproductive. But the commission goes even further by sug\u00ad gesting mat, while such validation is pending, public and private insurance coverage of CAM should be encouraged or mandated and that licensure and other laws ought to be revised to allow unsci\u00ad entific practitioners to ply their trades unhindered and with official approval. The embarrassed Bush Administra\u00ad tion, which appeared to have been com\u00ad pletely blindsided even as to die exis\u00ad tence of the commission, botded up die report in the Department of Health and Human Services for more than three weeks. When it was finally released, it was dear that the letters of transmittal by Secretary Tommy Thompson had been rewritten to remove the effusive misrepresentations suggested by Gordon as to the nature of the commission and its work. To the President and leaders of Congress Thompson tersely stated only that: \"The Report contains administra tive and legislative recommendations. . We will review carefully the recom\u00ad mendations.\" The White House has refused to make any other comment. The real surprise was that two mem\u00ad bers of the commission. Dr. Joseph Fins and Dr. Tieraona Low Dog, wrote a dis\u00ad sent to the group's final report, though it was buried at the very end in Appendix G. It is all the more surprising in that both were selected for their sympathies with CAM. Neither had expertise, experience, or even significant interest in the protection of consumers from un\u00ad proven, ineffective, and aberrant med\u00ad ical claims and practices. And both gave many indications at the public meetings of the WHCCAMP that they were com\u00ad mitted to working within die CAM ide\u00ad ology of the group. Yet they were both unable to endorse its final report. Appendix G, despite the fact that it lends credence to some unproven meth\u00ad ods and often pulls its punches, is essen\u00ad tially a repudiation of the Gordon Commission and its work. Fins and Low Dog even consistently place CAM in quotation marks to indicate that its meaning is in doubt. Some excerpts: \"... a presumption exists that com\u00ad plementary and alternative medicine will be found to be beneficial. This advocacy tone persists in die Report ... givfing] voice to a perspective . . . that 'CAM' will lead us into a new paradigm of health care.\" \"... research dollars are finite.. . . Asking for more research money to investigate an approach, practice or product simply because it is 'CAM' is an ideological, not evidence-based approach to science.\" \".. . the provision or 'CAM' afford access to conventional care . . . becomes neither a complementary nor integrative inter\u00ad vention, but rather a less validated alternative to conventional care ... we should not be a party to creating a sep\u00ad arate but unequal care system ... we should provide basic health care to every American before expanding ben\u00ad efits to include treatments or approaches that have not been shown through rigorous research to treat or prevent disease.\" \"... we do not believe that 'CAM' providers are fungible with die pri\u00ad mary care providers enumerated in Title VII [of the Public Health Services Act]. ... they are not posi\u00ad tioned for equivalency with conven\u00ad tional primary care providers. Efforts to equate their degree of training, or the scientific basis of their practice, with that of the designated primary care specialties puts the public at risk of receiving unvalidated and cited as being the focus of many 'CAM' approaches. It is unclear what these terms actually mean . . . these approaches are found in conventional medicine, . . . [and] [t]he notion that only 'CAM' supports healthy nutrition is neither accurate nor fair.. . .

Our uncritical acceptance of 'CAM' wellness and health promotion can be interpreted as an endorsement of these claims.. . . Furthermore, the suggestion that conventional medi\u00ad cine is primarily focused on disease, while 'CAM' is primarily focused on health promotion and prevention . .. fails to adequately acknowledge pub\u00ad lic health initiatives that have been an integral part of medicine for decades, efforts that have dramatically im\u00ad proved the health of the Nation.\" \"... most troubling ... is the inclu\u00ad sion of spirituality under the rubric of 'CAM.' . . . The truth is that spiritu\u00ad arbitrary designa\u00ad tion of conventional and non-con\u00ad ventional medicine and cannot be claimed by any particular group. Furthermore, the conflation of spiri\u00ad tuality and/or religion with 'CAM' could lead to an abridgement of the free exercise of religion by subjugating its practice to a regulated modality.\" \"[The majority position of the com\u00ad mission is that) 'The public has expressed interest in maintaining easy access to CAM practitioners.'... [but] the data does not support [this claim) ... the literature indicates that the use of dietary supplements has decreased and that the majority of Americans support increased regulation of sup\u00ad plements, including requiring the Food and Drug Administration to review the safety of new dietary sup\u00ad plements prior to their sale.\" \"Where medical care is concerned, the common good calls for ideology and advocacy to yield to scientifically sound evidence of safety and efficacy. We are confident that this can be accomplished with respect and com\u00ad passion for all Americans.\" Since die release of die commission report, its chair has been aggressively woo\u00ad ing die media and pointedly ignoring or, when necessary, downplaying die rebuke of Appendix G. After an article in die Washington Post called attention to his associations widi the Bhagwan, Gordon protested diat he had never personally par\u00ad ticipated in die Salmonella attacks carried out by the cultists in Oregon to keep locals away from the polls. He neglected to say diat, while it was happening, he was help\u00ad ing to bus homeless people to Oregon to vote for die cult's local political candidates. But some media reports managed to cut dirough the smokescreen. Adam Rogers, writing for Newsweek, quoted Yank D. Coble, M.D., American Medi\u00ad cal Association President-Elect as saying: \"We all have a desire for simple and inexpensive solutions. But anything that sounds too good to be true often is.\" Rogers himself noted the Gordon Commission's demand for more money for CAM research may be disingenuous, writing \"What the CAMsters want may be impossible,\" concluding that: The awkward fact is that after ten years of research the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine at NIH hasn't validated a single practice. Yet a few legislators, led by Iowa Sen. Tom Harkin, con\u00ad tinue to push for more studies. All sides agree that ideally there'd be medicine that works, and medicine that doesn't, with no special distinc\u00ad tion for \"alternative.\" Separating the good stuff\u2014like better ways of deal\u00ad ing with patients\u2014from the nonsense is the contentious part. Maybe aromatherapy candles would help.1 Christina Larson, writing in the April 2002 Washington Monthly, was less oblique, pointing out that both the WHCCAMP and the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine in the NIH amounts simply to \"alternative medicine endiusiasts are using the federal government to gain respect and funding\" and that the WHCCAMP \"was stacked with alt- medicine proponents.\" Larson notes that \"the most conse\u00ad quential recommendation is that federal health plans, including Medicare and Medicaid, begin to cover CAM treat\u00ad ments,\" at the same time that \"soaring costs have already forced Medicare to cut doctors' payments for routine treat\u00ad ments\u2014and, subsequently, many physi\u00ad cians have dumped their Medicare patients\u2014and the powerful seniors' lobby continues its push for prescription drug benefits.\" She tells readers: \"If your rates go up in the near future because your employer picks up a new insurance rider to covet chiropractic treatment for asthma or arthritis, you may have this White House commission to thank.\"6 In a companion article, Chris Mooney considers die problem and concludes: CAM's proponents must do more than simply assert its medical value. They must finally cop to the rules of scientific rigor\u2014no exceptions, no special pleading, no postmodern philosophy, and no hiding in the skirts of more legitimate treatments. Simply calling for \"more research\" won't do, since it's just another way of dodging the facts. . . . That means halting the CAM gravy train in which academic institutions are effectively lulled into submission by millions of dollars in foundation grants. The deans and presidents of respected schools like Harvard should step in and call out professors and directors who'd like to trade on their academic affiliation without living up to what that entails. ... [and when something is not shown to be safe and effective] it should be rejected.

LONDON If President Bush were to appoint Enron executives to a White House commission on executives selling shares of their own company's stock, it would be a scandal. Americans would be appalled at such a blatant conflict of interest. They would suspect that com\u00ad missioners would offer self-serving rec\u00ad ommendations. It's time for Americans to be appalled by die self-serving legislative and admin\u00ad istrative recommendations offered in March by a commission established by President Clinton in the closing days of his administration. The members of Clinton's White House Commission on Complementary and Alternative Medi\u00ad cine Policy (WHCCAMP) included magnates and ideological leaders from the never-never land of healthcare, euphemistically described as \"comple\u00ad mentary\" and \"alternative.\" It's a land where practitioners resist pressures from regulators and consumer advocates to refrain from making pro\u00ad motional claims for their methods in the absence of truly supportive scientific evidence.

SKEPTICAL INQUIRER July/August 2002 15 finger in sets of twelve to twenty-four strokes (eye-movement desensitization and reprocessing) Within the world of so-called com\u00ad plementary and alternative medicine (CAM) these methods are mainstream. Among their promoters are many of the WHCCAMP commissioners. The commission never defined com\u00ad plementary and alternative medicine. It failed to acknowledge diat CAM is mar\u00ad keting doublespeak used to conceal from consumers the shortcomings of irrational and scientifically invalidated methods. Instead the commission refers to CAM as if it is a genuine field of medicine needing special regulation, oversight, and, most ominously, integra\u00ad tion into our healthcare and medical education system.

Fins, M.D., director of medical ethics at the Cornell campus of New York Presbyterian Hospital, and Tieraona Low Dog, M.D., who develops continuing medical educa\u00ad tion programs on botanical medicine. \"While dogmatic disbelief of everything that is not currently explainable is fool\u00ad ish, and indeed unscientific,\" they wrote, \"it seems equally foolish to ask the tax\u00ad payer to bear the enormous expense of sorting out those areas that are plausible from those that are improbable.\" A painstakingly prepared, point-by- point critique of WHCCAMPs report appears on the Quackwatch Web site. Quackwatch notes that the report \"falsely assumes that many safe and effective 'CAM' practices and products exist and need special federal promotion to gain recognition.\" Last year, in testimony at WHC\u00ad CAMP hearings, I emphasized the importance of identifying health fraud masquerading as CAM and recommend\u00ad ing policies to oust bogus treatments from healthcare. Instead, the commis\u00ad sion recommended inadequate safe\u00ad guards for consumers and developed a blueprint for a costly bureaucracy to sup\u00ad port the CAM industry's efforts to boost business as they bamboozle consumers. President Clinton should never have established WHCCAMP. President Bush should reject its recommendations and, instead, seek rational alternatives to promote health, prevent disease, and improve healthcare.

INVESTIGATIVE FILES JOE NICKELL Moscow Mysteries Still the largest country in the world, Russia retains over 76 per\u00ad cent of the area of the former USSR, which collapsed in 1991. The collapse, along with the suspension of activities of the Communist Party, in\u00ad creased glasnost (\"openness\") in the new federal republic. With personal free\u00ad doms, however, has come a rise in pseudoscientific and magical expression. 1 became increasingly aware of this through the visits of Russian nota\u00ad bles to the Center for Inquiry- International: Valeril Kuvakin (profes\u00ad sor of philosophy at Moscow State University), Edward Kruglyakov (a distinguished physicist at Novosibirsk, Siberia), and Yurii Chornyi (Scientific Secretary, Institute for Scientific Infor\u00ad mation, Russian Academy of Sciences). Subsequently I was one of several CSICOP speakers at an international congress, \"Science, Antiscience, and the Paranormal,\" held in Moscow (October 3-5, 2001) and co- sponsored by the Russian Academy of Sciences. [Several articles from that conference appear in this issue.\u2014 Editor.] There I learned more about the newfound glasnost toward all things mysterious. I stayed on for sev\u00ad eral more days in order to investigate some of these. Joe Nickell is CSICOP's Senior Research Fellow and author of numerous investiga\u00ad tive books.

Nevertheless, boosted by claims that pyramid power was unleashed \"behind the iron curtain,\" the pyramid craze flourished in the United States. One company marketed a kit with eight Boosted by claims that pyramid power was unleashed \"behind the iron curtain,\" the pyramid craze flourished in the United States. tence\"\u2014die authors touted claims that small cardboard models of the Cheops pyramid could preserve food (especially \"mummify meat\"), relieve headaches, sharpen razor blades, and possibly per\u00ad form other wonders (Ostrander and Schroeder 1970, 366-376). The specific claims came from a Czechoslovakian radio engineer, Karel Drbal, who obtained Czech patent 91304 for the Cheops Pyramid Razor- Blade Sharpener. It supposedly gener\u00ad ated some unknown and mysterious \"energy.\" Unfortunately, subsequent tests of the claims failed to substantiate them. Pyramids preserved organic mat\u00ad ter no better than did containers of wooden sticks that, glued in place, formed a pyramidal frame. Even with\u00ad out being covered (with paper or foil, for example), this could allegedly retard food spoilage, remove the bitterness from coffee, impart a mellower taste to wine, sharpen razor blades, perk up houseplants, and perform other won\u00ad ders\u2014according to the kit's guide book which claims, \"The Pyramid is a geo\u00ad metric focusing lens of cosmic energy\" (Kerrell and Goggin 1974). A similar wire-frame \"magic pyra\u00ad mid\" was made to be worn on the head (and so looked rather like a dunce cap) in order to concentrate the wearer's alleged psychic or healing powers SKEPTICAL INQUIRER July/August 2002 17 (Randi 1982). Larger frames were avail\u00ad able for one to sit inside in the lotus position as a means of improving medi\u00ad tation, or to place over the bed to gain enhanced vitality (Kerrell and Goggin 1974, 6-7). There were even pyramid- shaped doghouses that supposedly rid their occupants of fleas (Hines 1988). The pyramid craze lasted dirough die 1970s (Randi 1995, 194) then declined, aluSough it has never entirely gone away. New Age merchants still offer small gem- stone pyramids diat focus the \"energy\" of die particular stone (e.g., tigereye for enhancement of \"psychic abil\u00ad ities\") as well as a plastic \"Wishing Pyramid\" (into which is placed a paper with one's wish written dicreon), and odier items. In Russia, pyramid power is on the rise\u2014almost literally: I was able to visit a pyramid that towered forty-four meters (about 144.4 feet or some twelve stories). Built in 1999 by Alexander Golod, it is the tallest of about twenty such pyramids intended for alleged scientific and medical purposes. I was taken to the site\u2014about 38 kilometers northwest of Moscow\u2014 by Valerif Kuvakin (who also translated various interviews), together widi his wife, Uliya Senchihina (see figure 1). (Valerii heads the Center for Inquiry-Moscow.) Although resembling a stone struc\u00ad ture from the outside, from the interior die pyramid is seen to be constructed of translucent plexiglas panels over a wood framework. It was closed when we arrived but a custodian consented to let us in and show us around. The pyramid was largely empty, although off to one side were cases of bottled water that were supposedly being energized for curative purposes. A rope-cordoned central area\u2014where the pyramid power is supposedly most concentrated\u2014contained some crystal spheres diat were also being \"energized.\" Despite being warned that the energy mere was so intense that someone with a large \"biofield\" (or \"aura\")\u2014such as I supposedly have\u2014could lose conscious\u00ad ness, I ducked under die rope to dare die awesome power. I stood there for a time (while Valerif photographed me, barely containing his amusement, and while we continued our conversation with die cus\u00ad todian), but I felt no effect whatsoever. Adjacent to the pyramid, in a small outbuilding was a small gift shop. A sign advertised (in translation) \"Consumer Goods Energized by Pyramid.\" I decid\u00ad ed to forego the \"energized\" gemstones: a woman at a store where we stopped en route for directions said she had bought some of the stones, which had been Figure 1.

It is one of several that dot the Russian countryside and supposedly utilize \"pyramid power\" for various beneficial purposes. Photo by Joe Nickell. supposed to cure headaches, \"and they didn't work,\" she stated, disparaging die pyramid claims. I did buy a small \"ener\u00ad gized\" lead-crystal (glass) pyramid and a booklet tided (in transladon), Pyramids of the Third Millennium. It featured the various new pyramids, including the one we were at. According to this source, while the claims for pyramid power might seem like mysticism and shamanism to some, those with \"intuition\" will see that there is the basis of a new physics, a new biol\u00ad ogy, etc. It boasts that the new pyramids have reduced the incidence of cancer, AIDS, and other diseases in the areas surrounding them; have begun to cleanse dieir local environments; and promise to extend nearby residents' lon\u00ad gevity to over 100 years. The booklet even promises that pyramids could help reduce religious and other conflicts (although we might note that they have not seemed effective in that regard, his\u00ad torically, in Egypt). Valerif noted that the claims were published without any supporting scien\u00ad tific data. Physicist Edward Kruglyakov (2001), who had previously visited the site and in turn suggested it to me, found die claims utterly outlandish, unsubstan\u00ad tiated, and scientifically without merit. Weeping Icons Another paranormal phenomenon enjoying favor in the new glasnost is that of \"miraculous\" icons\u2014notably one that was reported weeping in a Moscow church in 1998. The Russian Orthodox Church has a tradition of vener\u00ad ating icons (from the Greek eikon, \"image\") which were painted on varnished wood panels and over time acquired a dark patina from candle smoke. Perhaps because they naturally depicted holy subjects and mi\u00ad raculous events\u2014such as Jesus's imprint of his face on Veronica's veil (a fourteenth-century icon of which I viewed in the Tretyakov Gallery)\u2014they seem\u00ad ingly began to work miracles themselves. The claim that an effigy is in way animated (from anima, crosses a theological line from some \"breath veneration (reverence toward an image) to idolatry (or image worship) in which the image is regarded as the \"tenement or vehicle of the god and fraught with divine influence\" (\"Idolatry\" 1960). Nevertheless, reports of \"weeping,\" \"bleeding,\" and otherwise animated fig\u00ad ures continue. In one modern case, in Sardinia, where a small statue wept blood, samples were analyzed and the DNA proven to be that of the statue's owner. Yet her attorney reasoned, \"Well, the Virgin Mary had to get that blood from somewhere\" (Nickell 1997). \"Salty tears\" were said to flow from another image in Pavia, Italy, in 1980. No one witnessed the initial weeping, only the flows in progress, and die owner seemed to be alone with die figure (a small plaster bas-relief) whenever it wept. Soon, suspicious persons peeking through the windows, as well as from a hidden hole in an adjacent apartment, saw die lady apply water to the bas-relief 18 luly/Augusl 2002 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER with a water pistol! (Nickell 1997) And in 1996 in Toronto pilgrims were charged $2.50 to view an icon at a Greek Orthodox church that \"wept\" oil. As it happened, the priest had once presided over another \"weeping\" icon in New York and had even been defrocked for working in a brothel in Athens! I was involved in the case twice, the second time at the request of the parent church. With a fraud-squad detective standing by, I took samples of the oily \"tears\" for the Center of Forensic Sciences. The substance proved to be a nondrying oil, as expected; its use is an effective trick, since one application remains fresh-looking indefinitely. Because no one could prove who perpetrated the deception the case fizzled, but the church's North American head pro\u00ad nounced it a hoax (Nickell 1997; Hendry 1997). One interesting feature of the exuding icons is the variety of substances involved (blood, salt water, oil, etc.) as well as the different effects (e.g., weeping tears, sweating blood, exuding oil). There are some apparent trends involved. In Ca\u00ad tholicism the images tended to yield blood or watery tears until relatively recently when\u2014seeming to tap the Greek Orthodox tradition (possibly due to a number of oil-weeping or -exuding icons at such churches that received media attention)\u2014there has been a shift to oil (e.g., see Nickell 1999). Interestingly, icons in the Russian Orthodox tradition seem, rather uniquely, to exude myrrh\u2014or rather, apparently, myrrh-scented oil. Myrrh is a fragrant gum resin used in making incense, perfume, and herbal medicine, and in ancient times it was also employed in embalming. (For instance, it is one of the spices reportedly used in Jesus's burial, interspersed with his linen wrappings [John 19:39\u201440].) Indeed, in St. Petersburg, in 1998 when an uniden\u00ad tified mummy began to exude a myrrh\u00ad like substance, it was regarded as a mira\u00ad cle that helped identify the remains as the lost relics of a sixteenth-century saint. \"According to Orthodox tradi\u00ad tion,\" explains one source, \"the appear\u00ad ance of fragrant liquids on relics is a mir\u00ad acle and means they belong to a saint\" (Laguado 1998). Although forensic experts cautioned against a rush to judg\u00ad ment, priests were satisfied that droplets of the substance between the mummi\u00ad fied toes were myrrh and therefore evi\u00ad dence of a miracle\u2014seeming to ignore the possibility that myrrh could simply have been used in the embalming. Figure 2. Previously myrrh-exuding icon of the last czar, Nicholas II, shown on a devotional card. Given this cultural backdrop, it is not surprising to find that Russian Orthodox icons\u2014when they are in a reputedly miraculous mode\u2014tend to yield myrrh as the substance of choice. In fact this is true even of icons at Russian Orthodox monasteries in the United States. In 1985 one in Blanco, Texas, was discovered \"weeping Myrrh.\" (\"Shrine\" n.d.). Similarly in 1991 an icon that now reposes in a Russian Orthodox monastery in Resaca, Georgia, commenced to \"exude myrrh\" (\"All-Holy\" n.d.). In 1998 in Moscow, an icon portray\u00ad ing the last czar, Nicholas II, reportedly produced myrrh almost daily after a pa\u00ad rishioner brought it to the church on November 7, the date of the Russian rev\u00adolution in 1917. Nicholas\u2014along with the czarina, their children, servants, and a personal physician\u2014was assassinated on the night of June 16, 1918. (Eventually their remains were discovered, identified through DNA, and given a funeral in 1998.) (\"Church\" 1999) When I learned I was going to Moscow, I resolved to try to track down the lachrymose icon of Czar Nicholas. Subsequently, Valerii Kuvakin and I made our way by bus and Moscow's excellent subway system to one of the oldest districts in the city where we soon found the onion-domed church (called the Church of Nikola in Pyzhakh). There, as we looked around the interior, we observed the usual proliferation of icons, displayed on the iconostasis (a high screen that separates the sanctuary from the nave) and elsewhere. At least one depicted a weeping female saint, and I wondered if such depictions might have given rise to the idea of \"actual\" weeping icons. Upon inquiring about taking photographs we learned that they were prohibited, although\u2014a few rubles later\u2014we had permission to take a sin\u00ad gle picture. We also obtained a devo\u00ad tional card featuring the icon of the czar (figure 2). We were surprised to learn that, according to the text on the reverse of the card, the miraculous icon was only a color photocopy. The original was painted by an American artist commissioned to glo\u00ad rify \"the suffering czar.\" In 1987 a monk brought it to Russia where photocopies were made, one of which was received in Moscow in 1998. After prayers were made on the czar's behalf, the picture became fragrant on September 6 and began weeping on November 7. Actually the word used translates \"myrrhing\"\u2014 that is, \"yielding myrrh.\" The picture Icons in the Russian Orthodox tradition seem, rather uniquely, to exude myrrh\u2014or rather, apparently, myrrh-scented oil. SKEPTICAL INQUIRER July/August 2002 19 went on tour in Russia, Belorussia, and Serbia, and more than a dozen \"healing miracles\" were attributed to \"the myrrhing image of our last czar.\" Unfortunately when we visited the church it was no longer weeping, but people were coming into the sanctuary every few minutes to view the icon, typi\u00ad cally kissing the glass that covered it, praying, and even prostrating themselves before it. When I was able to get a look at it myself I could see that, indeed, it was merely a facsimile. I sought to learn more about the circumstances of the previous \"myrrhing,\" but Valeriis ques\u00ad tions to the church staff were met with apparent suspicion. We therefore learned little apart from press reports and the text of the devotional card. The staffs reaction made me suspicious in turn, since I have more than once found a wary attitude masking pious fraud. Further suspicions come from the fact diat, as we have seen, other \"weeping\" icons are proven or suspected fakes, that Russian Orthodox icons exhibit a culturally dis\u00ad tinct form of the \"miracle\" (\"myrrhing\"), and that die phenomenon occurred at a time when there was a campaign to be\u00ad stow sainthood on Czar Nicholas II and his family. The patriarch of the church, Alexy II, opposed the canonization, stating that the imperial family were undeserving because of their poor leader\u00ad ship of both church and state (\"Church\" 1999). The \"miracle\" seems an attempt to counter that view by faking a sem\u00ad blance of divine approval. The Pagan Stone Another carryover from the past that is finding new expression is devotion to a certain ancient magical stone which was a focus of pagan ceremonies (\"Kolomenskoye\" n.d.). I was able to visit the site with a young woman, Nadya Tereshina (a reception supervisor at my hotel), who translated for me. The stone is in Kolomenskoye, a state museum-reserve in south Moscow. Located on the west bank of the Moskva River, Kolomenskoye was once a royal summer retreat of Czar Ivan the Terrible (1530-1584). A guidebook calls it \"one of the most evocative sites in Moscow\" (Richardson 1998, 239), for its variety of interests. It contains an eleventh- century Slavic archaeological site and, among many other treasures, the rustic log cottage of Czar Peter the Great (1672-1725). Muscovites flock to Kolomenskoye for festivals, summer sunbathing, and other activities. Figure 3. New Age religious ceremony at a boulder once used for rituals by pagan tribes. Actually the stone is one of two huge sandstone boulders left by continental glaciation and found a short distance apart in a spring-studded ravine of Kolomenskoye. Reponedly once serving \"for pagan tribes' dubbed the \"Goose\" and \"Girlish Stone\" (\"Kolomenskoye\" n.d.), the latter reposing on a hillside. As luck would have it, when we arrived on a Sunday after\u00ad noon following a sketchy map provided by one of Nadya's co-workers, Kirill Boliakiu, there was a ceremony in progress at that stone (figure 3). The ceremony was not pagan\u2014there were references to the \"Christian fam\u00ad ily\"\u2014but it seemed to me, well, paganesque. The leader of the group, wearing a belted robe and sporting long hair and a beard, had a decidedly New Age appearance. He cleaned the stone and, to \"warm\" it, partially covered it with an animal pelt that had been draped over his shoulder. Crusts of bread were scattered on the stone so that, when birds carried the offering away, one's wishes would supposedly be granted. The supplicants raised their hands skyward, in the ancient attitude of prayer, as the leader gave an invoca\u00ad tion. Finally, he strummed his zither and sang a song about \"Old Russia.\" Poignant as such a ceremony may seem, there is no evidence that the stone has any magical power or functions as anything other than a focus for people's hopes. Petitions, including those for cures of illness, will seemingly be granted or not according to the whim of circumstance and possibly the beseecher's own subsequent actions. The wishes that are ful\u00ad filled are accepted as proof of the stone's power, while those that are not are forgotten or explained away. Suppressed during the com\u00ad munist era, religion is again flourishing in Russia as part of the new climate of change and tolerance of individual expres\u00ad sion. Cults and offbeat groups like the one worshipping at the ancient stone\u2014with its admix\u00ad ture of pagan, vaguely Ortho\u00ad dox, and New Age elements\u2014 are one manifestation of the trend. Ghostly Portents According to some sources Russia is a haunted place, and ghostly phenomena seem similar to those reported elsewhere. For example, a photograph of a \"Moscow ghost\" illustrates the section on Russia in The International Directory of Haunted Places (Hauck 2000). However the anomalous white shape at the bottom of the nighttime tourist photo seems consistent with other pho\u00ad tographs in which foreign objects in front of the lens have bounced back the flash to create various ghostly effects: strands of \"ectoplasm\" (caused by a wan\u00ad dering wrist strap), \"orbs\" (due to water droplets, dust particles, etc.), or, in the case of the \"Moscow ghost,\" apparently a careless fingertip! Then there are the apparitions.

Bunk, you say? Well, that's not what the people in East Delhi, India, thought last year. In May, just such a creature was repeatedly spotted, instill\u00ad ing terror and claiming two lives. The craze got to a point where vigilante groups armed with sticks patrolled the streets at night on the lookout for the creature and police announced a 50.000 rupee ($1,067) reward for information leading to its capture.1 Hey, Hey, We're The Monkees Reports of the \"Monkey Man,\" as the press promptly baptized it, first reached the local police office on May 13. 2001. According to one report\"' the masked man had appeared in the village of Ghaziabad around 8:30 P.M. and had remained there till 4:00 A.M., terrorizing the residents. Vineet Sharma, grandson of the first victim, said that that night, when he and his brother were sleeping with their grandmorJier, a masked man had entered the veranda and attacked the old lady and pushed her.

Then the assailant went into the neigh\u00ad bor's house and injured a child, finally disappearing in the dark lane before vil\u00ad lagers could be aroused. After that first blitz, dozens of indi\u00ad viduals in a number of areas in East Delhi claimed to have been hurt in subsequent attacks and pictures of scratched victims Tfl 1 'H? L- *r\u00bb i ..i. i^^ ! 1 T^^M^J i/i\u00bb The Spring-Heeled Jack as depicted by one of Victorian London's so called 'penny dreadful' news\u00ad papers. started to appear in daily newspapers. Descriptions of the Monkey Man soon appeared to be contradictory: some described the entity as a masked man, others as a monkey, and a few others as a cat with glowing eyes. Some said it wore a skin-tight costume, while others stated it was a bandaged figure with a helmet. At least one witness claimed that it looked \"like a remote-controlled robot like object, which jumped high in the air in a jiffy and vanished within seconds.\"' What's certain, however, is the fact that two people (some sources say three) died because of this creature\u2014or at least, because of the panic created. Early May 15, at 2:30 A.M., a pregnant woman in East Delhi fell down some stairs after being awakened by the shouts of neighbors saying rJiat the Monkey Man had arrived. She died in a hospital, as did another unfortunate soul, who died in similar circumstances. What is happening here? Is there really some freak monster out in the woods of New Delhi? Or is this some kind of evil superhero, waiting for the local Spider-man to capture him and return him to justice? During the past century there have been tales of strange creatures or men with properties similar to this Monkey Man, such as the glowing eyes and the ability to suddenly disappear in front of witnesses. In the 1960s, in America, there was a spate of such sightings: die creature was dubbed Mothman or Owlman in different areas.* The past few years have seen a num\u00ad ber of sightings of a creature dubbed El Chupacabra. However, to find another episode that has had a similar impact on the public we need to go back at least 150 years, 22 July/August 2002 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER when Victorian London fell for some time in the clutches of terror of what was then known as \"Spring-Heeled Jack.\" Jumping Jack Flash According to legend, the first reports of a strange leaping figure sighted in London date back to 1837; some descriptions tell of a strange monster, half-man half-bat, complete with wings and horns. Others refer to a powerfully built man in a shiny suit with a helmet and cloak, spitting fire. Whatever its features, it seems that it was a series of sudden and unexpected aggressions that led an anonymous citi\u00ad zen to write a letter giving details of an attack by a mysterious \"Spring-Heeled Jack,\" to Sir John Cowan, the Lord Mayor. Cowan drew public attention to the letter and his acceptance of the rumors led to a flood of letters from individuals reporting their own previous encounters with the terrible Jack. Young Jane Aslop, for one, told the press that one evening she answered a violent knocking at her front door. There was a man in the shadows by the front gate who identified himself as a police officer, and asked her to bring a light. .. he claimed to have captured the infa\u00ad mous Spring-Heeled Jack! Excited, Jane fetched a candle and hurried it out to the gate but nobody could be seen. Suddenly, two arms grabbed her neck and began to rip up her dress and body. It was only thanks to the arrival of Jane's sisters, alarmed by the struggle, that she was able to break free wearing only a few scars on her neck and arms. Into the dis\u00ad tance, Jack leapt away. Two months later, another girl, Lucy Scales, was returning home with her sis\u00ad ter. As they entered a dark, empty alley, a tall, cloaked figure leaped from the shad\u00ad ows, belched blue flames into Lucy's face, blinding her, and then disappeared again. In the ensuing years sightings of Spring-Heeled Jack multiplied and through the 1850s and 1860s he was spotted all over England. Sometimes he enjoyed slapping sentries with his icy hands and jumping atop their guard boxes, while other times he was reported as leaping into some apartment from an open window, trashing the furniture around and then leaving by jumping out of the window again. The few times when he was cornered he was able to escape thanks to one of his fabulous leaps. He soon became a sort of folklore Figure, the subject of so called \"penny dreadfuls,\" melodramas and at from the Indian police said: \"It was due to unsubstantiated media reports that people were encouraged to come out with bizarre accounts of the creature though no one had actually seen it.\"'' Furthermore, in both cases a host of imitators jumped on the bandwagon: The conclusion of Indian police is similar to one reached by those who have carefully studied the case of Spring-Heeled Jack: \"The mysterious 'Monkey Man' that instilled terror and claimed three lives in the Indian capital was simply the product of the city's collective imagination.\" least one later film. The Curse of the Wraydons (1946). Even mothers teaching their children to behave cried the name of that fearful bogeyman: \"Be good or Spring-Heeled Jack will get you!\"'' Just an Illusion The careful reader will certainly have noticed by now die many similarities between the case of Spring-Heeled Jack and its modern equivalent, Monkey Man. In both cases a mysterious charac\u00ad ter, half-man and half-something else, on whom descriptions rarely agree, attacks defenseless people unprovoked and then disappears in an impossible way. No traces of his passage can ever be found but there are many who claim to have seen it, or at least to have felt its presence. It is in fact only on the basis of a feeling that the attacker was pursuing them that two people jumped off a roof. Investigation by the police, finally, brings forth similar results in both cases: some scratches and bruises on the victims of the elusive creatures turn out to be caused by animal bites or accidents, while most of the wounds could have been self- inflicted by impressionable people. Statements from the victims change overnight and arc vague and often con\u00ad tradictory. Like in die old days, when sensationalistic newspapers' accounts fueled sightings of Jack, the same thing happened again recently. The final report pranksters, persons of malicious intent (like in Japan, which is currently experi\u00ad encing a series of \"Pandaman\" murders with the perpetrator wearing a Panda mask),' and possibly some who simply saw an opportunity to get some attention. The conclusion of Indian police is similar to one reached by those who have carefully studied the case of Spring- Heeled Jack: \"The mysterious 'Monkey Man' that instilled terror and claimed three lives in the Indian capital was sim\u00ad ply the product of the city's collective imagination.\"\" In other words, this was another sen\u00ad sational example of what sociologists call collective delusions. \"Collective delu\u00ad sions,\" say sociologists Robert E. Bartholomew and Erich Goode, \"are typ\u00ad ified as the spontaneous, rapid spread of false or exaggerated beliefs within a pop\u00ad ulation at large, temporarily affecting a particular region, culture, or country.... Many factors contribute to the formation and spread of collective delusions and hysterical illness: the mass media; rumors; extraordinary anxiety or excite\u00ad ment; cultural beliefs and stereotypes; die social and political context; and reinforc\u00ad ing actions by authorities such as politi\u00ad cians, or institutions of social control such as die police or military.\"'1 Usually, it all starts when, in an un\u00ad comfortable environment\u2014dark and fog\u00ad gy alleys in Victorian London yesterday, SKEPTICAL INQUIRER July/August 2002 23 degraded neighborhoods with unre\u00ad paired street lights and scarce drinkable water in New Delhi today\u2014something unusual happens. In London, it is quite possible that some street assaults actu\u00ad ally took place, since there have always been similar assaults anywhere in the world, but it was only following an anonymous letter that the culprit was identified as die improbable Spring- Heeled Jack. In New Delhi, likewise, it may be that some aggressive, roaming monkey got too close to some people sleeping and scared some child. This spark is usually enough to start the mania: from that moment on, anything that seems a little bit out of the ordinary immediately becomes a Monkey Man, a leaping Jack or anything else: a black cat walks on the roof? It's Monkey Man! Two drunks get into a fight? It's Monkey Man attacking an innocent victim! In Victorian London the imaginary exploits of Spring-Heeled Jack were soon forgotten and replaced in popular culture by the real and horrible ones of another Jack, the Ripper. In New Delhi, on the contrary, the wave of panic resulted in street lights being turned on, plentiful buckets of water being distrib\u00ad uted, and better police-guarded streets.

Both sources agree mat the most appearances occurred in 1894 before Nicholas lis wedding to Alexandra, when he was to accede to die throne following the death of his father. Supposedly Ivan's phantom \"brandished his heavy baton as sinister flames danced about his face.\" The Kremlin is also allegedly haunted by the ghost of Lenin (1870-1924), the Russian revolution\u00ad ary. In 1961 his spirit supposedly con\u00ad tacted a medium to tell her he despised sharing his mausoleum with dictator Joseph Stalin (1879-1953) \"who caused the Party so much harm.\" The medium, a communist heroine devoted to Lenin and imprisoned by Stalin, revealed Lenin's alleged wishes in an address to the party congress, and the next night Stalin's body was removed and reinterred elsewhere. Also, during the power strug\u00ad gle of 1993, Lenin's ghost was reported\u00ad ly seen pacing anxiously in his former office and other government sites (Hauck 2000; \"Ghosts\" 1997). What are we to make of such tales? First of all, the apparitions seem typical of those reported elsewhere and may have the same explanations as them; i.e., they may be due to a welling up of the subconscious during daydreams or other altered states of consciousness and may be triggered in part by the power of suggestion, especially among certain highly imaginative people (Nickell 2000). Moreover, the reported encounters show an obvious tendency for Russian ghosts to serve as omens. In different places and times people perceive ghosts in terms of their own cultural attitude. According to R. C. Finucane, in his Ap\u00ad pearances of the Dead: A Cultural History of Ghosts (1984): \"Each epoch has per\u00ad ceived its specters according to specific sets of expectations; as these change so too do the specters. From this point of view it is clear that the suffering souls of purgatory in the days of Aquinas, the shade of a murdered mistress in Charles lis era, and the silent grey ladies of Victoria's reign represent not beings of that other world, but of this.\" As purposeful as Shakespeare's ghosts (recall how the specters of Hamlet and Banquo were driven by revenge), those of Russian historical figures tend to function as portents in anxious times. While I toured the Kremlin and stood outside Lenin's tomb in Red Square yet saw no ghosts, I nevertheless could not escape feeling the impress of the often- troubled past of a great country. Such personages as Ivan the Terrible and Lenin, magnified by history and legend, loomed large\u2014at least in my own haunted thoughts. References \"The All-Holy Theorokos.\" N.d.

Russian scientists complained about the growth of uncritical public acceptance of pseudoscience in Russia and participants passed a resolution warning of the increasing anti-science, charlatanism, and irrationalism. PAUL KURTZ mm. Belief in pseudoscience and antiscience has been rising in Russia, as it has in other countries of the world. This is especially true in the mass media and popular press, but pseudoscience has also entered into Russian science, largely because skeptical points of view have not been heard. This has been of special concern to many Russian scientists, who believe that the scientific community needs to provide critical examinations of paranormal claims\u2014which main\u00ad stream scientists heretofore have largely deplored but ignored. With this vexing problem in mind, the Russian Academy of Sciences, cosponsored a special conference with the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal (CSICOP) on \"Science, Anti-Science, and the 1' '11 'Drf^ftEfTW r~m\u00bbr Three co-chairmen, October 2001, CSICOP / Academy of Sciences Conferences, Moscow, Russia. Paul Kurtz. Valerii Kuvakin, and Edward Kruglyakov. Paranormal.\" This was held on October 3-5, 2001, at the headquarters of the Academy of Sciences in Moscow. Founded in the eighteenth century, the Academy survived Stalinist repression during the Soviet period. The Russian Academy is considered Russia's elite scientific body. It includes in its highly select roster the most prestigious scientists in the country. The Russian intelligentsia is largely unfamiliar with our emphasis on skeptical inquiry, but a number of them are now sympathetic to the agenda defended by CSICOP. The conference was co-chaired by Edward Kruglyakov, a member of the Academy, who is a research physicist and deputy director at the Russian scientific city of Novosibirsk; Valerii Kuvakin, president of the Russian Humanist Society and former chairman of the department of philosophy at Paul Kurtz is the chairman of CSICOP and was a co-chairman of the Moscow conference. Moscow State University; and myself as chairman of CSICOP Well over 200 scientists and researchers came from all over Russia and neighboring republics\u2014from Ukraine to Kazakhstan\u2014to participate. Valerii Kuvakin heads die Center for Inquiry at Moscow State University, which opened four years ago. He is also editor of their journal Zdravyi Smysl (Common Sense or Critical Thinking) and editor of a series of books published in Russian. The Center, a joint project of CSICOP and the Council for Secular Humanism, is commit\u00ad ted to reason, science, and free inquiry in all areas of human interest. This conference marked my fifth trip to Russia in the last twelve years. I have par\u00ad ticipated in several conferences in Russia over the years, but this is the first one devoted exclusively to science and the paranormal. The Russian intelligentsia is largely unfamiliar with our emphasis on skeptical inquiry, but a number of them are now sympa\u00ad thetic to the agenda defended by CSICOP. During the long period of the Soviet Union, the official dogma of the Communist Party ruled the country, and alternative view\u00ad points were suppressed, though the rulers defended what tiiey called \"scientific Marxism.\" With the collapse of the Soviet 26 July/August 2002 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER Union, all sorts of paranormal and religious claims prolifer\u00ad ated, but there were few defenders of critical thinking. Both Kruglyakov and Kuvakin have visited the Center for Inquiry in Amherst, New York, Kuvakin several times as a Research Fellow. The Center for Inquiry in Moscow State University is also a strong proponent of human rights and democracy, which it considers essential for the flourishing of science. Kruglyakov was appointed chairman of the Russian Academy's new \"Commission Against Pseudoscience and the Falsifications of Scientific Studies.\" His task is to work with CSICOP and odicr skeptical groups in providing information about uncorrobo\u00ad rated claims. In his paper, \"Why Is Pseudoscience Dangerous?\" [see page 33], he was particularly concerned with unsubstanti\u00ad ated pseudoscientific theories that are being introduced into mainline physics and accepted without dissent. Kruglyakov was recently asked by President Putin for recommendations in treat\u00ad ing this problem. Kruglyakov urged increased funding for sci\u00ad entific research and education. Incidentally, news of die confer\u00ad ence prior to our arrival was apparently discussed in the Duma and engendered heated controversy. Russian scientists at the conference complained about the growth of astrology, psychic phenomena, UFOlogy, and alter\u00ad native medicine, but until now they said they did not have the proper tools or the information with which to criticize these topics. The need for scientific education in Russia was empha\u00ad sized by astronomer D.G. Sordin, who said that the funding for scientific research and education is in crisis, for it has declined precipitously. He cited the fact that Russia's most influential science magazines have lost readership. For exam\u00ad ple, Science and Life has dropped from 3.4 million during the Soviet period to 40,000 circulation today. Russia's leading physics magazine. Quantum, has fallen from 315.000 to 5,000 readers. Garry Abelev, also a member of the Academy, said that pseudoscience is growing in biology and medicine. Well- known TV personality Sergei Kapitsa, vice president of the Academy of Sciences, attributed the growth of pseudoscience to sociological causes and said that it is a symptom of the \"worldwide disintegration of society.\" Yurif Efremov, another noted astronomer, in his paper [see page 29] criticized the increasing influence of pseudoscientific philosophies, such as postmodernism and religious fundamentalism, which have subdy undermined the naturalistic outlook and the ideals of the Enlightenment. Representatives of the Russian Orthodox Church and some exponents of spirituality and the paranormal attended the public sessions of the meetings. Much has been written about an alleged religious revival in Russia. Lev Mitrokhin, a mem\u00ad ber of the Academy and social philosopher, said popular inter\u00adest, somewhat intense several years ago, has already begun to abate. Most people do not attend church, but they do not call themselves atheists or skeptics. Many Russians were concerned about the possible growth of cults in Russia, but popular inter\u00ad est here has likewise begun to decline. A number of members of CSICOP participated in this con\u00ad ference. They included Willem Betz from Brussels, who dis\u00ad cussed homeopathy and alternative medicine. Amardeo Sarma, head of the European Council of Skeptical Organizations and of CSICOP's Center for Inquiry in Rossdorf, Germany, dealt with the Shroud of Turin and the problems of creating a skeptics movement in a country. James Alcock, psychologist at York University, analyzed the question \"why people believe.\" Richard Wiseman from England criti\u00ad cized parapsychology. In attendance from the United States were Lee Nisbet, who talked about media misinformation; Joe Nickell, who discussed miracles; and Jan Eisler, who dealt with the limitations of \"therapeutic touch.\" In the last session of the conference the participants passed a resolution against antiscience, charlatanism, and irrational- ism in Russia and supported the work of the new Russian committee [see page 28]. The Russian Humanist Society also passed a resolution protesting the violation of the separation of church and state, and, in particular, the efforts by the Russian Orthodox Church to reintroduce religion into the public schools, which they thought would undermine science. Having suffered decades of religious repression at the hands of Stalinism during the Soviet period, participants, however, were cautious in their criticism of religion. The conference received extensive coverage in the media, front page in hvestia and other newspapers, as well as consid\u00ad erable comment in scientific journals, TV, and radio. Last but not least, the proceedings were held in a friendly atmosphere and concluded with many toasts of vodka at the Academy and at the Faculty of Philosophy of Moscow State University, chaired by the dean. The most important conclu\u00ad sion to emerge from the conference is that Russian scientists wish to participate in the world skeptics movement. They wish to take part in future conferences and to dialogue with their colleagues throughout the world. Russian scientists at the conference complained about the growth of astrology, psychic phenomena, UFOlogy, and alternative medicine, but until now they said they did not have the proper tools or the information with which to criticize these topics. SKEPTICAL INQUIRER July/August 2002 27 Against Antiscience, Charlatanism, and Irrationalism in Russia RESOLUTION of the International Symposium Science, Antiscience and Paranormal Beliefs Moscow, October 5, 2001 The international symposium orga\u00ad nized by the Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow State University named after M.V. Lomonosov, and the Russian Humanist Society, has been provoked by the necessity to resist the unprecedented expansion of false science, paranormal beliefs, and newer forms of irrationalism into Russian culture at the end of the twentieth and beginning of the twenty-first centuries. 1. The condition of devastation, collapse of former ideals, and absence of new ones have led Russia to the point where many people have begun to believe only in miracles. One such \"miracle\" has appeared in the form of false science, which is now the well-organized net of pro\u00ad fessional fakers. Today this organized false science has become a powerful, immoral, and criminal force. Pseu- doscience and charlatanism affect even the highest echelons of state institutions, becoming a parasite on the budget of science, which is already poor. 2. Another serious problem, which threatens reason and science both in Russia and many other civi\u00ad lized countries, is the renewal of paranormal belief;.\u2014archaic super\u00ad stitions and preconceptions of the magical conscience of ancient ages. Astrologers and psychics, occultists and shamans, magicians and sorcer\u00ad ers who propagandize mysticism, magic, divinations, and prophecies, have widely penetrated into the market of services, especially in the fields of medicine, psychology, and education. 3. We cannot keep silent about the danger of the current state-church policy in this country. Politicization and ideological revival of religions are a delayed-action bomb that threaten to split Russia into hostile parts: believers versus nonbelievers, \"the right faith versus the wrong faith.\" The situation has reached the point where the church has begun to occupy important positions in gov\u00ad ernmental bodies, the army, and the system of state education. 4. Taking into account the dan\u00ad gerous level of expansion of false sci\u00ad ence, charlatanism, and irrationalism into society, this conference: considers the organized false science and charlatanism in Russia as immoral and a socially dangerous activity, approves the goals and program of action of the Commission Against Pseudoscience and the Falsifications of Scientific Studies of the Presidium of the Russian Academy of Sciences, which is designed to promote objec\u00ad tive and independent expertise and review the results of scientific stud\u00ad ies, without which any scientific research is impossible; appeals to the leadership of the Russian Academy of Sciences to pro\u00ad vide more support to this Com\u00ad mittee; considers the derealization of education in schools and universi\u00ad ties as an action that violates Clause 14 of the Constitution of the Russian Federation proclaiming the separation of church from state and school; appeals to the mass media to be more responsible in reporting about sensational claims or paranormal phenomena, and to provide more opportunity for the experts to accompany such claims with their scientific comments; asks the Committee for Edu\u00ad cation and Science of the State Duma of the Russian Federation to organize hearings on the expansion of false science, charlatanism, and paranormal beliefs into Russian culture; approves the activity of the Russian Humanist Society and its magazine Zdravyj Smysl promoting scientific ideals, all human moral, legal, and civil norms, and resisting false science, charlatanism, and irra\u00ad tionalism. (Adopted October 5, 2001, at the clos\u00ad ing plenary session of the conference [two against]. According to the regis\u00ad tration sheets 210 people participated in this event, besides the foreign guests, radio and TV correspondents.)

Researchers fight attempts to misportray or abuse scientific results for good reason. There are dangerous enemies of science, and the situation is more serious than it may seem. YURI N. EFREMOV Outside the world of natural scientists there are many who talk about \"the crisis of science,\" and question the entire direction of science. Many knowledge\u00ad able sociologists assert that objective scientific truth does not exist at all. This is also repeated by the apologists of the fash\u00ad ionable philosophy of postmodernism and bellicose clerics. A real war with the scientific outlook thus has been declared. Indeed, there is some danger that we are approaching the sunset of the second great experiment with rationalism (after the classical world). The return of the Middle Ages could become a reality. We should constantly remind people that from the begin\u00ad ning of the twentieth century, human beings have lived in an SKEPTICAL INQUIRER July/August 2002 29 environment created by the achievements of science. We usu\u00ad ally do not notice the air that we breathe. The time between scientific discoveries and technological development usually takes decades. Electricity, air travel, television, victory over many mortal illnesses, the common comforts of life that we today enjoy are based in the end on the results of the disinter\u00ad ested curiosity of scientific researchers. Without the perfect flowers of a fundamental science tliere will be no fruits suitable for use. This is also true for technology. Modern engineering is based on the laws of mechanics, which have grown out of die observations of the heavenly bodies, and astrophysics is inseparable from the physics of elementary parti\u00ad cles. The abstract achievements of a modern-day science will help our grandchildren solve future problems. Technology and civi\u00ad lization itself will eventually die if science is allowed to perish. Outside Russia, despite severe criticisms of science, rapid developments go on not only in theoretical but also experi\u00ad mental research, demanding huge funding. The Russian six- meter telescope, which in 1980 was the largest in the world, is now outstripped by two dozen telescopes, including two ten- meter instruments, and there are development projects to con\u00ad struct thirty-meter and even one-hundred-meter telescopes. The achievements of astronomy in recent years seem to come from the pages of science fiction novels. They prove that the cri\u00ad sis of science exists only in the minds of its enemies. Some exam\u00ad ples are in order. The dream of discovering planets around the stars inspired astronomers for decades. Since 1995 they are being discovered almost monthly\u2014today we know about eighty planets. It is possible now to compare our solar system with oth\u00ad ers, to specify die theories about the formation of planets and our Earth, similarly for the geology of useful minerals, etc. Black holes, an area of space with a strong gravitational field from which light cannot escape, until recently was only a theo\u00ad retical concept. Today we know of about a dozen candidates for black holes inside our galaxy alone; and we are able to attribute the existence of supermassive black holes in the nuclei of some Yuri N. Efremov is an astronomer at the Sternberg Astronomical Institute, Moscow State University, Universitesky pr. 13, Russia. E-mail: efremov@sai.msu.ru. fifty galaxies. Movements of stars at the center of our galaxy recently were measured that prove the presence of invisible objects with masses of 2 million suns. Black holes, opening a window in other spaces and times, have become a reality! Modern cosmology removes a problem of the origin of our universe, asserting that it, as well as other universes, sponta\u00ad neously arose from a primary vacuum, and this process of gen\u00ad eration of new universes basically can some\u00ad day be reproduced in our laboratories by the collision of elementary panicles of super\u00ad high energy. Was our universe created in the laboratory of an ancient super-mighty civi\u00ad lization? Deep problems of human existence are posed by modern science. The view that science is poor in spirit is simply due to igno\u00ad rance of its frontiers. For the past half-century, due to space research and the development of radio- astronomy, the energetic range of quantums of electromagnetic radiation of heavenly bodies accessible to study has extended fifteen orders of mag\u00ad nitude. Humans have visited the Moon, and have sent rocket probes to other planets. The knowledge gained via optical tele\u00ad scopes in a tiny window of wavelengths through a terrestrial atmosphere has been completely confirmed by these achieve\u00ad ments. The development of methods of neutrino registration recently has brought confirmation (contrary to first results) of the validity of the theory of the sources of energy of the Sun (and the stars in general). Incoming observations of gravita\u00ad tional waves will allow testing many theories and certainly will bring challenging new problems. In view of this, what is the \"crisis of science\" that its critics speak of? The injustice of the statements of the critics of science is especially clear in astronomy. Observational programs enable us to verify conclusions of concrete theories, but frequently new phenomena are discovered or objects explained by other theories are also tested. We come nearer to a more complete understanding of our universe, because we are its children. Max Planck, the founder of quantum theory, on which all modern electronics is based, said that he understood that the laws of human thinking coin\u00ad cide with the laws managing sequences of impressions, which we receive from the encircling world. Consequently, thinking allows humans to penetrate inside the external world. The paramount role thus played by the external world is not some\u00ad thing dependent on man, but something absolute, he added. Similarly, Albert Einstein said that the truth of the existence of the external world is independent of the perceiving subject and this underlies all natural sciences. This conviction of researchers is shared by philosophers, the representatives of the evolutionary theory of knowledge. G. Follmer has noted diat the subjective structures of knowledge provide us widi die realistic approach to the world, as they were Was our universe created in the laboratory of an ancient super-mighty civilization? Deep problems of human existence are posed by modern science. The view that science is poor in spirit is simply due to ignorance of its frontiers. 30 July/August 2002 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER formed during evolution by human adaptation to die real world. We may add that the criterion of universal practice proves the validity of scientific knowledge. The collective practice of humankind confirms that scientific theories work. The hydro\u00ad gen bomb exploded in accordance with the theory of the nuclear sources of energy in the stars, and relativity corrections arc needed both for the rapid movement of interplanetary space probes and elementary particles in a synchrotron. The objectivity and reliability of die results of science never\u00ad theless are furiously challenged by its enemies, who unhappily are believed to be the philosophers of science. After Thomas Kuhn and Paul Feyerabend, modern \"sociologists of knowledge\" assert diat it is impossible to trust physical theories since they replace one another, it is possible to consider them to be a result of constructs by scientists. However, V. Ginzburg, the leading Russian physicist, a quarter of a century ago noted that die conclusions by Kuhn are based on misunderstanding of die major facts confirmed by the history of science: new knowledge, if it is true, always includes the old, which appears as a special case of die new dieory. According to Einstein, the best destiny of a physical theory is to specify a way of creating new, more general theories, within the framework of which the previous one remains as a limiting case. I would suggest that we consider this Niels Bohr's principle of correspondence as a condition and attribute of the genuine scientific character of a new dieory. This implies, by the way, that so called \"scientific revolutions\" do not exist. The emer\u00ad gence of relativity theory and quantum mechanics was nothing but a \"revolution\" in the psychology of scientists and philoso\u00ad phers, not in science itself. I would argue that the Copernican revolution was not a revolution either\u2014it marked the emer\u00ad gence of genuine science. One could on the contrary assert that there is a permanent revolution in science. But this is simply a way to deny the very existence of revolutions in science. By all means, science never cedes territory once conquered. The conclusions of postmodern philosophers about the alleged bias of scientific knowledge have not been demon\u00ad strated, not only because it is against science, but because phi\u00ad losophy does not provide the objective criteria for judging the validity of a scientific hypothesis or theory. Understanding the achievement of science requires special knowledge. It is why the deepest contributions to the theory of knowledge have been made by great physicists of the twentieth century, not by \"expert philosophers.\" The sociologists of knowledge have concentrated their study on the statements of scientists about their results. From these subjective statements the sociologists of science have concluded that the product of science grows out of the accord of scientists\u2014overlooking the fact that these statements by necessity are subjective. At any rate, the end result of science is the objective prod\u00ad uct of multiple verifications and the findings of generations of scientists. The final goal of science is the understanding of the world. Movement in this direction is the aim of scientists. It is the essence of a scientist, and it is only because this funda\u00ad mental research is still alive in Russia. It can contribute to the advances of world science, despite the fact that salaries of Russian scientists are barely adequate. Also, it is because of this that researchers are so hostile to any attempts to misportray or abuse scientific results. The aspiration for truth also explains why scientists strug\u00ad gle against pseudoscience. The philosophy of postmodernism serves to justify every possible para-scientific doctrine. The most ancient of them, astrology, does not require such huge financial support as the Russian \"torsion generator\" people do, but can well harm the people trusting in its predictions. There is no need to repeat that there is no material agent of influence of stars and planets on the destinies of the people\u2014and there are no statistics confirming the forecasts of astrologers. They make claims that come true with the same frequency that would be expected from chance. The astrologers advising the Ministry of Defense make Russia potentially dangerous to all the world\u2014and for its own population. . . . The question of parapsychology is more complicated, for the issue of the physical mechanism of consciousness is far from being resolved. Hypnosis, suggestion under hypnosis, (especially postponed suggestion) amaze the imagination and SKEPTICAL INQUIRER July/August 2002 31 are subject to research. However, without exception all the experiments on transfer of thoughts at a distance either are unsuccessful, or are doubtful, or are certainly proved frauds. The last is a fair statement in particular for those experiments, on which were based Karl Jung's concepts of synchronism and transpersonal consciousness. A previously solely-Russian phenomenon, the so-called \"new chronology,\" is getting to be a new international para- science. These people, led by the academician A. Fomenko, affirm that authentic history begins ostensibly only with the thirteenth century. Astronomers showed twenty years ago that ancient observations of stars and planets, including what can\u00ad not be forged with knowledge available up to the eighteenth century, confidendy confirm normal chronology. However, until 1999 most historians were passive, not wishing to besmirch their hands, and most of the mass media propagan\u00ad dized \"Fomenkism.\" The grandiose experiment to check the education level and the common sense of our population has begun. The results will be interesting. The historical and astronomical arguments of A. Fomenko are the fruits of specific selection of the initial data, or their direct juggling. Moreover, in a number of cases he has been caught in a blatant lie. Nevertheless Fomenko continues the propaganda of his fantasies, and even some even educated peo\u00ad ple believe him now, outside of Russia as well. On the horizon there is a potentially an even more danger\u00ad ous enemy of science\u2014\"scientific\" creationism. Creationists go about abolishing not thousands of years of human history, but billions years of the evolution of the universe. They affirm that it is necessary to take literally the words of the Bible about seven days of creation, the age of the universe being 6,000 years, and so on. Like Fomenko, creationists selectively snatch out the most doubtful, from a million facts, and ignore the rest. Like Fomenko, they do not stop before making obviously false assertions. To challenge the existence of objects with ages far exceeding 6,000 years, it is necessary to assert that there are scientists believing that there are no stars farther away than 6,000 light-years. . . . They do not notice that such inventions discredit religion. A clever writer notes that a biologist, having read a book by a creationist filled with errors, will attribute such ignorance to all of Christianity. The situation is more serious than it may seem. Almost liter\u00ad ally repeating die words of die Roman Pope in 1951, some repre\u00ad sentatives of Russian science nowadays declare diat science has come to a recognition of the religious view of the creation of the world. However, both cosmologists and theologians long ago showed that die expansion of die universe does not tell us about its creation, that the Creator should not be relegated to the role of a scientific hypothesis. Moreover, modern cosmologic dieory has come to the conclusion diat our universe, as well as sets of other ones, began existence spontaneously, as fluctuations of a primary vacuum. There is no basis to identify this vacuum with the Creator. At some schools lessons of religion have begun, and at universities theology is taught\u2014contrary to the Russian Constitu\u00ad tion. Some of the books, preaching creation\u00ad ism, carry a signature stamp saying die book is recommended by the Moscow patriarchy. While these Russian books still explain to children that Earth revolves around the Sun, some Western creationists even see that as a contradiction to sacred writing and attempt to expose Copernicus. However, half of the adults in the United States do not know how long it takes Earth to revolve around the Sun. It is quite possible diat the fruits of the present reforms of education in Russia will be not less impressive.... The events of September 11, 2001, show that the situation in the world quickly changes and to master it without science is impossible. The competition for raw material, especially cheap sources of energy, can reach the most severe forms, down to the military struggle of the states, if science will not teach us to manage our resources and add new ones. In Russia now, science is the least prestigious employment (the salary of a janitor is equal to the salary of a full professor), and science soon can disappear. However, pseudoscience finds powerful patrons in Russia. Poorly educated statesmen want to increase edible crops faster, regardless of whether or not the suggested project has scientific merit. For the same reason Stalin sup\u00ad ported pseudobiologist Lysenko, who promised to quickly produce plentiful crops. Pseudoscientists, ignorant officials, unwise philosophers, an ignorant mass media, and clerics all are pulling Russia back\u00ad wards. Yes, the decline of interest in science is dangerous to the future of mankind. This is seen all over the world, but Russia seems to be ahead of the entire planet, this time in its retro\u00ad grade movement toward the New Middle Ages. Whether we can stop this fall into the abyss depends on our success in struggling with antiscience\u2014and also whether popular scien\u00ad tific literature will be accessible to the population. Unfor\u00ad tunately, this is not the case in Russia today. Pseudoscientists, ignorant officials, unwise philosophers, an ignorant mass media, and clerics all are pulling Russia backwards. Yes, the decline of interest in science is dangerous to the future of mankind. This is seen all over the world, but Russia seems to be ahead of the entire planet, this time in its retrograde movement toward the New Middle Ages. 32 July/August 2002 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER Why Is Pseudoscience Dangerous? The growth and influence of pseudoscience in Russia has become serious. Many pseudoscientific devices and schemes have gained influence within governmental organizations. A special Commission of the Russian Academy of Sciences against pseudoscience has had some effect in addressing the problem. EDWARD KRUGLYAKOV The end of the twentieth century was marked by a boom of astrology, mysticism, and occultism in many countries. In the USSR (during the last years of its existence) and then in Russia the situation was even worse in a sense. The system's collapse and the wreck of old ideals\u2014 along with the absence of new ones\u2014caused many people to hope for some kind of miracle. The mass media contributed to this tendency. Through their irresponsibility, pseudo- science has filled newspapers, magazines, radio, and TV. In recent years a new phenomenon has arisen. Pseudo- science has become a powerful, well-organized force. Over the last decade in Russia, about 120 academies have appeared, many of which don't deserve the name \"academy.\" SKEPTICAL INQUIRER luly/August 2002 33 Some of them give their stamp of approval to professionally inadequate doctors of science in various fields. Others do the same in pseudoscientific disciplines, giving diplomas to astrologers, UFOIogists, and others of the sort. In Russia, even research institutes with pseudoscientific tendencies have appeared. I'll give only two examples: the International Institute of Space Anthropecology and the International Institute of Theoretical and Applied Physics. The first has even managed to attain state accreditation with the help of the Russian Ministry of Science. The second has received financial support both from the Ministry of Science and die Ministry of Defense for the well-known swindle of torsion fields. Peaceful coexistence between science and pseudoscience is impossible. From time to time, science attempts to unmask pseudoscience. The latter fights back with fierce hatred. Pseudoscientists are anxious to settle accounts with the Academy of Science, because the Academy is a great obstacle to these newly half-baked \"scientists.\" Here are a few quoted statements of such people: \"By the end of the twentieth century, on the periphery of official academic science, such a substantial arsenal of facts, conceptual guesses, and extravagant technologies was com\u00ad piled, demanding an integral and unpreconceived comprehen\u00ad sion, that it encourages many scientists to expect a new scien\u00ad tific paradigm in the beginning of the third millennium.\" \"The scientific paradigm is hopelessly obsolete. The epoch of materialistic science, which does not recognize this, is fin\u00ad ished.\" Meanwhile, according to die statements of such \"scien\u00ad tists,\" \"die influence of thought on the composition of liquid chemicals was proved.\" Furthermore, \"The worlds leading physicists and philosophers warned of an inconsistency between the modern paradigm and the fundamentals of physics.\" Thus pseudoscience predicts the full breakdown of science unless the scientific paradigm is changed. Meanwhile, according to a statement of academician Z.I. Alferov, recendy awarded die Nobel Prize, \".. . the crisis in quantum physics is not observed. For the most part in the physics kingdom, it is calm now.\" The Emergence of Antiscience Where does this passionate desire to replace a scientific paradigm stem from? Here is what one of the pseudoscientists said: \"Up to now die broadly spread dogma of experimental studies of the nineteendi century is to recognize as 'scientific' only one such Edward Kruglyakov is a head of laboratory and deputy director of the largest institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences (Budker Institute of Nuclear Physics). He is the State Prize (1986) and Artsimovich award (2001) winner. He is chairman of the Russian Academy of Science Commission on the struggle against pseudo- science. He is also author of a book whose title might best be trans\u00ad lated into English as Pseudoscientists of the Modern Era. E- mail: E.P.Kruglyakov@inp.nsk.su. technique, which provides reproducible experimental results irre\u00ad spective of whenever and wherever they could be obtained.\" What a fertile ground for antiscience if this \"dogma\" is canceled. There will be no need for explanations or repeatable evidence. Here is what one of the main theorists of the so-called sci\u00ad ence of torsion fields, \"academician\" G. Shipov said: existence of telepathy, levitation, clair\u00ad voyance, retrovision, or that energy of consciousness plays some certain role in physical processes.\" And since science does not recognize this, therefore, \"official science lags behind the new developments.\" Science has long been too indulgent to pseudoscience. This cannot continue. Pseudoscience becomes dangerous for both science and society. The bacchanalia of parascientific delirium has even begun to affect the highest echelons of power. Pseudoscience has begun to gain the favor of officials repre\u00ad senting the supreme authorities of the country. In the 1980s, for example, Chumak and Kashpirovsky forced their way onto television in spite of the fact that during those years TV was controlled by the state! This means that paranormalists have appeared on TV with the consent of the supreme officials. These officials might wish to know at least that Mr. Chumak is not original. His trick with \"charging\" water was unmasked in the beginning of the twentieth century by American physicist Robert Wood. It is worth mentioning the sad fact that Mr. Kashpirovsky pushed his ideas on members of the state Duma, and Mr. Chumak also has tried to do this. Here is another case, involving M.D. Maley, chairman of the Interdepartmental Commission on Scientific and Technical Problems of the Industry of Defense of Security Council of the Russian Federation. The purpose he pursued looked rather reasonable: \"From the viewpoint of the Security Council, our task is to filter correctly the basic directions and orient the present and future management of the country with respect to a launching position of Russia in this scientific- technical revolution.\" To prepare for scientific breakthroughs, Mr. Maley created a \"Large State Research Center.\" This is praiseworthy in itself; a high-ranking government official facilitates the development of a science. Alas, when one hears the purposes, you can't help being horrified at the ignorance of the official: \"Replacement of the concepts of quantum physics by neutron physics, vacuum as emptiness by the concept of neutrino fields is in prospect for us We have some works at the R&D [research and develop\u00ad ment) stages that contradict common sense and cannot be described by any equation.\" One can add to this many other \"pearls\" characterizing the activities of the Center, but it hardly seems worth mentioning. But I would mention that the Secretary of the Security Council of Russia, heading the Council in the first years of existence of the new Russia, O. Lobov, has managed to 34 July/August 2002 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER distinguish himself. He patronized the introduction to Russia of the scandalous doomsday cult Aum Shinrikyo. Bad Science in High Places Astrologers, claimants of extrasensory powers, and newly appeared \"scientists\" of other \"professions\" more and more actively push themselves through into the State Duma, min\u00ad istries, and even into the President's circle. Here are recent examples: In die Ministry of Emergency Measures, a laboratory of \"extrasenses\" was arranged, and though no results have been reported yet, the laboratory nevertheless exists and is finan\u00ad cially supported. At the Ministry of Defense, a military astrologer is employed. In addition, the Ministry has created a specialized military unit manned with psychics and others who claim special powers. The research is conducted secretly. Such senseless secrecy is advantageous only to dishonest officials. It raises the possibility of corruption and the absence of out\u00ad side review and control. At the Ministry of Defense, the Extreme Medicine Center was created. At first glance, this seems quite reasonable. However, listen to what they do there, as described by the head of the Center, Professor P. Shalimov: \"We test charged water, study man's aura.\" Quite frequendy in the mass media we hear com\u00ad plaints about the lack of funds for the army. At the same time, inside the Ministry of Defense large amounts of money are spent supporting various programs with a pseudoscienrific orientation. The deputy chief of the President's Security, General G. Rogozin, in addition to his main duties, was involved in astro\u00ad logical forecasts and occultism. At the end of 1998, Mr. Rogozin, on the basis of his analysis of Nostradamus prophecies, predicted the beginning of nuclear war in July and August 1999. Fortunately, today this person is out of the President's circle. One academician of the Academy of Natural Science, G. Grabovoy, carried out a psychic check of the readiness of President Boris Yeltsin's airplane. And recently, the Rossiyskaya Gazeta (a Russian newspaper) revealed to readers how Mr. Grabovoy took part in underground tests of nuclear weapons in Semipalatinsk where he supposedly investigated the influ\u00ad ence of some device, \"a crystalline module,\" on a nuclear explosion. It was asserted that switching on the device makes the force of a nuclear explosion two times lower. But if one can use several such devices simultaneously, the force of explosion could be \"nullified.\" Under present conditions, it was said the device could be used on atomic power stations to serve as a guarantee against accidents. This entire swindle is apparent to any physicist at once. Nevertheless, I had to carry out the official investigation. It revealed that Mr. Grabovoy never took pan in tests of nuclear weapons in Semipalatinsk. Therefore, he did not test \"a crys\u00ad talline module\" there. At the same time, it was revealed that this \"doctor of technical and phys-math. science\" has never defended any dieses. In lists of the Italian Academy of Science, \"academician\" Gravovoy was never mentioned. It is sad that the governmental Rossiyskaya Gazeta misled its readers; alas, not for the first time. In the ptevious State Duma, a rather strange exhibition was arranged, in which the main subject was the so-called sofa-extrasens, which was said to cure nearly a hundred dis\u00ad eases including impotence and frigidity. The same Duma has arranged debates on the problems of the UFOlogical safety of Russian people. To understand how this could hap\u00ad pen, I cite the statement of the deputy chair of the State Duma Ecological Committee, doctor of technical science (!) V. Tetelmin: Science revealed a sufficient number of examples of natural bioresonance processes affecting the human organism. For example, at the Earth, there are many well-known gcopamo- genic zones. Their basic property is that there, the procession of time is changing. So scientists detected that precise watches failed in the region where the Tunguska meteorite fell, in regions of nuclear weapons tests, near Chernobyl, and in other \"fatal\" places. ... It was noticed that places with anomalous proceeding of time are located there, where there are flows of large amounts of water along the circle. I hope that it is now clear who could organize such an exhi\u00ad bition and who could try to push through a law on the protec\u00ad tion of the \"enetgy-informatic\" safety of the population. To the credit of the present Duma, it does not do anything like that. Alternative medicine has dramatically developed. It is atttacting numerous unscrupulous swindlers, robbing sick people who cannot find help from traditional medicine. New medical devices claiming to cure patients of any illness are appearing on the market. A device called \"New Cardiomag\" recently became available at a price of only 500 rubles (about $16). It supposedly helps with hypertonia, ischemia, arterial hypertension, stenocardia, and headaches. One might question the honesty of developers of the device since one of them, doctor of medical science A.P. Naumov, has written in an advertisement for the \"Cardiomag\" the following: \"This is an ecologically pure autonomous source of gravitation field, pulse bipolar current, and direct magnetic field with special energy characteristics\" (Isvestiya, March 14, 2001). In Isvestiya of July 24, 2001 a device called \"Vita\" was described. Do not think that the device is so different from many other useless devices. The one thing that was different about \"Vita\" is that it had direct lobbying on its behalf by high-ranking officials. The Deputy Minister of Labor and Social Development, V.A. Yanvarev, requested Federal Organs of Executive Power of Federal Subjects \"to facilitate head san\u00ad itary physicians in introducing the device 'Vita.'\" And a deputy head of sanitary physicians, professor E. Belyaev, impudently recommends \"the use of the bioenergetic safety device 'Vita' as an individual protection against electro\u00ad magnetic radiation at plants and establishments, on the ground, and air transport. . . .\" Even if this device could really SKEPTICAL INQUIRER luly/August 2002 35 protect against electromagnetic radiation, it is improper for high-ranking government officials to be engaged in lobby\u00ad ing. And as Mr. Belyaev ends the letter with the words, \"With questions on purchasing the device 'Vita' please address to . ..,\" (and then the address and phone of a commercial firm follows), there is a suspicion that the official does not do all this with much objectivity. Two conclusions can be made about the device: The prod\u00ad uct \"Vita\" is not a means of protection against biological action of electromagnetic fields; and the offered technical information and advertising mislead potential customers. It is incomprehensible why the Academy of Medical Sciences keeps silent about such fraud. It is time to express its opinion about that. The ever-growing activities of pseudo- science attempt to get money from the government, con\u00ad sumers, and industry while avoiding the standard procedures of review by experts. There are many examples of pseudo- scientists managing to get money from state sources. The most well known is the swindle based on so-called torsion fields. In addition, there are some \"studies\" on anti- gravity, and on transmutation of elements with an attempt to obtain gold (not involving the known method of nuclear reac\u00ad tions but instead a modern version of alchemy). In such an atmosphere, at the end of 1998 the President of the Russian Academy of Science, academician Yu. W. Osipov, arranged a special Commission Against Pseudoscience and the Falsifications of Scientific Studies. One of the commission's very first actions was to prepare a special appeal that was considered and accepted by the Presidium of the Russian Academy of Sciences. This appeal was published in many Russian mass media outlets. Members of the commission appeared many times in news\u00ad papers and magazines and on radio and TV, addressing the government with suggestions. I think I can say that this com\u00ad mission and its work with the mass media resulted in some corrections of the situation. Some allies appeared among jour\u00ad nalists, astrological forecasts vanished from some newspapers, and some science sections appeared. In addition, scientists more frequently were asked to be guests on TV programs. However, these are only small steps. A victory over pseudo- science is still far away. To conclude, I would like to recall one more story. About twenty-five yean ago, fringe-science swindlers pushed through to the level of the government of France an idea of ever-penetrating rays for finding oil deposits. (How similar it is with our torsion fields!) This speculation was blocked by the president, Valery Giscard d'Estaing, by his words: \"Assume it is necessary to find expertise aimed at revealing the possibilities of falsification.\" Recently, several members of the 1998 commission (acade\u00ad micians E. Alexandrov, V. Ginzburg, and E. Kruglyakov) sent a letter to the president of Russia, Vladimir Putin. They drew the president's attention to the dangerous growth and influence of pseudoscience in Russia. The first of many suggestions and mea\u00ad sures was to seek the expertise of members of die Russian Academy of Sciences in applying the fundamental laws of nature to evaluate projects. We hope that the president of Russia will follow the example of the president of France and apply thor\u00ad ough scientific expertise in examining proposed ideas. If that happens, we will have a chance to witness a cleansing of science from the shameful prevalence of pseudoscience.

Part one appeared in the May/June 2002 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER, with sections on \"The Memory Wars\" and \"Our Search for the Full Story.\" Who Abused Jane Doe? The Hazards of the Single Case History Part 2 Case histories have played a long-standing role in the history of science, medicine, and mental health. But they can mislead\u2014especially when only half the story is told. Here's a case history about a case history that proves just that. ELIZABETH F. LOFTUS and MELVIN J. GUYER Many questions remain unanswered. Did Jane repress and recover an authentic memory of sex\u00ad ual abuse, or did she always remember the charges that cost her mother custody of her? Were those allegations accurate, or is there an alternative tiiat might explain why Jane reported sexual abuse as a child and later came to believe it really happened? What is the truth about Jane's allegedly \"burned\" feet? Why were John Doe's abuse accusa\u00ad tions against Dad never pursued? A memory is, of course, not proof of the event it purports to recall. We all \"remember\" things that never actually hap\u00ad pened, as ample scientific evidence has demonstrated (Loftus 1997). To take Jane's memory as evidence of an SKEPTICAL INQUIRER July/August 2002 37 About this article: Case histories make contributions to science and prac\u00ad tice, but they can also be highly misleading. We illus\u00ad trated with our re-examination of the case of Jane Doe; she was videotaped twice, once when she was six years old and then eleven years later when she was seventeen. During the first interview she reported sexual abuse by her mother. During the second interview she apparently forgot and then remembered the sexual abuse. Jane's case has been hailed by some as the new proof of recovery of repressed or dissociated traumatic memories, and even as proof of the reliability of recovered memories of repeated abuse. Numerous pieces of \"supporting evi\u00ad dence\" were given in the original article for believing that the abuse occurred. Upon closer scrutiny, however, there are reasons to doubt not only the \"supporting evi\u00ad dence,\" but also that die sexual abuse ever happened in the first place. Our analysis raises several general ques\u00ad tions abut the use of case histories in science, medicine, and mental health. There is a cautionary tale not only for those professionals who advance the case history, but also for those who base their theories on it or would readily accept it as proof. \u2014The Authors Also see \"The High Cost of Skepticism,\" Carol Tavris's essay about die Loftus/Guyer investigation into the case of Jane Doe, immediately following their article on page 41. \u2014The Editors alleged prior event is to beg the question of whedier it is a recov\u00ad ered memory. Instead, we must begin with an inquiry into what was regarded as corroboration of the claim of recollection. Thus we are led back to Corwin's original clinical evaluation. There was no smoking gun in this case\u2014no first-hand eye\u00ad witness accounts from impartial parties, no unambiguous physical evidence of sexual abuse or even of old burns. Corwin rests his corroboration of Jane's memory upon his clinical opinion that the alleged abuse occurred. The claim of corrobo\u00ad ration naturally takes us to questions about the nature of clin\u00ad ical child abuse evaluations and their validity and reliability in general, and in this case in particular. Child sexual abuse is not Elizabeth Loftus is professor of psychology and adjunct professor of law at the University of Washington.

Instead such cases typically involve an effort to postdict\u2014to say, on the basis of record review, contemporane\u00ad ous observations, and credibility judgments whether some event did or did not occur in the past\u2014an enterprise typically outside the scope of mental health expertise. Can clinicians postdict with accuracy whether child sexual abuse occurred? Based upon a substantial body of scientific research, much of it done after Jane's 1984 evaluation, we have learned many sobering things about the limitations of clinical expertise in the postdiction of child sexual abuse. 1. We know that clinical judgments of alleged sexual abuse may be unreliable (Horner, Guyer, and Kalter 1993a, b). Even experienced evaluators of child claims disagree markedly. 2. We know that clinical judgments concerning the credi\u00ad bility of children's statements are not 1997, Ceci, Loftus, Leichtman, and Bruck 1994), nor are clinical judgments concerning the credibility of adults particularly reliable (Ekman and O'Sullivan 1991). 3. We know that there are few, if any, specific behavioral indicators of child sexual abuse (Kendall-Tackett et al. 1993), and to rely upon any one or two behavioral indicators will result in many false positives. 4. We know that false allegations of child sexual abuse find fertile ground in highly contested child custody/visitation cases and that these are the most suspect cases in which allega\u00ad tions of abuse arise (Benedict and Schetky 1985). We know that children in such circumstances are often subject to so much parental influence that they sometimes lose the capacity to accurately report their own experiences. 5. We know that children, especially young ones, can be made to recall events that have not occurred, especially if they are questioned about them in suggestive and leading ways. 6. We know that interviewers and evaluators who have an expectation bias can influence the recollections and reports of their subjects to be congruent with their bias. 7. Finally, we know that multiple interviews and repeated and prolonged evaluations erode the capacity of people to obtain trustworthy data from child witnesses. Indeed, the study of the malleability of children's memory constitutes an important area of memory research, and much of it has devel\u00ad oped only in the last ten years (Ceci and Bruck 1995). What does all this mean for Jane Doe's case? The claim of recovered memory here is founded upon a type of corrobora\u00ad tion that in general terms is highly unreliable and invalid, though it was standard throughout the 1980s and 1990s. It is doubtful, for example, whether the clinical evaluation method of assessing abuse allegations would pass the \"junk science\" test set out by the United States Supreme Court in Daubert v. Merrill Dow, given the demonstrated lack of agreement among clinicians in these sorts of cases. (At the time of Corwin's 1984 evaluation of Jane, however, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry had not yet promulgated its guide\u00ad lines for assessing allegations of child sexual abuse and would not do so for several more years.) To die extent that Jane's memory can be regarded as an instance of a recovered, accurate memory, there must be some objective and independent corroboration of the events she purports to remember. If Corwin's evaluation is to serve as the corroboration of Jane's alleged abuse, it must lay some strong claim to the measure of reliability, validity, and objectivity 38 July/August 2002 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER upon which scientific claims are founded. We have argued that clinical evaluations of abuse allegations, in general, do not have the desired indicia of reliability necessary for corroborat\u00ad ing scientific theories. There is nothing that we can see in Corwin's evaluation that distinguishes it from ordinary, sub\u00ad jective clinical assessments, or that allow him to make some special claim to objectivity and reliability. Nonetheless, other important questions remain: Even if there was no corroboration of sexual abuse, was there not corroboration of Janes burned feet? We learned from StepMom that Jane was taken to two hos\u00ad pitals on the same day to get as much documentation about the burned feet as possible. We learned from other sources that Jane had a fungal condition that could have been responsible for injuring her feet. We learned from FosterMom that Mom apparently did not have the type of stove that was supposed to have been used to burn Jane's feet. We could not access Jane's medical records, of course, because of confidentiality, but we did have descriptions about the burned feet provided in one of the CPS worker's reports. We then contacted Edwin Carlson, M.D., who was director of the emergency room at one of the hospitals where Jane was taken for examination of her feet. In response to the diagnosis of almost completely healed second- degree burns. Dr. Carlson told us: \"A physician cannot tell the cause of sloughed skin when the area is healing. The sloughed area is caused by vesiculation and it in turn has many etiologies including thermal and chemical burns, exfoliative dermatitis secondary to a drug reaction, bacterial and fungal infections. Therefore the etiology in the diagnosis is related as past history by the patient or the patient's guardian.\" He added that if there had been any suspicious circum\u00ad stances, the chance of a report not being filed with Child Protective Services was near zero, especially with the above diagnosis. We also contacted an Emergency Room nurse who knew a great deal about the standard of care at one of the hos\u00ad pitals where Jane had been taken to have her feet examined. She told us that during 1982 (the year Jane was taken to have her feet examined), any suspected child abuse was reported immediately to CPS unless there was an investigation in progress in another county, that the CPS offices were in a building immediately adjacent to the hospital where Jane was taken, and that the staff were on call twenty-four hours a day. \"We erred on the side of the child concerning the report,\" she told us. She implied that there must have been significant doubt that the \"burns\" were a result of child abuse. If Mom did not sexually abuse Jane, why did Jane report abuse when she was six years old? One possible answer: StepMom and Dad\u2014\"The Sexual Angle.\" A thorough examination of the data lead us to propose another equally plausible hypothesis about what happened, one that does not involve sexual abuse. Mom and Dad were involved in a prolonged and nasty divorce and child custody battle. Even allegations of deliberately burned feet had not suc\u00ad ceeded in getting Mom out of the picture. StepMom seems to despise Mom to this day. Did she, with or without Dad's involvement, see a way to finally get rid of Mom once and for all? \"The sexual angle\" is the phrase StemMom used in her interview with us when asked about the initial reports of abuse. Did StepMom question Jane in a suggestive manner? Mom obviously bathed her daughter Jane, and perhaps she might accidentally have poked her. Perhaps it was ordinary bathing with vaginal and anal cleansing of the type done by many parents. Did StepMom misconstrue Jane's honest accounts of how her mother bathed her? Did she reinforce sus\u00ad picions and reports of sexual abuse? Documentation from that period reveals that StepMom was the first person to whom Jane \"reported\" sexual abuse; only later did she tell this story to others. This is only one of the ways that Jane may have come to report sexual abuse if in fact none occurred, but there is contemporaneous documentation that is consistent with this hypothesis. If abuse did not occur, why were so many people\u2014including Jane herself\u2014persuaded that it did on the basis of the videotaped interviews of Jane at six? When someone recounts an event, especially if it is detailed and accompanied by emotion, it can be very persuasive (Bell and Loftus 1989). Jane herself was persuaded when she saw herself on tape, as were many knowledgeable scientists. Where would all that emotion and detail come from, many people assume, if the recounted events didn't happen? But of course the fact that a person has come to believe that something hap\u00ad pened does not mean it actually did. The belief can be absolutely real and heartfelt without being correct. People who believe they were abducted by aliens, people who believe they were kings and princesses in past lives, people who believe they can recall being born (or being cramped in the womb) will also give detailed, emotional, and persuasive reports of their \"mem\u00ad ories,\" but it seems unlikely that they are right. Thus, Ekman could have been absolutely right in his assessment that Jane's \"emotions\" at age six were authentic\u2014and absolutely wrong that she was having an authentic memory. Where did the pornography accusations come from? Numerous commentators have puzzled over the accusations of pornography. Corwin and Olafson's original article repeated Jane's accusations: \"I accused her of taking pictures of me and my brother and selling them,\" Jane recalled at age seventeen (Corwin and Olafson 1997, 105-106). Neisser suggested that the pornography accusations were false: \"Jane has clearly 'remembered'\u2014and been very upset by\u2014something that never took place\" (Neisser 1997, 123). Based on our interviews, we think that these accusations may have originated in the mind of StepMom and were communicated to Jane. They were denied by Jane's older brother John, who was supposed to have partic\u00ad ipated. They were denied by Mom. No reports or documenta\u00ad tion exist to substantiate them. They almost certainly would have been noted in police reports, therapists' notes, or other documents had they been mentioned. The Ethics of Exploring Jane Doe's Case Are our efforts to examine this case study ethical? Was it appro\u00ad priate for us to track down information, reassess the evidence and claims, and come to a different conclusion than Corwin's? SKEPTICAL INQUIRER July/August 2002 39 We consulted Thomas McCormick, a physician whose spe\u00ad cialty is medical ethics at the University of Washington. McCormick offered a hypothetical situation in which a profes\u00ad sional has published a case history claiming that he cured can\u00ad cer with marijuana leaves and Crisco. Oncologists would natu\u00ad rally have many questions to ask of this case study: Did it really work? If the patient seems to be in better health after the \"treat\u00ad ment,\" did he or she really have cancer in the first place? Would it be ethical for a physician to talk to the \"case history\" and to examine the original doctor's data? McCormick thinks so, and so do we. The essence of science is its openness to examination by one's peers. Claims ought to be subject to peer review; facts must be available for verification or criticism; and findings ought to be reproducible. When an author puts forward a hypothesis based upon a case study that he maintains is true, one that he uses to defend his theory, oth\u00ad ers are entitled\u2014indeed obligated\u2014to scrutinize the methods and findings as long as this can be accomplished without undue harm. In the case of Jane Doe, we followed the trail left by Corwin, and we tracked down many documents pertinent to her case, and met a few individuals who knew her. We found a great deal of material that was damaging to his claims. What wc did was reminiscent of the work of scholars who reexamined Freud's case of Dora, discovering crucial information about her that Freud neglected to tell his readers. Reanalyzing a case study does require detection skills. Readers may wonder why we did not speak to Jane Doe herself. We thought long and hard about doing this. Although we obtained recorded permission from Jane's mother to con\u00ad tact her daughter, we worried that such contact might be upsetting to Jane\u2014and she had surely been upset enough in her troubled young life. Given that Jane's own account at this point might well not shed additional light on the \"case study,\" as her beliefs had potentially been so contaminated, we decided not to risk upsetting her. Corwin and Olafson and some of the commentators pro\u00ad posed a new \"research paradigm\": future studies could take advantage of the existence of vast numbers of decades-old tapes of children making sexual abuse allegations. Adults like Jane who had been videotaped in childhood, reporting that they had been abused, could be recontacted to explore their memory of the childhood trauma. Adults like Jane could be shown their childhood tapes, as Jane was. Lindsay (1997) urged careful consideration of this idea, and after seeing what followed in Jane's life, we agree. We think this method is risky\u2014indeed, potentially catastrophic. If the abuse never happened in the first place, the adult- child may be mistakenly led to believe that it did because she does not understand that there are reasons why a child might make an abuse report even when no abuse had occurred. She may be led to act on the basis of this \"new information\" in ways that she would not have otherwise acted, with results devastating for her and others. In this case, for example, Jane terminated her newly reforming relationship with her mother after seeing her childhood tapes. No one counseled her that her age six statements, however dramatic, might have been the result of suggestion. Moreover, according to many sources, prior to Corwin's intervention, Jane was frequently question\u00ad ing her \"memories,\" talking about them, wondering what \"really\" happened. Did her 1995 contact with Corwin push her over from uncertain to certain? Postscript Our efforts to critically evaluate this claim of the recovery of a repressed memory were met with unexpected and unsettling obstructions. Critics of our inquiry, some of whom shielded themselves in \"confidential\" memos and anonymous allega\u00ad tions of our supposed wrongdoing (memos to which we were denied access and hence opportunity to respond), were able to impede the publication of our work for more than two years. Indeed, our respective universities issued chilling warnings to us that we were to avoid the publication, in any forum, of any of this material, even that which is in the public domain and readily found by anyone with access to a modem and Google search engine. Our vindication, and concomitant recognition of our constitutionally protected speech, was wrested from the academy not by the shield of \"tenure\" and its intended protec\u00ad tions of the spirited exchange of intellectual ideas, but through the costly (emotionally, professionally, and financially) reten\u00ad tion of private counsel. We are alarmed on behalf of all mem\u00ad bers of the academic community that our universities, institu\u00ad tions that above all others should be championing the right to free speech and academic debate, so implacably opposed it in this instance. Jane Doe's case continues to be offered as proof of the authenticity of repressed or dissociated memories in many venues, including court cases involving other, potentially innocent, accused individuals. Jane terminated her newly emerging relationship with her mother after Corwin came back into her life and replayed her childhood tape. Her mother lost her once, long ago in 1984, and lost her again in 1995. At this writing they are not in con\u00ad tact with one another.

Continued on page 44 40 July/August 2002 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER This article chronicles the tribulations noted psychologists Elizabeth Loftus and Melvin Guyer were put through for conduct\u00ad ing the investigation that is the subject of their ttvo-part article \"Who Abused Jane Doe?\" concluding in this issue of the SKEPTICAL INQUIRER (Pages 37-40).\u2014The Editor The High Cost of Skepticism Here's what happened to two scientists who believed that tenure and the First Amendment would protect their rights to free inquiry. CAROL TAVRIS In the olden days, perhaps twenty or thirty years ago, aca\u00ad demic debates were marked by sweet discourse and the harmonious if impassioned hum of debate. (Also by sar\u00ad casm.) The rule used to be that if you disagreed with some\u00ad one's opinion or interpretations of data, you did the civilized thing\u2014you called the person a knucklehead or an incompe\u00ad tent fool. Or you wrote a devastating reply explaining why the knucklehead was terminally wrong, misguided, or drunk. That was then. Just as noise trumps silence and rage trumps courtesy, the cudgel of lawsuits to silence or cower the opposition trumps free debate. In universities across the country, lawsuits, even spurious and unsuccessful ones, have weakened the once-sacrosanct guarantees to scholars of free SKEPTICAL INQUIRER luly/August 2002 41 speech and association. Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) and Human Subjects Committees have proliferated, to protect human subjects from harm caused by unethical scientists\u2014 and to protect universities from any lawsuits that might ensue. Of course some scientists have conducted dangerous and/or unethical research. I do not disapprove of efforts to assure the safety of subjects any more than I do of lawsuits to punish those who plagiarize, commit libel or fraud, or mali\u00ad ciously destroy reputations. But all institutionalized efforts to correct one problem will inevitably create other problems. Today, many of the IRBs originally established to protect subjects have instituted so many byzantine restrictions and rules that even good scientists cannot do their work. Some have become fiefdoms of power\u2014free to make decisions based on caprice, personal vendettas, or self-interest, and free to strangle research that might prove too provocative, con\u00ad troversial, or politically sensitive. The growing power of IRBs in academia, along with the increasing number of restrictions on free speech in the politi\u00ad cally correct name of \"speech codes\" and \"conduct codes\" (described so well by Alan Kors and Harvey Silverglate in The Shadow University), is perilous for independent scientific inquiry. For years, the skeptical movement, which had its birth in the domain of philosophy and the study of logic, has tended to regard failures of skeptical and scientific thinking as failures of reasoning\u2014something amiss in human cognition. The underlying assumption has been that if we can only get people to think straight, junk their cognitive biases, and understand the basic principles and methods of science, pseudoscientific reasoning will become as vestigial to the mind as the appendix is to the body. Perhaps, but the skeptical movement needs also to focus its energies on the growing institutional barriers to free inquiry, and the efforts to silence those whose inquiries make waves. The story of what happened to Elizabeth Loftus and Mel Guyer when they set out to investigate the case of Jane Doe is itself a case study of the high cost of skepticism.1 The two demonstrated exactly the kind of openminded spirit of discov\u00ad ery that is at the heart of the skeptical movement. For their pains, they found themselves in an Orwellian nightmare. The irony is that if Loftus and Guyer were journalists, they would have done precisely the same investigation unhampered and fully supported by their employer. But because they are university professors, they were subjected to a secret, shadowy investigation of their legal right to GO what good reporters do every day. And their respective universities, far from support\u00ad ing their intellectual inquiries and their tenured (indeed American) right to free speech, obstucted and harassed them. Some of these obstructionist efforts linger in the articles they wrote in this magazine [\"Who Abused Jane Doe?\" May/June and July/August 2002]. If a writer for, say, The New Yorker or Carol Tavris, Ph.D., is a social psychologist, writer, and lecturer. She is author of a recent collection of book reviews and essays. Psychobabble and Biobunk, and coauthor of three introductory psychology textbooks. 42 July/August 2002 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER The Atlantic had conducted such an investigation, you would know the city and state of all of the individuals interviewed, their names (unless they requested anonymity), the data bases the investigators used to gather information\u2014in short, you would know the details. But Loftus feels she is still not at lib\u00ad erty to provide these details in print, and that her university is still looking over her shoulder. Who Abused Loftus and Guyer? After reading David Corwin's account of Jane Doe in the jour\u00ad nal Child Maltreatment in 1997, Loftus and Guyer decided to examine his alleged evidence of a recovered memory of sexual abuse. The stakes were high for their work as scholars, teach\u00ad ers, and expert witnesses, because the case was already being used in court as evidence that recovered memories of sexual abuse in childhood are reliable. They began by looking into documents in the public record. They found a public court case of \"Jane Doe\" who fit the description in Corwin's article, but the court records dif\u00ad fered from Corwin's account in significant ways. They eventu\u00ad ally met Jane Doe's mother, and became convinced that she had been falsely accused many years before, leading to the loss of custody of her daughter. They decided that this was a story worth pursuing and publishing, ideally in a popular magazine. In the spring of 1998, Guyer contacted the administrator of the University of Michigan's IRB to make sure the commit\u00ad tee shared his view that he did not need their approval because he was not doing \"research\" but rather \"intellectual criticism, commentary on a forensic issue, and an historical/journalistic endeavor.\" The administrator and the then-chair of the IRB, Sumer Pek, agreed; Guyer's investigation would be exempt from IRB oversight. A month later Guyer received a letter, with no intervening warning that anything was amiss, telling him that his project was not exempt; in fact, that it was assigned a \"disapproval\" sta\u00ad tus; and that the IRB was recommending to the Office of the Vice President of Research that he, personally, be reprimanded. The Catholic Church has given up limbo, but not, appar\u00ad ently, university IRBs. Appeals, protests, and exchanges ensued for nearly a year. In March 1999, Guyer received a letter from the new chair of the IRB, Stephen Gebarski, telling him that his work was indeed exempt from IRB consideration because it was not \"human subjects research.\" The OVP Research office con\u00ad cluded that there was no basis for a recommendation of \"repri\u00ad mand.\" Guyer was given no explanation of the year-long delay, although Gebarski did apologize for any \"misunderstandings\" that might have occurred that year. He added that he was per\u00ad sonally \"[looking] forward to seeing your interesting historical journalistic work published in the appropriate forum.\" Encouraged by the green light given to Guyer at Michigan, the two pursued their investigation. Then the University of Washington received an e-mail from Jane Doe, complaining that her privacy was being violated. Considering that David Corwin had published his account of her life and was traveling around the country showing videotapes of Jane at six and sev\u00ad enteen, and considering that no one was making her story public (and hence violating her \"privacy\") except Jane herself and Corwin, this complaint should have been recognized as a cry from a troubled and vulnerable young woman, and set aside. Instead, it was enough to set in motion a series of end\u00ad lessly shifting charges against Elizabeth Loftus, a scientist of international stature who had brought luster and prestige to her university for more than twenty-five years. The \"investiga\u00ad tion\" against her lasted more than twenty-one months, in spite of the University's own statute of limitations\u2014thirty days for the selection of a committee and ninety days for its delibera\u00ad tions\u2014for bringing all such investigations to a conclusion. On September 30, 1999, having given Loftus fifteen min\u00ad utes' advance notice by telephone, John Slattery of the University of Washington's \"Office of Scientific Integrity\" arrived in Loftus's office, along with the chair of the psychol\u00ad ogy department, and seized her files. She asked Slattery what the charges against her were. It took him five weeks to respond, and when he did he had transformed Jane Doe's \"pri\u00ad vacy\" complaint into an investigation of \"possible violations of human subjects research.\" Loftus later learned that lawyers in another state, who had retained Corwin as their defense expert, were trying to subpoena her personnel file in hopes of finding something there to discredit her as an expert witness for the plaintiffs. Because the University, in the face of her objection, was going forward in complying with this improper subpoena, she was forced to retain her own lawyer to stop them. (Because it was from out of state, it had no force of law or validity in Washington.) In February 2000, Loftus and her lawyer dislodged some documents from the University's investigation, and found among them a \"Confidential Memo\" written by Stanley Berent, a neuropsychologist who was on the IRB at the University of Michigan \u2014Guyer's IRB. This memo had played a crucial role in the decision to reprimand Guyer and deny him the right to continue his work, yet Guyer was never even told it existed. Berent's memo, Guyer says, \"was the harshest document, filled with false innuendo, malicious insinuations, and outright falsities. Keeping it secret from me denied me the opportunity to correct its mischaracteriza- tions.\" To this day Guyer has been unable to get his own uni\u00ad versity to provide him with a copy of this memo, even after repeated requests under the Freedom of Information Act. Yet a University of Michigan lawyer was happy to send it directly to the investigating committee at the University of Washington, to be used against Loftus. This was the modus operandi at both universities: keep the charges secret, keep changing the charges, keep the meetings secret, keep the accused in the dark. In the spring of 2001, the three-member investigating com\u00ad mittee, consisting of two clinicians and one sociologist, con\u00ad cluded that Loftus was not guilty of the charge of \"scholarly misconduct.\" But the two clinicians recommended to the dean, David Hodge, that she nonetheless be reprimanded and subjected to a program of remedial education on professional ethics. They instructed Loftus not to publish data obtained by methods they regarded as inconsistent with the \"ethical prin\u00adcipals\" [sic] of psychologists\u2014that is, the methods of a jour\u00ad nalistic investigation. On July 3, 2001, one year and nine months after the University of Washington seized her files, and one month after Loftus won the prestigious William James award from the American Psychological Society for her decades of scientific research [see SKEPTICAL INQUIRER, November/December 2001], Dean Hodge wrote Loftus a letter of exoneration. Her work, he said, \"does not constitute research involving human subjects.\" She did not commit ethical violations or deviate from accepted research practices. She was not guilty of any misconduct. She would not have to undergo remedial educa\u00ad tion on how to conduct research. But, oh, one more thing: She was not to contact Jane Doe's mother again or interview anyone else involved in the case without advance approval. Such meetings, he said, would con\u00ad stitute \"human subjects research requiring Human Subjects Committee approval.\" The Enemy Within And there it stands: Loftus and Guyer won; their investigation was published in these pages; but at tremendous cost. Loftus still feels bitter at the dean's restrictions, which she and Guyer regard as blatant violations of her First Amendment rights. Guyer is still outraged by Stanley Berent's peculiar and devious memo, not knowing to whom else it was improperly sent or who might next use its innuendos and lies against him. Of course, their investigation of Corwin's claims was bound to enflame passions: those of Jane Doe herself, an unhappy young woman whose life has been filled with conflict and loss; those of David Corwin, who has publicly promoted his case study as a personal vindication and a prototype of how recov\u00ad ered memories should be studied; and those of the many clin\u00ad icians who still cling to the discredited concept of repressed memories. Loftus and Guyer knew they had enemies. They hadn't known that some of them were at their own universi\u00ad ties, and that the shields of tenure and the First Amendment would not be sufficient protection. \"I don't see how you can write anydiing of value,\" the great anthropologist Marvin Harris told me years ago, \"if you don't offend someone.\" Skeptical inquiry is endangered when those who are offended or threatened by knowledge are able to silence those who have something valuable to say. The lawsuit path is crowded because those who take it face no negative consequences: The worst that can happen to them is nothing at all-\u2014their target doesn't budge. But often the targets of these threats, weary of being harassed, unable to pay the costs of self- defense, frightened at the prospect of losing their reputations, and unsupported by their publisher or university, do back down. The offending passage is deleted, funny but sarcastic remarks toned down, safer topics chosen, documented evi\u00ad dence of the target's malfeasance removed. That is why we must be all the more grateful for the courage, persistence, and integrity of those skeptical inquirers who are still willing to \"offend\" in the pursuit of truth and jus\u00ad tice, heroes like Elizabeth Loftus and Mel Guyer. SKEPTICAL INQUIRER July/Augusl 2002 43 Postscript Institutional Review Boards misuse their power not only when they impose excessive and unnecessary restrictions on free speech in the name of protecting subjects; but also when financial interests influence their approval of research that is potentially harmful to subjects. Consider this irony: Stanley Berent's confidential memo excoriated Mel Guyer for his alleged scientific and ethical lapses\u2014among them, failing to get Jane Does consent to call her mother, who was eager to tell them her side of the story; failing to enlist the \"ongoing coop\u00ad eration\" of Corwin(!), as if Corwin would have granted it; and failing to consider whether this \"research\" might have \"a nega\u00ad tive effect upon the dignity and welfare of the participant.\" Yet at the very same time, Berent got permission from his own IRB (of which he was a member) to conduct research with, in my view, far graver implications for the dignity and welfare of his subjects. The Michigan IRB had granted approval for Berent and his associate James Albers to retrieve medical records of railroad workers who had been exposed to dangerous solvents.

O 44 July/August 2002 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER Tracing Graham Hancock's Shifting Cataclysm An examination of a specific portion of Graham Hancocks book Fingerprints of the Gods, relating to Earth Crustal Displacement, the climates and fauna of Siberia and Alaska, and the deaths of the mammoths, finds it to be critically flawed. MICHAEL BRASS By the late 1960s the modern theories of continental drift and plate tectonics had become firmly established in geological thought. They had survived close scrutiny and challenges from competing hypotheses and propositions, both within and outside the scientific community. One of the most prominent unorthodox interpretations put forward was Charles Hapgood's \"Earth Crustal Displacement,\" which was never accepted as a truly valid competing scientific hypothesis (and Hapgood was nor part of the geological community). Popularized in his 1958 book Earths Shifting Crust: A Key to Some Basic Problems of Earth Science, the Earth Crustal Displacement idea has re-emerged in alternative circles in the last decade. Its most vocal supporters are the librarians Rand SKEPTICAL INQUIRER July/August 2002 and Rose Flem-Ath and the journalist Graham Hancock. Hancock based a large portion of his book Fingerprints of the Gods (1995, revised 2001) on Hapgood's evidence for cata\u00ad strophe at the end of the Last Glacial Maximum, 12,000 B.P. (before present). Earth Crustal Displacement is based on the premise that Earth's lithosphere (the outer part of the rocky Earth, about the uppermost 80 kilometers or 50 miles) has shifted as a whole at different times in the past over Earth's interior. Hancock (1995, 11) went so far as to claim no geologist \"has succeeded in proving it incorrect.\" Results from pollen analyses have revealed patterns of climate change that are at odds with the inherent predictions of the Earth Crustal Displacement model. Studies have shown that the Polar regions have either contracted or expanded toward the equator, but have never shifted their positions as required by Earth Crustal Displacement. The CLIMAP Project (1981) reconstructed cli\u00ad matic zones during the Last Glacial Maximum and the results obtained shows the North and South Poles (and the equator) in the same position as today. Paleontological data, summa\u00ad rized by Thiede et al. (1990), reveals that the Arctic Ocean has continuously experienced polar climates, almost permanent ice cover and glacio-marine sedimentation for all of the Late Cenozoic since the mid-Pleistocene. Phillips and Ganze (1997) reconfirm that, regardless of how the climate has var\u00ad ied in the Arctic Polar regions, they have been colder than the oceanic areas south of it for at least die past 7 million years. Earth's lithosphere is attached to the mantle in such a way as to make Earth Crustal Displacement impracticable. The mechanism for Earth Crustal Displacement was postulated to be the sheer weight of the ice built up over time; this caused the crust to shift through unequal weight distribution. However, diis weight is compensated for by isostatic depres\u00ad sion of the crust. Finally, there is no paleomagnetic evidence for Earth Crustal Displacement having occurred. In Fingerprints of the Gods, Hancock hypothesizes that the demise of the mammoths and other megafauna was caused by a catastrophic cataclysm brought on through an Earth Crustal Displacement. The result was that \"terrible forces were Michael Brass has degrees in archaeology and history and is owner and designer of The Antiquity of Man Web site at www. antiquityofman.com. He is also a contributor to the anti- pseudoscience Web site In the Hall of Ma'at: Weighing the Evi\u00ad dence for Alternative History at www.maat.paradoxdesigns.com. unleashed on all living creatures during the last Ice Age\" and that \"the nordiern regions of Alaska and Siberia appear to have been the worst hit by the murderous upheavals between 13,000 and 11,000 years ago. In a great swathe of death around the edge of the Arctic Circle the remains of uncountable numbers of large animals have been found\u2014includ\u00ad ing many carcasses with the flesh still intact, and astonishing quantities of perfectly pre\u00ad served mammoth tusks\" (Hancock 1995, 212, 213). Hancock makes a case for Siberia having experienced a warm climate be\u00ad fore 11,000 B.P. and contrasts it with the conditions seen there today. As evi\u00ad dence, Hancock focuses on stomach contents: \"The mammoth died suddenly, in intense cold, and in great numbers. Death comes so quickly that the swallowed vegetation beans have been found, yet identifiable and undeterio- rated, in their mouths and stomachs\" (Hancock 1995, 215\u201416). The source for the quote by Hancock is a 1960 news\u00ad paper article by Ivan Sanderson. Hancock (1995, 216) also claims: \"Needless to say, such flora does not grow anywhere in Siberia today. Its presence diere in the eleventh millennium B.C. compels us to accept that the region had a pleasant and pro\u00ad ductive climate\u2014one diat was temperate or even warm. . . . What is certain, however, is that at some point between 12-13,000 years ago a destroying frost descended with horrify\u00ad ing speed upon Siberia and has never relaxed its grip. In an eerie echo of the Avestic traditions, a land which had previously enjoyed seven months of summer was converted almost overnight into a land of ice and snow with ten months of harsh and frozen winter.\" The positions and actions of ice sheets are more compli\u00ad cated than the blanket portrayal in Fingerprints of the Gods. The Barents Ice Sheet covered most of northern Russia and goes unmentioned in Fingerprints of the Gods, as do the reasons behind why Siberia was not all covered in ice. Siberia lay west and southwest of where the Barents Ice Sheet had formed. There was insufficient snowfall to create enough ice to expand the Barents Ice Sheet into Siberia. Chinooks blowing down off the ice sheet, moderating the climate of the area in front of them, was the cause of the insufficient snowfall. North America was also subjected to its own chinook winds. As has been documented with the Sierra Nevadas and other moun\u00ad tain ranges, the air descending 2-3 km from the top of an ice- sheet would be heated up to an average of 4\u20147 degrees centi\u00ad grade. The areas of Siberia and North America in front of the ice-sheets would have experienced a milder winter than pre\u00ad sent, although their summers were colder, which resulted in more conducive conditions for plant growth and for animals than those currently experienced. Moreover, a rain shadow was cast over Siberia by the ice sheet, and the Arctic Ocean, cov\u00ad ered in ice, could provide little moisture for precipitation over Siberia. This scenario was tested by COHMAP (Cooperative Holocene Mapping Project) members (1988) who found a dry In Fingerprints of the Gods, Hancock hypothesizes that the demise of the mammoths and other megafauna was caused by a catastrophic cataclysm brought on through an Earth Crustal Displacement. 46 July/August 2002 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER Siberia, a glaciated Barents Sea, and a glaciated North America to be compatible. The Frozen Mammoths Claims that the mammoths were quick-frozen have been propounded for decades and were disputed by Zimmerman and Tedford as long ago as the mid-1970s (1976, 183): \"Histologic examination of rehydrated tissue samples from late Pleistocene Alaskan mammal mummies demon\u00ad strates that the preservative effect of freezing and drying extends to remains 15,000 to 25,000 years old. Some mus\u00ad cle and liver retained identifiable histo\u00ad logic structures. Most tissues were com\u00ad pletely disintegrated and partly replaced by masses of bacteria, an indication of considerable post-mortem decay before the remains were entombed beneath the permafrost zone.\" These points were taken up and elaborated upon further by Kurten (1986, 51-2): \"Various legends exist about frozen mammoths. It has been said, for instance, that the scientists who excavated the Beresovka mammoth, discovered in the year 1900, enjoyed a banquet on mammoth steak. What really appears to have happened (as I was told by Professor Anatol Heinz) is that one of them made a heroic attempt to take a bite out of the 40,000 year old meat but was unable to keep it down, in spite of a generous use of spices... The facts are not hard to find. In 1902, Otto Herz, a zoolo\u00ad gist at the Imperial Academy of Sciences in St. Pietersburg published in German an account of the expedition to the Beresovka River which he had led the year before, with the purpose of salvaging the mam\u00ad moth carcass diat had been discovered in 1900. . . . The point here is this: Herz definitely states that it was only the superficial part of the cadaver that had been pre\u00ad served. The internal organs had rotted away before the animal had become frozen.\" \"Blue-babe,\" a mammoth that perished 36,000 B.P., was discovered with its chest cavity torn open by predators, which allowed its body to be quick-frozen. If it had been catastroph- ically frozen, it would have been too hard to tear open and be feasted upon. Second, its predators should have been quick- frozen by the same catastrophe that overcame their feast. The size of the mammoths was an adaptive advantage to the cold environment in which they lived, and not to the warm environment postulated by Hancock. Low surface-to- body ratios help to reduce passive heat loss through the skin. They had small ears and trunks by comparison with their African elephant cousins, who use their large ears and trunks to dissipate the heat. The mammoth's body was cold-adapted Claims that the mammoths were quick-frozen have been propounded for decades and were disputed as long ago as the mid-1970s. in other ways. They had a 10cm thick undercoat, 50cm long body hairs and a 10cm layer of white insulative fat under the skin. The woolly rhinoceros, Coelodonta arttiquitatis, also had a shaggy coat and a layer of extra fat underneath its skin. Mummified remains of these rhinos have also been found in the permafrost. Permafrost Plants The plants and pollen found within the mammoths, together with the remains in the surrounding sediments, consist entirely of plant varieties adapted to cold climates. The plant remains found in the guts of the mammoth and other mum\u00ad mified animals from Siberia have been analyzed and summa\u00ad rized in detail by Ukraintseva (1993). Further work on the cli\u00ad mate of Siberia by Russian paleontologists, paleobotanists, and geologists has also been summarized in Ukraintseva (1993). Siberia was not dominated by tundra when the mammoths SKEPTICAL INQUIRER July/AugusI 2002 47 lived. As Ukraintseva (240) points out, \"Integrated investiga\u00ad tions threw light on environments of the concrete specimens of fossil animals discussed here and the 'mammoth' fauna as a whole. Most of the mammals died in warm periods during the last 53,000-10,000 years when the vast territory of Siberia was covered by various forests, paludal communities and bogs, whereas communities of azonal character (meadows, steppe meadows, and others) which served as pastures to the mam mals sharply reduced in area.\" Ukraintseva also says: \"Cold (glacial) epochs were dominated by open, treeless landscapes such as arctic meadows, various tundras, periglacial steppes. Remains of fossil trees, dated by C\" analysis, suggest rhat woody plants did not disappear completely during short cold phases of the last Pleistocene and Holocene. They remained as small forests and separate trees in the river valleys and serves as peculiar advanced posts for forest advance northwards at warm periods.\" The arctic meadows, tundras, and steppes contained the herbaceous plants, leaves, and sprigs of shrubs and low shrubs needed for the mammoth to feed on and survive in glacial Siberia. The mammoths also had complex molars that were ideally suited for its macrograzing habitats. These data were available to Hancock when both editions of Fingerprints of the Gods were published. The problem is that the winters had to have been cold enough to freeze and mummify the remains, and the summers warm enough to melt the permafrost and produce mudflows to bury the carcasses. If the summers were too cold then mud- flows wouldn't have occurred and the carcasses be buried and preserved; if the winters were too warm, the carcasses would have been decayed or been devoured fully by predators be\u00ad fore being preserved. The remains of Pleistocene mammals in Alaska and Siberia have been discovered in permafrost, which resulted in the body tissue being preserved through desiccation-induced mummification. The end of the Last Glacial Maximum was a continuation of cyclical events occurring over hundreds of millions of years, which has its origins in slow cyclical changes in the tilt of Earth and Earth's eccentric orbit around the Sun. Although the latter is mentioned in Chapter 28 of Fingerprints of the Gods, entitled \"Machinery of Heaven,\" its implications are not discussed. These two Milankovitch factors combine to vary the amount of solar radiation different areas of Earth receive at different times in accordance with orbital forcing. Current cycles last 100,000 years and are affected also by ocean cur\u00ad rents and the rise and fall of mountain ranges. In-depth analy\u00ad ses have been undertaken and presented by John and Katherine Imbrie (1979), as well as Wally Broecker and George Denton (1990). The climate changes that affected the habitats of the mam\u00ad moths, and other mammals, at the end of the Last Glacial Maximum have been eloquently and concisely expressed by Vereshchagin and Baryshnikow (1984, 506-7): \"Winters with little snowfall and the development of a luxuriant grass cover on hard, dry ground with abundant sum\u00ad mer insolation allowed horses, bison, and saiga to occupy huge expanses of northern Eurasia. The boundary between the Pleistocene and Holocene was characterized by sharp, short climatic oscillations: The Boiling interstadial (12,400-12,000 yr B.P.), stadial B.P.), and so forth, which affected the Pleistocene species decisively. It was precisely in this time range that the massive extinction of the mammoths and their 'fellow travellors' occurred in the arctic zone. Testimony to this extinction are the hundreds of thousands of bones from disarticulated skeletons and the occasional frozen carcasses buried in Sartan deposits (late Wisconsin) in north\u00ad ern Yakutia and on the Tajmyr Peninsula. Judging from mod\u00ad ern examples of mass death among wild and domestic ungu\u00ad lates in the Kazakhstan steppes, the best explanation for such death at the end of the Pleistocene is the frequent occurrence of snowstorms (blizzards) in winter and the transformation of the nutritious Pleistocene tundra-steppe into a boggy, lake- dotted tundra. In subarctic latitudes at this time, taiga and mixed-forests advanced rapidly onto open expanses, and a for\u00ad est fauna developed. From the paleozoologist's point of view, the most convincing proof that the landscape changed radi\u00ad cally on the boundary between the Pleistocene and Holocene is the change from a steppe, mammoth fauna into a forest fauna on the Russian Plain, in the northern Urals, in Siberia, and even in the Far East.\" These two authors place great emphasis upon the role of climate in the demise of the megafauna (512): The examples wc have presented of extremely rapid decline in some nonexploited mammal species during the Quaternary and at present in northern Eurasia point to the supreme importance of external, abiotic environmental factors in their extinction. The near-total extinction of large species of the mammoth fauna in the tundra and taiga zones and their partial survival in the for\u00ad est steppe and steppe confirms the decisive effects of climatic and landscape changes for the life and death of this species group. The best proof of what has been said is die ubiquitous transformation of the Upper Pleistocene \"steppe\" fauna into a forest and taiga fauna over huge areas in upper and middle lati\u00ad tudes in Eurasia. In this case, the primitive species were not crowded out by more progressive ones, nor were their popula\u00ad tion structures disrupted, nor were diey destroyed by human activity. Environmental change was so radical and dramatic that morphological evolution simply did not have time to catch up. The destructive activity of people is often thought to have been decisive in the extinction of Quaternary giants (mammoths, rhinoceros, cave bear, and others). However, while human The problem is that the winters had to have been cold enough to freeze and mummify the remains, and the summers warm enough to melt the permafrost and produce mudflows to bury the carcasses. 48 luly/August 2002 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER influence on animal populations steadily increased in prehistory, it became definitive only in the last few millennia and centuries. In addition, the role of man has not been the same in all geo\u00ad graphic zones. It has been greatest in die ancient heartlands of civilization in the Mediterranean Basin, western and central Asia, and China, and least in the polar desert. The remaining causes of extinction have apparently been sec\u00ad ondary, merely promoting further reduction in ranges and numbers of species after they had suffered from climatic and landscape changes or from human pressures. Other theories place greater or lesser emphasis upon human involvement on the extinction of the megafauna, but the point is that that alternative theories to a cata\u00ad clysmic demise are rooted in sound factual evidence that strongly contradicts Fingerprints of the Gods. The book Quaternary Extinctions is cited four times in Fingerprints of the Gods (Chapter 26), which puts forward Hancock's view of a cataclysm having struck Siberia and Alaska causing the demise of the mammoths and other fauna. In each case, no mention is made of the evidence and views proposed by the scientists on the basis of valid scientific research into the cause of fauna extinctions at the Plcistocene- Holocene boundary. Conclusion In the scenario painted by Hancock in Fingerprints of the Gods, Siberia and Alaska are ice-free with temperate climates prior to a cataclysm occurring at the end of the Last Glacial Maximum. This dramatic shift to an ice-bound climate explains the exis\u00ad tence of frozen mammoths and the demise of a number of megafauna. Accordingly, to test Hancocks ideas the following factors would have to be proven correct: 1. The fauna! remains found inside the mammoths and in die surrounding environment could not be from plants which can adapt to the cold; 2. The dates of frozen mammoths carcasses would be clus\u00ad tered in the couple of thousand years following the Last Glacial Maximum; 3. No mammoths would have survived the Earth Crustal Displacement-induced cataclysm; 4. Earth Crustal Displacement would need to be a valid scientific theory; and 5. No other geological and archaeological theory could better explain the currently available evidence. Until 3,700 BP, a small woolly mammoth species existed about 200 km off the coast of Siberia, on Wrangel Island. The body of the mammoth was adapted for the cold, and the environment of Pleistocene Siberia and Alaska was far from the warm picture portrayed in Fingerprints of the Gods. Earth Crustal Displacement is a discredited hypothesis which no longer has any factual basis on which to stand: it was tested, as all scientific hypotheses are, and found wanting. The demise of the mammoth and other megafauna at the Pleistocene- Holocene transition is readily explained through climatic influ\u00ad ences and human activities. The information cited in this article was available to Hancock before the publication of the first edition of Fingerprints of the Gods. He has since brought out a second edi\u00ad tion, with the only change being an introduction and addi\u00ad tional photos. It is fitting to end of this article in Hancock's own words (2001, xvii-xviii): \"I don't believe in revising or 'updating' books. For this reason, I haven't changed a word of the original text of Fingerprints of the Gods. All of it is repro\u00ad duced here exactly as it was in the first, 1995, edition. . . . The proper place for all this new material to come out, in my view, is in new books, not in updates to old ones. So even as I write this introduction to the 2001 edition of Fingerprints of the Gods I am happy to report that I have also completed the first three chapters of Underworld\u2014which is scheduled for publi\u00ad cation in 2002 (please note that Underworld Wi\\\\ not be cover\u00ad ing the same subject material as Fingerprints of the Gods). Writing new books, rather than going back to tamper with books already written, is also the way I prefer to respond to criticisms of my work. ... I am proud of this book and con\u00ad tinue to stand by it despite the unremitting hostility and crit\u00ad icisms of academics.\" References Broecker, W.. and G. Demon. 1990.

Yet few realize that both incidents were products of a chemical and biological weapons scare that parallels present-day American terrorism anxieties. While the Martian scare has been exaggerated in terms of the extent of those who were frightened or panicked (Bartholomew 1998), Princeton University psychologist Hadley Cantril found that 20 per\u00ad cent of those he interviewed assumed that the radio announcer in the bogus broadcast had misinterpreted what he was seeing and the \"Martians\" were actually members of IFYH I FOR PARAL GAS PRO!

One typical respondent stated: \"The announcer said a meteor had fallen from Mars and I was sure that he thought that, but in back of my head I had the idea that the meteor was just a camouflage . . . and the Germans were attacking us with gas bombs\" (Cantril 1940, 160). During the early 1930s Americans were preoccupied with the threat of chemical and biological terrorism as many books and articles addressed the topic, especially gas warfare (Kenworthy 1930; Lefebure 1931; Han 1933). In The Air Menace and the Answer, Elvira Fradkin (1934, 1) described America during this period as experiencing the \"poison gas scare.\" Many magazines also addressed the subject (Moore 1933; Phillips 1933; St. John 1934). The League of Nations published many documents addressing the issue, and proceed\u00ad ings of the many conferences held on the topic appeared (Fradkin 1934). German aggression in Europe and increased publicity of the dangers of chemical and biological weapons were essential backdrops that rendered the Martian radio play more plausible as a German gas attack. A similar context helped to create the case of the \"mad gasser\" of Mattoon\u2014 once again with the sensationalizing of the American mass media. In fact, the media have often been implicated in fomenting mass hysterias and social delusions. The Media and Mass Hysteria The mass media are often influential in creating, spreading, and ironically even eventually ending mass hysteria. In most cases the media neither create the initial incident nor help to spread it, but exacerbate the outbreak once it is underway. Most mass hysteria reports in the scientific literature occur in schools and factories and involve the rapid spread of transient, benign illness symptoms among members of closely knit groups in enclosed settings (Sirois 1982; Bartholomew and Sirois 1996). Such cases are typically triggered by a few well- known factors: rumors, anxiety, and an exaggerated threat that is either real or imagined. The media typically exacerbate these episodes by reporting public reaction to the hysteria diagnosis, which is often met by fierce opposition from victims, their friends, relatives, com\u00ad munity members, and leaders (Cartter 1989). Physician Joel Nitzkin received physical threats after diagnosing a mass hys\u00ad teria outbreak in a Florida school (Nitzkin 1976; Roueche 1978), while historian Elaine Showaltcr more recently retained the services of a bodyguard after stating her view that Gulf War Syndrome has a hysterical basis (Wessely 1999, personal communication). The initial diagnosis of hysteria is always going to be ambiguous since it takes time for all probable causes to be eliminated and negative test results to come back. In the interim, the participants typically express dieir views in the form of emotionally charged public meetings mat are reported by the media and letters to the local press which often report misinformation (Hocking 1990). Occasionally social protest movements are formed that thrive on media publicity surrounding a hysteria episode (Philen et al. 1989). While epidemic hysteria can never be confirmed with negative medical and environmental test Aline Kearney consoles her daughter Dorothy. Both reportedly became ill after smelling a sickly sweet odor. Her other daughter, Carol, looks on. She was unaffected and sleeping in another part of the house (Source: The Chicago Herald-American. September 17. 1944. p. 3). results, it has several distinct features, the confluence of which almost certainly indicates the presence of psychogenic symp\u00ad toms. These include: no plausible organic basis; symptoms that are transient and benign; occurrence in a segregated group; presence of extraordinary stress; rapid onset and recov\u00ad ery; symptom spread by sight or sound; and dispersion down the age-scale beginning in older or higher status persons. In relatively rare instances involving the spread of mass hys\u00ad teria (or social delusions involving the spread of a false belief but no illness symptoms) to the public at large, the media usu\u00ad ally play an instrumental role, amplifying small, isolated events involving few people into full-scale episodes affecting hun\u00ad dreds or thousands. Eventually, the same media typically help to extinguish the very episodes they initially fostered by report\u00ad ing accounts that discuss their psychological nature, often ridi\u00ad culing those who persist in holding such beliefs.

The radio and press were not only responsible for the throngs of participants but also conditioning them to expect a spiritual event (Tumin and Feldman 1955). Medalia and Larsen (1958) concluded that the Washington state press were instrumental in spreading claims that atomic fallout from highly publicized Pacific bomb testing in 1954 was pitting windshields near Seattle. Jacobs (1965) also noted the key press role in his examination of erroneous claims that a mani\u00ad acal slasher was roaming Taiwan in 1956. Bartholomew and Howard (1998) found that press speculation about claims of the worlds first piloted heavier-than-air flying machine trig\u00ad gered a massive wave of imaginary airship sightings around the world between 1896 to 1913 in the United States, England, and New Zealand (see \"The Airship Hysteria of 1896-97,\" by Robert Bartholomew, SKEPTICAL INQUIRER, 14[2], Winter 1990). During another sighting wave in the Pacific Northwest in 1947, newspaper reporters coined the term \"flying saucer,\" sparking a global spate of similar reports (Strentz 1970). More recently, the press has been blamed in spreading psychogenic illness symptoms by publishing false accounts of poison gas attacks in tense ethnic conflicts in both Palestine and Kosovo (Radovanovic 1995). The \"Phantom Anesthetist\" of Mattoon The case of the mad gasser began about 11 P.M. Friday, September 1, 1944, as Aline Kearney lay in bed reading the newspaper. She was a young housewife whose husband was driving a cab that night in Mattoon, a small city of about 17,000 residents in eastern Illinois. They had a son and two daughters, including three-year-old Dorothy Ellen, who was sleeping in their bed. Also staying with the Kearneys was Alines sister, Martha Reedy, whose husband was in the war. Suddenly, Aline smelled a sweet odor that made her sick. She was not able to move, her legs paralyzed. At some point, Dorothy Ellen also became sick from the odor. Mrs. Kearney yelled for her sister, who said she smelled the odor coming from an open bedroom window and contacted a neighbor, Mrs. Earl Robertson, who called police. The police searched and found nothing. Mrs. Kearney recovered in about thirty minutes. Her husband heard of the incident and rushed home, arriving about 12:30 A.M., upon which he said he saw a prowler at the bedroom window. Police were again called but found nothing. The whole family then left to stay with a rela\u00ad tive elsewhere that night. Mattoon's only major paper, the Daily Journal-Gazette (hereafter referred to as the Gazette) reported the incident on page 1 the next evening with a six-column headline, \"Anesthetic Prowler' on Loose.\" Two subheads under the Kearney and Daughter First Victims\" and \"Both Recover; Robber Fails to Get Into Home.\" Typical symptoms in this and other reports that were to follow included lightheadedness, paralysis, upset stomach, and vom\u00ad iting, and followed the perception of a sickly sweet odor. All either recovered that night or the next day. On the night of September 5, Mrs. Carl Cordes picked up a small folded cloth on her porch, saw a wet spot, smelled it and was overcome by an odor. \"It was a feeling of paralysis,\" she told the Gazette (September 6, 1944, p. 1). \"My husband had to help me into the house and soon my lips were swollen and the roof of my mouth and my throat burned. I began to spit blood and my husband called a physician. It was more than two hours before I began to feel normal again.\" For the next week, more and more reports of gassings were reported. Other newspapers began picking up on the story by September 6, and almost daily reports in the Gazette, Chicago Tribune, Chicago Herald-American, Champaign News-Gazette, and (Springfield) Illinois State Journal heightened awareness of the mad gasser nationwide. Joining the hunt for the mad gasser were the Illinois State Police, which sent five squad cars and ten officers, two FBI agents, and groups of armed citizens roaming the city. A group of fifty armed farmers, members of the Anti- Theft Association, also roamed the city. Meanwhile, the harried Mattoon police, headed by skeptical police chief C. Eugene Cole, received veiled criticism from a September 8 Gazette edi\u00ad torial about their initial doubts that a prowler existed. As the police sped off to each new call about a mad gasser incident, armed citizens and farmers quickly followed. Police Commissioner Thomas Wright began ordering officers to arrest the chasers. One woman intending to protect herself loaded her soldier-husband's shotgun and blew a hole in her kitchen wall. Another sighting of demon-like eyes at a woman's bedroom window turned out to be a cat. A woman in the midst of a movie theater audience screamed that she was hit by gas although no one around her was affected! A few sus\u00ad pects were questioned, including a high school student playing a prank on a woman, but no arrests were made. By September 14, gassing reports had stopped for good. In all there were at least three dozen reported victims, more than 100 if seventy in a roaming group claiming to be hit by the smell of gas are included. No prowler was ever identified or arrested, no physical evidence presented (the Cordes's cloth tested negative at a state crime lab for poison gas residue), and there was no medical substantiation of a gas being used. In fact, none of the victims ever reported having eye problems from the alleged gas, despite the fact that if it was a poisonous gas, the eyes would certainly be affected. Memory Reconstruction and Embellishment The Mattoon Gazette practically created the entire mad gasser scare. We know that the first few gassing reports were not As the police sped off to each new call about a mad gasser incident, armed citizens and farmers quickly followed. 52 July/August 2002 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER taken seriously by police. This was noted in a September 8 Gazette editorial criticizing police who had not taken Aline Kearney seriously. Nor did they place much credence in the three reports that quickly followed by residents who reported \"gassings\" only after learning of the Kearney case. According to the Gazette, police concluded that these early reports were \"just imagination.\" They did not begin to become concerned until about September 5, after Mrs. Cordes found the strange cloth on her porch. But this police skepticism is not reflected in the early press reports in the early stages. On Saturday, September 2, the Gazette carried the first report on the inci\u00ad dent: \"Anesthetic Prowler on Loose.\" Not only was the gasser's existence treated as absolute fact, but there was an implication that there may be more gassings to follow. The sub-headline read: \"Mrs. Kearney and Daughter First Victims . . . Robber Fails to get into Home.\" Sensationalism by the Gazette prompted a series of retro\u00ad spective gassing reports that supposedly had occurred before or during Mrs. Kearneys \"attack.\" In reporting these cases, there is no hint of police skepticism or of the possibility of the gasser being imaginary. Only after reading or hearing of the Gazette story did several local families report similar home attacks. Mrs. George Rider said that the gasser had struck her Prairie Avenue home about the same time Mrs. Kearney and her daughter were made ill. At about the same time, a few blocks from Mrs. Rider, a woman and her children awoke and began vomiting. It was later assumed that the gasser had been there. Mr. and Mrs. Orban Raef of Grant Avenue said that the night before Mrs. Kearney was gassed, they were asleep at 3 A.M. when fumes came through the bedroom window. Both awoke and experienced \"the same feeling of paralysis' and felt unweii for about ninety minutes. Curiously, friends staying at the house and sleeping in another room reported no ill effects. Finally, Mrs. Olive Brown on 22nd Street told police that several months earlier, she and her daughter had been gassed, but did not report the incident thinking no one would believe them. These incidents were men\u00ad tioned in the next Gazette article about the gasser on September 5 (\"Anesthetic Prowler' Covers City\"). The newspaper was not printed on Sundays and holidays. Smith (1994, 35) states because there were gassing reports prior to Mrs. Kearney's on September 1, and they occurred late at night, it is \"very unlikely that word of the incidents could have spread so quickly. As they were not reported in the news\u00ad paper until two days later, they simply had to be real events.\" Smith (1994, 39) himself admits that, \"1 am a physicist, not a psychologist.\" He makes no mention of studies on the fallibil\u00ad ity of human memory and perception (see Loftus and Ketcham 1991). These earlier reports are dubious. At the time of the supposed gassings, no one reported these incidents to police, bothered to contact friends or relatives to share their concern or even fled their house. Imagine that you suspect someone has sprayed poison gas into your home, making you and your family ill. You experience dizziness, burning lips, vomiting, and partial limb paralysis. It was well-known that poison gas could cause permanent disabilities or even prove lethal. And what do these pre-September 1 \"gas victims\" do? They remain in the house and soon go back to sleep without telling a soul! This behavior only makes sense if, after learning of the mad gasser, these \"victims\" began redefining recent ambiguous incidents during which they had noticed a strange smell and embellished upon it. This brings to mind a story discussed by UFO investigator Philip Klass (1974, 283-284). Early on the evening of June 27, 1959, the Reverend William Gill and a small group watched an illuminated object in the sky near Boianai, Papua New Guinea. They became excited after thinking they could see human-like figures waving back at them. The exchange of waves continued and a flashlight was turned on and off toward the \"craft,\" which seemed to respond by moving in a pendu\u00ad lum fashion. With the object still in view, and having wit\u00ad nessed what he was certain was an alien spaceship for only about thirty minutes, what did Father Gill and the group do at this potentially historic juncture in history? He and the entire group went to dinner! They resumed watching at 7 o'clock. This makes for an exciting story, but human memory does not recall events as they happened, but as we think they happened. Often the details get changed after the fact. It brings to mind the saying, \"The older I get, the better I was.\" If we had been convinced an alien craft were hovering nearby, we would likely have called the police and every friend and rel\u00ad ative, and told them to get there\u2014fast. Such stories sound exciting after the event, but logic and common sense suggest otherwise. We certainly would not have gone to dinner. Press Reconstruction Let us re-examine the report by Mrs. Kearney in the Gazette on September 2. Despite being quoted at length, neither she nor her sister mentioned any prowler. Her sister mentioned only an open window. Mrs. Kearney is quoted saying that her sister contacted the neighbor, Mrs. Earl Robertson, who called police. The newspaper then indicated that Mr. Robertson searched the yard and neighborhood \"but could find no trace of the prowler. Police also searched without success.\" After being notified of the incident, Mr. Kearney arrived home about 12:30 A.M. and saw a prowler who was \"tall, dressed in dark clothing and wore a tight fitting cap.\" He gave chase but the \"prowler\" escaped. Not until Mr. Kearney arrives is any person identified as being at the bedroom window. In the article's lead and a fol\u00ad lowing reference to Mrs. Kearney's parched and burned lips from \"whatever was used by the prowler,\" the unidentified newspaper reporter conjectures that there is a prowler spraying gas through the bedroom window. After quoting Mrs. Kearney, the reporter then refers to Mr. Robertson, the police, and Mr. Kearney, who is reported as seeing a man at the window. That sighting, though, was for the second incident. Apparently, all involved assumed or reinterpreted the first incident as one caused by a prowler spraying an anesthetic substance. The \"anesthetic prowler\" was thus a creation of the Gazette by combining the first incident involving Mrs. Kearney's paralysis and an odor with Mr. Kearney's alleged sighting of a prowler in the second incident. A close reading of this initial SKEPTICAL INQUIRER July/August 2002 53 public report shows that no one involved is quoted as saying that an \"anesthetic prowler\" was seen. That phrase is an inven\u00ad tion of the headline writer. In addition, the \"anesthetic prowler\" now conveys the impression of retrospective rational\u00ad ization, which was also evident in the next three reports of a \"prowler\" by the previously mentioned Rider, Raef, and Brown families. The Gazette then immediately added fuel to the fire by suggesting that there would be more victims; the subhead under that first headline was, \"Mrs. Kearney and Daughter First Victims.\" The headline was \"'Anesthetic Prowler' on Loose.'\" The other newspapers soon followed with coverage, and the whole country was being made aware of the \"mad gasser of Mattoon.\" Context: The Poison Gas Scare By the fall of 1944, with an Allied victory seeming inevitable, the fear of gas attacks was evident. Even though poison gas was not known to have been used in World War II for fear of retribution that could devastate civilians, during the year of the \"gassings\" in 1944, there were no less that 112 articles in The New York Times Index under the heading \"chemical war\u00ad fare.\" Dozens of popular and scientific periodicals around this time also discussed the poison gas peril in publications such as Newsweek, Popular Science, and The American Journal of Public Health (Lindley 1943; Scott 1944; Sanders 1945). As the tide of World War II turned increasingly in favor of the Allies, so did concern that desperate German commanders might resort to gas warfare (Marshall 1943). In fact, the Allies were so concerned that the Germans might use poison gas during their June 6, 1944, D-Day invasion of Normandy that they had a plan to retaliate within forty-eight hours with two bombing raids of 400 planes each, all loaded with chemical weapons designed to hit selected targets (Brown 1968). Gas warfare expert Frederic Brown (1968, 244) states that D-Day was the \"most dangerous period for German [gas] initia\u00ad tion\"\u2014a credible threat that was widely discussed in the press during latter 1944. The mad gasser appeared just two and a half months after D-Day. There was even discussion as to whether the United States should be the first to use gas. This view received a firestorm ot criticism by many readers and commentators, fearful that the Axis powers would think that the use of gas was imminent, and initiate a first strike. Following editorials favoring the idea of using gas first in The Chicago Tribune, The New York Daily News, and the Washington Times-Herald, Norman Cousins (1944) branded their editors as \"incredibly irresponsible.\" About the time of the first gassing report in Mattoon by Aline Kearney, newspapers in Champaign, Chicago, and Springfield carried wire service articles about gas use. The August 30 Champaign News-Gazette included a page 1 article: \"Believe Nazis Prepared To Use Gas.\" On August 31 the Chicago Herald-American had one on page 2 (\"Report Nazis Plan Poison Gas Attack\") and another report in the September 1 issue on page 2 (\"Allies Ready If Nazis Use Gas\"); and an Associated Press article in the (Springfield) Illinois State Journal on September 1 (\"Unlikely Gas To Be Used In War\") 54 July/August 2002 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER appeared on the day of Mrs. Kearney's alleged gassing. The article stated: \"If Nazi extremists bent on ruling or ruining should employ gas against civilian populations in a bitter end resistance, the Allies would be in a position through air strength to drench German cities. . . . Recurrent rumors diat the Germans are preparing to initiate gas warfare bring no offi\u00ad cial reaction here.\" While Mattoon's Gazette did not carry news of the potential German use of gas, knowledge of the threat, whether perceived as domestic or foreign, would have been widespread. Many state newspapers were read by Mattoon citizens, as Johnson (1945) pointed out, and the gas fears were almost certainly dis\u00ad cussed on radio and by word-of-mouth. In addition, during that same time, a Nazi prisoner had escaped from Camp Ellis in the Mattoon area and was reportedly seen in the city (\"Hunt Escaped Nazi Here,\" Gazette, August 31, 1944). He was cap\u00ad tured the following night in another city. If this were not enough, at the same time there was a wave of robberies in Mattoon (\"Two Homes Entered,\" Gazette, August 31, 1944; \"Robbery Wave Continues,\" Gazette, September 1, 1944). The Shift Toward Terrorism The \"mad gasser\" was triggered by a confluence of factors: sen\u00ad sational press coverage, ignorance of human perceptual falli\u00ad bility and memory reconstruction, fear of Nazi poison gas attacks, an escaped Nazi in the city, and a robbcry/break-in wave. It is essential to understand the overall context of what happened in Mattoon within the social and historical context as it was experienced by Mattoonites and reported by the media at the time. People of the period lived under the specter of massive poison gas attacks on civilian targets. While cer\u00ad tainly unusual, given the war-scare context, the case of the mad gasser of Mattoon is not so bizarre after all. Indeed, dur\u00ad ing the twentieth century a strange odor was the most com\u00ad mon trigger of epidemic hysteria in both job and school set\u00ad tings (Olkinuora 1984; Bartholomew and Sirois 1996). It was a sign of the times, which were dominated by occupational safety legislation and environmental fears. Episodes such as the \"mad gasser\" may be set to recur. In Japan during 1995, the use of Sarin nerve gas on the Tokyo subway by the Aum Shinrikyo cult killed twelve people. It also triggered a wave of mass collapses from pseudo-attacks after commuters detected strange smells (Wessely 1995). Since the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States, America has experienced an upsurge in reports of mass hyste\u00ad ria and social delusion. In one case, a man was subdued by police after squirting a mysterious spray at a Maryland subway station. Thirty-five persons in the vicinity were treated for symptoms ranging from nausea to sore throats. The substance turned out to be a common window cleaner (Lellman 2001). Similar episodes of mass psychogenic illness prompted by the chemical and bioterrorism scare were reported from California THE MAD GASSER OF MATTOON Continued on page 58 BOOK REVIEWS Truth Really Is Stranger Than Fiction\u2014and More Entertaining ROBERT A. BAKER Real-Life X-Files: Investigating the Paranormal By Joe Nickell. University Press of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky. 2001. 326 pp. ISBN 0-8131-2210-4. Cloth, $27.50. Anyone who has ever watched and enjoyed an episode of the long-running TV series The X- Files will find Nickell's book even more entertaining and delightful. There is a major difference between the TV tales and the stories in Nickell's work, how\u00ad ever. While the X-Files are fiction, Nickell's accounts are true. Whoever said that the truth is both stranger and more entertaining than fiction describes this book exactly. The cases that Nickell investigates are not only as exciting as the show but they are also much more satisfying if one is also a lover of myster\u00ad ies and enjoys watching a first-rate mind systematically track down and expose the fakirs and mountebanks who attempt to mystify and deceive us. Consisting of forty-seven short chap\u00ad ters or investigations, the work is not only an antidote to anyone infected with belief in the paranormal or supernatural but it is also a mini-education in how to go about successfully investigating and clarifying claims of haunted houses, UFO appearances, mysterious lights, encounters with the dead, spontaneous human combustion, alien abductions, crop circles, alleged psychics and vision\u00ad aries, weeping statues and stigmata, and miracle workers of various kinds. Nickell, a former private detective, professional magician, and an authority Robert A. Baker is professor emeritus in psychology at the University of Kentucky. on the detection of forged documents, brings this training and experience to bear in his investigations. For cases in which Nickell's broad and deep experience does not suffice he invents ingenious new approaches to solve the mysteries he faces. Opposed to the arm\u00ad chair and \"debunking\" approaches in all his investigations, Nickell uses a \"hands- on\" approach, supplementing most of his investigations with explanatory drawings and photographs. Covering a period of well over thirty years, none of the invesdgations in this book have been andiologized before. Others have never been reported so fully, and regular readers of Nickell's columns in SKEPTICAL INQUIRER and Skeptical Briefs will be delighted with some of the new material and the results of his appearances on various TV talk shows. In this regard one of the most amus\u00ad ing incidents of all was Nickell's con\u00ad frontation with an alleged clairvoyant on the infamous Jerry Springer Show. The so-called psychic claims to be able to \"read\" the contents ol a locked refrig\u00ad erator he had never seen before. Though the \"psychic\" appeared to be quite suc\u00ad cessful in demonstrating psychic abili\u00ad ties, he was totally incapable of passing Nickell's simple test of reading a three- letter word on a card in a sealed enve\u00ad lope. The verbal exchange between Nickell, the alleged psychic, and Springer is hilarious. Also delightful is Nickell's exposure of the scam artists in The Gypsies' \"Great Trick.\" Nickell's version of this impres\u00ad sive \"fooler\" has been shown on the Discovery channel several times. Nickell's investigation of the notorious Flatwoods UFO monster is anodier classic example of human credulity and demonstrates how effective a little suggestion can be when naive and untrained observers con\u00ad front the unknown. These unusual and mysterious detec\u00ad tive stories are suffused with the author's wit and engaging sense of humor. As he notes in his introduction, \"I joke that I have been in more SKEPTICAL INQUIRER July/August 2002 55 BOOK REVIEWS haunted houses than Casper and have even caught a few 'ghosts.'\" Nickell has never shied away from get\u00ad ting himself personally involved in some of the more daring and adventurous aspects of die cases he's studying. He has, for example, inflicted \"stigmata\" on him\u00ad self with a knife, put sharp crystals under his eyelids, walked across a twenty-five- foot bed of fiery coals, and he has even appeared\u2014not once\u2014but twice on The Jerry Springer Show! If this isn't a display of the limits of human courage this reviewer doesn't know what is! Above all, these investigations are predicated on a rational, scientific approach and, in his words, \"since proving a negative is difficult (often impossible), the burden of proof must In the town of Nanyuki, Kenya, located on the equator, a local man named Peter McLeary performs an intriguing demonstration for tourists. He takes them to a line drawn on the ground (the putative location of the equator) and drains a pan of water on either side of it. The water flows clock\u00ad wise when the pan is north of the line, and counterclockwise when the pan is south of the line. McLeary explains that this is due to Earth's rotation, and then collects tips from the tourists. Those tips may start drying up if some of the tourists read Bad Astronomy, a lively, informative guide to astronomy- related errors and deceptions. As Philip Plait explains, Earth's rotation does divert moving objects in opposite direc- Kenneth Silber is a writer based in New York City. fall on whomever advances the claim. In addition, the maxim that 'extraordi\u00ad nary proof,' must apply, meaning that evidence must be commensurate with the extent of a claim. The principle of 'Occam's razor' also applies; it holds that the simplest tenable explana\u00ad tion\u2014the one requiring the fewest assumptions\u2014is to be preferred as most likely correct.\" Nickell has followed these principles and has applied them in all of the inves\u00ad tigations recounted in this book. Readers familiar with Nickell's other books will not want to miss this one, and those readers who have never been so fortunate as to have encountered this master of \"explaining the bizarre\" are in for a treat! tions in the northern and southern hemispheres, a phenomenon known as the Coriolis effect. However, the effect is significant only over large distances (as with the movement of hurricanes, say) and not, as commonly supposed, in toi\u00ad lets and kitchen sinks. As for McLeary, he achieves an effect by spinning the pan as he turns to face the audience (but he gets it backwards, since the Coriolis effect would make water in the northern hemisphere spin counterclockwise). Bad Astronomy is the first in a planned series of Bad Science books to be pub\u00ad lished by John Wiley & Sons; the next installment will be Bad Medicine. Plait, an astronomer at California's Sonoma State University, is the creator of a useful Web site called Badastronomy.com, which also delves into wrong ideas involving space and celestial objects. Bad Astronomy deals with diverse topics including the ineffi-cacy of astrology, the non-dependence of egg balancing on the spring equinox, and the dubious claims of companies that offer to have a star named after you or a loved one. Did NASA fake the Moon landings? Plait exposes the hollowness of the argu\u00ad ments put forward for such an elaborate conspiratorial hoax. As hoax theorists point out, no stars are visible in the black lunar sky in photographs taken by the astronauts. As Plait explains, the stars were too faint to show up in the short-exposure photos, which were taken in daylight when the lunar surface is brightly lit by the Sun. By the way, he asks, if NASA had taken the photos on an expensive fake set, wouldn't the agency's Soviet rivals have called atten\u00ad tion to something as basic as a failure to put in stars? [For a fuller account, see \"Fox Special Questions Moon Landing But Not Its Own Credulities,\" SI, May/June 2001.] Did Venus emerge from Jupiter, pass by the Earth, and cause the \"miracles\" written about in the Bible, as theorized by psychoanalyst Immanuel Velikovsky in the 1950s? Plait highlights the many problems with this theory. If Venus was ejected from Jupiter, why are the two planets' compositions so different? Why are Jupiter's moons still circling the giant planet in unperturbed orbits? If Venus passed within hundreds of miles of Earth, as Velikovsky asserted, then it would have literally filled the sky (a spectacle the ancients did not note). Moreover, it's hard to reconcile such an event with such facts as that our Moon is still in orbit and that humans survived all this. Plait is adept not only at untangling the convolutions of bogus theories but also at explaining everyday phenomena of the physical world. He clears up com\u00ad mon confusion as to why Earth has sea\u00ad sons and why the Moon has phases, and may spare parents some embarrassment in fielding questions from their kids about why the sky is blue. Bad Astronomy is a powerful antidote to public befuddle- ment about the universe around us.

Basic Books, New York, 2001. ISBN 0465022723. ETERNAL FRONTIER TIM FLAK The Eternal Frontier: An Ecological History of North America and Its Peoples by Tim Flannery. Atlantic Monthly Press, New York, 2001. ISBN 0871137895. Throughout human history, weather and weather changes have been a source of supernat\u00ad ural speculation. Extreme weather, beneficent or malign, has long been seen as a manifestation of the will of the Gods rn reward or punish humankind More recently, weather and climate have become sources of equally fantastic futurist doomsday scenarios as well. Look more closely, however, and all this superstition should not be unexpected. It is surprising how little we know, empiri\u00ad cally, about climate and human history. It might be said that angels lurk where scientists have yet to tread. The two books reviewed here both aim to remedy our ignorance. Both argue that climate is a product of lawful global processes that can be analyzed and understood and that man, while having distinct advantages over animals in being able to adapt to cli\u00ad mate changes through technological means, is still ultimately prey to these forces. And both provide examinations of climates relationship to civilization in die past that are compelling and, ulti\u00ad mately, unsettling. Despite their similarities, diese are Dr. Erik Strommen is a developmental psychologist and longtime SKEPTICAL INQUIRER subscriber. two very different books. Fagan's is a detailed examination of \"recent\" history, a dramatic cooling then warming trend that took place during a five-to-six-hun- dred-year period lasting from 1300 to 1850 or so. Culling data from medieval and Enlightenment-era records in Western and Northern Europe, his goal is to show that the effects of climate change on human society can be con\u00ad cretely measured. He correlates the cool\u00ad ing documented from natural sources like tree rings and ice cores with human records of events like droughts, crop fail\u00ad ures, and changes in seafaring routes. He then attempts to relate these climate- driven events to larger political and cul\u00ad tural changes. Fagan argues, for example, that prim\u00ad itive French agricultural practices pro\u00ad duced mass starvation when crops failed in the cold years and that this starvation was a contributing factor in the French Revolution. Thus, he reasons, climate change was a causal factor in one of his\u00ad tory's most dramatic events. You don't have to accept this oddly indirect logic, however, to enjoy the book because there are so many other interesting con\u00ad crete examples of climate impact. I found the strange story of England's wineries to be the most strik\u00ad ing. Once a major supplier of wine to Europe, the cold spell led to the com\u00ad plete collapse of viniculture in the British Isles. Only recently have grapes been re-established there again, as the world has gotten warmer. The weakness of this book is that the many details, while intriguing, end up as a sort of a hodgepodge. Fagan relies on die sheer bulk of evidence to make his case. While many of his examples are insightful, others are not and this weak\u00ad ens his argument. The unevenness of the data aside, Fagan has pointed the way to re-examining many historical records for climate research purposes and has gath\u00ad ered much of them in this book for the first time. Flannery's book takes a much broader time frame and geographical reference. He examines climate not over a few cen\u00ad turies but over millions of years\u2014the last 20,000 or so in particular\u2014and he is concerned exclusively with the North American continent. This is a very infor\u00ad mative book, well written and thought\u00ad fully presented. It starts with a review of the unique geological history that has made North America an \"eternal fron\u00ad tier,\" constantly invaded throughout his\u00ad tory by newcomers of all kinds from other continents. Flannery describes how North America's geography makes it unique in its extremes of weather: Deep winters and baking summers are a norm nowhere else on the planet. This same geography serves to amplify the impact of global heating and cooling trends, which have contributed to periodic extinctions on the continent. When it comes to the climate's effects on man in the Americas, Flannery makes a strong case that the \"mysteriously rapid\" rise and fall of ancient pan-American societies, so breathlessly attributed to alien migra\u00ad tions or other silliness by New Agers, actually reflects the impact of climate changes combined with environmen\u00ad tally unsustainable farming and cul\u00ad tural practices. As this analysis suggests, his discussion of human interaction with the environment is unsentimen\u00ad tal. He makes a strong case that the SKEPTICAL INQUIRER July/August 2O02 57 BOOK REVIEWS first human immigrants to North America, who did not farm and whose major artifacts are stone spearheads, lit\u00ad erally hunted most of the continent's large animals of all kinds into extinc\u00ad tion, inflicting serious damage on the ecology of the continent that remains to this day. Flannery tries to be upbeat, but his assessment of North America's future is disturbing. European colonization has only exacerbated the damage done to the continent's ecosystems. He believes that large animals must be reintroduced to restore \"balance\" to ecosystems. He also warns that North Americans are rapidly consuming the continent's fresh water THE MAD GASSER OF MATTOON From page 54 (Becerra and Malnic 2001) to the Philippines.

Indiana University Press, 601 N. Morton Street, Bloomington, IN 47404- 3797. 2001. ISBN 0-253- 33929-4. 510 pp. $49.95. hardcover. A distinguished professor cmerita of folklore at Indiana University provides a scholarly descriptive and analytical study of the legend, the most prolific and characteristic form of folklore in contemporary Western civilization. 1 he legends concerns are universal and eter\u00ad nal, touching upon the most sensitive areas of our existence. This is why, she says, stories about supernatural encounters, possession, miracles, evil spirits, monsters, and prophetic dreams continue to proliferate in the urban/industrial world. Legends are today communicated not only orally, face to face, but also in die press, on radio and television, on Web sites, and by e-mail. True to the tradi\u00ad tion of die folklorist. Degh does not explore occult phenomena themselves but examines the world of die legend diat surrounds them. As she says, \"As far as legends are concerned, it is irrelevant whether they are true. Most likely some of them are true, odiers are erroneous, and odiers are deliberate distortions....\" She adds: \"We will have to walk die slippery paths of other disciplines such as sociology, psychol\u00ad ogy, semiotics, theology, criminology, cultural history, literature, and what are known sum\u00ad marily as die occult sciences.\" Degh says there were times when people could distinguish fan\u00ad tasy from reality. \"Our time is increasingly becoming a legend-time in which reality inter\u00ad mingles with unreality, without the capability of distinguishing one from the other.\" Shockingly Close to the Truth!

Prometheus Books, 59 John ISBN 1-57392-991-3. 371 pp. article \"Gray Barker's Book of Bunk\" in our May/June 2002 issue, you got a little flavor of what to expect from James Moseley. Moseley, longtime editor of the underground newsletter Saucer Smear, has always been pan participant in, and part acerbic observer of, the sometimes wacky, weird, off-the-wall claims and behavior of saucer devotees and proponents. He wants to believe, but he's seen a lot of strange people come and go. This is billed as die \"first-ever insider social history of urology.\" Its approach is exemplified by die tide of Moseley's prologue \"The Truth Is Out There, Maybe.\" The tone is pure Moseley: candid, anecdotal, revelatory, tongue-and-cheek, willing to expose die pas\u00ad sions, foibles, and foolhardiness of, in his words, \"fifty years of UFOs, ufologists, ufology, and 'ufoology.'\" \"This isn't a scholarly work.\" he warns at the outset. It's a very personal rec\u00ad ollection. ... So we haven't larded it up and odicr stigmata of die scholar at work.\" The organization, in five parts, is chronological: \"The 1950s: SAU.C.E.R.S. and Kidnappers from Babblegate,\" and \"The 1990s and Beyond: Virtual Reality\" with its opening chapter, \"Trust No One (Especially Your Abductologist).\" SKCPTK M rni: Skeptical Philosophy for Everyone.

Are knowledge claims\u2014and the criteria for making such claims\u2014ever really valid? Throughout die history of Western thought, great thinkers have produced theories designed to forestall or refute philosophical skepticism, thereby seeking to demonstrate that knowledge claims are meaningful. Two philosophy pro\u00ad fessors review each major theory of philoso\u00ad phy chronologically and by subject areas: metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, political philosophy, and philosophy of religion. Within each subject they discuss how die skeptical challenges gave rise to new philo\u00ad sophical positions. They conclude with a debate about whether the doubts expressed by skeptics can ultimately be refuted. \u2014Kendrick Frazier and Benjamin Radford SKEPTICAL INQUIRER July/August 2002 59 FOLLOW-UP More on Vardaman's Microletters RICHARD CARRIER Several observations must be com\u00ad municated to SKEPTICAL INQUIRER readers regarding my previous article \"Pseudohistory in Jerry Vardaman's Magic Coins\" (5/26:2, March/April 2002). First, Vardaman passed away in November of 2000. I directed my work at his claims, still appearing in print (both John McRay and Lee Strobel cite him), not at the man, whom I believed was never challenged while alive. But it appears he was once, in a less-known antiquities journal (David Hendlin, \"Theory of Secret Inscriptions on Coins is Disputed,\" The Celator 5:3, March 1991, 28-32). Sent to me by a kind reader, this included a response by Vardaman in which he added still fur\u00ad ther references to evidence of ordinary graffiti or inscription as \"support\" for his thesis, an argument I refuted. The rest of his response was mere challenge and assertion. Hendlin, for his part, cor\u00ad roborates some of my observations and adds some of his own, drawing on his vast experience in numismatic science. And he had the benefit of interrogating Vardaman. His article is an excellent addition to mine. Second, several letters from readers unfairly questioned Vardaman's creden\u00ad tials. According to the Gale Database of Contemporary Authors he received a Ph.D. from Baylor University in 1974, after aTh.D. from Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in 1958 (he was an ordained Baptist minister). He was a genuine field archaeologist and held a professorship in religion at Tarleton State College in Stephenville, Texas, Richard Carrier is a doctoral candidate in ancient history at Columbia University, specializing in the history of Greco-Roman science and religion. Figure 1. Damascene Coin Blow-up A W . \\ ' H -4 5 \u00bb Blow-up B followed by instructorships at two Baptist seminaries, before receiving his position at Cobb in 1972. Third, Joe D. Seger, current director of the Cobb Institute of Archaeology at Mississippi State University, wishes to clarify that the \"professional staff\" and col\u00adleagues of Vardaman at the Institute had fully disassociated themselves from his micro-letter theories long before his retirement in 1993.\" Though I made no claims or inferences about their views or involvement in this affair, it should be noted mat Seger's statement is not backed up by any public document to my knowledge, and when asked for articles where Institute scholars criticized or dis\u00ad avowed Vardaman's theory, none were provided. I also received a private com\u00ad munication from Professor Stephen Williams, author of Fantastic Archaeology (1991) and a Harvard emeritus, who apparently was one of a few outside experts called in by MSU in the 1970s to evaluate Vardaman's claims. The consul\u00ad tants gave a resounding condemnation, but the only action taken appears to have been the removal of Vardaman as director of the Cobb Institute in 1981. He remained a professor tJiere, and nothing was published on the matter. All this was in essence confirmed by Seger. It would appear that MSU was embarrassed by Vardaman but was happy to sweep the whole affair under the rug. Fourth, die curators of die British Museum informed me that many of die plates in Burnett were made from plaster- casts, not genuine photographs. So on a recent trip to England I studied die coin in question and arranged for new pho\u00ad tographs. As we would not want to mis\u00ad lead our readers, it is fitting to pre\u00ad sent what I can personally vouch for as a genuine photo, remarking on what I observed under a magnifying glass and digital microscope. I can confirm there are no \"microletters\" on the coin (figure 1). The photo used in my original SKEPTICAL INQUIRER article faithfully indi\u00ad cates die nature and extent of the coin's wear, but it is clear from die new photo- 60 July/August 2002 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER FOLLOW-UP graph how a delusional mind could be led to see microletters in grit, oxidation, and numerous cracks and abrasions. Indeed, I observed the coin to be heavily patinated. Most of the scratchy lines and squiggles visible here are the green patina of oxidized bronze, not a part of the original coin as cast. I took great care under high magnifi\u00ad cation to try and see how Vardamans let\u00ad ters might be interpreted, but to no avail. There is nothing even resembling what he claims, despite ample fuel for the imagina\u00ad tion. All the observations made in my original article remain correct, including the fact that the key area of the coin is completely smooth from wear, and thus could not have microletters even if they were once there (blow-up A). To be fair, elsewhere on the coin there is the clear appearance of the let\u00ad ter \"M\" (\"W\" was not invented until relatively recent times), a crack filled wirh bright green patina (blow-up B). This is the only thing that looks like a letter and that Vardaman did indeed represent in his drawings as a vague squiggle. So Vardamans drawings were indeed based on a photograph or per\u00ad sonal viewing of the coin, and not just wholly fictional. But this \"letter\" is an irregular zigzag, a random crack carved out by rust, a common outcome of impurities in the coining process per\u00ad mitting accelerated oxidation (rampant rust-based cracking is pronounced on the coin's other face). It is certainly not part of any word, and there is nothing like this anywhere else that accords with Vardamans drawings. Finally, many wrote me to ask whether my claim that 6 A.D. for Jesus s birth \"is the most credible year to date\" was a mistake for 6 B.C., as most refer\u00ad ences claim a date of 4 B.C. But experts have long known the Gospel of Matthew sets the date around 6 B.C. (or no later than 4 B.D.), while Luke sets the date at 6 A.D. However, if either Gospel contains any history, it is far more likely Luke than Matthew, for a number of reasons, not the least being that Luke alone writes like a historian and actually attempts to date events by reference to office-holders, while Matthew does not, but instead litters his account with fan\u00ad tastic stories begging credulity. So an objective assessment of the two conflict\u00ad ing sources leads us to Luke, not Matthew. The reason Matthew is ever preferred is largely ideological, not his\u00ad torical: e.g., it is impossible to fit Matthew's story to Luke's chronology, but possible (if you invent some external facts) to force Luke to fit Matthew. Thus, to preserve Biblical consistency one must side with Matthew. But the premises here are that the Gospels can\u00ad not contradict each other and do not contain false data, premises no skeptic can accept. Abandon those premises, and the most credible date for the nativ\u00ad ity is A.D. 6.

Medicine Bigfoot Evidence Evaluated I thoroughly enjoyed Benjamin Radford's article about Bigfoot (March/April 2002). He summarized the evidence for and against Bigfoot in a succinct and objective manner, and I agreed wholeheartedly with his conclusions. However, there was one major piece of evidence\u2014or lack thereof\u2014 that he did not discuss: the lack of evolu\u00ad tionary antecedents. After all, a giant mammal like Bigfoot didn't just suddenly materialize out of the vacuum like a quantum fluctuation. The fos\u00ad sil record clearly demonstrates diat monkeys have been in the Americas since die Eocene, roughly 20 million years ago. But these mon\u00ad keys have remained relatively small, and largely confined to South America. V/c see no fossil record of transitional species leading up to an eight-foot tall, 500-pound hairy ape. Nada. Such a creature roaming the forests of North America must have evolved from other species. Surely, some of these transitional species would have left their mark in the fos\u00ad sil record. But no transitional species have been round, despite the enormous numbers of professional and amateur fossil hunters who have combed North America. The fact that we see no fossil record of creatures leading up to Bigfoot, and zero physical evidence for Bigfoot creatures today, leads to the inescapable conclusion that Bigfoot simply docs not exist. Robert Naeye, Editor Mercury magazine Astronomical Society of die Pacific San Francisco, California Benjamin Radford responds to Robert Naeye: I'm glad you liked my article, and you make an important point. Due to space constraints, I had to limit my discussion strictly to the main evidence offered in support of Bigfoot's existence. Different theories on Bigfoot (such as whether it is a paranormal entity) and non-evidence, such as the lack of evolutionary antecedents, are just as important but unfortunately could not fit. 1 am pleased to announce that I solved the problem of Bigfoot over thirty years ago. During a summer doing field geology in the Klamath Mountains, I soon noticed that every hamlet had a sign saying \"Welcome to Bigfoot Country.\" My partner and I con\u00ad cluded that Bigfoot was probably collecting royalties and living in a penthouse suite at the Mark Hopkins in San Francisco. Given the street people who were then (and now, for that matter) walking around in San Francisco, Bigfoot could probably wander around with\u00ad out drawing die slightest attention. Steven I. Dutch Professor, Natural and Applied Sciences University of Wisconsin- Green Bay Green Bay, Wisconsin 1 really enjoyed Benjamin Radford's article on Bigfoot. Radford's reasons for being skep tical of Bigfoot's existence are solid, but he overlooked one: Bigfoot believers can't seem to agree if the creature is merely some type of undiscovered animal or a paranormal entity with weird, almost superhuman, powers. A number of books were published in the 1970s exploring the latter view. These include Earth's Secret Inhabitants by D. Scott Rogo and Jerome Clark, Creatures of the Outer Edge by Clark and Loren Coleman, and Bigfoot by B. Ann Slate and Alan Berry. The Bigfoot stories recounted in these books differ significantly from the usual \"hairy, manlike being seen running through the woods\" reports that sometimes pop up in newspapers. In these books, Bigfoot appears in or near UFOs, becomes invisible, wears trousers, fails to leave tracks in fresh mud, is impervious to bullets, and so on. This \"para\u00ad normal Bigfoot\" is definitely more than just a flesh-and-blood animal unknown to science. The paranormal Bigfoot is out of fashion with most of today's Sasquatch hunters, but in the 1970s, when this view was considered cutting edge, Bigfoot sightings with paranor\u00ad mal features were common. This seems to me to be strong evidence that the mystery behind Bigfoot has a cultural, not biological, answer. Robert Boston Silver Spring, Maryland Yes, in fact see the following letter we received from perhaps the main proponent of Bigfoot paranormalism.\u2014EDITORS I've seen snippets of the new articles on Bigfoot, and after having done field work over thitty-six years, I agree that a physical Bigfoot animal simply is not there. But . . . due to personal contacts with them I do find that they are some form of manifested \"OOBE\" [out-of-body experience] event, and are temporary beings. Now this can be a new target for skeptics to shoot at. John-Erik Beckjord Director Sasquatch Research Project It is time to call a truce and look at how ama\u00ad teurs, scientists, hobbyists, academics, hunters, and skeptics can move forward together in search of valid evidence for or against Bigfoot/Sasquatch. Radford's article in SKEPTIC INQUIRER on hominology reinforces my thoughts that we are at a historical crossroad in which the seri\u00ad ous study of unknown primates can now begin. Recreationally and scientifically, Bigfoot-hunting is having a significant impact on our culture, as I will explore in a new book due out next year. . . . It took over fifty years ... for the first dead mountain gorilla to be brought back to science after it was rumored to be in east Africa, and for the first live panda to be extracted from Tibet after the first few were killed. It takes time to find animals. We must be patient. Dr. Bernard Heuvelmans, the father of cryptozoology who died last year, once wrote of the eyewitness accounts of giant lemurs in Africa. Today, they have been officially and scientifically described. There are other success stories in the field of primate biology. . . . The age of adventure is not over in primate cryptozoology, and Si's look at the subject merely reinforces this notion. There are always going to be fakes and hoaxes. Of course, it is just as silly to think these claims are valid as for us to assume that every footprint presented of a Sasquatch stomping through a farmer's back forty arc real. Bigfoot researchers are skeptics too. The vast majority of cases we investigate never get space in our articles, books, or conversations. In this realm, we are in agreement. The article uses two non-Bigfoot stories to criticize die time we spend on searching for SKEPTICAL INQUIRER July/August 2002 63 LETTERS TO THE EDITOR these unknown primates. But isn't this line of thinking like saying that anthropologists should get out of the study of humans because the Piltdown Man and Tasaday hoaxes have occurred? These hoaxes should not stop us, but only clarify our desire to be more true to the scientific method, as most serious Sasquatch researchers are\u2014in spite of the pranksters and troublesome fringe element. 1 see this is a time of maturing in the field, a time for resolve and insight. I wel\u00ad come the challenge of the SI article. The moment is upon us to stand shoulder to shoulder with skeptics and forge ahead, exploring what is out there, continuing the open-minded but critical search for tomor\u00ad row's surprises.

Prof., University of Southern Maine Portland, Maine www.lorcncoleman.com The Problem of Holism John Ruscio's disdain for holistic approaches (\"The Emptiness of Holism,\" March/April 2002) is so clear that I doubt his capacity for the very objectivity he claims that the con\u00ad demned approaches lack. Who but someone who wishes only to deride would allow his treatise to expand from a quote by a fictional character. Are we to assume that John Updike is a scientific authority disguised as a novelist? II not, were there not other more learned commentators to support his premise? In that same paragraph Ruscio illustrates his lack of objectivity by using a captious argument that allows only for the polar choices in a false dichotomy: if one would choose to treat a broken leg with a cast, one must (if one follows Ruscio's logic) reject \"holistic\" treatment options such as mag\u00ad nets, acupuncture, or nutritional supple\u00ad ments. Treating a fracture with a cast docs not in itself induce optimal healing, whereas nutritional supplements that help the body recover from the trauma of the injury may facilitate healing. The rational practitioner would potentially choose bodi of Ruscio's options: treating the leg to restore function and the person to promote health. Ruscio is so intent on the absolute con\u00ad demnation of holistic approaches that he deteriorates into sophistry. Rather than attack the approaches for which some evi\u00ad dence base exists, he chooses astrology\u2014an approach that all but the most lightheaded of practitioners would disdain. ... I agree with Ruscio that clinical method\u00ad ologies must be evidence based. Evidence, however, is accumulated over years of prac\u00ad tice. Ruscio's point of view is so prejudicial that it seems to preclude further inquiry. For him the jury is in. He wishes it to be so for us as well. . . . My greatest concern arises from years of experience with psychological practitioners who, like Ruscio, insist that the patient or client is nothing more than a constellation of features that can be understood with statisti\u00ad cal methodologies and profiles. Treatment then consists of interventions applied because \"science\" says they should work. When these interventions are unsuccessful, the blame is often assigned to the patient or client through the label \"non-compliant.\" While it is convenient and messy for the \"scientific\" practitioner to view each human being as unique, those with whom I have interacted over the years have expressed great apprecia\u00ad tion for my willingness to view them thus. Far from representing modern shaman\u00ad ism, holistic approaches simply attempt to compensate for the fact that, despite their scientific basis, current \"scientific\" method\u00ad ologies are not always successful, and, even when clinically effective, sometimes leave the patient with pain, suffering, or lifelong dis\u00ad ability. Do holistic methodologies need rig\u00ad orous testing and study? Yes. Should those that are wholly ineffective be exposed? Yes. Is Ruscio in danger of pitching out the baby with the bathwater? Yes. If you will allow me the license afforded Ruscio, Shakespeare's Hamlet said it best \"There are more things in heaven and earth ... than dreamt of in our philosophy.\" Or our science. Norman M. Council Associate Director Behavioral Counseling Sciences MCP/Hahnemann University Philadelphia, Pennsylvania John Ruscio loses me with several of the examples in his critique of holism. When a patient presents with a broken leg, the right solution may or may not be \"a cast and some crutches.\" Yes, the \"broader problem\" should be considered: Is the patient an infant? Then cue models of possible abuse. Is the patient elderly? Or a professional athlete perhaps, with a career riding on nuances of treatment? The variables and statistics for each context arc quite different, and for many areas defin\u00ad itive research doesn't exist. Regarding his next example, I do prefer treatment of \"the whole car.\" Adding oil when the oil light comes on may or may not be the right solution. Are the seals defective? Is the car still under warranty? Does the owner ever add oil? Does the owner know to shut the car off immediately after the light appears? The broader problem indeed requires a type of clinician with a feel for a spectrum of probabilities and unknowns, the assessment of which requires at least a mod\u00ad icum of induction. 1 don't mind calling \"holistic\" an approach that tries to surround a problem in these ways, with as much rigor and wit as is available. There seem to be many types of holism. Some arc indefensible, as the astrological materials he cites, but Ruscio wrongly lumps all types of holism together. I want the right kind of holistic doctor, and auto mechanic. I realize this is a difficult and quack-prone search, but all this article offers arc statisticians. Charles J. Palus Research Scientist Center for Creative Leadership palusc@leaders.ccl.org John Ruscio says \"undoubtedly\" the \"smartest course of action\" in the case of a car with a low oil warning light is to add oil. \"By contrast, holism is empty rhetoric.\" However, I would prefer a more holistic approach; examine the whole engine and find where the oil is leaking out. Neil Speirs Melbourne, Australia Kurtz on Science and Religion As a longtime reader of SI, I have to rank Paul Kurtz's article on religion and science (March/April 2002) as one of the best. The one area he might have added to his discus\u00ad sion concerns the evil done in the name of religion. Many critics cite this as one of the main reasons for rejecting religion. However, in the spirit of Kurtz's separation of issues, it would appear that religious zealotry is not essentially different from all its other fla\u00ad vors\u2014political, racial, ethnic, and so on. For those willing to become violent about their beliefs, any they have will do. His clear articulation of what is essential about religion has changed my attitude. In writing a book that explores the implications of taking control of our own evolution, including the possibility of de facto immor\u00ad tality, one of my dilemmas has been how to convince readers that religious fairy tales 64 July/August 2002 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER LETTERS TO THE EDITOR about the hereafter can and should be replaced with far more defensible and opti\u00ad mistic scenarios based on a scientific under\u00ad standing of our universe. Kurtz's article shows how to replace con\u00ad descension with empathy for those who cherish their faith. My challenge is the same: to connect \"scientific naturalism\" with hope, promise, and expectation \"in the light of the tragic character of the human condition.\" Paul Bassett Barrie, Ontario, Canada Paul Kurtz's excellent overview of science and religion considered whether \"scientific naturalism could provide an alternative dra\u00ad matic, poetic rendering of the human condi\u00ad tion.\" That might suggest an eventual natu\u00ad ralistic religion even with formal church structure. A format for that drama and poetry may have been foretold in the opening scene of Stanley Kubrick's 2001; A Space Odyssey. Those accompanying chords of Strauss's \"Also Sprach Zarathustra\" generated mystery with a suggestion of spirituality. That sense was amplified via the paranorama of primi\u00ad tive humans grazing with the animals. Here was revelation in a real-world setting. It could be prelude to a factual \"Greatest Story Ever Told,\" never reaiiy addressed in that context. It should represent die story line, in a naturalistic Biblical epic. . . . The story of course needs an initial Genesis, and ours would be cosmological and geological, in contrast to 3000 B.C. mythology. Once again, the most inspired cinema of the twentieth century previewed this concept. The first embryonic stirring of this vision occurred for me when viewing the evolutionary sequence in Disney's Fantasia. A volcanic punctuated landscape, booming in concert with Stravinski's powerful \"Rite of Spring,\" actually generated religious oaths from audience in my vicinity. In some near-future holographic plane\u00ad tarium setting, one might commence this Genesis with die fiery birth of the Sun, rotat\u00ad ing jets with light-year dimensions. Almost every religion offers immortality as prime enticement. But how long can a virtual immortality persist? Beyond the last syllable of recorded time, as the expanding universe blips into eternal darkness, mere is not much point in being there. The trillions of years probably remaining arc eternity enough. One can visually experience it and even the begin\u00ad ning, via state-of-the-art visual representa\u00ad tions, along with lectures by professional cos- mologists. Living vicariously die entire life span of diis universe, dramatized via inspired musical accompaniment, should satiate the need for an impossible, eternal immortality. But within all these spiritual embraces of an overwhelming universe, how can this for\u00ad mat address the need for inclusive morality? The Old Testament evokes sacred laws which are nothing more than secular laws given supernatural sanction. The law of the land today is secular law, which supercedes reli\u00ad gious law. However, our most basic secular laws address everyday behavior, and should be massaged in church services, perhaps in a pantomime mode, monitored by experienced judges. Empathy, as a formal discipline, tai\u00ad lored with psychology should also be included. The philosophical basics of moral\u00ad ity and ethics could be addressed via a Steve Allen approach. In addition to costumed greats from the past, selected members of the congregation would join the debate. Religions have included symbolic heroes like Buddha, Moses, and Christ. The true creators of civilization should be celebrated in this church; the pioneering Greek philoso\u00ad pher-scientists, DaVinci, Voltaire, Franklin, Newton, Darwin, Einstein. Their incredible and documented achievements were actually more miraculous than die contrived myths of classical religions. B.D. Gildenberg Tularosa, New Mexico Paul Kurtz's article posits that while \"the descriptive and explanatory functions of lan\u00ad guage are within the domain of science; the prescriptive and normative are the function of ethics, . . . the domain of the religious . .. is evocative, expressive, emotive.\" It seems to me, however, that this is die area mat is well served by literature and the performing and fine arts. The Bible, the Koran, and similar works should be considered on an equal footing with the works of Shakespeare, Asimov, Roddenberry, . . . ad infinitum. Equal in the sense of a right to be heard, not necessarily equal in truth value. What is wrong with religion as opposed to literature? Religion, as its etymology shows, binds together. But in binding together particular groups, they necessarily separate the members of one group from another. The question is not whether science and religion are compatible, but whether religions are compatible with one another. Appreciating Shakespeare does not prevent one from finding value in Asimov. A science fiction fan is not an Asimovian or a Roddenberrian even if one or the other may be favored, along with other authors, but being a Christian precludes being a Muslim. That is how religion differs from literature. Finally, Kurtz does leave out anodier area in which religion claims a priority: philoso\u00ad phy. How is it that we know what we know? Religion claims divine revelation. Skeptics rightly need empirical evidence. Why is it that we should in fact have such a thing as ethics? Is ethics merely the way people evolved, and just \u00ab? Or in fact, is one of Kurtz's list of \"reli\u00ad gious\" truth claims true: that a consciousness exists \"as a separate and distinct entity\" rather than a \"function of the brain,\" thereby mak\u00ad ing an avoidance of real suffering, rather than mere tropisms, a beneficent goal? This is a philosophical question, not a question of rev\u00ad elation. So there it is: Science, Ethics, Literature (the Arts), and Philosophy. The limit of religion, in its capacities as listed by Kurtz, is to be just a particular genre of literature and the arts. Charles Kluepfel Bloomfield, New Jersey I read Paul Kurtz's article on science and reli\u00ad gion with great anticipation. When I reached the point where he concluded that \"religion and science are compatible, depending of course on what is meant by religion,\" I found myself depressed and distressed. Redefining one source of conflict to make it compatible with another is a technique used frequently by politicians in order to maintain harmony and avoid dealing with obvious contradictions. If religion is defined in a way that eliminates conflict between it and sci\u00ad ence, how many of mose who have a reli\u00ad gious faith would accept the definition? Redefinition of religion to make it com\u00ad patible with science would require at the minimum: 1) elimination of any claim that reliable knowledge can be obtained through revelation or divine authority; 2) removal of any claim of being able to achieve absolute truth; 3) deletion of any reference to belief in supernatural beings or phenomena; 4) omis\u00ad sion or modification of beliefs and claims that are at variance with modern knowledge established by methods acceptable to science. Who would accept a definition of reli\u00ad gion with these restrictions? I suggest that it would be only a portion of unitarian- universalists, ethical culturists, and other small, modern, progressive religious groups. A major objective of the several Unitarian ministers who were instrumental in formu\u00ad lating the First Humanist Manifesto was to provide the basis for a religion that was com\u00ad patible with modern advances in knowledge. SKEPTICAL INQUIRER July/August 2002 65 LETTERS TO THE EDITOR including science, while retaining the values for humanity that Kurtz says are provided by religion but not by science. It is achievement of this compatibility that made it possible for William Schulz, former President of the Unitarian-Univcrsalist Association, to be Humanist of die Year in 2000. I suggest that we spend less time discussing whether sci\u00ad ence and religion arc compatible and more discussing how religion must change in order to be compatible, not only with science, but with modern knowledge generally. Alfred E. Harper Mercer Island, Washington I found the article by Paul Kurtz to be quite disappointing. He seems to have abandoned rationality in defense of religion. He says that religion's domain is \"evocative, expres\u00ad sive, emotive. It performative ceremonial rituals. . . .\" These are nice words, but how do they indicate that religion is any more compatible with science than the Harry Potter series, which he also mentions? He further states that religion's \"primary function is to express hope,\" but is unjusti\u00ad fied hope compatible with science, or is it even a good thing? Islamic boys have high hopes of a free path to heaven (including sev\u00ad enty-two virgins) when they willingly become suicide bombers. Many of the hopes engendered by other religions are equally incompatible with science.. . . Arthur L. Kohl Woodland Hills, California Paul Kurtz responds: I agree with Paul Bassett that many evils are committed in the name of religion and that the challenge is to connect scientific interests with hope, promise, and expectation. I also agree with B. D. Gildenberg that there is a need for scientific narratives of evolutionary genesis and secular heroes. Charles Kluepfel points out that the real question is not whether religions are compatible with science, but with each other, given the bloody con\u00ad frontations of religious fanatics. I of course agree with the need to separate philosophy from theology. Religion is closer to literature and the fine arts than science or ethics. Alfred Harper is indeed correct that I have redefined religion, but questions whether mainline reli\u00ad gionists would accept this definition. I concur. My redefinition is a meta-account of the Junc\u00ad tional role of religion in order to explain its power. In answer to Arthur Kohl I surely have not abandoned rationality in defense of religion, but have simply tried to understand why Jesus and Mohammed have endured while Socrates and Spinoza are forgotten by all but a small group of intellectuals. Is it because we have not found dramatic symbols to arouse human imagination and inspire alternative moral commitment? 1 do not believe that theistic religions are compatible with science, morality or poli\u00ad tics\u2014insofar as they claim to possess divine truth, a deeper morality, or a higher sense of justice. The religions of the books of Abraham and the promises of salvation that they offer are based upon revelations and to my mind are false; for their claims are without eviden\u00ad tial corroboration. If this is the case, what is left for religions? They will not easily wither away as secularists expected for they are forms of existential poetry, dramatizing the tragic dimensions of the human condition. We should recognize that if secular and humanistic outlooks are to have any enduring appeal then they must offer nat\u00ad uralized moral poetry that can inspire hope and nourish courage. The 'Mothman' Owls Regarding \"'Mothman' Solved\" (March/April 2002): No it ain't a common barn owl\u2014it's a great horned owl, which can grow to massive proportions depending upon the local sup\u00ad ply of rats, field mice and rabbits. Any country boy who's been around a while has been startled by die \"automobile- reflcctor-eyes\" and huge wings, tucked against a tail, fluffy body. . .. These owls get positively huge down in these parts (Georgia) and the spectacle of a startled great horned owl flapping his wings and swooping from a perch is enough to startle and traumatize any imag\u00ad inative person. Chris Long chrislangeus@yahoo.com Joe Nickell responds: Mr. Long's sweeping categorical statement ignores the specific evidence. The creature's squeaky cry, \"funny little face, \" and presence near barns and abandoned buildings suggests the barn owl. But the great horned owl may well have played \"Mothman\" on occasion as no doubt did the barred owl an intermediate- sized owl that is especially common in the vicin\u00ad ity of the original sightings. That ana is the McClintick Wildlife Management Area\u2014a bird sanctuary to be sure! On a recent trip to the region (which I hope to report on in Skeptical Briefs,), / also photographed a large stuffed owl\u2014identified as a snowy owl (unusual for the area)\u2014that had been shot off a local barn during the Mothman flap in 1966. 'No Effect' Prayer Study Kevin Christopher made some good points in his News & Comment piece on die Mayo Clinic's 'no effect' prayer study (March/April 2002). The main point was that there is an inadequate correlation between prayers and die medical outcomes of diose being prayed for. But die real problem here, as Hector Avalos has indicated in \"Can Science Prove That Prayer Works\" (Free Inquiry, Summer 1997), is that \"diere can be no such diing as a controlled experiment concerning prayer.\" For example, pious Catholics light candles and pray for everyone who is sick, and reli\u00ad gious relatives of die sick pray but diey are not part of die selected group of prayers. Since there is no way of identifying all of the prayers, \"control groups are not possible\" and dierefore \"such purported scientific ments are not possible.\" There is a sense, dien, in which die Mayo study is irrelevant. Art DiQuattro Seattle, Washington I've read the recent articles and letters about the effectiveness (or lack thereof) of prayer with interest. Nobody seems to have pointed out that, if prayer was shown to be effective in aiding the recovery from illness, we could perform an experiment to test the existence of God. If prayer is communication with God and God rewards the good and punishes the bad, then there should be a measurable dif\u00ad ference in the effectiveness of prayer for a saint and a sinner. Unless, of course, God is perverse and deliberately refuses to allow an experiment to work that could prove his existence. But then how would that differ from a universe with\u00ad out a God? Geoff Lane Tottington, Bury, England Transmitting Beliefs After reading Kendrick Frazier's News & Comment (March/April 2002), about the 66 July/August 2002 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER LETTERS TO THE EDITOR transmission of paranormal beliefs as pub\u00ad lished in Sociological Perspective, I am, no doubt, one of many who thought \"Yes, of course, I knew that.\" I'm glad that lab exper\u00ad iments confirm what seems obvious con\u00ad cerning the social impact theory which states \"The social impact of a message source comes . . . from three factors: the number of people, their strength or status, and their immediacy or closeness.\" Another social impact, inclusive but not mentioned, is the very fact that a scientific experiment was being conducted and the subjects in the experiment were given oral instructions \"that included a brief review of 'evidence' for a pyramid's special powers.\" Would results of die study been different if the subjects had been given balanced oral instructions of claims and counter claims for the pyramid's special powers? Perhaps the \"prompting\" of the testers unduly influenced the subjects. It also struck me that the term paranor\u00ad mal beliefi could have easily been replaced by the term religious beliefi and made just as much sense. It is impossible for a child to resist the influence of family concerning religious beliefs but with age and education it becomes easier to resist social impact. Even then, the views of esteemed religious leaders, politicians, and especially some renowned scientists are difficult to resist. There are exceptions of course. \"[My] deep religiosity . . . found an abtupi ending ai age twelve, through the reading of popular scientific books\" (Albert Einstein, as quoted from Einstein, History, and Other Passions, p. 172.) Other exceptions, no doubt, in\u00ad clude the majority of SKEPTICAL INQUIRERS readers. Craig Gosling Indianapolis, Indiana A minor comment related to Kendrick Frazier's News & Comment on paranormal beliefs. In the 1980s, while working for a division of Transamerica Bank, Insurance, et al. (that of the pyramid building in San Francisco), we, in sales, would receive directives from the corporate office to mention the \"power of the pyramid\" to prospective customers\u2014it was supposed to facilitate sales. I could never bring myself to do that, and never did. It would have been humiliating to say that to an educated individual. William Comiskey Edina, Minnesota The Berries on Multiverses In Follow Up, March/April 2002, Bryce DeWitt criticizes the article \"Multiverses and Blackberries\" by Martin Gardner (September/October 2001). But he seems to chide Gardner for what are relatively minor points. The real thrust of Gardner's article can be summed up in his parting words: \"The stark truth is that there is not the slightest shred of reliable evidence that there is any universe other than the one we are in. No multiverse theory has so far provided a prediction that can be tested.\" One must be quite old to recall the dismay felt by physicists when die famous Michelson- Morley experiment to detect the motion of Earth through the \"luminiferous ether\" pro\u00ad duced a null result. Many clever modifications and additional experiments also failed to detect this motion. So may one therefore conclude that the luminiferous ether doesn't exist? The answer is not necessarily, however, if no experiment can detect its existence or measure its properties, it is a sterile concept lying outside the pale of science. I think this was Gardner's message. One of the multiverse theories may yet turn out to be valid but right now there is too much speculative drivel being written about them. I would have heen enliphrrned much more if a physicist of DeWitt's outstanding caliber had addressed the future prospects for find\u00ad ing direct experimental verification that these universes really exist. William H. Lamb, Jr. Eatonton, Georgia Perhaps you will allow me to tweak my old friend and colleague Bryce DeWitt who has seen fit to take Martin Gardner to task. He first praises Gardner for his being \"one of the best and most intelligent debunkers of pseudoscience\" but then berates him for his views on the \"many worlds interpretation\" of quantum mechanics. This seems to be the history of Martin Gardner. In the preface of the second edition of his book Fads and Fallacies Gardner says: \"The first edition of this book prompted many curious letters from irate readers .. . oddly enough most of these correspondents objected to one chapter only, thinking all the others excellent.\" Of course this does not prove anything except that people do not like to see their own ox gored. Ezra T. Newman Physics, Univ. of Pittsburgh Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania And Martin Gardner himself replied to DeWitt in our May/June 2002 issue.\u2014EDITORS Logic, Emotion Don't Meet The excellence of your March/April 2002 issue was marred, in my opinion, by one thing: the repeated references to the Science and Religion conference last November. If 1 learned anything from Star Trek it's this: logic is logic and emotion is emotion and never the twain shall meet. McCoy never did wrangle a giggle out of Spock, who likewise failed to cool rhe hot temper of Bones. So, in my humble view, will science and religion never adequately prove God or disprove him to the satisfaction of all concerned. I've sub\u00ad scribed to SKEPTICAL INQUIRER for about a year now, and already I find this discussion tedious to the point of exasperation. Couldn't you keep it all contained to your annual Science and Religion issue so that I can ignore it all at one whack? Must you spoil the juicy meal of each issue with the day-old dinner roll of this tiresome, pointless debate? Sally LeCroix Nashville, Tennessee Calculating God Controversy Editor's note: Barry Seidman's review of the novel Calculating God created a storm of con\u00ad troversy beginning with this response from the novel's author, Robert J. Sawyer: As a skeptic and evolutionist, 1 was stunned by Barry Seidman's review of my Hugo Award-nominated science-fiction novel Calculating God (March/April 2002). He incredibly characterizes a novel whose villains are a pair of young-Earth creationists, destroy\u00ad ing Burgess Shale fossils in order to erase evi\u00ad dence of evolution, as a pro-creationist work. Heck, one of my creationist antagonists has the last name \"Falsey\"\u2014I couldn't have been more obvious about my sentiments. (What's that? You don't remember those characters from Seidman's review? Exactly.) Further, Seidman misleadingly presents a line of dialog (omitting any indication that it is dialog) as if it were a statement of my per\u00ad sonal beliefs. Yes, I have a character (an alien character\u2014another little fact Seidman fails to cite) say: \"That we live in a created uni\u00ad verse is apparent to anyone with sufficient intelligence and information.\" But Seidman SKEPTICAL INQUIRER July/August 2002 67 LETTERS TO THE EDITOR makes no mention of the pages of later dia\u00ad log in which the novel's human protagonist disputes this statement. (For an articulation of my own beliefs, see the essay \"Science and God\" that Borders commissioned to accom\u00ad pany the release of Calculating God. sfwriter.com/cgborder.htm.) 5/s editors should be chided for accept\u00ad ing a book review from someone who cites within that review a personal relationship witJi the author. Yes, Seidman sought me out repeatedly, and argued in what 1 felt was an illogical and rude fashion. Even after I stopped responding to his rants, he contin\u00ad ued to send me unsolicited e-mails for years afterwards. There are countless disinterested skeptics who could have reviewed my book; using one of them would have been much more appropriate journalistically. Contrary to Seidman's statements, my novel takes pains to point out arguments against intelligent design, irreducible com\u00ad plexity, and many mini issues. More: Seidman outrageously charges that I'm trying to discredit Sagan and Gould. As H. Paul Shuch, director of The SETI League, wrote to me (unsolicited; our first-ever con\u00ad tact): \"I certainly identified with your protag\u00ad onist. Of course, early on I recognized Steve Gould. And I saw in (the characters] atheism a healthy dose of Cosmic Carl. All in all, he was a most appealing composite.\" Seidman, who said in a February 1999 e- mail that he'd only just started reading \"sci- fi,\" now feels expert enough to declare that I should \"stay far, far away from hard science fiction.\" This would astonish Stanley Schmidt, editor of Analog, universally consid\u00ad ered die leading hard-SF magazine. Schmidt had planned to serialize Calculating God, and only scheduling difficulties with the hard\u00ad cover publisher prevented its appearance.. .. It would also astonish Gregory Benford, professor of physics at the University of California, Irvine, who is often cited as the greatest living hard-SF writer. Benford was one of the three judges who awarded Calculating (W second place in the John W. Campbell Memorial Award for Best SF Novel of 2000. Wrote Benford: \"Your han\u00ad dling of the ticism creeping in.\" Barry Seidman's review isn't just unfairly damaging to my book: it's also part of the shift toward knee-jerk reaction and rhetori\u00ad cal sleight of hand within the skeptical com\u00ad munity that is damaging die skeptical move\u00ad ment itself. Seidman should be ashamed. Robert J. Sawyer www.sfwriter.com Barry Seidman responds to Robert Sawyer (condensed by editor): One of your complaints is that I offer as proof of your creationist stance dialogue from the aliens in Calculating God. In fact, you go out of your way to point out that aliens made these remarks as if that in itself ought to dismiss such remarks . . . which in science fiction, as you should know, is hardly the case. Indeed, alien characters are traditionally used to mirror human ideas and often the ideas of the author. Besides that point, it is clear that the lead alien in this book is indeed your \"voice\" in the book. How can I tell? Probably the biggest clue is that in the end, the aliens are correct and the human \"protagonist\" turns out the be wrong! Calculating God is in this regardsimilar toThe X-Files, where the off-the-wall lead guy who presents the pseudoscience side of the story always turns out to be correct in the end while Scully (the rational scientist) is always wrong! It is safe to say that both the writers of The X-Files and yourself in Calculating God manipulate the rules of scientific method and philosophical debate to foster the validity of pseudoscience. The claim that your novel points out \"argu\u00ad ments against intelligent design and irreducible complexity\" is irrelevant since those arguments are mostly won (in Calculating God,) by the proponents of intelligent design and irreducible complexity. . . yes, those darn aliens again! Finally 1 think your criticism of SI for letting me discuss our previous e-mail conversation is misguided It was indeed included to offer the reader a background on how you think with regard to science fiction and fantasy and helped build an awareness of your recent tendency towards the latter while professing the former. . .. Greg Benford's comment notwithstanding.... In his review of Robert Sawyer's Calculating God Barry Seidman forgot that the second word in science fiction is \"fiction.\" Perhaps I'm old fashioned, but a book review is sup\u00ad posed to give insight beyond the reviewer's opinions. Seidman's charges of \"anti-science propaganda,\" \"pseudoscience,\" and \"cre- ationism\" show that he has written a polemic, not a review. His diatribe showed only the vaguest relationship with the book on my shelf. If Seidman feels that only fantasy writers can use religious themes, he has a lot to learn. The greatest science fiction writers have used religious themes. The classic short story \"The Star\" by Sir Arthur C. Clarke is not \"anti-science.\" It is, however, an example of story telling at its best. Even die hardest science fiction writers violate scientific law. The key is consistency. not scientific rigor. It would be a pretty parochial science fiction that never allowed us to leave our solar system, except at sub- light speeds. The greatest of them all, Isaac Asimov, invented \"psychohisiory\" and made it die heart of his Foundation stories. And horrors, he used unscientific themes such as hyper- drive, hand-blasters, and psychic powers to fuel his story line. I eagerly await Seidman's analysis of Asimov's psychohistory in terms of \"pseudoscience\" and Joseph Aspler Kirkland, QC, Canada I am a long-time subscriber to SI, a member of the Ontario Skeptics, and also a veteran reader of science fiction. (Among my many books is the first Canadian anthology of SF.) I want to register an objection to Barry F. Seidman's review of Robert J. Sawyer's novel Calculating God Seidman states, \"Sawyer confuses science with fantasy.\" Then he goes on to maintain diat \"Sawyer began to use his fiction more as a weapon of anti-science propaganda rather dian entertainment.\" Nowhere in the review does Seidman substantiate these statements. Indeed, it is impossible to do so! Calculating God is a work of science fiction (like Rendezvous with Rama), not fantasy fic\u00ad tion (like The Lord of the Rings). The novel assumes a cosmos diat is understandable, not magical. Far from being a work of \"propa\u00ad ganda,\" die novel is a work of fiction. Seidman ascribes die attitudes of some of its charac\u00ad ters\u2014but not odiers\u2014to its author. Give-away sentences begin \"Sawyer proposes ...\" and \"Sawyer also includes....\" It is not Sawyer, it is some of his characters who are speaking. Seidman fails to appreciate die difference between a tract and a novel. (The former is a single-minded statement of a position; the latter is a nuanced, dramatic, and imaginative presentation of points of view.) Calculating God is no tract but a novel, a well-written prose narrative in which characters converse and argue points of view. Sawyer is adept at counterpointing points of view. A serious reading of Calculating God leaves no reader in doubt that (a) it is a seri\u00ad ous work of SF; (b) it is a serious discussion of the nature of reality; and (c) it is a novel that will be enjoyed by serious readers\u2014and intelligent reviewers. John Robert Colombo Toronto, Canada Robert J. Sawyer is a science fiction writer. Calculating God is a science fiction novel. 68 July/August 2002 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER LETTERS TO THE EDITOR The operative word in both cases is \"fic\u00ad tion.\". .. End of discussion. End of argument. End of debate. It's speculative fiction. Get over it! Peter de Jager Brampton, Ontario, Canada On Being Stared At In a letter in the March/April 2002 SI, Andrew Alan Smith thought he had detected an artifact arising from the ran\u00ad domized sequences used in some of my star\u00ad ing experiments. He speculated that there might be a tendency for subjects to guess Not-looking (N) and Looking (L) in the sequence N-L-N-L-N. Smith's argument is flawed. First, he considered only two out of the twenty-four randomized sequences, and looked at only the first three to five trials out of the twenty-trial sequences. He claimed that he had found systematic deviations from chance. The set of twenty-four sequences was counterbalanced to avoid any system\u00ad atic bias. When I applied Smith's hypothet\u00ad ical guessing pattern to all twenty-four sequences, the results were exactly at die chance level of 50 percent. Second, Smith made an elementary mistake in his calcula\u00ad tions. In his small sample there were more correct \"guesses\" in the N than in the L tri\u00ad als, the opposite of his claim. Smith's arguments are not only erro\u00ad neous, but irrelevant to the evidence for the staring effect. In peer-reviewed journals, I have already published data from thousands of trials using structureless randomizations, based on tossing coins, with results that are highly significant statistically. The same pat\u00ad tern of results was also apparent using the set of twenty-four counterbalanced sequences, without giving feedback to the subjects. The details are available on my Web site (www.sheldrakc.org). Rupert Sheldrake London, England Hypothesis, Not Theory My curriculum, as a middle school science teacher, encompasses many scientific theo\u00ad ries, including evolution. When I read the March/April letters to the editor I grimaced. Sometimes I think that we science support\u00ad ers are our own worst enemies. Throughout the school year, I continu\u00ad ally take great pains to remind my students of the differences between an hypothesis and a scientific theory, emphasizing that a theory, such as the Cell Theory or Atomic Theory, is an explanation of a large body of scientific data, and not just an educated guess. This, so far, has warded off any claim from students or parents that a theory is \"something that has not been proved.\" Then I read Grant Hutchison's letter. In it, he states that \"(t)he Rare Earth Hypothesis is a scientific theory\" (emphasis mine) which will stand or fall \"under peer review.\" No, it isn't. Like the Life Everywhere Hypothesis, the Rare Earth Hypothesis is just that\u2014a scientific hypothesis. It cannot be tested against any scientific data, because, so far, no such data exist\u2014until, of course, SETI receives that cosmic SOS, or until the federal govern\u00ad ment releases those Roswell corpses. (Just kidding!) In any event, we must choose our words carefully\u2014and keep in mind rhc now-proverbial saying that \"absence of evi\u00ad dence is not evidence of absence.\" By the way, the punster-of-rhe-year award goes to Ralph [Forum column \"It's Life Captain .. . , March/April 2002) for reminding us that \"(a)ll gall is divided into three parts.\" Julius Caesar himself would have laughed as much as I did. Edward B. Mills edmills@gte.net In his response to my baffled letter (March/April 2002), David Darling takes me to task for \"jumping to conclusions about other people's beliefs.\" I thought I had very clearly indicated my lack of knowledge about Darling's beliefs by presenting my remarks as a series of questions, beginning with the phrase: \"Does he seriously believe. . . ?\" It's a clumsy rhetorical device, I admit, but it's usually taken to indicate the sentiment: \"I don't think he does, but I'm forced to enter\u00ad tain the notion.\" So I'm glad to see Darling confirm he doesn't believe any of the dubi\u00ad ous things I mentioned. But my bafflement persists. In his response to my comments Darling quotes a categorical statement from his own book: \"In the end a scientist's personal beliefs are irrelevant because science is a communal, peer-reviewed venture in which belief is always subordinate to data.\" Indeed\u2014and that was the whole thrust of my letter. The reason I felt the need to write the letter in the first place was in response to Darling's seri\u00ad ous modification of this view in die special case of Guillermo Gonzalez: \"... in the case of Gonzalez it matters because his underly\u00ad ing conviction has led him to play a very sig\u00ad nificant role in raising the prominence of the Rare Earth debate.\" (As quoted by Kendrick Frazier, \"Was the 'Rare Earth' Hypothesis Influenced by a Creationist?\" News & Comment, November/December 2001.) So my question remains. If Darling doesn't believe any of the odd things I asked about, why does he want to modify his fundamen\u00ad tally fair-minded view in the case of creation- ism and the Rare Earth Hypothesis? Grant Hutchison Dundee, United Kingdom What Is True? What Is Science? As the gap (at the least) remains wide between \"science\" and \"humanities\" per C.P. Snow's old division, I've been hit often by thinkers with the idea that everyone's idea/approach to a subject is equally valid\u2014 which I don't believe. It's true that in many fields problems remain. For instance, in the study of legends of the past, it may well be that sometimes \"plausibility\" may be ail that can be said of certain approaches. But wc still are not quite in a \"night in which all cats are gray,\" as a scholar wrote many decades ago Hugh H. Trotti Decatur, Georgia The letters column is a forum for views on matters raised in previous issues. Letters should be no more than 225 words. Due to the volume of letters not all can be published.
