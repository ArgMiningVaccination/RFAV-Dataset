Discover the Detoxification Difference Quality of life is greatly enhanced by body detoxification. Detox and you feel better... it really is that simple Missing Medical Education It's not your fault that you didn't get adequate environmental health training in school. But it is irresponsible if you don't educate yourself about this information. This missing link could make the difference between health, disability, or even death for you or your patients. \"The lack of environmental health education in medicine contributes to lost opportunities for physicians to prevent or intervene early in environmentally-related diseases. Despite the importance of environmental exposures on disease morbidity, medical students receive very little training on how to recognize and manage environmentally-related diseases. On average, medical students receive seven hours of environmental health training in 4 years of medical school; approximately one-third of graduating medical students believe that their EH training was \"inadequate\". \u2014Physicians for Social Responsibility Website Environmental Toxins are a Major Health Threat The World Health Organization states 25% of our patients are affected by known environmental factors. What if this information could help your patients (and you) live a healthier and improved quality of life? \"Maintaining a healthy environment is central to increasing quality of life and years of healthy life. Globally, nearly 25 percent of all deaths and the total disease burden can be attributed to environmental factors.\" \u2014World Health Organization Detoxification of chemicals and heavy metals is essential in providing the best care to our patients. Invisible Epidemic: Toxic Overload The FDA has approved over 84,000 drugs and chemicals in the United States. There are over 100 million registered new chemicals worldwide (see ticker on website). The American Chemical Society registers known chemicals worldwide on their website ( [www.cas.org](http://www.cas.org)). The exponential growth is astonishing. It took 33 years to develop and register the first 10 million chemicals. The last 10 million chemicals only took 9 months. The safety of these chemicals is unknown. We are exposed in one day to more chemicals than our ancestors 100 years ago were exposed to in their entire lifetime! The CDC monitors the amount and types of chemicals in American's bodies since 1999. Here are some of the disturbing facts from the 2009 report: - 100% of test subjects had perchlorate \u2014 found in rocket fuel and adversely affects the thyroid - Majority have fire retardants (called polybrominated diphenyl ethers) found in furniture linked to thyroid and kidney tumors, infertility, and interfers with brain function - 90% had BPA (bisphenol A) in urine found in plastics, thermal paper receipts, food can lining, and linked to behavior problems in children and breast and prostate cancer The Environmental Working Group is a non-profit organization dedicated to protecting human health and the environment. Their 2009 study of cord blood in 10 unborn children found an average of 232 toxic chemicals! These fetuses had chemicals that are found in personal care products (such as makeup and shampoo) including flame retardants, plastics, mercury and pesticides. Innocent Until Proven Guilty The Environment Protection Agency does not require chemicals be tested for safety. Only 200 of the 84,000 chemicals have been required to submit safety studies. We don't know the health affects of most of the 84,000 chemicals and the interaction. Below is an informative video of Dr. Sanjay Gupta's senate talk on the harmful affects of chemicals... [Dr. Sanjay Gupta's Senate Talk](http://www.cnn.com/2010/HEALTH/10/26/senate.toxic.america.hearing/index.html) Patients Want to Know Patients are forced to learn on their own about the toxic effects of these chemicals. Isn't this also our responsibility? There is much research and information we can learn to help our patients. Actress, author, and health advocate, Suzanne Somers, is speaking out for patients about the toxic health effects of chemicals. Learning from her own health problems and as a breast cancer survivor, she states in her most recent book (Tox-Sick): \"We are now under the greatest environmental assault in the history of humanity. The planet has changed so drastically in the last 50 years. The chickens are finally coming home to roost. Today, we're trying to address diseases that were more or less unheard of, or exceedingly rare, a century ago or less. And even those living a seemingly \"clean\" life can be dramatically affected; the toxic load is just that great.\" Detoxification Not An Option Anymore We are exposed every minute of every day with chemicals eroding our health. We MUST learn and start a daily program of chemical detoxification. We cannot possibly know all the interactions and safety concerns of the 100 million chemicals in the world. Starting a daily detoxification program is the missing link in our healthcare approach. This enables the body to heal. Integrative medicine providers incorporate effective methods of detoxification to help remove these barriers to health (see [7 Foundational Principles of Integrative Medicine](/integrative-principles)).
