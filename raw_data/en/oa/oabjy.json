This is the type of medicine that most of us grew up with and is still the dominant form of medicine practiced in the United States. When you go to the doctor, they will likely take a quick look at you, ask some questions, and then write you a prescription for a medication that will help to treat your symptoms. On the other hand, functional medicine also known as integrative medicine is a newer form of medicine that is quickly gaining popularity. Functional medicine practitioners take a different approach. Rather than simply treating your symptoms, they seek to find the root cause of your illness or disease. They do this by taking a comprehensive approach that looks at all aspects of your life, including your diet, lifestyle, environment, and genetic factors The Benefits of Functional Medicine Functional medicine has many benefits over traditional Western medicine. First and foremost, it is much more effective in preventing disease than traditional Western medicine. This is because it takes a comprehensive approach that looks at all potential factors that could be contributing to your illness or disease. Furthermore, functional medicine practitioners often have more time to spend with their patients than doctors who practice traditional Western medicine. This allows them to get to know their patients on a deeper level and understand their unique needs. Another benefit of functional medicine is that it emphasizes the use of natural methods for treating illness and disease. The goal is to use the least harmful method necessary to achieve optimum health. For instance, rather than prescribing medication as soon as you start showing symptoms, a functional medicine practitioner may first recommend making changes to your diet or lifestyle. If those changes don't work, then they may move on to more aggressive treatment methods such as medication. Conclusion: If you are seeking a more comprehensive approach to your health care, then functional medicine may be right for you. However, it's important to note that not all insurance plans cover this type of care. So be sure to check with your insurance provider before making an appointment with a functional medicine "}
