Our philosophy is that natural medicine is the best way to regain and maintain health. We've built our practice on the core belief that our bodies have an innate God-given ability to heal themselves when given an appropriate internal and external healing environment. Our goal is to empower you with knowledge of your body and basic functions of herbs and supplements that will allow your body systems to function and flow as they should. We specialize in kinesiology, iridology, and nutritional counseling. Whether traditional medicine hasn't worked for you or you are ready for a new approach to your health, we can teach you to achieve optimal health through holistic principles and practices. Schedule your appointment Hours of Operation: Mon-Fri: 10:00AM MacArthur Blvd. Warr Acres, OK 73122 Testimonials \" MY PROMISE My goal is to teach you how to listen and properly respond to your body through nutrition. I look for the cause of the discomfort rather than working with symptomatic care. Our warm and friendly staff helps all who enter our doors feel comfortable and at home. About Us Taylor's Herbs Since the beginning of my journey, God had given me a dream of a multi-purpose clinic where I could help others gain optimal health naturally by addressing the mind, body, and spirit. In September 2014, we expanded our business from a little over 500 sq.ft. to over 2,000 sq.ft. clinic. God has blessed our business beyond measure. Kassi Mankin, MH is able to offer her bulk herbs and teas as well as Bach Flower Remedies for emotional help; Svetlana Van Hooser, LPC offers counseling; and we offer a wide variety of products and supplements to meet your needs. Together, we make up Taylor's Herbs. "}
