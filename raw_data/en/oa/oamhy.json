Novavax said protein-based vaccine induced neutralizing antibodies against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, becoming the third company to publicize preliminary findings for updated monovalent COVID-19 vaccines expected this fall. The vaccine candidate induced neutralizing responses to several of the most common omicron subvariants in animal models, according to the manufacturer. The FDA is expected to decide on authorizing or approving on the updated vaccines in mid- to late September, according to the CDC. It was the top story in infectious disease last week. Another top story was about an experimental study that determined that bed bugs can contract MRSA, but knowing for sure whether they can spread the infection to humans requires more research. Read these and more top stories in infectious disease below: Novavax says updated COVID-19 vaccine induces antibody response to new variants Novavax said its updated COVID-19 vaccine candidate induced neutralizing antibodies against emerging SARS-CoV-2 subvariants in small animal and non-human primate studies.

Study findings support hypothesis Through the first experimental evidence of its kind, researchers determined that bed bugs can contract MRSA through contact with or feeding through a surface contaminated with the bacteria, although this does not necessarily mean they can spread the infection to humans.
