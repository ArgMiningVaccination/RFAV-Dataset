Vital Flora Women's Daily Probiotic: The Organic Prebiotic Blend While probiotics get all the attention, we can't forget about their best buddies \u2014 [prebiotics](https://findyourhealthyplace.com/product-category/digestion-supplements/prebiotics/). These are essential for creating a thriving environment in our tummy, where good bacteria can flourish and do their thing. They come from fiber-rich foods like fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. So, next time you're chowing down on that delicious salad or munching on some crunchy veggies, know you're fueling your gut with the good stuff. Check out the seven organic prebiotics in this women's probiotic for digestive, immune, and vaginal health: - Potatoes work wonders for your heart, muscles, and nervous system.* - Acacia fiber encourages the growth of probiotics, alleviates stomach discomfort, supports weight management, and maintains gut health.* - Apple fiber helps regulate bowel movements, balance cholesterol levels, and ease constipation.* - Blue agave supports our immune system and mental health.* - Guar gum promotes the growth of good bacteria in your gut. It also keeps your blood sugar and cholesterol at healthier levels.* - Jerusalem artichoke root aids in controlling cholesterol, blood pressure, and new blood cell formation.* - Chicory root \u2014 a famous coffee alternative \u2014 aids bowel movement and supports healthy weight management.* Delayed release vegetable capsules A delayed release capsule is the perfect capsule for these probiotics. They are designed to slowly release the nutrients in the digestive tract, giving them time to be absorbed by your body. Not a nutrient explosion all at once!* Why is this important? For our probiotics, we want those good bacteria to reach your gut intact and ready to work their magic. But here's the catch: your stomach is like an acid bath with a pH less than 3. Those battery acid-strength juices can be harsh on the delicate probiotics, potentially breaking them down before they even reach your gut. That's the benefit of delayed release capsules! Another perk is that this capsule formulation is a gentler option for those with a sensitive stomach lining. It's about finding a perfect match for your tummy! FAQ: Q: Is Vital Planet Vital Flora Women's Daily Probiotic shelf stable? A: Yes! This Vital Flora women's probiotic supplement is shelf stable. It means you don't have to put it in the refrigerator to keep the bacteria alive. Q: What's the difference between shelf-stable and refrigerated probiotics? A: A refrigerated probiotic requires refrigeration to keep the good bacteria alive. A shelf-stable probiotic requires no refrigeration because good bacteria can thrive within the supplement through temperature changes. Perfect for travel! Q: Is Vital Planet Vital Flora Women's Daily Probiotic safe for vegans? A: Yes! This daily probiotic for women is safe for vegans.
