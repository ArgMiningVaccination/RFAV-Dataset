In Qu\u00e9bec, 1 in 5 people suffers from seasonal rhinitis, which is mainly caused by ragweed pollen. Seasonal rhinitis usually begins in the spring, when some trees that may cause allergies release their pollen in the air. Thereafter, other allergenic plants release their pollen throughout the summer and until mid-October. Allergic reactions caused by the various pollens occur at roughly the same periods each year. These periods are as follows: March to June (trees and shrubs pollen) May to October (grass pollen, such as turf, hay, bluegrass and brome) July to October (ragweed pollen) Climate changes extend the period during which plants and trees produce pollen. As a result, allergy periods may also be longer in the coming years. Symptoms Seasonal rhinitis causes different symptoms that are mainly brought on through the inhalation of pollen. Symptoms may appear in the following ways: Worsening of asthma if a person already suffers from it Nasal congestion Signs of conjunctivitis: Itching of eyes Purulent eye discharge Swelling of eyelids Watering eyes Eye redness Runny nose with clear and abundant phlegm Repeated sneezing Headache Tingling and itching of the nose, throat and ears The side effects of seasonal rhinitis also impact the quality of life of the person allergic and their family.
