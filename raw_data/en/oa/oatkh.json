If you're here it means you're looking for the healthiest candles, and you're definitely not interested in the idea of burning Bath & Body Works candles that release harmful toxins into the air for hours on end. Thankfully natural candles do exist, and there is no shortage of clean candle companies making non toxic candles using natural and organic ingredients that are safe for you, your family and pets. Non toxic candles are also easily available on Amazon. Organic candles help enhance your home environment with their aromatherapy health benefits, and one natural wax even helps clean the air. So toss out your paraffin wax Yankee Candles and read on for candle ingredients to avoid, how to choose a natural candle and the healthiest candles that are non-toxic and organic. Why You Shouldn't Burn Candles Conventional candles that is...Using conventional candles in your home means you're unleashing loads of toxic compounds and particles into the air that, over time, can be harmful to your health. Will one candle wreak havoc? Probably not. But if you enjoy burning candles fairly regularly, then it's important to be aware of what's actually inside these candles and their harmful effects. We, as consumers, assume that companies have our best interests at heart and strive to do \"the right thing.\" You would think companies wouldn't want to sell millions of American families candles that could harm their health, but that's exactly what they're doing - and making millions doing so. In this wildly unregulated industry, companies don't even need to label the ingredients in their candles. So why shouldn't we be burning these candles?

The dangers of conventional candles include: - Paraffin: petroleum-based product that can release dangerous volatile organic compounds (VOCs). VOC's can disrupt hormones, carcinogens and neurotoxins. - Formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, toluene, benzene, acetone and more can be released - Burning paraffin wax releases ultrafine soot with particulates that stay suspended in the air. This particulate matter, just like pollution, penetrates into the lungs, entering the bloodstream and leading to allergies, asthma, bronchitis, even strokes and cancer - Wicks that contain lead: In 2003 the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission banned the manufacture of all candles with lead cores. But many candles still contain lead or even have core wicks made of zinc and tin that can release trace amounts of heavy metals. What Kinds of Candles are Non-Toxic? I'll be sharing which candles are safe for your health and tips for how to choose one that's the best fit for you. Natural waxes include: - Soy wax - Beeswax - Coconut wax - Apricot wax - Rapeseed wax - Other 100% vegetable wax - Blend of the above waxes Some companies use a blend of waxes, and will often state \"wax blend\" to indicate this. For example, a candle company may use a proprietary wax blend of Coconut, Soy and Beeswax along with Apricot and coconut oils. The goal is to take advantage of the qualities of different waxes to produce the best natural candle that burns smokeless, soot-less, produces the strongest scent, and lasts the longest. In the candle world, this is known as clean burn, burn time and scent throw. To make sure there is no paraffin wax lurking in the blends, you can reach out to the company and ask directly. 3 Things to Consider when Buying a Natural Candle - Wax type - Wick type: cotton, wood, paper - Fragrance type: natural, synthetic, or a mix of both Other factors you might want to take into consideration with a non-toxic and natural candle are: - Artificial dyes (think those colorful Yankee Candles) - Recyclable and reusable containers - Complete ingredients list (or email the company directly for a clear response) CANDLE WAX - Should I Buy Soy, Beeswax or Coconut Wax? Everyone has their own personal preference with candles, but if you're new to natural candles, it's best to try out various types of candles from the wax to the wick type used to see what you prefer. Your perfect candle is out there somewhere! Beeswax - One of the cleanest burning candle waxes - Warm, natural toned flame - A natural air purifier - Releases negative ions when burned and attaches to positive ions (ie dust, toxins, pollen, odor) in the air - Not vegan friendly Soy Wax - Most common natural wax used in candles - Whiter, cool toned flame - Lower melting point - Less scent throw than coconut wax (holds up to 10% scent in its wax) - More affordable due to 94% of soy agriculture being made via genetically modified means Coconut Wax - One of the cleanest burning candle waxes & often considered by candlemakers as the best natural wax option - Burns slower than other waxes for a longer lasting candle - Most eco-friendly wax to produce - Strong scent throw (holds up to 12% scent in its wax) - Zero soot particles released when burned - More expensive so it's commonly mixed with other waxes like soy wax CANDLE FRAGRANCE - Should I Buy Essential Oil or Synthetic Fragrance Candles? Fragrance choice is a personal decision and up to each individual. Candles are basically perfume for your home, and in the world of clean perfumes, there are many brands that combine both natural fragrance (ie essential oils) with synthetics to create a fine fragrance that has projection and longevity - while others remain 100% natural. Some people may be entirely against any added fragrance oils or safe synthetics, while others are okay with their addition for better performance. The same correlates to fragrance in candles. A candle brand creating fine fragrance candles will perform more similarly to a conventional candle (but without the toxic paraffin wax) and have superior scent throw and a wider variety of scents. Even if the synthetic fragrance is phthalate-free, the cleanest option will always be 100% organic essential oils. But, essential oils are difficult to work with in candles as they can easily burn up without leaving any scent behind. Choose whichever type of candle fragrance that aligns with you the most.
