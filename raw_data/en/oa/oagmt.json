A traditional Ayurvedic massage tool, the Kansa Wand, used in India for centuries, is designed to activate Marma points (vitality points) to increase the flow of Prana (life-force energy) from the top of your head to the tips of your toes. The East by West Kansa Wand, handmade in India, features a teak wood handle and polished metal dome made from \"kansa\", the Sanskrit word for bronze (a copper tin alloy). This sacred metal blend, said to be more healing than gold and silver in Vedic wisdom, quickly warms, and its alkaline properties mean that it can help to naturally balance your skin's pH. For face massage, apply a quality oil or serum and use it in small, circular clockwise movements to gently stimulate circulation and promote lymphatic drainage for clearer, plumper and smoother skin. For the ultimate self-care, Vata-soothing treatment, use your East by West Kansa Wand (and [East by West Neem Comb](https://www.jasminehemsley.com/jasmine-hemsley-exclusives/neem-comb) if you have one!) for an at-home traditional Abhyanga (warm oil massage) and a hair oil ritual. The East by West Kansa Wand is packaged in recyclable/compostable cardboard tube with a handmade, certified Fairtrade and GOTS Organic Certified Cotton bag and detailed usage instructions including a QR code to access exclusive massage content with Jasmine. GOOD TO KNOW: As with all natural materials, and in comparison to the picture, slight variations in the wood and metal can be expected.
