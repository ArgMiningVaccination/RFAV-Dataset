While many of us may be experiencing COVID-19 \"fatigue,\" it is not yet time to let down our guards. Instead, we must increase our level of vigilance and practice more thoughtfulness and more steps to prevent the spread than ever before. The pandemic has challenged everything from our physical and mental health to our resources and livelihood, and our safety. In some ways, we have no control over how the virus will affect us. However, the choices we make do help determine the impact of COVID-19 on our lives, including the precautions we take or don't take. The CDC continuously updates their guidelines based on new developments, so one of the best actions we can take is to frequently check their website for the latest COVID-19 safety information. To a degree, we also determine the subjects that will occupy our thoughts. Year after year, the holidays prompt us to practice gratitude and remember the many reasons we have to celebrate. While this year differs from previous years in several ways, this sentiment is not one of them. We remain grateful for all the good in our lives. Aside from the various personal milestones I know we are celebrating, the School of Medicine has had a very successful year despite the challenges of COVID-19. Our high-level accomplishments include: Various major CO VID-19 scientific advances for diagnosis, treatment and prevention, including successful vaccine candidates; Our medical education team's implementation of a Renaissance Curriculum that has shown great initial success; Achieving $563 million in FY20 for grants and contract awards, 4 percent ahead of FY19; Surpassing FY20 first quarter grants and contracts by 24% in FY21; Our clinical enterprise being ahead of budget for FY21, although now being challenged by the rise in COVID-19 cases and the anticipated reduction i n elective treatments.We also celebrated many significant occasions virtually, including Match Day, Graduation, our White Coat Ceremony, the State of the School Address, Medical Student Research Day, and many more. These successes and celebrations are products of a safe environment that has permitted our students to continue to learn, our physicians to continue to treat our patients, our scientists to continue to conduct research, and our staff to continue to work in various roles. The safeguards that the School of Medicine and the University of Maryland, Baltimore have collaboratively implemented and executed throughout this year also give us hope for even brighter days and greater achievements. In the coming months, we look forward to a new year, a new administration, and an end to this global pandemic. Please remain cautious and continue to make wise decisions throughout the holidays, including referring to the holiday travel guidance, which can be found on the the UMSOM website https ://www.medschool.umaryland.edu/news/ coronavirus/UMB-Holiday-Travel-Guidance--Guidelines /. Stay safe, stay healty, and stay hopeful. In the relentless pursuit of excellence, I am Sincerely Yours, E. Albert Reece, MD, PhD, MBA Executive Vice President for Medical Affairs, UM Baltimore John Z. and Akiko K. Bowers Distinguished Professor and Dean, University of Maryland School of MedicineDEAN'S MESSAGE ...is the success and the hope found in safety through the choices we make during this global pandemic. Continued on page 8Dr. Slobogean Named Director of Clinical Research for UMSOM Department of Orthopaedics Gerard Slobogean, MD, MPH , Associate Professor of Orthopaedics and an orthopaedic traumatologist at the R Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center, has been named the new Director of Clinical Research for UMSOM's Department of Orthopaedics. His appointment was announced by Andrew N. Pollak, MD, James Lawrence Kernan Professor and Chair of the Department of Orthopaedics. In his new role, Dr. Slobogean will oversee the development of a robust program for clinical research within the Department of Orthopaedics that Gerard Slobogean, MD, MPHSOM news Research &Discovery 2As 2020 comes to a close, so has one of the most successful initiatives in the history of the University of Maryland School of Medicine. Over the course of just three years, the special Trans-Disciplinary Recruitment Award Program (STRAP) has added dozens of top researcher-physician-scientists and biomedical scientists to the already outstanding ranks of UMSOM's faculty. ThiThe STRAP Initiative was led by Terry Rogers, PhD , Professor of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and Associate Dean for Research Development and Administration, along with the Office of Research Affairs (ORA) Director, Joni Prasad, PhD . Launched in 2017, the STRAP Initiative produced exceptional recruitment results, with the addition of preeminent physician- scientists and biomedical scientists to the UMSOM faculty, while further elevating the UMSOM's national and international research profile. In all, the STRAP Initiative attracted 26 teams of scientists from leading institutions across the U.S., with $101 million in total research funding at its conclusion. Faculty recruited in the STRAP Initiative came from a variety of leading academic institutions and from a diverse range of disciplines. Many were attracted to the exceptional resources of the newly constructed Health Sciences Research Facility (HSRF III) and its state-of-the-art laboratories, while others saw new opportunities to expand and collaborate across various research platforms. \"Louisa Peartree, MBA, Senior Associate Dean and Chief Operating Officer for the UMSOM, and her team in Finance and Administration deserve special recognition and thanks, as they provided critical support in helping to meet the specific laboratory and other resource requirements of the many STRAP recruits, as part of the occupancy program of the new HSRF III research building,\" Dean Reece said. Dean Reece and Dr. Rogers noted that the STRAP Initiative evolved and broadened during its three-year tenure. Many recruits were purposely recruited through the original established criteria. Over time, the definition expanded and evolved. Other top scientists, who were recruited during this STRAP period, came to the UMSOM faculty as part of a \"halo effect\" \u2014 in which many of the new scientists were attracted to join existing UMSOM faculty.According to Dr. Rogers, the result has been an infusion of highly talented researcher-physician-scientists and biomedical scientists who have brought tremendous synergy and opportunities for collaboration to the UMSOM. \"We have seen STRAP-recruited faculty dramatically expand the scope and impact of their research,\" Dr. Rogers said. \"Many have pointed to their ability to engage in crucial collaborations with our existing faculty. This has resulted in technology development start-ups, cutting edge interdisciplinary work, and partnerships leading to new drug development programs and future therapies.\" The STRAP Initiative was among recent components of UMSOM's multi-year research strategy called ACCEL-Med (Accelerating Innovation and Discovery in Medicine). ACCEL- Med was implemented in 2013 to increase the pace and scope of clinical and basic science research, and move the UMSOM to the top-upper echelon of research-intensive medical schools. The initiative included a slate of new programs, including the UMSOM's annual Festival of Science, the formation of a Scientific Advisory Council, a renewed focus on interdisciplinary research and collaboration, the opening of new core biomedical research facilities (CIBR), the introduction of the new course, Foundations in Research and Critical Thinking (FRCT) in the MD curriculum, and the development of a research continuum across the UMSOM, in which faculty, trainees, and students at all levels play a role in advancing science and discovery. The newest component of ACCEL-Med is the recently launched LGAP (Large Grant Award Program) Initiative, which aims to secure large NIH program project, center grants, or the equivalent grants. \"The tremendous success of the STRAP Initiative, along with the opening of Health Sciences Research Facility III, and the other components of ACCEL-Med, has significantly accelerated the upward trajectory of UMSOM as one of the leading biomedical research institutions in the nation,\" said Dean Reece. \"Our advanced laboratories and leading-edge technology in genomics, personalized medicine, cancer, and diagnostic imaging in the new facility are among the best in the world. Our teams of preeminent, well-funded physician- scientists and biomedical scientists are working on the most critical 'big science' research questions. Indeed, UMSOM's leadership position continues to rise among the upper echelon of research-intensive medical schools. \" Highly Successful Dean's Challenge Initiative Concludes \u2014 But Not Before Bringing on 26 Extraordinary Researchers with $101M in NIH Funding Terry Rogers, PhD Joni Prasad, PhD STRAP Sets the Bar for Succ ess$101M IN NIH RESEARCH FUNDING$101M IN NIH FUNDINGUniversity of Maryland School of Medicine Tracy L.

A respected and beloved member of the UMSOM community, her passing was mourned by all, with that sadness soon giving way to a collective determination to honor the memory of this trailblazer for equality, diversity, and inclusion in a substantial and lasting way. On Thursday, November 5, 2020, that resolve was confirmed by the announcement of a new tribute fund in Dr. Lowitt's honor. During a schoolwide virtual event held to celebrate Dr. Nancy Lowitt's legacy, UMSOM Dean E. Albert Reece, MD, PhD, MBA , Executive Vice President for Medical Affairs, UM Baltimore, and the John Z. and Akiko K. Bowers Distinguished Professor, announced the launch of the Nancy Ryan Lowitt, MD, EdM, Faculty Development Fund . Sponsored by the Office of the Dean and UMSOM's Women in Medicine and Science (WIMS), the fund commemorates her leadership and commitment through an annual award to an UMSOM faculty member whose academic leadership, cultural transformation work, commitment to excellence, and integrity reflect the high standards set by Dr . Lowitt during her 22-year tenure. As the Senior Associate Dean for Faculty Affairs & Professional Development, Dr. Lowitt was instrumental in developing and managing the implementation of UMSOM's Culture Transformation Initiative (CTI) , New Tribute Fund Honors the Life and Accomplishments of Dr. Nancy Ryan LowittSOM news Giving Matters which launched a school-wide program to ensure a diverse, inclusive, and respectful professional environment for everyone at the School. Part of that initiative included the founding of WIMS, which actively supports the professional and academic success of UMSOM women faculty through professional development opportunities and a range of resources. \"Nancy understood the fundamental importance of supporting faculty to be the best they can be,\" said Kimberly Lumpkins, MD, MBA , Associate Professor of Surgery and President of the WIMS Executive Council. \"It's an incredible pleasure to bring this fund in her honor to the faculty at our school.\" Its sponsors note that the Lowitt Fund, like its namesake, is focused on producing actionable results. \"This fund is essential to providing professional development resources for rising stars within our faculty,\" said Mary A. Pooton , UMSOM's Assistant Dean for Development. \"In this regard, the Fund seeks to follow the example and best practices set by Dr. Lowitt.\" Kimberly Lumpkins, MD, MBA Mary A. Pooton\"I describe Dr. Lowitt to others as a UMSOM \"treasure,\" and I will miss her dearly. During her career, Dr. Lowitt was committed to standing with students and faculty in their pursuit of excellence. She addressed the needs of graduate education and continuing medical education, cared deeply about mentoring women and developing faculty leaders, and valued empathy and integrity. We are all better for having known her. I hope you will join me in honoring Dr. Lowitt with a donation to the Nancy Ryan Lowitt, MD, EdM, Faculty Development Fund.\" - Dean ReeceUniversity of Maryland School of Medicine 5Nancy R. Lowitt, MD, EdM, FACP, a longtime University of Maryland School of Medicine (UMSOM) educator and national leader in faculty affairs and professional development, was known across the UMSOM community for her extraordinary compassion, collaborative spirit, and selfless demeanor. She was often described by colleagues across the UMSOM as one of the \"kindest, friendliest, and most caring people they knew.\" Dr. Lowitt had a distinguished career that provided her with a strong foundation for leadership in medical education and professional development. She received her AB Degree (Cum Laude) from Middlebury College in Vermont, followed by an EdM Degree from Harvard's Graduate School of Education and then an MD from George Washington University School of Medicine. She completed her residency in Internal Medicine at Harvard Medical School, New England Deaconess Hospital, and her fellowship in General Internal Medicine, Clinician Educator Track, at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. She also completed Facilitator in Training in both Teaching and Curriculum Development at Johns Hopkins. She served as Assistant, then Associate, then Program Director, of the General Internal Residency Program at Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center, and as a teaching attending in a primary care clinical practice. She was elected to Fellowship in the American College of Physicians in 1997. In 1998, she joined the Department of Medicine at the University of Maryland School of Medicine as Assistant Professor. Soon after arriving at the UMSOM, Dr. Lowitt was recruited to lead the School's Graduate and Continuing Medical Education programs as Associate Dean of Graduate and Continuing Medical Education. Over her 22-year tenure, she took on increasing responsibilities for major UMSOM faculty and organizational management functions \u2014 including faculty affairs, professional faculty development, conflict of interest, and culture transformation. Before her passing, she had been promoted to Senior Associate Dean for Faculty Affairs & Professional Development. Dr. Lowitt was widely recognized for her national leadership and involvement in medical education issues \u2014 serving for many years as a member of several committees of the Association of American Colleges (AAMC), the American College of Physicians, and the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education. She also had been active in educational program development and assessment locally, regionally, and nationally in Faculty Development. The UMSOM Teaching Portfolio for Promotion Curriculum is one that she had presented nationally, and had been disseminated and adopted at other institutions since 2002. She served as an external reviewer for the UCSF Academy of Medical Educators, and served as a member of national consensus conferences on Educational Scholarship convened by the AAMC. Earlier in 2020, Dr. Lowitt led the UMSOM to achieve Accreditation with Commendation from the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education. In perhaps her proudest accomplishment, Dr. Lowitt had taken the lead in developing and managing the implementation of the Dean's Culture Transformation Initiative (CTI) in 2018. Under her leadership, the CTI launched a school-wide program to ensure a diverse, inclusive, and respectful professional environment for everyone at the UMSOM. She then led implementation, in collaboration with UMB and UMMS, of a wide range of activities, programs and committees dedicated to making both short-term and long-term culture changes that continue to move forward- including policy enactment, professional development, equity in faculty promotions and compensation, and culture/climate research. For her many efforts, she was honored by the Daily Record as one of \"Maryland's Top 100 Women.\" Dr. Lowitt is survived by her husband, Mark Lowitt, MD, and their three children. Dr. Mark Lowitt served on the full-time faculty at UMSOM from 1993 to 2004 and is currently Adjunct Associate Professor in the UMSOM Department of Dermatology.

A tradition at the University of Maryland School of Medicine since 1997, the White Coat Ceremony is a key milestone occasion for first-year medical students, where they are presented with their traditional white coats, long the symbol of physicians and scientists. In past years, students have had their coats put on by School of Medicine faculty in welcoming their new colleagues to the profession of medicine. After being \"coated,\" students recite a Code of Honor acknowledging their acceptance of the obligations of the medical profession. In contrast, this year's November 10 ceremony, sponsored by the Whiting- Turner Contracting Company and the Medical Alumni Association, was held virtually via Zoom for the Class of 2024 and a select group of faculty and staff, and also live-streamed on YouTube for the larger UMSOM community and student families. Through the efforts of the Ceremony's Planning Committee \u2014 Donna L. Parker, MD, FACP , Associate Professor of Medicine and Senior Associate Dean for Undergraduate Medical Education ; Joseph P. Martinez, MD, FACEP, FAAEM , Associate Professor of Emergency Medicine and Medicine, and Associate Dean for Medical Education and Student Experience; Kerri A. Thom, MD, MS , Professor of Epidemiology & Public Health and Medicine, and Associate Dean for Student Affairs; Kristen McCartin, CMP , Events Specialist in the Office of Student Affairs; Mary Pooton , Assistant Dean for Development; and Natalie Rathell , Event Specialist, Office of Development \u2014 the event was hailed by all as a complete success. The special tone for the day was set in the opening remarks by UMSOM's Dean E. Albert Reece, MD, PhD, MBA . \"I know this is not what you imagined today would be like,\" he noted. \"Although the COVID pandemic has prevented us from physically gathering, we are joined together in spirit by collectively recognizing what this occasion means to all of us. Today marks a major milestone in what will surely be a momentous and lifelong journey.\" Along with observations made by various speakers (including Brad Lerner, MD, FACS '84 , President of the Medical Alumni Association, and UMSOM faculty members George C. Willis, MD , Assistant Professor of Emergency Medicine; John C. Allen, MD '14, Assistant Professor of Medicine and Assistant Dean for Student Affairs; and Dr. Thom), a number of UMSOM faculty members surprised students with video messages of support. In addition, when they were asked to don their white coats for the first time, students discovered personal notes of congratulations tucked into their pockets from UMSOM alumni. And, to demonstrate their collective diversity, students recited sections of the Code of Honor in their native languages, including Turkish, Yoruba, Farsi, Portuguese, and Polish.An additional highlight of the ceremony came in the remarks from two Class of 2024 students, Adaobi . \"We are a special class that started medical school during a global pandemic, and a racial justice pandemic as well,\" said Ahanotu. \"Despite this, I am truly in awe of how our class has maintained unity and support for one another. We have truly persevered.\" In turn, Alvarez urged her classmates to realize their common focus. \"I think many of you will find similarities in your path whether it is linear or not, \" she said. \"I want to encourage you to look back and embrace your path because it's brought all of us here and should be celebrated.\" Darby Moore '24 , Class of 2024 Student Government President, had nothing but praise for this virtual version of the White Coat Ceremony . \"The School did a beautiful job in putting the event together and making the best of the circumstances that we've been given,\" she said. \"I think they really upheld the tradition of the White Coat Ceremony, and maintained all of the true feeling in a virtual format.\" View the entire 2020 White Coat Ceremony here.

But more importantly, it had to do with the constant news about Americans suffering, especially in terms of so many going hungry. I felt like I needed to do something.\" Out on a run with his wife one day, the idea suddenly struck him. \"COVID-19,\" Dr. Mattu remembers thinking. \"Why, that almost sounds like the name of a race!\" From that seed of an idea, an entire event quickly took shape \u2014 a COVID-19 K race, which would be open to physicians, residents, residency graduates, and staff of UMSOM's Department of Emergency Medicine. Thanks to the organizational expertise of the department's conference planning specialist Doreen Lucadamo, CMP, HMCC, the program rapidly took off. Through a website set up exclusively for the COVID-19 K, registration for the race was made through a tiered donation to the Maryland Food Bank, a local non-profit organization working to end hunger in the state. In return for their donation and completion of their 19 K, the first 200 participants would receive an actual medal designed by Dr. Mattu. Race rules were simple: Participants needed to complete the distance of 19 kilometers (11.8 miles) over the course of two weeks, which was set for November 1-14. Any form of mobile exercise was permitted \u2014 running, biking, swimming, kayaking, even stationary walking on treadmills \u2014 as long as that distance was achieved and documented during the allotted time period. \"Given that so many of our faculty and residents enjoy exercise activities, and also the fact that they had two weeks to do it, I figured that we ought to be able to get at least 100 people to sign up.\" Dr. Mattu says. But he was wrong \u2014 in the best possible way. The COVID-19 K proved to be highly popular, attracting not just Emergency Medicine physicians, residents, and staff, but nurses, alumni, family members, and friends as well. An initial fundraising goal of $5,000 was quickly surpassed, and in the end, the virtual event raised $10,070 to feed the hungry in Maryland. While he admits to being \"pleasantly surprised\" by the outpouring of support, Dr. Mattu is already looking to expand the event in 2021. \"If there is another good cause, we will try to stage this race again on a broader level,\" he says. \"I think we can potentially make this a really great annual giving opportunity.\" University of Maryland School of Medicine 7 November / December 2020 Vol.22 N o.11/12Dr. Mattu displays the COVID-19 K medal that he designed.

To compete for such awards, Dr, Slobogean also will be responsible for promoting the development of a broad-based series of multicenter clinical investigations that demonstrate the department's expertise and capacity in those areas and serve as pilot work to refine and develop important clinical questions. Concurrently, with the support of fellow departmental faculty, he will develop and lead an educational program in clinical research to encourage future generations of investigators, including medical students, residents, fellows, and junior faculty, by supporting and mentoring them to become independently funded investigators. This educational program will seek to compete for a National Research Service Award (NRSA) Institutional Research Training Grant (T32) from the NIH National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NAIMS). This grant enables institutions to support pre-doctoral and postdoctoral research training for individuals in the fields of arthritis and musculoskeletal and skin diseases to pursue further career development through K- or F-series awards, and to develop into funded researchers in an academic setting. \"I think that this new position is about developing a larger, long-term, and sustainable research vision for the department,\" says Dr. Slobogean. \"I look forward to developing these larger initiatives and instilling a broader research-oriented philosophy across all the divisions "}
