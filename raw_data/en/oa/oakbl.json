Title of ~hesis/~issertation : The Vanishing Unicorn - A Study of Science vs. Superstition in Tudor Medicine. Author: ., , I (signature) Eric Victor Sangwine I (name ) April 8, 1975 (date) ABSTRACT Previous studies of Tudor medicine have found it dominated by superstition, its theory grounded in the mysterious and occult, its remedies derived from esoteric sources such as the bezoar stone and the horn of the fabulous unicorn- Such studies have placed unwarranted emphasis on the colorful aspects of Tudor medicine, however, and they have been further weakened by an inadequate definition of the terms \"science\" and 'lsuperstition.\" In attempting to determine which aspect - the scientific or the superstitious - dominated Tudor medicine, this thesis firstly endeavours to clarify the central concepts. Science is defined as the effort to understand and work with nature in a rational way, Scientific effort is restricted 1 by the current hypothesis or paradigm which gives it a basic order, The scientist, further, relies primarily on his reason aided by careful and methodical investigation, Superstition, on the other hand, is the attempt to interpret and sometimes manipulate nature through resort to the irrational, Superstitious beliefs and practices are often prompted by needs arising from the emotions, particularly the emotions of insecurity and fear, Some superstitions are not amenable to empirical investigation; others continue to be held even when they are shown to be false. When the medical views and procedures of Tudor doctors (viz. licensed physicians, surgeons, and apothecaries) are examined in the light of the above definitions, science and iii superstition are discovered to have operated in a different balance than has commonly been presumed, This thesis contends that science, rather than superstition, dominated orthodox medical practice, Tudor doctors had a paradigm in the humoral theory which postulated that disease resulted from an imbalance among man's body fluids, the humours. 1 Treatment consisted largely in the prescription of drugs with innate physical properties believed contrary to those of the disease-causing humour or humours. That Tudor doctors relied on human reason is clear from their efforts to prove the medical worth of drugs by personal clinical experience over long periods of time. The emphasis on rationality is also reflected in their attempts to underplay the use of bizarre and fantastical prescriptions, Such cures, moreover, seem to have been administered only in crisis situations, that is, when scientifically acceptable remedies proved ineffective . In Tudor times, medicine was practised also by a variety of social and regional &oups who operated outside the licensed profession, These groups included the gentle- women and midwives, the magi and charlatans, and the so-called \"cunning folk,\" Taken as a whole, the unorthodox healers present a wide diversity of practice, the gentlewomen approaching orthodox medical practitioners in their scientific attitude , the \"cunning folk\" relying on superstitious cures such as charms and incantations, the remaining groups at various points on the spectrum. General- iv ization is difficult amid such diversity, so the unregulated groups have been used chiefly as foils to emphasize the scientific aspects of orthodox practitioners who, I believe, were the vanguard of the medical profession in their day. A variety of documents has provided the source material necessary for the research of this thesis. The historical collection of medical literature in the Woodward Library, University of British Columbia, includes some rare first editions of Tudor medical works and these have been consulted whenever possible. Extensive use has also been made of primary source material available through facsimile editions and microfilm copies. Many such voLumes have been published under the title The English Experience and are found in the 1 collections of both Simon Fraser University Library and the Main library of the University of British Columbia. Xeroxed copies of Tudor medical books held in the British Museum have been obtained through the facilities of interlibrary loan. Unfortunately, the records of unlicensed medical practitioners are virtually non-existent. In an effort to fill this void, recourse has been made to the commentaries published by sixteenth century observers of irregular medicine. These commentaries are also readily available in the Vancouver area through facsimile reprints and microfilm. I wish to thank my parents for their support, and my supervisors, Dr. Hamilton and Dr. 3utchlnson, for their pidmce and constructive criticism. I am especially indebted to IIIJ mother whose cheerful brightness sustained me when 2 surfeit of melancholy threatened to disrupt ny humours. At least a 'ootnote should be reserved for Goblin, my eni-cnztic companioz during the isolated hours required to write thls thesis. TABLE OF CONTENTS .....................

In medical books of the time, we have, on one hand, the voice of the rational practitioner: tlSicknesses doth come many ways, as by surfetynge and euyl dyet, and to company with infectious people.\"' Yet medical 1 men of the period also had recourse to esoteric remedies like the Which of I these strains predominated, the scientific, or the occult and I ritualistic? This is the central question which the following I analysis attempts to answer. I But why choose medicine and especially English medicine I of the Tudor period for an investigation of science versus I superstition? The battle between science and superstition is, I as we know, ubiquitous. It pervades all fields of science, I and is as old as recorded history and as contemporary as the daily newspaper.3 Moreover, there was little difference '~ndrew Boorde, The Breuiarg fol. lxxxviii. '~ecentl~, for instance, an article in the Vancouver Sun reported that three hundred adults in Britain belong to the Fairies Investigation Society. This group has been in the process for thirty-six years now of spreading \"the fairy faith, collecting records from people who have seen, sensed or heard fairies and encouraging all possible field work.\" The same ar- ticle also reported that science is fighting back. One bit of evidence which the Society has treasured as positive proof of the existence of fairies is a photograph which is supposed to show fairies dancing in a Yorkshire glen. Yet Brian Cole, curator of the Kodak Photographic Museum in London, has said -2- between English medicine of the Tudor period and continental medicine of the same time. The field of medicine suggests itself because it is intimately connected with the lives of everyone. Tudor nedi- cine has been chosen for the following study partly because of its inherent fascination. Our examination will bring us into contact with dragon's blood, Egyptian mummies, and the fabulous unicorn's horn, all of which played a role in rnedi- cine during Tudor times. But there is also a scholarly basis for our choice. Several medical historians believe the Tudor period to be a time of rapid advance in medical science, both in its practi- cal and theoretical aspects, and therefore a period of more than usual interest. They point out, for example, that during the sixteenth century the doctors and the central government in England tried to raise the professional status of medicine by founding the College of Fhysicians and the Company of Barber-Surgeons. The two organizations were supposed to examine and license all physicians and surgeons, initially in London alone. Yet though the regulatory power of the Company of Barber-Surgeons remained confined to the Capital during Tudor tices, the power of the College of Physicians had been extended by 1600 to cover the whole that modern photographic processes have positively identified the photo as a picture of cardboard cut-out-fairies. Michael Cope, \"Fairies DO exist, claims U.K. society,\" Vancouver Sun, 1 Gct. 1373, p. 38, cols. 1 - 2. realm. By the end of the sixteenth century, the College of Physicians also was supposed to inspect and test apothecariest drugs in London and elsewhere, 4 Regarding the theoretical aspect of Tudor medicine, many medical historians point to such rapid developments as the rejection of classical medical texts as the sole basis of medical truth, This advance, they add, was in response to I crisis, The appearance in the Tudor period of new diseases unknown to ancient medical authorities forced doctors of the later period to work from direct observation, This furthered the development of scientific medicine and will. subsequently be considered at length, At the sane time, William Shakespeare's plays testify to the common pre-occupation with all sorts of magic: the ghost of Hamlet, the witches ol Macbeth, and the fairy kingdom of A Midsummer Nightt s Dream, It is not surprising, then, to find superstitious beliefs appearing in medical theory and practice: for example, the belief that the herb alysson \"hanged in the house, or at the gate or entrie keepeth both man and beast from enchantments and witching,~~ or that \"the blacke gra-ines number 4~t is sonctines overlooked that provincial barber- surgeons compxxi.es in Chester, IIereTord, and St. Albans probably date from the I5OO1s since they are first mentioned in documents during that era, Like similar bodies in other provincial cities including Bristol, Norwich, and York, all of which had been incorporated in the Middle Ages, the new cor- porations tried to supply rural areas with qualified surgeons. In the following analysis, it has been assumed that the provincial barber-surgeons'companies shared the same medical views as the London company, '~embrant Dodoens, A Niewe Herbal1 or Historte of Plantes -4- in wine or meade is a specially remedy for those that are troubled with the disease called . . . night Mare. 11 6 Randolph S. Klein of Wisconsin State University even goes so far as to presume that the marvellous and fantastical were of major importance in English medicine four centuries ago. In outlining his case, Klein first draws attention to the findings of Lynn Thorndike of Columbia University. Thorndike has read widely in the literature of mystic doctors on the European continent. His investigations have led him to the declaration that magic, astrology, and the occult would have been welco~e in any decade of the sixteenth century since \"they constituted the vortex in which all works upon nature and medicine of that century had to whirl. lt7 In describing continental medical practices, Thorndike has over- looked works where irrational aspects play at best secondary rolesO8 Nevertheless, Klein accepts his conclusion and (London, 1586), p. 119. 6~ohn Gerard, The Berball (london, l597), p. 984.. horndik dike, History of Magic and Experimental Science, vol.

More information which suggests that the practice of medicine was more rational on the continent during Tudor times than Thosndike would nllow appears in maladies contagieuses et la Faculte mgdecine de Paris, de 1399 3 1511 ,I' Bulletin de la Societe francaj se dt histoire de 1s mkdecine, vol. I 4 pp. 25 - 29. iickersheimer indicates that when the Faculty of Medicine -5- extends it to Tudor En~land which Thorndike deals with only superficially. Klein feels justified in doing this because he believes that \"England looked to Europe for medical ideas and leadership\" during the sixteenth centuryO9 Yet this argument also needs qualification. True, continental works were read in En&md and developments in that country often paralleled developments on the continent, as already noted. Nonetheless, it will be shown that most English doctors rejected the mysticisn of the continent, particularly in its theoretical aspects. Special reference should be made here to sources used for the following analysis as these sources have considerably influenced the choice of topic. The libraries at Simon Fraser Universit~ ad the University of British Columbia house a wealth of primary documents related to Tudor medicine. Extensive use has been made of the exact and full-size facsimile editions of rare books published by da Capo Press of New York and Theatrum Orbis Perrarum of Amsterdam under the general heading of The English Experience. The facsimile editions are recent acquisitions to Simon Fraser University in Faris shunned public baths in 1500 it probably did so for fea~ that syphilis would be contracted by \"la chaleur, la rarefaction de 1' air, 1' ouverture la peau, (et) les assemblQes du peuple.\" The enphasis, then, appears to have been on factors from man's ?rnnediate environment which are more anenable to investigation than nagical or supernatural explanations. 9Klein, \"History of Medicine in Tudor Tines, p. 373. Library and to date have not been used much by the academic body. They are not restricted to medicine, of course, and should prove a valuable resource for many areas of study in the Tudor period and beyond since they encompass the years 1450 to 1640. In addition, use has been made of the large collection of rare books found in the microfilm collection at the University of British Columbia Main Library. All of them are listed in Pollard's and Redgrave's Short-Title catalogueqo and most of the medical books available are also listed in Russell's \"A Check List of Medical Books published in English before 1600 \"\" and Barlow's \"Old hglish Herbals: 1525 - 1640.\"~~ Further use has been made of published ex- tracts from Tudor books and documents like Dunhame's Complaint md Reforn in England: 1436 - 1714. 13 Although the specified time period fop the present I analysis is the sixteenth century, there has been some I spilling over into the fifteenth and seventeenth centuries I in the selection of primary source material.

However, since medical practitioners of the time also read a number of treatises published on the continent, additional references have been made to these works. For the sake of flavour, all quotations from prinzry source materials have been cited with minimal changes. In general, the original spellings of words have been retained. Capitals, however, have been introduced at the beginning of sentences which lacked them and contractions have been expanded: for instance \"thE\" for then, .\"$\" for with, I? I' for per, \"9\" for the, and \"5\" for on. Occasionally parts of 1 quotations have been deleted when their inclusion would have obscured the meaning of the whole for the modern reader. Sometimes, too, interpolations have been made in brackets to help clarify the meaning of quotations. In punctuation no changes have been made except for the deletion of periods in the middle of sentences. It has been impossible, of course, to reproduce quotations'in the beautiful \"gothic\" or \"black letter1' type in which most Tudor medical treatises were printed. Yet an attempt has been made to explain all archaic or foreign words and phrases either in the quotations themselves or in footnotes. -8- CHAPTER I SCIENCE AND SUPERSTITION DEFIMED The subject of this thesis has already been dealt with by a nunber of investigators. As yet, however, nost studies have been weakened by the assumption that the scientific attitude involves those aspects of Tudor medicine in which the researcher himself happens to believe and that supersti- tion is the converse. One such investigator, C. F. Smout of the University of Birmingham, rejects the following: witch- craZt, 2strology, the theory of the humours, and medicines made from earthworms, all of which he associates with super- stition.14 Another, B. J. Gordon, M. D., has no patience with uroscopy, relics, and amulets ad therefore dismisses them as superstitious.15 On the other hand, both Gordon and Srnout are favorably disposed towards the use of ligatures to control hemorrhages in anputations. l6 Consequently, their writings suggest that sixteenth century doctors who used ligatures were scientific. Our first objective, then, has been to arrive at an adequate understanding of science and superstition. Since these terns appear diametrically opposed, the task of distinguishing between then would seem a simple one. But it - I + The Story of the Progress of Medicine (Bristol: John Wright, 1964), p. 79. 15Nedieval and Renaissance 759. 16~rnout, p. 77; Gordon, p. 672. is surprising how quickly our definitions land us in diffi- culties, One such difficulty arises from the subjective nature of superstition noted above. Because of its personal and irrational aspects, the phenomenon is easier to recognize in others than in ourselves. Another problem rises from the fact that areas of science and superstition have changed over the centuries so that what may be regarded as scientific in one age may be condemned as superstitious in another. Alchemy and astrology are classic illustrations of this, For several centuries they were regarded as sciences but now they are considered, at best, as pseudo-sciences by all but a fes.I7 The problem of defining terms is further complicated because superstition and science turn out, surprisingly, to have some aspects in commor_. Both the scientist and the magician see the world as governed bg laws, for instance, thou.& their interpretation of these laws differs. Again, both believe that they must aclmowledge these laws as they interpret then iT their actions'are to be effective. As will be seen later, the scientist, as well as the magician, uses his imagination, and is seldom, if ever, entirely free from his emotions. On the other hand, the magician, like the I7~his raises questions as to the relationship between science, pseudo-science, a-nd superstition. For the purposes of this thesis, alcheny and astrology will not be considered nerely as pseudo-science in the sense of being false and erroneous but will be vievaed as superstitions because of their supernaturel elements. - 10 - scientist, sonetimes attempts to supply reasons (howsoever erroneous) for natural phenomena. Furthermore, when we try to define superstition, some effort must be made to distinguish it from religion since there appear to be similarities between the two. To take one instmce, both are associated with beliefs in supernatural forces, such as spirits, ghosts, dead culcestors, or deities. A clear understanding of the role of religion is dl the more necessary because it played an influential part in Tudor medicine. Tlevertheless, in spite of these and other diffi- culties, the terms \"science\" and \"superstitionf1 convey distinct ad separate rnemin~s. ' It is khese which we wish to draw out and to clarify. , The word \"science\" comes from the Latin root, scientia, meaning knowledge, and nay be defined further as the pursuit of knowledge about the real or natural world. This definition presumes, noreover, thct the natural world behaves in a pre- dictable fashion, that it has unchanging ways which man can discover through his rctional faculty. For the purposes of this analysis, however, we xi11 be think in^ of science in more restrictive terns, as that form of rational endeavour which men perform within the barriels of a pa.rc?dic~. By paradigm, we refer not to the linguistic model but to the governing hypothesis accepted by a community of investigators at a given time and in a specific field. Exaxples might be Aristotlels analysis of notion or Newtonian mechanics. The paradigm gains acceptance, in part, because its achievement is sufficiently unprecedented to attract the scientific com~lunity away from competing modes of sci- entific activity, Simultmeously, it is sufficiently open- ended to allow several kinds of problems for the scientific community to solve methodically, The \"mopping up operations\" of science may involve the verification of an accepted fact, thus demonstrating apeement between paradign and nature, The paradigm may be partially, or even largely, in error, but this in itself does not undermine its importance, The im- portant contribution of the paradigm is that it delineates an area within which a particular scientific community (in our case, Tudor doctors) can operate, Without this delineation, scientific movement is random, diffuse, and shallow, and no 1 real progress can be nade, This is the definition presumed in the book, - The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, b;: Dr. Thoms Kuhn of the University of ~a1ifornia.l~ In his discussion of the paradigm, Kulm is psrticularly interested in the appearance of a najor m-onaly to the current h;rpothesis, Minor anomalies, he notes, may be dealt with by ad hoc elaborations of the paraclign or may rernain outstanding research problems, But a najor anomaly produces grezt confusion until someone proposes a nev naradig~n which xi11 encompass its unrcesolved featuyes. The fight is then on between the old paradip and the new. In the scienti5c revolution which follows, the new paradigm r, loscientific Revolutions (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Press, 1963). - 12 - overthrows the old and thereafter the cycle repeats itself. Two major paradi~cs, says Kubn, cannot occupy the same field, though, on the other hand, the achievements of the old para- digm are never coinpletely forgotten. Kuhn's analysis ern- phasizes the vitality, creative force, and conflicting pressure o.C scientific progress. But for present purposes, this is less important than the part played bp the paradigm itself and its effects on scientific progress. As suggested above, a second aspect of science, in the narrow, practical sense of the word, is the scientific method. As J. A. Thomson, former Regius Professor of I?atural History in the University of Aberdeen, points out, the first step in the scientific study of a problem is to collect data. The investigator nust exhibit at this point certain virtues: \"Precision and exhaustiveness of observa- tion, patience to 60 on collecting, impartiality to whatever is forthcoming, watchfulness against the deception of the senses, and humility to learn from previous mistakes\" made by himself and other researchers. A second step is the accurate registration oS the data tnto their most useful state. It may be, for instance, that the data are not fully uselul until they have been further analyzed or reduced to sir~ipler form, %o a conncon denominator with sets of facts with which they have to be compared. Following this \"comes the find in^ 02 a fornula to Sit all the facts, or more Irequently, the new set of facts is shown to be in conformity with a - 13 - previously established law. ,,I9 A common misconception on the part of the layman is that the scientific method ends here. Thomson goes on, how- ever, to emphasize that a contrzsting but no less important aspect of the scientific method lies in the domain of imagina- tion. He writes: In the discovery of a formula that fits, the in- vestigator is often helped by a flash of insight. In other cases, one hypothesis after another may have to be made before a solution is found. And whether the formulation is researched imaginately or laboriously, whether it comes as a brilliant deduction Irora some previously established law or as a patient induction and deduction, it has to be tested, criticized and verified before it is allowed to rise to the rank of a theory. 20 The main point we wish to make here is that however methodical the scientific method may seem to be, it is never wholly cut and dried, Rather, the scientist, like the magician, also draws on the dimly comprehended reserves of his intuition and his imagination. A debate hzs continued for,many years, not only among scientists themselves but among laymen concerning the extent of science. Should science be restricted to purely intellectual study, or should it be extended to include the realm of practical activity? The question has particular relevance to medicine which includes both theoreticd and 19~hornson, \"Science, \" in Enc;,xlopaedin of Religion end Ethics, ed. James Hastings (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1918), vol. XI, p. 567. - 14 - practical aspects. In assuming that medicine is a science we are, of course, taking the stand that science includes both theoretical and practical aspects. Another contentious issue involves the attitude of the scientist to nature. Some scholars emphasize the need for humility, for they believe too much self assurance deters the scientist from the purely intellectual aim of unraveling the mysteries of nature. Others take a more aggressive approach. Viewing nature as man's adversary, they point out that man may use the theoretical findings of science to help himself in what is at best an unequal struggle to control nature. This second stand may seem to reflect the attitude of the magician who attempts to mmipulate nature through his understanding of the laws of sympathy and antipathy. It is the contention of this thesis that an important difference exists between the scientist and the magician, however. The scientist seeks to understand nature on its otm terms. The magician, on the other hand, strives for irrational mastery over nature which he interprets according to his own needs and emotions. In short, his quest is really for power rather than understanding. In this thesis, then, science is seen as the rational attempt to interpret the natural world which, presumably, behaves in a regular and predictable fashion. Scientific endeavour takes place within the boundaries of the paradigm and is implemented by what is called the \"scientific method,\" the collection of data involving careful measurement, - 15 - observation, and interpretation. Such acts must be performed with painstalrin~ patience, and often repeated many times and supplemented by imagination. The stereotme which equates science with the calm axalytical world of the laboratory is inadequate, for scientific progress also involves intuition, stress, and upheaval. Finally, for the purposes of this ex- position, science is taken to involve both man's search for knowledge and his attempts to control his environment through the practical application of his insights concerning the laws of nature - When we turn our attention from science to superstition, we move from the objective world to occult and supernatural realms. In this area, magical beliefs and practices often hold sway, These derive primarily from the centuries old principles of sympathy and antipathy, The principle of spnpathy assumes a priori the existence of affinities between things which may be used to produce desired effects, For instance, it was generally believed hundreds of years ago that the stag's horn, consumed in powdered form, counteracted poison because it too was poisonous. On the other had, the principle o? antipathy assumes a priori the existence of antagonisms between thinzs which may be used to produce desired effects. One such example would be the ancient belie; thzt the flesh of elephants, when burnt, drove away serpents because of the antagonism betsl:een the two animals, The principles of sympathy and antipathy originate, then, not in empirical reasoning but in associative thinking, and - 16 - ultimately in man's imagination. Yet it would be unfair to move immediately to the conclusion that reasoning based on the laws of sympathy and antipathy is necessarily supersti- tious if not downright erroneous. On the contrary, assuming the truth of the basic laws, many procedures can be supported rationally. While rationally supportable, others, however, may involve the bizarre and fantastical to an inordinate degree, or may not be subject to empirical investigation. One of the tests of the superstitious disposition is that the believer cleaves to esoteric or supernatural explanations when natural explanations have been shown efficacious. Complicating matters still further is the fact that the original explaations which give meaning to magical synbolism tend to become forgotten with the passage of time. When people continue to employ superstitions without regard for their origins, their usages degenerate into stereotmed ritual. Another useful distinction has been drawn between super- stition and error by Horace and Eva English, two American psychologists. They write that \"beliefs having no reference to the magical or the supernatural, even though scientifically unsupportable, are better called misbeliefs and errors or (when stubbornly held in the face of evidence) prejudice. 11 21 A well known instance of such prejudice is the belief in the 21~ Comprehensive Dictionary of Psycholo~ical and Psycho- analytical Terms (New York: David McKay, l958), p. 536. - 17 - geocentric universe which wzs stubbornly adhered to by most sixteenth century intellectuals even though Copernicus furnished strong arguments for heliocentricity. An important aspect of superstition is the atmosphere in which it thrives. In the following analysis, we have adopted the view that superstition flourishes when man confronts his world with a feeling of impotence. This impotence nay be exacerbated by temporary crises, but it is always present to a certain degree because of the ultimate mystery of life. Dr. Hugo Magnus, a German scholar, emphasizes the second aspect in his book, Superstition in Medicine. Magnus notes that science can never give man complete and final answers regarding natural phenomena. Yet , at the same time, man has a compelling need to reflect on the ultimate mystery of life and in some way bring it within his comprehension. Confronted with his impotence, and his need, man turns to superstition (and also to religion). 22 On the other hand, Bronislaw Malinowski, an American anthropologist, sees superstition rising out of man's inadequacy in the face of day-to-day crises. In his work among the Trobrian islanders, Malinowski found primitives turning to magic when confronted by problems outside their normal situation, and for which they had no practical solution. In such situztions, says Malinowski, the control which magic offers is delusive. Nevertheless, it mitigates fear and the Magnus, Superstition in Medicine, tr. Julius L. Salinger (~ew York: Punk and Wagnalls, 1905), pp. 1 - 2. sense of helplessness and gives the practitioner the im- pression that he is doing something positive towards the solution of the problem. 23 Dr. George Steiner, deliverer of the 1974 CBC Massey Lectures, draws attention to the loss of confidence in our own time which he attributes to the ecological breakdown, inflation, the threat of a nuclear holocaust, and the loss of absolute values. Consequently, Steiner feels there has been a mushrooming of superstitions, as illustrated by the following curiosa: sales from astrological literature in western industrial societies today runs at twenty-five million dollars annually and practising astrologers in the United States now exceed by a factor of three to one the total number of physicists and chemists in American scientific bodies. 24 Perhaps we may shed some final light on superstition by comparing it with its near relative, religion. We noted earlier that both concepts have close bonds with the supernatural. Superstition and religion are also alike in that they often supply mankind with explanations for personal misfortune, including disease and death. The concept of supernstural or divine punishment is not so much in evidence in the western world today. Yet anthropologists tell us that \"~~~alinoioski, \"magic, Science and Religion, \" in Magic Science and Relirion, and other Essays (1948; rpt. Garden City, Uew York: Doubleday, 1954), pp. 17 - 92. 24~teiner, I1ostalp;ia for the Absolute, Lecture IV (\"The Little Green Men\"), broadcast over CBC AH Radio, 31 October, - 19 - it still exists in primitive societies and parish records suggest that it was very much in evidence in Tudor England. Consider, for example, the parish records of Cranbrook, Kent. Bere we read that when the pestilence exploded in Cranbrook during 1597 - 98, the local curate attributed the outbreak to divine displeasure with the totmts sins, particularly \"that vice of drunkenness which did abound here. w25 The laity, too, believed in this kind of explanation, but might also attribute the pestilence to superstitions such as the evil conjunction of certain stars. Despite the similarities between superstition and religion, essential differencestremain. Whereas religion is viewed as an end in itself, sup,erstition is seen merely as a means to an end. Superstition frequently turns around specific problems while religion always refers to \"fundamental issues of humzn existence.\" Popular superstitions, at least, discharge only a limited number of functions, such as the protection against supernatural forces which are evil. But popular superstitions, unlike religion, never offer \"a comprehensive view of the world, an explanation of human existence, or the promise of a future life. ,, 26 We are now in a position to draw attention to some of the ':c. E. Woodruff, In Inventory of the Parish Registers and Cther Records in the Diocese of Zznterbur3~ (Canterburj, 1922), pp. - (IJew York: Charles ~cribne? s Sons, 1'371 1, p. 86. - 20 - broad differences between science and superstition. Where science is concerned with the natural world and its laws, superstition frequently has recourse to the supernatural which is beyond empirical proof. Opposed to science's emphasis on reason and rationality, superstition appeals to the irrational and emotional side of man's nature. The scientist uses in- ductive and deductive methods in his quest for truth whereas the practitioner of superstition adheres to false premises and faulty logic. In contrast to the procedures commonly designated as the scientific method, superstition often comprises rituals which have become devoid of their original meaning. The scientific attitude predominates in those area.s where man has confidence in his ability to interpret nature while superstition flourishes where man is most exposed to feelings of fear and of helplessness. Science attempts to to see things as they Ere; superstition views things as man would like them to be. Science works within a limited area amenable to reason and defined bz the current paradigm; superstition caters to a wider realm - to man's need for emotional fulfillment, to the deep drives of the unconscious levels of his mind, to his desire for immortality, and his huncer for answers which science cannot provide. Ultimately these drives account for the prevalence of superstition in Tudor times as well as in our own. CHAPTER I1 THE ORTHODOX MEDICAL FROFESSION~~- ETIOLOGY, PROGNOSIS, AND DIAGNOSIS Recently Eric Maple, a writer of popular history, has dismissed medical explanations for disease28 four centuries ago with the curt remark that witchcraft and demonology dominated them.29 It is, of course, true that most Tudor doctors believed in witches and demons3' who were supposed to exercise their malign powers in a variety of ways. Both might resort to maledictions, for instance, which in due course were supposed to cause disease. Demons also might \"possess\" their victim's body simply by entering it since they were considered incorporeal beings. This power was denied witches who were believed to have bodies of their om. Witches, on the other hand, might cause disease by piercing 27~n this analysis, the term \"orthodox medical profession\"has been used to describe licensed physicians, surgeons, and apothecaries, These three groups have also been referred to collectively as \"doctors\" to emphasize the con- trast between their approach to medicine and that adopted by most unlicensed medical practitioners who are discussed in chapter four. 28~he definition of the term \"disease\" underwent some changes during the period 1493 - 1623. In 1493, the term \"disease\" was defined as a t'molestation;\" in 1526, as an \"ailment;\" and in 1623, as an \"absense of ease, uneasiness, inconvenience, annoyance, disturbance, or trouble. It C.

'Y~he Dark World of Witches (London: Pan Pocket Books, 1965), p. 34. The continued appeal of Maple's work today is attested to by a recent re-issue of the original hardcover edition of 1962. 30~he only known exception to this rule was a Dr. Browne (no relation to Sir Thomas ~rowne) of Norwich who categori- - 22 - a victim with emanations from their eyes. They could also make malicious charms out of the herbs rue and vervaine, or they could inflict evil on an intended victim by fashioning his image in wax and sticking it with pins. Aids like these were supposed to work by occult antipathies, the theoretical basis of which was outlined in chapter one. The aforementioned beliefs were centuries old by Tudor times and they would find a favorable environment in the revival of Platonism which occurred in England during the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. To do justice to this ancient philosophy would require a separate study in itself, however. Suffice it to say that neo- Platonism envisioned the universe as populated with demons and pulsating with magical forces which might be utilized by witches for evil deedsO3' Nonetheless, my examination of Tudor medical manuscripts seems to indicate that neo-Platonism did not have an extensive following among doctors. Contemporary religion furnishes another more likely explanation for the orthodox medical profession's continued belief in witches and demons since some doctors were also clergymen and almost all were devout Christians. Both cally denied the existence of witches in 1578. See Thomas, Religion and the Decline of Magic, pp. 579 - 80. 31~ fuller discussion of neo-Platonism and its ties with belief in the black magic associated with witchcraft appears in Thonas' book, pp. 437 - 38. Gn neo-Flatonism and demonology, the most satisfactory brief account is Magnus, Superstition in Medicine, pp. 101 ff. - 23 - Renaissance Cztholicisn and Protestantism, in their efforts to account for evil and misfortune in a univefse they believed ruled by a beneficent and 211-perfect deity, affirmed the reality 02 witches demons, It must be recognized, however: that the powers of darl7aess t.:cre never thou@t to hxe complete freedom to work out their macbinztions for that would have denied God's omnipotence. Rather, witches and demons were inagined to operate only when God permitted thea to do so in order to punish man Tor his sins, It is my contention, hoilrever, that Naplc has greatly exaggerated the hold of witchcraft and demonology on Tudor doctors. Extensive research into relevant documents has revealed no books based entirelj on the witchcraft interpre- tation of disease. Further, onlg one study has been found devoted cor?.pletely to the premise that the malevolent actions of demons we responsible for personal misFortune. The study carries the title 1nte~;rur.i MorSorum 14ysteriurzl (The Thole Mystery of Disease), and was written in the early seventeenth century bz Dr. Robert Fludd. Fludd, so far as I can discover, was the only physician 01 his time who was also an outright neo-I?latoni~t.~* In contrast, other medical books of the era written by Drs. John Jones znd ?hilip Barrbough make no mention at all of witches and demons.33 Then there is Dr. Prjncis '2 '' 2ludd ' s e:ork being unattainable, my ovm acquai-ntance with it has reading Sona Rosa Burstein, 11 Denlonolog;.

Here it is enou@ to say that Tudor doctors believed the hurnoral theory fell within the realm of naturd etiological factors. In other words, the hunoral theory operated as the scientific paradigm for doctors four centuries ago. Othes medical writings of'the time are openly skeptical about the workings of evil spirits though their power is not denied in toto. For instance, in Bullein's Bulwarke thereby soche. 35 It might be suspected here that Bullein is implying, ironically, thzt there are no witches or devils at all. Elsevhere in his book, hov~ever, BulleFn does give some evidence of superstitious belief for he beseeches God to The Pletkode ol vii. \"deliuer us with against all soche euill spirites. \"36 Moreover, spirite, Bullein does not deny witches might \"prouoke, bewitche, or cast men into madde blind fantasies, or f anc [ij es, called Loue\" with charms made from the mandrake though he prefers think of love as \"noisome beastly and when . . . wrought by foolishnes. 11 37 A medical work by Edward Jorden, a physician of London and later of Bath during the late sixteenth and early seven- teenth centuries, expresses similar sentiments: I doe not deny that there may.be both possessions by the Diuell, and obsessions and witchcraft, &c. . . , But examples being verie rare now adayes, I would aduise men to be very circumspect in pronouncing of a possession, 38 Jorden ' s contemporary, Dr. John Cotta of Northampt on, also was chary about repudiating the possibility of evil spirits as etiological factors, but added: the common amazed thoughts of vulgar people to be blasted by the stupiditie of euery idle feare, to gape after witchcraft, or to make nature a diuell or a bugbeare, must needs be base pro- cliuitie and vnlearned lightness. . . . Those whom true learning and wisedome hath well instructed, know how to stay themselves, and to consist in a temperate mediocritie betweene both these. 39 \\ This attitude is expressed once more in a book by Dr. John 3b~ dialo~ue the Mother (1603; facsimile rpt. New York: da 1971), s. v. Epistle Dedicatorie. By obsessions, Jorden means \\ the maledictions to which devils were believed to resort in order to trouble mankind. - 26 - IIalle of Ikiidstone, Kent, who prefaces the story of a supposed case of vitchcra1t with the statement: seeneth to proue that there by l:!e have seen, then, that though Tudor doctors believed in the povers of evil, they subjected these beliefs to skeptical scrutiny which is the hallmark of the scientific zttitude. It is to be expected, therefore, that belief in the n&i.gn influence of witc5es and devils played a minor role in medical practice. In Pact, nost Tudor doctors reso~tcd to superstition only when the circumstances surrounding a disease were bizarre or simply unaccountable within the limits of their past experience. Such an environment is, oi' course, most conducive to superstition, as noted in chapter one. For instance, when the young son of a certain John Adome was afflicted with a strange crippling disease in 1496 or 1497 - the exact date is un- certain - the family doctors blamed a Another instance involved f ourteen-year-old Mary Glover who fell into strange \"fittes . . so fearfull, that a11 that that she would dye\" in 1602. Mary's Sherdman and Thomas Moundefourd, at first diawosed a natural cause for her illness but when three months of treztment failed to be efzective, they changed their diagnosis to witchcraft.42 A similar case involved f ourteen-year-old Anne Gunter who fell victim to \"hysterical passions and paraljtical convulsions\" in the summer of 1604. Her father, a gentleman of Morth Moreton, consulted the most eminent physicians of the region, Henry Bust, John C5ennel1, and Feter Williams, who at first suggested thst Anne pins sufzering from \"suffocation of the mother\" (i.e. hysteria) or \"falling siclmess\" (i.e. epilepsy). But Anne's illness was not amenable to treatment and in desperation it would appear her doctors changed their diaposis to witch- craft, 43 The forces of evil might also be invoked to explain bizarre deaths. For example, when the Earl of Derby died suddenly after a brief illness in 1596, his doctors explained away his death as the result of witchcraft, In this case, the fact that the Earl had cried out in his illness that his doctors laboured in vain to save him because he was bewitched 4- l G, L.

Once more, recourse to the supernatural appears to have met man's need to account .for the inscrutable. Par from doainzting etiology as Maple contends, however, witchcraft and demonology played at best secondary roles in medicine four centuries ago. Rather than view disease in the context of the magical and the occult, most doctors chose to work within what was for them a scientific paradigm; the p~rzdigm of humoral theory. The theory of the hu~ours postulated that the fluid substances of man's body were four humours - blood, phlecrn, melancholy (or black bile) and choler (or yellow bile). In health, the proportions of these hurnours were supposed to be in balwce. In disease, itwas assumed that the bzlance had become disturbed thr0ugh.m UI- abnormal condition in one more the humours. Dysentery and plague, for instance, were assumed to rise from unnatural blood. Struma, dropsy, palsy, and quotidians (fevers characterized by the occurrence of a paroxysm every 44~. B. Harrison, ed., The 1603 (Ann Arbor: Book 11, p. 297 45~bid. , Book I, p. 225. - 29 - day) were believed to come from unnatural phlegm. Diseases considered to be the result of 'an abnormal condition of melancholy included pleurisy, hardness of the spleen, and quartans (fevers chnrac terized by the occurrence of a paroxysm every fourth day). Abnormal choler was thought to be the source of yellow jaundice and tertians (fevers charecterized by the occurrence of n paroxysm every third dad Factors held responsible for the abnormalities or disease causing conditions of the humours were categorized under the so-called \"six unnaturals\": inhalation of fetid air, excessive or ill-judged eating and drinking, carelessness regarding evacuation of body wastes, insufficient or improper exercise, perturbations of the mind, and immoderete sleeping. All this theory wan taken from the writings of classical medical authorities, especially Aippocrates and Galen, who were regarded as the fathers of medicine. The classics, of course, had been revered during the Niddle Ages, but in the late fifteenth snd sixteenth centuries emphasis on them in- creased to the point that a real change resulted. Historisns have explained this change, in part, by the rediscovery of classical texts hitherto lost, such as some of Galen's more importat writings. Also responsible for the new interest in antiquity was the sudden spread of the teaching of Greek in the lest quarter of the fifteenth century. In England, this was partly caused by the presence of Greek scholars who ? hod fled Constnntinople after its fall to the Turks in 1453 - 30 - and partly by the interest of important men like John Ankwyll. Ankwyll was hezdmaster of Nagdalen College School at Oxford where many hezdnasters of the early Tudor period were trained. Further impetus to the classical revival came from the development of print in^. The first English printing press had been set up by Villiam Caton in 1476 and by the opening of the sixteenth century there were.many more, such as those operated by Edward Whitechurch and William Middleton, all of which published renditions of classical medical works. Without the development of printing, the classical revival would have taken place, but it would not have been as rspid or as widespread as it turned out to be. It must be stressed, however, that the classical revival did not amount to a servile dependence on the writings of Galen, Hippocrates, and other medical authorities from antiquity. As in the case of neo-Platonism, those aspects of the classical heritage which attempted to explain bodily misfortune through recourse to the magical, esoteric, and fantastical were given little weight. For example, I have found only one medical work which discusses the harpy and the griffin, two fabulous monsters the ancient world had believed would tear man apart if they caught him. Significant also is the fact that the work, which carries the title Hortus Sanitatis (The Garden of ~ealth), was extremely unpopular among Tudor doctors, no doubt because of the attention it gives to irrational health hazards like the illustrations just \\ cited. The original Latin version of the Hortus Sanitatis appeared on the continent towards the end of the fifteenth century. Yet there was only one English edition which is referred to in no other English medical literature published in the sixteenth century. 46 Another mythical monster discussed in the Hortus Sanitatis is the basilisk which the ancient world had thought to be possessed of so potent a poison it could inflict disease or death on man or beast simply with its glance.47 One might expect the basilisk to have had more credibility in English medical circles four centuries ago since the monster is discussed also in the writings of Ambroise par6 and Conrad ~esner,~~ both continental medical men often cited in English medical literature of the time. The basilisk is even referred to briefly in the writings of Andreas Laurentius, 49 another European doctor renowned in Tudor Encland. Yet the interest of English medical men in the basilisk legend remained marginal, despite attempts by Gesner and 46~he 1954 facsimile edition of the English language Hortus Sanitatis published by the Bernard Quaritch Press of London has been consulted for this thesis. In the facsimile edition, the harpy is discussed on p. 103 and the griffin on p. 105. 48~ar6, The workes of that famous Chirur~ion, Ambrose Parey, Translated out of the Latine and compared with the French by Thomas Johnson (London, 1634), pp. 792 - 93; Gesner, vol. 11, pp. 677 - 80. 49~aurentius, A Discourse of the Preservation of the Sight; of melancholike Diseases; of Rheumes, and of Old Ape, Lau~:er,tius to make tile legend more acceptable . Gesnes claimed that animals resemblin~ the basilisk had been seen in the Yorests oZ Saxony. For his part, Laurentius broke with tradition by explaining the malign effect of tke basilislc' s stare without recowse to \"the Basilisk . . hoed not infect from . . . [its eyes1 , by d a natural1 substance, which is very subtile, that is to say by a vapour insensible breathing out of the lwhole bodie, which infecting the agre, is by it transported to vs.\" Nevertheless, the only reference to the basilisk in English rnedical literature oZ the sixteenth century appears in Bullein's Bulwarke of defence apainste all Sicknes, Sorncs, and woundes, Moreover, the reference seems to have been included as a digression for it deals more specirically with the gene~c3ion of the basilisk than with the monster's role in medicine. Bullein has written simply that \"the hor~ible Serpente called the Codkatrise [another name for the basilisk] is bred in the Ege. \"50 In addition, I have found no zeyerences to medical cases where any Tudor doctor, in- cluding Bullein, actually blamed the basilisk for a patient's misIortune. It would seem that the basilisk legend failed to have a signil\"icant inpact on sixteenth century medicine, in England at any rate. tr.

In fact-, this belief, which wcs based on the principle of occult entipathy, appears to have been virtually suppressed. It receives no mention in most sixteenth century publications either by figlish doctors or by their continental colleagues. Furthermore, the few orthodox medical v~orks which do refer to the stare of the wolf do so disparagingly. This is true even of La.urentiusq Discourse of the Preservation of the Sipht: one of the works where the basilisk legend is upheld, as noted above. Laurentius dismisses the stare of the wolf as an explanation for disease as \"no beter worth then [sic] to bee derided.\"51 In place of the superstition, he outlines generally accepted etiological factors. One reads, for instance, thzt \"Glaucom hapneth through the con~elztion of eye '1 \"52 and thnt the cause of ox-eye is either the error of the first forme 2nd shape committed by nature, or else some accident whet he^ Tlegmatike humor, or inflarnma.tion, or else some greet flue of humours falling down vpon the sane. ,153 - - 51~iscourse, p. 44. 52~bid 1 P- 55- 53~bid., 50. etiological supersti- rel-nted to the wolf Englznd, at lecst? b3- the alnost complete disappearance 01 the wolf by Henry VIII's reign.

According to this model, ma was seen as a \"microcosm,\" reflecting on a small scale everythinc that happened in the universe or \"macrocosm,\" When there was order in the universe, with each star and planet occupying its proper place, man would be healthy. If a heavenly body deserted its place, however, man would mirror this chaos in the heavens by falling victin to disease. The alleged influence of the heavenly bodies is more easily understood when we reflect that in an age devoid of neon si~ns and electric lights the stars and planets must have seemed a great deal brighter and more potent than they do today. It is not surprising, therefore, that references to astrologiczl etiology in orthodox medical Ij-terature occur more often than references to most other etiological supersti- tions. Yet it would be a mistake to think that the belief in the occult power of the heavenly bodies was a major concern in accounting for individual misfortune. Seldom does an ortkzbdox medical tract associate common bodily disorders with the stars or planets, though one of the few exceptions occurs in an exposition by no less a person than Walter Bailey, Renaissance medicine had considered the doctor without any knolvledge of astrolo~y to be no better than a butcher. The certitude of this belief was attested to by Flaginus, an early seventeenth century Venetian physician as quoted by Robert Burton, The Anatomy of Melancholy (I621 ; rpt. London, l859), PO 300- Queen Elizabeth 1's private physician in her later years.

Paracelsus maintained that disease resulted not fro2 an imbalance among humours - the very existence of which he questioned - but from an interaction in man's body between two kinds of spiritual substances, the \"eleroents \"73 and the \"principles. 11 74 Paracelsus never attracted a large following among Tudor doctors. One English doctor who did accept Faracelsim theory was Thomas Moffet whose conversion took place while he v;as on travels through Italy and. tlne Germanies in 1570's.

The success professional medical men had in combatting the scourges of their day fidence they had in human to the Christian deity in Gale and Barrough sug~est no doubt contributed to the con- perspicacity.83 But the references the aforementioned statements bx thzt an even more important factor the sixteenth century medicine was contemporary religion. This nay seem surprisint;. As already noted, both the Protestant and Catholic faiths affirmed the realit;. of witches and demons which theologians saw as agents of divine retribution for man's sins. Noreover, theolo~izns never denied that God might work independently of the pavers of darkness in his role as chastiser. In fact, 82~ale, Certcine \\!orlres of Chirurpx3-e (1 563 rpt.

Such a viewpoint might seem more likely to gener- ate abject humility before the Almighty than the strong feeling of pride in rim's acumen which is so evident in six- teenth century medicine. Nevertheless, contemporary religion, especially in its Protestant form, vehemently opposed many superstitious practices. Indeed, individuals who relied on the magical and the occult in medicine were more often than not denounced as witches or Satanic minions out to usurp the natural order as ordained by God. Even those who subscribed to astrological beliefs night be accused imgiety, though the astrologers themselves declared the power of God lay behind all astral ernmations. The problem with estrology was that it might lead to veneration of the stars rather than of God. Philip Stubbes, a Puritan divine, elaborated on this theme when he asked : Who heering that . . . the sun, the moon, the stars, the signs and planets, do give both good things and evil, blessing and cursing, good success and evil success, yea, li2e and death, at their pleasure . . . =and that they rule, govern and dispose all things whatsoever, yea, both the bodie and souls of man . . . who, hearing this, . . . would not fall from God and worship the creatures that give such blessings unto Ma? . . . Vhr should not planets and stars be adored and v?orshipped 83~or the measures employed to combat the more harmful diseases of the period as well as everyday afflictions, see chapter three. - 46 - as gods, if they could work these effects? 84 The Church of England, of course, never condoned worship of the stars and planets. At most, English Protestantism regarded astrology with uneasy approval 2nd encourzged its menbers to exercise their rational faculty in seeking a solution to health proSlerns, though human reason might always be aided by prayer to God, This emphasis on human initiative nag have been a major force in moulding the optimistic mood of sixteenth century nedicine. 85 FurtLermore, however pious they might be, Tudor doctors never let their belief in divine causation blind them to the evidence furnished by observable phenomena. Tudor doctors were clear that the realm of m?dicine was the real world. The impact of this view on medical theory is seen, for instance, in a s,-philitic tract by 'ilillian Clowes, one of Queen Elizabeth Its chief surgeons. Clowes v~rites in his opening pages that syphilis \"is a notable testimonye the iust wrath of God aeaynst that filthy sinne [of lustj ,\" but devotes most of his etiological section to mundane causes relzted to the humoral theory. 86 U4~tubbes, Annt omy of Abuses, cited in Thomas, Religion and the gecline of biaf~ic, p. 383. 85~eaders wanting a detailed discussion oT the probable impact of early Frotestantism on the mental outlook of educated En~lishmen should consult Thomas, pp. 278 - 79 et passim.. '6~viorbus Gallicus, s. 211 s2ppinest1 and \"The manner of taking this sicknes, with the causes, and signes therof.\" Just as residual elements of superstition survived in the etiology, so irrational aspects sometimes influenced the diagnoses and prognoses of Tudor doctors. The Hortus Sanitatis, a work we have already noted was never popular among proTessioml medical men, speaks of the caladrius, a ~ythical bird supposed to be endowed with wonderful prognostic powers. The relevant part of the entry reads: \"As soon as thys byrde seeth one that about from ye seke body/ but yf he se that he shalle escape then this byrde turneth him toward t5is seke body. ,187 The caladrius superstition dated from the classical period at the latest ,88 as did the diamosis of disense based on the positions of the heaven17 bodies vis-2-vis the patient .89 Undoubtedly, too, there were doctors who adhered to astrological diagnosis, related as it was to the doctrine of correspondences, discussed earlier in this chapter. Yet I have Sound no specific references to astrological diagnosis in orthodox medicine four centuries ago. 90 It would appear that the role of astrolosy in diagnostics U'~ortus SanitatFs, p. 31.

New York: Octagon, 1966), p. 102). However, I also - 48 - must not be overly emphasized. Several of the medical books published in Tudor times which have been consulted for this thesis make no mention of astrology in discussing methods of diagnosis. A typical instance is Dr. John Banister's tome on ulcers where diagnosis is based entirely on observa- tion of the patients.91 Then there is the kind of book exemplified by Dr. Andrew Boorde's Breuiarg of Helthe where the astute doctor is advised to know the principles of astronomy (i.e. astrology)92 but where diagnosis is based on observation of the patients or of their urine. \"An urine which is blewe or blewyshe,\" for example, is reported to \"signifie eyther a flyxe or els an and dyspleasure in the lyuer. '19' have consulted Chamber's writing (A Treatise a~ainst Iudicial Astrolo~ie) and have found no mention of the use of astro- logical diagnosis by Henry VIII's physicians, even on the page Allen claims to have got his information. 91~ needefvull, new, and necessarie treatise of Chyrur~eri-e (4575; facsimile rpt.

The emphasis on the patient's body chemistry as a diagnostic tool is suggested also in the writing of Thomas Wilson. !filson, zn English Phisician, when he desireth to understand perfectly the state and disposition of any bod^, the first thing he doeth, he will feel the pulse, howe it beates, and thereby he fyndeth the force of life which it holdeth and the vigor of the human which possesseth the same. Thereupon he demandeth of the patient divers questions, howe the body hath bene governed; what diet; what order; what exercise. That knowne, he beholdeth the outward appearance, he veiweth [sic1 the face, the body, and each external member. Thirdly he cofneth to the inward and unseen partes, and of them he devyneth by dreames, delights, cogitations, and sometimes by phantasyes which are not alwaise sure\" The State of Enpiland, Anno Dom. 1600 (rpt. methods remind us of modern diagnostic procedures and reflect the new conf i-dence of the Tudor period in man's ability to interpret nature without recourse to the supernatural. In methods of prognosis, too, we find a new spirit of inquiq-, primitive though it may appear by modern standards. For instance, in Bullein's Bulwarke of defence againste all Sichces, appear: Who so haue spattle stinke, when it is burned upon the coals, and also if his heare doe easely fall from his hedde, it is a signe of death. 94 And again: Wino so euer haue their liuer repleted, or so filled full with water; and if the same water breake dounward to the bellie it is a present signe of death. 95 , In conclusion, an examination of the etiological aspects of Tudor medicine reveals that bizarre and magical explana- tions and also the religious interpretation of disease had already lost much of their influence. In diagnostics and prognostics, too, there was a move towards rationality. This is seen in the attempt to determine man's physical condition through analysis of his body chemistry as revealed, for instance, in his spittle and urine. This trend is indeed amazing when we remember that the sixteenth century was the London: Canden Society, 1936), p. 1. 94~ooke of Sicke Men, Sol. 95~oc. cit. - 50 - age of the European witchcraze. Science, to be sure, was rudimentary by modern standards. Laboratories as we know them did not exist and technological refinements were usually lacking. But, as defined earlier in this analysis, science appears to have been on the ascent in orthodox medical circles as doctors became more confident of their ability to interpret nature through observation and deductive reasoning. Moreover, in discussing the reaction of Tudor doctors to the new scourges of their day, syphilis and the sweat, we see considerable evidence of paradigm based research. This, too, points to the rise of science. ti; THE ORTiiODOX MEDICAL TRO3ESSIOII - TIE TREATTJZERT AND EREVENTICi'J In viev of vh2t has been satd. about orthodox medicine so 222, one migl~t expect science to have dominated the treatment cmd preve~tion 02 disease four centuries ago.

I have found only contempt for users of such wonderful medical aids in reputable medical literature of the time. For instance, Dr. Peter Lowe in his Discourse of the 'dhole Art of Chirurpery decries them as \"ignorant malicious people. ''1q3 of course, as Lowe points out, cunning folk and empirics often did resort to charm, incantations, and prayers. Consequently, there is some truth in Edgar's 8rgurnent if applied to irregular medical practice.

Ar;:bic for \"t:le horn. \" The Arabs were confirmed believers in the marvelous powers of the alicorn, and p2?obzblg carried this superstition into Europe when they invaded Spain in the thirteenth century A. D. since the first extznt refeixnces to it in R~ropean literature date fron this time. 121 The edditional possibility must not be over- looked, !-o:;rever, that zrnbic notions about the alicorn v?ere brousht back to Europe by Cru.sxiers who head then on Ynctever the times, in part beczuse 02 the Portu~uese. In the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries, tllese e~terprising people estzblished trade routes L LO Indiz, the ezr1Ses.t- Icnovm home of the superstitions surround in^ the alicorn, stretching back even beTose those that came out of Arabia. Pron Indic, the Portuguese brought : rpt . back the horn of the rhinoceros which was believed to be alicorn and which was indicenous to India and Africa. 123 Prom Eor-tugal, the fame of the alicorn spread through con- tinental Euro?e and Zngland. The German traveller, Thorms Platter, records in his journal that an alicorn in Queen Elizabeth 1's possessicn >:as seven spacs long and th2t filings from it hzd been used in medicines. Plet ter does not Cocunent the success of the medication, but a testimonial to the effectiveness of an alicorn prescription does appear in the me~noires of Edward :Webbe, which were published in the latter sixteenth century, Webbe, who was a sailor and adventurer, wrote tlx.~t \"some lewd gunners\" once tried to poison hir?. But the attempt failed because his physician \"gave hin speedily Unicorne's home to drinke, 1,125 It is, of course, easy to h2yothesize explanations for belief in the alicorn cures, among them, the possibility of an initially nlistaken diagnosis. A doctor might, for instance, erroneously deduce that a stomach upset had been caused by poisoning. In such a situation, prescription ol alicorn would appear to have real efficacy. It is also possible 12''-~lare Villians v!as confection lvhich one scholar clzims was sold for eleven shillings. See L. G. Natthcws, \"Ro;qal Apothecaries of the Tudor reriod, \" In Shepard, Unicorn, p. 122. that the poison siven to patients like Webbc was less potent than it was supposed to be or xas simply some vile tasting herb. In such cases, prescription of alicorn would appear to be effective. Fraud mar also acco~mt Ior some of the success stories. It is conceivable, for instance, that a doctor nig>ht ~ealize his patient had contracted only a minor ailment. He rnirht then magnify the illness, prescribing alicorn as a necessary curative. The patient's inevita-ble recovery would enhance the doctor's prestige as the administrator of the mervelous medicine. Certainly some doctors were not above such deceitful practices. For example, in Edv~ard VI's reign, Cesare Adelnzri , a Veneti'm physician ,living in London, found one of his patients, a certain Baptist Boron, unconscious znd believed already dead by his rele-tives.

Furthermore, their survival in the Ren3,issance can be attributed in part to the current theory of the microcosm and the macrocosm, discussed in chapter two. Clowes, however, preferred to defend his use of astrology on personal observation and deductive reasoning, a procedure essential to scientific practice. In the Rriefe and Necess~r:i Treatise, Clowes claims to have observed many doctors who neglected to bleed patients at astrologically propitious moments and \"after they did repent themselues, when it was too late. ~lowes' main flaw was that he had insufficient data from which to deduce a valid conclusion. Another doctor who, like Clowes, was a firm believer in the przctice of bleeding according to astrological considerations was Andrel;~ Boorde. This is made clear by a passage of Helthe: what tyme they do let any man blode except that they do know the operation of the signes [of the zodiac1 - . t11 53 It may be that Thomas Heywood's biogrephy of the early life of Elizabeth Tudor contains further evidence of astro- logicd phlebotomy.

Iadecd, in at least one book by the chronicler, -!!illion Harrison, tobacco an2 extolled 25ove that of cl~uzs LnCirenous to England. I is o~itenipornry theory. Ultimately, hovever, Fhilaretes falls back on an irrational argument based on the assunption that since tobacco was first tried by \"the Diuells Priests,\" it should \"not be vsed by vs Chrtstinns. The \"Diuells Priests, \" referred to here were the American Indians from whon: the Europeans first learned about the drug. In spite of these I.ay arguments against tobacco, the use of the drug itself ca.nnot be disaissed as superstitious since Tudor doctors explained their prescriptions according to generally accepted paradigmatic theory. Typically, Gerzrd wrote that tobacco's medicinal powers derived from a hot and dr;~ temperature. Here we see again that profession- al medical men represented the cuttin% edge of the scie~~tific attitude. Nor can one ri~htly condenn as superstitious much of the hygienic advice Tudor doctors gave. They advocated, for example, that sweet scented herbs or handkerchiefs dipped in rosewater should be carried close to the nose when walking in vile smellins streets. This precauti.on was supposed to prevent fetid fumes from entering the body and vitizting the humours. In addition, the doctors suggested that individuals should hold their breath as long as 'yh~~~ for Chimy-sr~eepers : or n warnin:. for Tcbacconi sts (London, '1601 j, ed. the Univ. iress, 193G), sig. 3'4. - - possible and then exhale it quickly. This \"exercise\" was believed to expel superfluous humours from the body. Such centuries-old advice was not only supported by the huinoral theory but also bg the related theory of the six non- naturals outlined in chapter two. It must not be forgotten either that orthodox ~edicnl nen believed their personal experience verified the advice. As already noted, the sixteenth century was a time of expanding horizons in medicine. As part of this movement, several new hygienic measures were proposed. These also were iater2reted within the context of the humoral paradigm and were susceptiblr to objective scrutiny. For instance, the doctors stated that the roar of cannons provided 11 exercise\" for the ears because it would drive excess hunours from then. Agzin, the doctors declared that sexual inter- course with syphilitic sufferers should be avoided as dangerous to one's health. The medical assertion that the spread of syphilis was furthered through copulation spurred public officials to close brothels in the city of London. Further evidence of the doctors' reliance on the rational in hygiene was their tendency to explain the medicinal virtues of England's numerous baths primarily in natural term. To be sure, no doctor denied the possibility that God in his benevolence had provided the baths with hezlin~ properties. That would have gone against the teachincs of contemporary christianity and individual conscience. Still, the supernatural element received scant attention. In the writinz of Dr. Edward Jorden, for example, the mineral elenents in the baths are viewed as basic to their heal in^ qualities. On the other haad, God's beneficent influence is mentioned onl;~ twice. In one instance, the divinely curative nature of the baths is passed over quickly with the renark that they axSe 3 reat at blessinge of God bestoi~ed vpon VS. 't197 In the other reference, Jorden comes dangerously close to denying the role of I'rovidence. He writes of some biblical baths with healing properties \"done by supernatural pol;:ertt and adds : these waters-/ and such like examples have bred in the mj-ides of men a reuerend and diuine oplnioi: of a11 Bathes: especially where they saw such strange effects as they could not well reduce to nztural causes. 198 Jorden's implication appears to be that whereas i~norant peo2le will turn to God for explmations the doctors the]:,- selves are more likely to seek natural explanations. Another indication of the tendency to de-emphzsize the importance of the divine in medicine appears in the belief that therapy and prophylaxis mi ght be eff ecti-ve irrespective of God's will. True, this is implied rather thnn stated. In Bullein 'S Bulumke of defence ac;ainste dl S' ckxes, kltllou~lz publi shed in the seventeenth century, this work has been quoted since it is available in our librar~r. Other medical works published in the sixteenCh century vhich ador~t - 94 - and replies: \"Thou has spoken visely, for a1 thing is in vain where God cloeth not put -to his helping hmde. By far the lar~est part of Bullein's book, however, is devoted to natural Zorces which can affect the outcome of medical practices.

Even less descriptive of the cunnin~ folk was the adjective \"learned, \" at least in the sense of formal education, since members of the group appear to have been persons of little if any schooling. A good example would be Raxe Clyes, described by the Cornish gentleman, Justice of d-'.'~. T.

Yet even this definition is prohlenttical. Since orthodox medicine vas not completely free fron magical beliefs and practices, the question arises : can doctors be cztegori-zed separately fron cunning folk? Rather than tackling this question head-on, historians have resorted to intellectual obscuranticn. Consider the lengthy list of Essex cunning folk, including many doctors, drelxn up by Dr. Alan Macfarlane of Essex Universitx. Macfarlane appends a symbol code to the list by means of which he reveals that he does not- lmow whether most of the doctors really were cunning folk. 21 5 The recder can 021;~ be confused by such an ambiguous categorization. H The find meaning of the adjective cunning\" in the sixteenth centur? was \"skilful.\" Skill does seem to have been an important aspect of medicine as practiced by the f r.csinile rpt.

For instace, one full-tim cumins woman. cl~arsed only threepence on one occasion and sixpence at another time.*I7 It seems that the '\"\"A Guide to Grand.-lury Wen (1627; rpt.

From what has been said already about the way an atnosphere of helplessness promotes superstition, one might be tempted to explzin the cun~zing folk's use of witchcraft solely in terms of inadequate nedical knowledge and practice. That the cunning folk were indeed ignorant of orthodox medicine seei,ls indicated by the fact that research has revealed onlx one cunning mm, a certcin John 'Jalsh of **A LLL, he recosGs appenTs to hzve had c1ifLicult~~ substantiathi his claim. !!hen asked as to the ten:pcrz.tures 225 of various herbs by the Commissary to the Bishop 02 Ecetcs, ',!alsh coulC! ~:inlre no reply. 226 Several Tactors may accow7t 10s khe i~;nomnce or the cuiirij.nc folk in he sphe12e of art-hodox medical kno~~ledf~e. There was, for instace, the mid-century rise in book- prices, part of the spiral inflation of the sixteenth century.

Moreover, it is highly probable that the existence of inan:: peculi arLties of9 dialect worked against the oral dissenin~t-ion of orthodox medical knowledge . That there was a lan~ua~e barrier is suggested by the following quotation iron the diary of ~u~dld von !fedel, a German tmveller of th later Tudor period: \"there are fourteen provinces in England in which the English lan~uage is not spoken Sor l-here are six different languages in 225~or a discussion of te~peratures, see above, chap. 111, pp. 82 - 63. 227~ee, Jor exnnple, the list of in \"llotes 16/40, The - Lib-rar~, 5l-h ser., vol. 5 (1950), pp. S3 - 112.

Monc- theless, his stand must not be dismissed as nonsense. Accordin,. to G. Trevelyan, educated Englishmen developed a cornson dialect during Tudor times thanks to the influence of the printing-press which popularized \"literary En@sh.\" On the other hand., illiterate members of society continued to spe& a vmiety of dialects. 229 Ignorance of orthodox medicine may have been a contributing factor in the dependence 01 the cunning folk on witchcraft as an interpretation of disease. It is well to remember, however, that other influences probably played a role as v~eI.1. For exainple, there is some evidence that the reliance on witchcraft may have had psychological aspects. That is to say, in many cases the cunning folk appear merely to have confirned the suspicions of those who visited then. In other words, the diagnoses of the cu.nnin~ folk were not based on objective scientific analysis but apparently were shaped by elnotional factors such as the 22E~ottfried von ~kow. trans. and ed.. \"Journey throwh En~land 1584 and 1585,\" Trmsncti.ons of the Royal Historical Societ~~, 2nd (new) ser., vol. 9 (1895), p. 223. 22'3~llustrnted Enylish Social Hi story (1942 rpt.

An hypothesis advance2 by Alan Nacfarlane and Keith Thonas seems to offer at least oblique support to the psycholo~ical interpretation. the;^ sucgest that at times both doctors an6 cunning folk would be visited by a layman who suspected his disease was caused by witchcraft. Invariably, in such circumstances the la.yrnm also linked the witchcraft with a definite suspect, usually someone to whon the complainant owed a social obligation which he wished to avoid, Macfarlnne and Thomas subnit thzt most commonly the social obligation involved ~ivihg alns or loans to the poor. 230 A typiczl case ~oulcl involve the indj-vidual who suffered pangs of conscience after turning avay a poor neighbour who had requested a bowl of porridge, According to bcf mlane and Thonas, when the parsimonious neighbour or one of his loved ones fell ill, he \\f;ould recall that he had rejected the alms seeker and would sus2ect him of employing rritchcrfift. confronth with the suspicions, of such a layman we can assume that the cunning folk would be all too ready to offer confirmation, partly becc.use of their own supersti-ti~us beliefs. The cunning folk would then attempt to counter the black nagic with white nagic. A sixteenth century pamphlet describes n specific instance which seems to confirm the psycho1o~;ical interprc- 230Nacfzrlane, -- ilitnh.nraf t in Tudor Ve that 1580, or thereabouts, an 1ps;:ich sailor, believin~ his dauzhter to be bewitched, took a vial of he^ urine to a local doctor for confirmation of this suspicion, The doctor ref used to f;ive it, presumably because the coxposition ol the girl's urine suc7gested a more rational interpretation based on the hu1,ioral theory. So, still \"not satisfied to his minde,\" the sailor visited a local cunning man who agreed that the girl was bewitched. 231 SigniTicantly , this story also explains ~hy the clientele of the cunning folk included, in addition to the poor, middle class &glisht.en r.~ho could well afford prof essiooal medical care. fio::ever fascii~atinr; such theorizing may be, it does not solve the problen posed by nedical cases in which the cunning folk appear to have encouraged witchcraft usp pic ions where none h2d been held before. 232 Further conplj.cntions zrise when we realize that even cunning folk known to have confirmed the suspicions of those who visited then were - 231i?.

Though the latter source is ~entioned in !?itchcrzft 2nd Dencnianisz, Ewen has in this case mderpl2;-ed t'nc i:nportance of the cunning person in initiatinc the witchcrzft suspicion. For more nisuse of historical material, cf. I<i.ttred~e ' s description of !L Avder (Yitchc~aft in Old znd Net: 106). In the Calcnc'lar, Avder is described as \"taking upon himself divers personates: as sometimes of a schoolmnster, sometimes of a reading minister, md someti~es of a physician or chirugei or,. \" In Kitt-redge , the distinction between fact and f\"mc7 is completely dis- - 111 - expected to provide some rationale for their action. In both situations, it will be argued, the key factor in understanding the cunning person's diagnosis of malevolent magic was data supplied by cestain tests. Further, the word \"tests\" may be seized upon to indiczte that the cunning folk were more scientific than has previously been allowed. Yet such a contention would not reveal the true story. As the following illustrations show, the tests employed by the cunning folk involved none of the critical evaluation of evidence which is so vital a part of the scientific method. The patient's inability to recite prayers - undoubtedly a common characteristic among the lower classes who, according tq recent research, appear to have had an appalling ignorance in religious matters 233 - was considered one sign of bewitchment. 234 Another involved first having the sick party sleep overnight in old clothes. These were burnt the next day and if they turned black - as combustible materials always do when lit - witchcraft was interpreted as the cause of illness. 235 In addition, it is recorded in the parish records of the diocese of York that when Cuthbert Williamson, a local cunning man, was \"asked how carded. Awder has now become \"schoolmaster, minister, and physician. \" 233~homas, Re1ir;ion and the Decline of Nopic, pp. 159 - 64. 234~ernard, Guide to Grand-Iury Men, p. 135. 235~iff ord, Dialocue, sigs.

Similar \"tests\" to confirm client suspicions as to the specific witch responsible for misfortune or to identify the culprit if clients had not considered witchcraft before consultation included the so-called divination by \"sieve and shears.\" A sieve would be hung beside a pair of shears. Then, if the client had a suspect in mind, the cunning person would say the suspect's name and any movement of the sieve would be interpreted as incontrovertible proof of guilt. In such cases, the questions were never posed, \"How do we know that the string by which the sieve was suspended had not been twisted inadvertently and in unwinding produced the movement?\" or \"Could not a gust of wind have had the sane effect?'' If the client had no particular suspect in mind, but the cunning person suspected his problem was caused by witchcraft, the procedure was as follows: the cunning person would pronounce the names of individuals he suspected to be witches solely on the basis of gossip or prior consultations (note the further departure from rationality). 236~. S. Purvis, ed., Tudor Parish Documents of the Diocese of York (Cambridge: at the Univ. Press, l948), pp. 199 - 200. - 113 - Any irregular movement of the sieve on mention of a particular suspect's name was considered enough to supply the culprit's identity. At times, too, torture was used to locate the malefactor. In 1596, for instance, a cunning man of Stapenhill, Burton-upon-Trent, had the feet of a suspect roasted until a confession was made. 237 It is beyond the scope of this analysis to trace the histories of the various practices described in the last few paragraphs. Possibly, however, all were very old by Tudor times. Certainly this was true of other techniques employed by the cunning folk. The prescription of anti-witchcraft herbs - vervain and St. John's wort, for example - dated from the Middle Ages, at least, as did attempts to break a witch's power by scratching her face. 238 The same could be said for the use of charms against almost every other ailment. 239 Further techniques can be traced back to even earlier tines. A cure for headache by tying the halter \"wherewith one hath beene hanged\" around the patient's, hea g4* goes back at least as far as the classical age since it is L3'/Anon., The most wonderful1 and true storie, of a certain Wtch named Alse Gooderiae of Stapenhill (London, 15971, P. 24. 238~aple, The Dark World of Witches, p. 28. 2390n this point, see Thomas, Religion and the Decline of Magic, p. 42. 45. Scot would have us believe , \"raelancholike witchesn) \"bad\" ed to the same technique \"to hey knew \"not how to cure.\" Put another way, Scot felt that competent medical men shunned the above mentioned cure, My research leads me to a similar con- - 114 - referred to in the writing of Marcellus Empiricus, foreign minister to the Emperor Theodosius. 241 Pliny8s Natural History testifies to the antiquity of other cunning medicines: epileptic patients must drink spring water at midnight from the skull of one who has died violently, 242 and scrofulous victims must touch \"the hand of one that died an untimelie death. 11 243 Presumably such ancient cures came to England during the first three centuries A. D. when the country was a Roman province and were passed on orally from one generation to the next like cures which dated from medieval times. The possibility must not be overlooked, however, that some rudely educated cunning folk pqssesssed manuscripts from which they learned their skills, as Keith Thomas has suggested in his Religion and the Decline of Magic. None- theless, even Thomas stresses the former method of learning. One of the several illustrations to which he refers involves Margareta Hunt who told the Commissary of London in 1528 that she had learned how to collect and prepare medicinal herbs from Mother Emet of Wales. 244 clusion. No mention is made of the \"halter\" cure in any of the orthodox medical publications consulted for this thesis. Moreover, I have found no specific references in any other literature of the time to doctors who used the cure. 241~ccording to Magnus , Superstition and Medicine, pp. 38 242~atural VIII, Bistory, vol. VIII, p. 35; Scot, Discouerie, - 115 - All techniques for which genealogies can be traced derived initially from the magical laws of sympathy and antipathy which have been outlined in chapter one. To take one instance, the prescription of vervain for witchery had been based originally on the antipathy the herb was supposed to have for any evil force, According to legend, vervain staunched Jesus' wounds on Mount Calvary. Conceivably, at least in the case of charms, the primitive magical symbolism of sympathy and antipathy had been largely forgotten by Tudor times. In other words, certain techniques of the cunning folk appear to have degenerated into stereotyped ritual. Keith Thomas argues this way, though he does not supply evidence to substantiate his theory. In describing charms based on holy names, he writes only that by the Tudor period, \"their original meaning was often hidden from those who used them. tt245 Exactly the same phraseology is used later when he discusses charms in general. 246 TO support Thomas, we must turn to an early seventeenth century publica- tion, the Ignorant Practisers of Phisicke (even the title 244~he reference appears in a footnote to William Hale's A Series of Precedents -&id Proceedings in Criminal Causes, extending from the Year 1475 - 1640; extracted from the Act- Books of the Ecclesiastical Courts in the Diocese of London l~ondon, 1847). on D. 228 of Thomast work, In Hale, Mother met is -introduced this wag: 245~eligion and the Decline of Magic, p. 180. connotes the irrationality in irregular medical practice), where the author, John Cotta, describes the charms of the cunning folk as \"idle words and sentences. According to the &ford English Dictionary, the adjective \"idle1' meant \"groundless1' in Cotta's time. 248 In view of the uncomplimentary description of unorthodox medicine given thus far, it might be assumed that the cunning folk were dismal failures. Surprisingly, however, this does not appear to have been the case since many clients and contemporary observers testified to the effectiveness of the cunning folk's medicines. For instance, Elizabeth Gibson of the village of Benton,claimed that Jenkyn Pereson, a local cunning woman, healed her mother who had been \"taken with the fayre\" (i-e. bewitched). 249 hother cunning woman was reported by Sir Anthony Shirley to have healed \"most miraculouslyn a patient of an unnamed disease. 250 Then there is George Gifford's assertion that \"out of question they be innumerable which receiue help by going unto cunning men. ,1251 It may seem, therefore, as if the irrational side of unorthodox medicine should not be emphasized. Yet many success stories may well have been fabricated by clients ~ho LW/ Imorant Practisers, pp. 50 and 71. 2480. E. D., ed. Onions, p. 952. 249~aine, ed., Depositions and other Ecclesiastical Proceedings, p. 100. 250~istorical Manuscripts Commission, Calendar of the Manuscripts of the Most Honorable the Marquis of Salisbury, did not want to appear foolish in having consulted irregular medical practitioners, as Richard Carew suggested. *'* To be I sure, the possibility of psgchosomatic healing must not be ruled out. As already pointed out in chapter three, the cure in which the patient puts great faith may achieve remarkable results in the dissipation of minor ailments through its enlistment of the imagination even if it has no relevant pharmaceutical content what ever. Noreover, it . should be noted that some cures which the cunning folk prescribed for superficial complaints really did have a therapeutic value despite the mystical mumbo-jumbo which surrounded them. Such was the case, for instance, with unguents made from marigolds. As a woman mashed the marigolds in a container, she was to say \"iii pater nosters, iii aves, and a crede, in the worshyp of our Lady; & if it be a man he must se [say] iii pater nosters, iii aves, & a crede in the worshypp of Jesus.\" 253 Nonetheless, it is inconceivable that in the treatment of more serioud com2laints the cunning folk had any success with the methods they used. For example, the recital of the following charm for Saint Anthony's Fire (i.e. ergotism, a deadly disease resembling leprosy) can vol. IV, p. 81. 2S1~iff ord, Dialowe, sig. G3.

Such irregular medical practitioners would thus have been similar to the continental hermit of the time about whom a commercial agent for the wealthy banking and trading family, the Fuggers, wrote: he heals Catholics with prayers and fresh water, but only if they are not victims of \"ills which arise . . . from heredity or the French diseasett (i. e. syphilis) .256 The cunning folk further ensured themselves against loss of prestige through failure by taking care never to claim their medicines were infallible. As Richard Bernard noted, they could always resort to a number of explanations when failure was imminent. They might blame their patients that they came not in time, or say they applied not the meanes aright, or that they wanted faith to beleeue, or at least . . . acknowledge their -- 254~his-~ charm appears in ' s Bulwarke of defence above, 02. 256~ictor von Klarwill, ed., The Fugger News-Letters being a Selection of unpublished Letters from Correspondents of the House of Purger durin~ the Years 1568 - 1605 (London: John Lane Bodley Head, I92>), great inough, and therefore . . . aduise them to go to a more cunning man. 257 The procedure is reminiscent of the various explanations used by Tudor doctors to account for the failure of marvelous drugs including the alicorn and the bezoar stone. Yet the comparison between orthodox and unorthodox medicine rnust not be carried too far since extant primary sources intimate glaring discrepancies between the two types of practice. Vhereas cunning folk relied on the supernatural which is beyond scientific investigation, doctors were concerned primarily with the natural world. Cunning folk appear to have been ready to accept medicines whose rationale had been completely forgotten but, as pointed out in chapter three, doctors were extremely reluctant to rely on a prescription which could not be rationalized to fit the humoral-elemental theory. Nor can it be overlooked that cunning folk lacked the inquiring attitude of science which was illustrated in orthodox nedical experiments with hartshorn and tobacco. A third category of nedical practitioner consisted of charlatans or \"mountebanks\" as they were more generally known in the sixteenth century. Available evidence suggests that members of this group came from the lower classes. Because they had little or no formal education their techniques also seem to have been based extensively on superstitions inherited from the past. These included image 257~ernard, Guide to Grand-Iury Men, p. 143. magic, the theoretical basis of which has been outlined elsewhere. 258 For instance, apples with the magical word \"abracadabra\" 259 gouged in them were prescribed for the plague. In many respects, then, mountebanks seem to have been like cunning folk. Unlike village wizards, however, they are reported to have roamed the country, usually in small groups, and to have practiced medicine almost invariably on a full-time basis. Furthermore, source materials intimate that mountebanks worked primarily for money rather than the prestige which would come from having special skills , and that they often resorted to chicanery. This characteristic also distinguishes then from fellow lay practitioners who seldom tried to dupe their clients. A common ruse used by the quack doctors is described by Robert Coplmd, a mid-sixteenth century Londoner who probably gleaned his information while on duty as a member of the city watch \"when that . . . [he went] door&. \"260 The ruse suggests the 258~ee above, chap. 111, p. 57. The composite picture of Tudor quackery given here is based primarily on information in John Halle's A most excellent and learned abusers, both 02 Chyrurgerie and Phisicke in our tyme and the writings of William Clowes which are listed in the bibliography of this thesis. 259~cc ording to Gust av Davidson (A Dic tionzrg of h~els (London: Collier-Macmillan, 1967), p. 4), this is one of the most ancient words in magic.

Then the charlatans \"taketh licence1' (presumably a free meal) and depart. The next day a confederate and his minion arrive on the scene.

Considerably higher up were gentlewomen who looked after the sick poor without charge, thus carrying on a European tradition which stretched back at least as far as the Middle Ages, It is reported, for instance, that in the beginning of the fourteenth century, Mahaut, Countess of Artois and Burgundy, spent long hours ministering physic to the poor in hospitals built at her instruction and maintained at her expense. If needs be, she even sent patients to some place better to be cured, as was the case with one indigent who s~ffered from gout and was sent to take healing waters. 262 Along with the influence of tradition, English gentlewomen seem to have been motivated by energetic dispositions, humanitarian instincts, and religious zeal. This is suggested, for instance, by a quo- tation from the diary of Grace Mildmay, a patrician woman of the Tudor period: It is good sometimes to be alone and meditate; but it is good also to call on one's neighbours, to comfort their souls and bodies and thereby do good to themselves and lay up treasures in heaven; and far better it is so to do than to sit with a dunme [dumb or dummy1 pair of cards in our hands, for as the hands are busied with good or bad, the mind will be set thereon. 263 262~lice Kemp-Welch, Of Six (unpublished),\" Quarterly Review, vol. CCXV (Iqll), p. 129. - 123 - In addition to their acts of altruism, some gentle- women published collections of medical recipes. Particularly noteworthy in this respect is Elizabeth, Countess of Kent, whose Choice Manuall of Rare and Select Secrets in Phvsic and Chirur~ery proved so popular that it was translated into German. Yet compendiums like Elizabeth's are difficult to locate nowadays and consequently have not been consulted for this thesis. One of the few available sources of information on the medical practices of gentlewomen is the diary. Entries are usually too sketchy to ascertain finally the extent to which upper class women were scientifically in- clined, though they seem to emphasize practical methods of healing rather than the superstitious. For instance, in the diary of Lady Margaret Hoby appear entries like the following: \"looked mans hand; ,,268 1'267 and \"dressed Hiares finger. Taken together, these entries suggest conditions that are relatively easy to diagnose. Faced with the obvious needs of servants and others, gentlewomen appear to have ministered 'b4~orothy M. Meads, ed. Routledge 86. 266~bid 0, Po 14-50 267~bid., pp. 169 - 70. - 124 - to them in a practical and efficient manner using the materials close at hand. At first glance, a remedy prescribed by Lady Nildmay, recorded in her diary, and reportedly learned from a friend, may suggest dabblings in the occult. To remove corns, the entry reads, \"take a blacke snaile, roast it in a white cloth, and when it is roasted laie it to the corne hot, and it will take it a~aie.\"~~' On the other hand, it is possible to argue that the application of a red hot snail may have been a relatively efficient way to remove a corn in circumstances where corn plasters and absorbing poultices were not available. It must be admitted, however, that gentlewomen sometimes used prescriptions which have clearly defined links with superstition. For instance, elsewhere in Lady Mildmay's journal are found a number of treatments for epileptic seizures which are supposed to derive their efficacy from occult lunar emanations. 270 We do not know if Lady Mildmay's treatments are typical of those used by other gentlewomen. Nor do we know whether Lady Mildmay herself resorted to occult healings except in extreme circumstances. From what i we do know of English gentlewomen generally, however, it seems reasonable to assume that superstitions were of minor influence on them. 269~ited in Yeigzll, l1 Journal, \" p. 131. cit. - 125 - If little is known about the methods of cure administered by gentlewomen, even less is known about the theoretical beliefs that formed the basis for the cures. Possibly gentlewomen were not greatly concerned with theory. In fact, a cure such as the one calling for red hot snails may have had no theoretical basis at all. Assuming, however, that attempts were made to rationalize prescriptions, the question rises, were magical principles or the humoral-elemental theory involved? Significantly, the diary of Lady Anne Clifford, who lived from 1590 to 1676, reports that Anne's mother, Lady Margaret Cumberland, was deeply,interested in alchemy. 271 (This passion may have reflectqd the influence of Lady Cumberland's father-in-law who was himself a practicing alchemist. More will be said about his kind later in this chapter.) Since astrology and magic are related to alchemy, Lady Cumberland nay also have had a keen interest in these aspects of the occult and may even have related her pre- scriptions as an amateur healer to then. Nevertheless, it seems probable that gentlewomen, like doctors, were generally optimistic about the potentialities of hman reason unaided by superstition. Therefore, they would have minimized the role of the extraordinary in healing. The rational approach to medicine drew support from con- C[. I According to George C. Williamson, Lady Anne Clifford, Countess of Dorset, Pembroke & Montgomery, 1590 - 1676. Her Life, Letters, and Work (7922; rpt. East Ardsley, Wakefield, Porkshire: S. R. Publishers, 1967), p. 38. - 126 - temporary Protestantism which we have seen emphasized healing through natural means. This is not to suggest, of course, that the devout gentlewomen failed to call upon God in their acts of curing. In addition, diary entries suggest that gentlewomen often read widely in the field of orthodox medical literature. In Lady Mildmay's diary are found references to Jean de Vigo's Vorkes of Chirurgerie and William Turner's Herbal. 272 Moreover, Lady Hoby s journal mentions Timothy Bright's Treatise of Melancholy and a herbal, possibly John Gerard's, which was published shortly before Lady Hoby commenced her personal record. 273 Nor can the likelihood be overlooked that when gentlewomen consulted professional medical men about their own health274 they were encouraged to adopt what doctors envisioned as rational therapeutic measures which operated well within the bounds of the humoral-elemental paradigm. On the other hand, A. It. Rowse would have us believe that one gentlewoman practitioner of medicine, Lady Hoby, also sought consultations with the magus, Simon Forman, regarding medical matters. These consultations took place twice for herself and once for her brother. 275 Accordingly, the infer- 272~eigall, \"Journal,\" pp. 120 - 21. 273~eads, Diary, 77, and 78. 274~or an exenple, see ibid., p. 73. 275~imon Pormul. Sex and Society Shakespeare 's Age (London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson, lg74), pp. 132 and 233 - 34. ence might be drawn that Lady Hoby was more ready to rely on superstitions than has been allowed. Yet it is exceedingly doubtful that the consultations actually took place. Rowse bases his argument on references to Lady Hoby in Formants personal papers. Other references in the papers have led Rowse to argue that during -4pril and Nay, 1601, when all three visits were supposed to have been made, Porman was in Lambeth, now a borough of South London. However, entries in Lady Hoby's diary indicate that she was miles away in Hachess, Yorkshire, during the time in question. 276 Nor are there any references to consultations with Fornan elsewhere in the diary. Lady Hoby, then, appears to have had no ties with Formq and like most other gentle- women of her day probably played down the role of superstition in healing. 277 Besides their role as amateur doctors, Tudor gentlewomen doubled as lay obstetricians, as further diary entries make clear. The sources make no mention of techniques, however, though they emphasize the gentlewoman's piety. For example, looking once more at Lady Hoby's journal, we find only the 277~onceivably Lady Hobo's name had been mentioned by an acquaintance of hers and a regular client of Porman's, one Nrs. Blague. Later Forman may have confused Lady Hoby with another client. The likelihood of a mistaken identity is made more plausible when it is realized that Forman really did mix up names, as even Rowse belatedly admits in a footnote at the end of his book (Simon Forman, p. 301). following brief statements: \"1 was. sent to Truts dall in the trauill of my Cossine Isons wiffe, who was brought to bed of a daughter, 11278 and \"I went to awiffe in trauill of childe, about whom I was busey tell: I a Cloke about which time, She b[e]ing deliuered and I hauinge praised god, returned home. ,279 There were others in addition to doctors or gentlewomen who also engaged in the practice of obstetrics. Indeed, when we turn our attention to this aspect of medical practice we confront a particularly amorphous group, and one which it is impossible to categorize clearly. It is even difficult to describe definitely the techniques employed by that much more limited group, the midwives in the service of the monarchy. All that can be said with certainty is that these personnel received adequate salaries for their day, 280 though deliveries were not always successful. 281 Moreover, royal midwives sometimes travelled to foreign countries to perform accouchements there. Such was the case, for instance, with 280~x., Alice Massy, midwife to Elizabeth of York, Queen of Henry VII, received a salary of ten pounds in 1503 (J. H. Aveling, English Midwives: their History and Prospects (1872; rpt. London: Hugh K. Elliott, 1967), pp. 15 - 16). Cf. salaries paid other royal servants in Francis Peck's Desid.er- ata Curiosa (London, 1732), Lib. 11, esp. pp. 7 - 10. The examples cgted here show that even in the inflation economy at the end of the Tudor period master cooks and sergeants of the royal household made only eleven pounds, eight shillings, and one pence per annum. 28'~n Francis Bacon's The History of the Reign of Kin Henry the Seventh (1622; rp%. London: Folio Society, 1971): - 129 - an unnamed midwife sent by Queen Elizabeth I to Russia to look after the Tsaritsa during her pregnancy in 1586. 282 Conceivably, gentlewomen and royal midwives were familiar with the obstetrical techniques of orthodox medical practitioners discussed in chapter three. Moreover, gentle- women may even have adopted orthodox obstetrical techniques as their own. The close ties between gentlewomen and doctors have already been suggested. Mention has also been made of the probable influence on patrician women of contemporary Protestantism, a force which was in itself generally hostile to superstition. Beyond the gentlewomen and royal midwives, however, there appear to have been midwives who were deeply immersed in the occult, presumably because of ignorance, impiety, or a combination of both. Exact numbers of these midwives are not knovm, but they must heve been large in view of the frequency with which bishops asked parochial clerics questions like the following: \"Whether you how anye that doe use of divination?] , witchcrafts, south- sayings, or my like crafts or imaginations invented by the Devyl, and specially in the tyme of women's travyle.

Similar instances are foupd in ibid., pp. 3 - 4 and in Thomas Rogers Forbes, It may be noted, moreover, that the desire to eliminate practices like those mentioned in this query influenced the Church's decision to initiate a licensing system for midwives during Henry VIIIts reign. Before procuring her imprimatur, the prospective licentiate was questioned on her religious orthodoxy and skill by the bishop of her diocese and a panel of doctors and learned midwives. The candidate also might have to swear an oath which included a clause never to use \"any witchcraft, charms, relics or invocations to any Saint in the time of travail, I1 284 or, more simply, to desist from \"sorcery or incantations in the time of the travail of any woman. 11285 Yet the problem of unlicensed , midwives who relied ex- tensively on practices the Church condemned was never solved during Tudor times. Though the reasons are not fully known, a legal snag in the ecclesiastical court system where violators of church law were tried may be of significance: defendants who pleaded innocent to the charge against them had only to procure the names of from four to eight cornpurgators in their parish and their case would be dismissed. Hidwife and the 'ditch (New Haven, Conn.: Yale Univ. Press, l966), pp. 148 - 49. Forbes also devotes a chapter of his work to obstetrical charms, some of which may have been prescribed by the group of midwives now under examination. Yet the general reader must pick his way with caution through Forbes' chapter. Like many nineteenth century historians (exs., T. J. Pettigrew, On Su Medicine and Surgery ( Medicine: A Chapter in the Historg of Culture (1883; rpt. New York: Burt Franklin, 1970)), Forbes has for his prime concern the compilation - of a list of bizarre and fantastical practices down through the ages. Consequently he tends to blur or completely disregard distinctions between the kind of In this way, the recalcitrant midwife could flout the church licensing system, provided she was popular among her neighbours or wealthy enough to buy supporters. Besides unregulated and unlettered midwives, gentle- women and royal midwives, it is possible that contemporary magicians known as the magi practiced obstetrics, at least occasionally. This is suggested by the discovery that the magus, Simon Forman, alluded to above, mentioned in his diary the obstetrical amulet discussed in chapter three called the eagle-stone. The reference is difficult to in- terpret, however, for it reads simply: \"The 17th of December I had my . . . rnadLej with the e Calgles stone. 1,286 people who resorted to charms. 284An oath for midwives, in Forbes, p. 145. 285~n oath administered to one Eleonor Pead of Canterburg, in loc. cit. 286~. 0.

It should be added that the appellative \"Dr.\" in the title of Halliwell's edition is misleading. Cambridge University gave Forman a medical license possibly because of the influence of Dr. Blague, who was Dean of Rochester, a member of the University, and one of Forman1s regular clients. Yet official approval never came from the College of Physicians in London. No doubt, the College's rebuff was largely the result of Fornan's occultism. True, there have been other interpretations. The seventeenth century historian, Charles Goodall, wrote that the College rejected Forman because it found him ignorant in physic and astrolo y (The Royal College of Physicians of London (London, ,6847, ~737). In our time, Porman1s biographer, A. L. Rowse, has suggested that Porman1s popularity in London and his financial success, Accordingly, until more substantial~information is found, even Formants involvement in child-delivery must remain tenuous . More easily cscertainable is the interest of the magi in non-obstetrical arcana. For instance, my research into primary and secondary source materials reveals that Tudor &gland's magicians were deeply involved in the search for the philosopher's stone, The best known of these men, in addition to Simon Forman, were Burchard Kranich and John Dee. 287 As already noted, moreover, I have found that Forman, --- - - both of which threatened the livelihood of doctors angered the College (Simon Forman, p. 47). But both interpretations create a false impression. As suggested in the beginning of this chapter, most doctors were not avaricious, as Rowse would have us believe. In zddition, we saw in earlier chapters that most doctors gave astrological medicine at best scant attention. So it is highly probable that the main reason for the College's antipathy to Porman was the latter's disregard for orthodox medical efforts to restrict the role of the occult in medicine. 287~ornzn' s alchemical investigations are ref erred to briefly in his diary on pp. 23 (\"Abought Michelaas I first begane to practise the philosopher's stone.), 25 (\"This yere in Lente I began the philosopher's stone, and before made my furys and all for yt.\"), and 28 (\"The 27 of April1 in subliming, m5 pot and glasse brok, and all my labour was lost pro lapide.'' . Those of Kranich and Dee are discussed in M. B. Donald1 s \"Burchard Kranich (c. 151 5 Plining Stanps, Science, vol. 6 (1950j, pp. 308 - 22 and P.

New York: Arns, 1968), esp, p. 13. It may be noted that/like Forman, both Kranich and Dee were men of learning and had no formal recognition from the College of Physicians. Unlike Forman, however, Kranich and Dee were never harassed br the orthodox medical profession, no doubt because they had considerable royal patronage. Kranich's ties with royalty are especially well discussed in F. E. Halliday's \"Queen Elizabeth I and Dr. Burcot,\" History Todax, vol. 5 (1955), pp. 542 - 44. at least, had an interest in astrological medicine. The extent to which this interest influenced Formants medical practice is made clear by an event of 1593. When questioned by the Royal College of Physicians, Formvl claimed that he could dispose diseases with no help other than an epheneris288 and that he could tell at once what the cause of an illness was merely by looking at the stars. 289 Dee also may have diagnosed and explained diseases astro1of;ically. Certainly he had a profound interest in other astrological matters which might easily have carried over into his medical practice. A good illustration involves his passion for drawing up nativities290 which is testified to by the several allusions to them in his diary. 291 It should be added that the magi healed without the use of magic. Por example, an entry in Formants diary reads: \"I cured the f ellowe of Quidhampton of the king's evill, which had 24 holes in his throte and necke out of the which in one morning I got 86 worms at on[e] tyme lyke maggots, and after he was well. 1'292 Nonetheless, it is more than likely - -- For Dee's I refer the reader once more to French's book and to Dee's diary, esp. pp. 21, 32, 36 - 37, and 42. 288~his is an astronomical almanac showing the deily positions of the sun, moon, and planets. 2S9~homas, Reli~ion and the Decline of Magic, p. 316. 290~hese are astrological representations of the position of the heavenly bodies at one's birth. 291~or examples, see p. 1. 292~alliwell's edition, p. 35- - 134 - that as part of their general interest in the occult, the magi stressed the prescription of wonderful cures, like those discussed in chapter three. /' Since the magi were men of learning, it might seem at first difficult to understand their immersion in beliefs and practices which placed them outside the mainstream of con- temporary scientific activity. To some extent, the magi undoubtedly were influenced by neo-Flatonism. As pointed out earlier, this philosophy envisioned the universe zs pulsating with all kinds of sympathies and antipathies, and consequently would have fostered astrological, alchemical, and magical lore, at least among its votaries. That there were in fact links between the ,magi and neo-Platonism is suggested by references to the writings of neo-Flatonists in the magi's diaries. For instance, Dee's diary refers to \"Paracelsus twelve lettres, written in Prench with my own hand. 11293 Again, in Forman's diary there are references to the De arte nemoratus by the neo-Platonist, Appolonius Niger. 294 But even after allowing for the influence of neo-Platon- ism, the problem remains: what made the magi turn to the occult in the first plwe? In some cases, there simply is not enough documentation on which to base an answer. 293~allivel11s edition, p. 35. 294~alliwel11s edition, p. 30. - 135 - Recently, however, the American historian, I?. J. French, has tried to psychoanalyze John Dee by scrutinizing Dee's personal papers and published works which are scattered about in various English libraries. French feels that Dee wanted, above all else, to achieve god-like omipotence and to help his fellow man by discovering the deepest secrets of the universe. Becoming disillusioned with contemporary education at Oxford and Cambridge where the emphasis was on rhetorical studies, Dee turned to the occult hoping to acquire the powers he so deeply craved. 295 Another historian, A. L. Rowse, has tried to delve into the psyche of Simon Forman. His research into the mass of Forman papers in the Bodleian Library, Oxford, leads him to cone-lude that Forman, too, had an insatiable desire to penetrate the unknown and to control it. This desire, Rowse would have us believe, stemmed from Formants inferiority complex, the result of being physically small both as a child and as an adult. In addition, though Fornan was learned, he was virtually self taught. An ambition to attend university went unfulfilled, except for a brief period in his youth when he lived at Oxford as a servant. As a result, Forman was particularly susceptible to beliefs and practices which seemed to promise the key to recondite knowledge. 296 1f we are willing to adopt the psychological explanation, it is not too 295~ohn Dee: The World of an Elizabethan Magus, esp. chap. 2. esp. chap. difficult to agree with French and Rowse that the driving force behind the magi appears to have been a Faustian desire for power and glory. Thus far in this chapter, nothing has been said about ecclesiastical medicine. Yet clerics also doubled as lay medical practitioners and therefore their services demand attention. Unfortunately, however, there is once more a paucity of good source materials, making it virtually impossible to comprehend the extent to which clerical prectitioners were scientific. For instance, in Carew's Survey of Cornwall, it is recorded that Mr. Atwell, the parson at St. Ehie from 1559 to 1615, prescribed milk or milk and apples for many illnesses. But did Mr. Atwell rationalize his concoctions to fit generally accepted medical theory of his day? Or was magic involved? Carer? does not say. 297 Nonetheless, it is clear from what little is decipher- able in extant docunentation that some clergymen had no compunction about the use of wonderful cures despite the disapproval with which established religion looked upon then. Consider, for example, the Sussex curate rho in 1538 had a child drink water three times from a chalice for the \"chpe cough\" (i.e. whooping cough). 298 Here the medieval 297~urve:~ of Cornwall, pp. 131 - 32. - 137 - belief in religious objects as a source of supernatural power is discernible. Possibly the recourse to magical prescriptions by some clerics can be explained in part by inadequate religious education which would make such clerics little better than cunning folk with whom their contemporaries sometimes confused them. 299 Indeed, it is conceivable that many of the clerics did not have any religious education at all. The chronicl-er, William Harrison, writes in the 1577 edition of his Description of En~land that miserly parishioners gave clerical appointments to weavers, peddlers, and glovers who would be glad of an augmentation of eight or ten pounds yearly to their incomes. The parishioners thus avoided having to pay adequate salaries to learned clergymen. In a later edition of the same work, Harrison adds that the parishioners also bestov~ed benefices upon \"bakers, butlers, cooks, good archers, falconers, and horsekeepers, instead of other recompense for their long and faithful service. 1,300 It must be recognized, moreover, that religious educa- tion Der se was not necessarily a bulwark against the bizarre and fantastical in clerical medicine, as is illustrated in the case of John Darrell, a clergyman with a university degree. In the last decade of the sixteenth century, he 299F'or instaxe, the above mentioned presentment describes the Sussex curate as a witch when he gave the sick child the chalice. 300~oth quotations Description of England, come from Edelen's version of the PP* 31 - 32. toured several southern counties claiming to heal victims of demonic possession by incantations and fasting. 301 In part, Darrell may thus have seen himself as striking a blow against Catholicism. Certainly George Kore, one of Darrell's closest friends and himself a university educated cleric, rationalized depossession along these lines. \"If the Church of England have this power to cast out devils, \" wrote Hore, \"then the Church of Rome is a false church; for there can be but one true church, the principel mark whereof (as they say) is to work miracles, and of them this is the greatest, namely to cast out devils. 11302 As might be expected, however, the pundits of orthodoxy took atdecidedly different view. Darrell zas tried and convicted, by the ecclesiastical Court of High Commission as an impostor who had trained his patients to simulate possession to prove his curative power. 303 Established religion was more tolerant towards astro- lo~ical medicine as the following information suggests: Simon Harvrard, yet another university trained ecclesiastic, was not prosecuted for writing a treatise in which several pages are devoted to the astrological side of phlebotomy. One explanation as to why no court action was taken may have 301~honas, Belifiion and the Decline of Magic, p. 483. 302~ True Discourse concernin;: the Certaine Fossession or nersons in one familie in Zancashire (Landon, 1600), cited in Thomas, p. 484. been Harward's care not to impinge upon either divine or human will which were basic considerations in contemporary theology. \"God, It Harward declared, hath giuen a power to the heauens, and an in- fluence to the Starres and Planets, which doe mightily worke in the things here below, not to induce any necessities, but to dispose the inclinations, so farre as God hath appoynted and determined, 304 Nonetheless, it is highly improbable that most educated clerics paid much attention to the astrological side of bleeding. Adherence to astrological principles would lead ' to a philosophical determinism antithetical to contemporary theology. Finally, rather than submit to the ministrations of un- licensed (or licensed) medical men, individuals might attempt to look after themselves through home remedies. A consider- able amount of prima facie evidence suggests that people who opted for this alternative were deeply interested in astrological medicine. As a starting point, there is the popularity of The myrrour or glasse of helth which went through fifteen editions between 1539, when it first appeared, and 1580, Written for general sale by Thomas Moulton, \"Douctoure of dyvynte of the ordre of Frere Prechours, lt305 the work lists remedies for many diseases, but always according to the positions and conjunctions of 3U4~arwards Phlebotomy: Or, A Treatise of thls booke that sheweth dyuers causes how the heavenly bodies. Then there are the scores of almanacs and prognostications written for the popular market by Moulton's contemporaries, including some doctors, where consideration almost invariably is given to astrologically propitious times for therapeutic measures. Such works hardly would have been put out in great numbers if there had been only a few people who bought them. 306 Significantly, however, a substantial number of lapen appear to have had little, if any, interest in home medicine of an astrological nature. This is indicated by another treatise on amateur healing, Sir Thomas Elyot's The caste1 of helth, which was published initially in 1539 and went through thirteen more editions by 1595. The continued appeal of the work into the early seventeenth century is the pestilence may be gendered.\" 306~he writers of astrological vade mecums which contein home medical advice are an interesting group worthy of a separate study. One might begin, for instance, by examining Drs. William Cunningham and Thopas Gale. Cunningham wrote home medical almanacs in 1558, 1559, 1560, 1561, 1565, and 1566, while Gale turned his out in 1566 and 1567. Though both doctors lived into the 15801s, they wrote no more almanacs after the 1560's. Perhaps they became disillusioned with astrology, as was the case with Jean Fernel, noted earlier. On the other hand, Gale, at least, may never have considered astrology an important part of medical practice. His major contribution to medical literature, Certaine Workes of Chirur~erie , published in 1563, barely mentions the super- stition. After examining Cunningham and Gale, one might turn to the layman Robert Wger. Wyer hoped to boost the sale of his astrological work by attributing it to a fictitious doctor whose name appears on the title page: A Prognosti- cation of Erra Physgcke, Frolytable to Kepe the Body in relth. - Though professional medical men generally were not overly enthusiastic about astrological medicine, Wyer's temerity seems to have worked in his favour for Erra Pater's prognostication enjoyed several reprints. The work's popular- attested to by another edition in 1610. Yet there are only fleeting references to astrology in The caste1 of helth. One of the few instances occurs in a discussion of atmospheric pollutants where Elyot writes: \"the ayre and sluttyshely. '1307 More often, Elyot, who was not a licensed practitioner but had taken a course in medical instruction from Dr. Thomas Linacre before writing his book, does not even mention the influence of the stars. Consider, for example, Elyot's statement that \"many diseases of the head. lt3O8 The emphasis on the natural as opposed to the supernatural appears also in Elyot's attempts to explain the efficacy of drugs with respect to their temperatures. Temperatures, it will be remembered, were regarded by doctors as perfectly rational its mas even have started a trend. The title of another as%rolbgical work reads : A newe Almanacke and Prognostication seruing . by G. Gossenne, Doctour in Ehrsicke. I have found no mention of Gossenne in Lee's Dictionary of National Biography, Munk's Roll of the Royal College of Physicians of London, or Panckoucke's Dictionaire des sciences medicales. Laymen who affixed their own names to their astrological home medical works and who might also be studied include T. Hill, G. Hartgill, R. Norton, A. Mounslowe, and T. Digges. - 142 - explanations for the medical value of drugs because they operated well within the bounds of the humoral theory. In this chapter, we have seen that there were various groups of lay medical practitioners: cunning folk, who were the nost numerous, mountebanks, gentlewomen, midwives, magicians, ecclesiastics, and individuals who catered to their own health needs. These groups differed considerably from one another, though most of their practices were alike in that they had been inherited from the medieval and classical periods. Research suggests that often the practices had been, and continued to be, passed on orally and that the primitive magical symbolism which underlay some of the practices had been forgotten bx Tudor times, In other words, some of the techniques employed by irregular medical practi- tioners appear to have degenerated into stereotyped ritual. Further, it appears that among many irregular medical practitioners there were no attempts to prove clinically the inheritance from the past, Failures were simply explained away. Generally speaking, we have argued that education plays a role of considerable importance in understanding la;^ medical practice in &gland four centuries ago. Lay practitioners, like the gentlewomen, who were familiar with contemporary theological and medical knowledge, seem to have minimized the role of superstition. In contrast, unlearned medical practitioners, among them the cunning folk, mountebanks, and midwives, appear to have made extensive use - 143 - of the bizarre and fanciful. Of course, other factors than lack of education may have been involved. Mountebanks, for instance, may have employed superstition in a deliberate desire to mislead. Cunning folk, on the other hand, may have been influenced by a desire to please clients by con- firming their suspicions. Cunning folk also believed a diagnosis of witchcraft could be confirmed by prescribed tests, though these procedures would not pass as tests in any scientific sense of the word. The magicians present an anomaly in the attempt to relate superstition to lack of education for these scholarly men turned to the numinous and the oc ult despite their learning. We have suggested they did so not through ignorance byt a Faustian desire for power. - 144 - CONCLUSION Can Tudor medicine be viewed predominantly as a science or must it be regarded as a colorful but irrational accumulation of occult and ritualistic superstitions? Having surveyed the texts, diaries, pamphlets, and official documents at our disposal, we are now challenged to formulate these materials into a final assessment. The challenge is by no means an easy one, for at first glance the predominant impression is the great diversity of medical practice, As we have seen, the diversity includes licensed physicians, surgeons, and apothecaries, and their emulators, the gentle- women; theze were the magicians, learned, but unorthodox; the clerics, who also practiced medicine and were in them- selves a diverse lot; there were the midwives and the large body of individuals who by necessity practiced home medicine; there were the cunning folk of the village and rural areas; and there were the charlatans, those nether individuals who attach themselves to every professsion in every age. Such diversity is difficult for Canadians to comprehend, living as we do in a highly technological society where professional medical care is available to almost everyone. In Tudor England, however, as in many parts of our world today, professional medical care was limited, Most physicians, surgeons, and apothecaries lived in the larger towns and cities and catered to the wealthy, unless hired by municipal authorities to look after the sick poor in hospitals. But there were few hospitals. Most of the poor in large popula- tion centers as well as those who lived in the country were forced to rely on the medical services of unregulated practitioners. In this regard, it is interesting to note that the education of the full-fledged Tudor physician required no less than fourteen years attendance at university, approximately double the time today. Though the training of surgeons and apothecaries was much less rigorous, they too had to serve an apprenticeship of several months in their guilds. In addition, certain self-educated persons might practice physic upon obtaining a license from the Church. But apparently this was no facile exercise. To procure the license, these individuals had to demonstrate their knowledge of medicine to the bishop of their diocese and also before a panel of doctors. The final result of these attempts to formulate medical practice was that the number of licensed doctors was very small. 309 If we attempt to deal with the whole range of medical services available, it becomes virtually impossible to issue statements about the nature of medical care in the Tudor era. Of necessity, then, we have chosen to base our conclu- sions on the practice of licensed practitioners of the '09we can get some idea of the paucity of reputable medical practitioners from Joyce Godber's discovery that between 1530 and 1603 there were in all of Bedfordshire only two ~h~sicians and an occasional barber who practiced primitive surgery (History of Bedfordshire lb66 - 1888 (Luton, Bedfordshire: 209). - 146 - Tudor period, using other groups as a foil to illuminate their methods. This approach seems justified when we consider that modern English medicine has proceeded from orthodox medical efforts to regulate the profession through the licensing bodies established in Tudor times, especially the College of Physicians and the Company of Barber-Surgeons. It is the contention of this exposition that the licensed practitioners were in the main stream of medical history. When we limit our findings to this group, it is possible to assert that doctors of the time were predominantly scientific in their approach to medicine and had little recourse to superstitious practices. The scientific approach requires first of all a paradigm and Tudor doctors had one in the humoral theory. This theory came to light as part of the revival of classical learning which was an important characteristic of the sixteenth century. It postulated that disease resulted primarily from an imbalance among body fluids or humours. The doctor's duty, then, was to re-establish the equilibrium among the humours and to maintain it. This was to be done usually by the prescription of drugs whose innate properties or \"elemental make-ups\" were contrary to the properties of the excess humour. The paradigm of the humours and the elements has long since become antiquated. Nevertheless, its importance as an attempt to deal with disease intelligently must not be underrated. - 147 - The scientific approach in orthod-ox medicine was further illustrated by a reliance on human reason which nay be traced to at least two sources. In the first place, the Church of England urged its members to cast off charms, in- cantations, and the like, and to rely on practical self-help abetted by the individual's direct supplication to God. 310 Secondly, the confidence of the doctors was bolstered by their spparent success in devising efficacious modes of therapy to combat new scourges of their day, the most virulent of which was syphilis. The reliame on human reason took several forms- One of these was the attenpt to relate syphilis to the humoral theory through scientific method. First came the search for sips of morbid humours by the examination of smhilitic pustules. This was folloared by the formulation of hypotheses. The one significant step lacking to make the procedure truly scientific was the testing of the hypotheses by the controlled experiment of the laboratory. In this respect, however, it must be born in mind that Tudor doctors were handicapped by the incipient state of their technology. The compound microscope was not invented until 1590 by the Dutch spectacle- maker, Zacharias Jansen, and its use for medical purposes did not occur until the seventeenth century. Admittedly the thernometer had been known for centuries. But it was first 3q0Tlnis was despite the Church's insistence on the reality of witches and devils- - 148 - used clinically in the early seventeenth century by the Italian physician, Santorio Santorio, and it would not be put to significant use until some time later. A further manifestation of the orthodox medical pro- fession's reliance on human reason was the endeavour to relate prescriptions, both centuries old and recently developed, to personal clinical experience- It hardly needs to be reiterated that some of the prescriptions, such as cow dung and young boy's urine, no longer belong to orthodox materia rnedica. The appeal of these prescriptions and others like them may even indicate that Tudor doctors sometimes failed to distinguish clearly between those patients who recovered because of their medicines and others who survived them. Still, we cannot overlook the fact that in their attempts to relate the value of prescriptions to observable phenomena, Tudor doctors acted scientifically. The reliance on human reason also led doctors to attach less importance to the role of providence in medicine, at the very time that the Reformation Church contributed to the emphasis on rationality through exhortations to seek natural means of disease control. To be sure, no doctor denied the belief that disease was a scourge sent by God to punish mankind for his sins, Nor did any doctor assert that a therapeutic measure could restore health irrespective of God's will. To do so would have been to go against individual conscience and to incur the opprobrium of the Church. None- theless, the religious aspects were weakened by a concentra- - 149 - tion on the physical manifestations of disease and on natural ways to combat then. Likewise, the emphasis on reason and rationality under- mined superstition. In etiology, we find that references in orthodox medical literature to the occult malignancy of the wolf's eyes and of the henbane plant's shadow have all but disappeared. In prognostics, only one reference to the mythical caladrius is discovered. In diagnostics, many orthodox medical books give at best short shrift to the role of astrology. In therapy and prophylaxis, references to marvellous drugs, among them the alicorn and the bezoar stone, are few. In obstetrics, our examination of orthodox medical literature turns up only one r9ference to the aetites, an amulet prescribed to prevent abortion. In all these fields, then, there is a tendency to shun the marvellous and the fantastical, substituting in their stead theory and practice which is rationally substantiated by the humoral paradigm. This is all the more remarkable when we recall that superstitious procedures were easily explained away in Tudor times, As noted earlier, for instance, the inefficacy of a bizarre drug could be accounted for by blaming witch- craft or by saying the drug had been spurious. Dr. William Clowes, who appears to have been committed to astrological phlebotomy, vent even fzrther in his attempt to justify superstitious procedures. Clowes kept an account of occasions when certain of his fellow doctors engaged in blood letting. On the basis of his record, Clowes believed - 150 - that he worked out a correlation between failures of the operation and negligence. In other words, he used a crude empirical procedure to show that astrological phlebotomy was efficacious. Nevertheless, Clowes' contemporaries continued to pay scant attention to the role of astrology in blood letting. The significant point to note here is that Tudor doctors were so committed to reason and rationality that they rejected superstitious procedures even against the arguments of their most ardent supporters. It has been suggested, moreover, that superstitions were resorted to primarily in times of crisis. For instance, when syphilis broke out at the end of the fifteenth century and continued to rage in epidemic proportions during the six- teenth century, some doctors were driven to say that the disease had astrological origins. But even these doctors were inclined to minimize the influence of the stars. In fairness to orthodox medical men of the Tudor period, their attitude towards syphilis appears to have been scarcely more superstitious than the attitude of contemporary doctors towards cancer. There is a growing awareness, for example, that massive cancer operations have frequently been performed on the basis of questionable scientific evidence and with little, if any, positive effect. In times of crisis, when human beings are motivated by fear, the irrational elements of the psyche all too easily take control of their actions. Of alb the medical groups which functioned outside or- - 151 - thodox medical practice, the gentlewomen appear to be the most admirable and impressive. Though it was an anomaly for a womm to attend university in Tudor times, the gentlewomen were a surprisingly well educated group who strove both as healers and as midwives to emulate the doctors. Gentlewomen read widely in orthodox medical literature of their day and had close contacts with doctors whom they consulted about their own health problems. In addition, gentlewomen were subject to the influence of the Protestant faith which decried most superstitions, including those associated with healing. The gentlewonen, then, seen to have been supportive of the scientific strain in Tudor medicine, extending medical services to areas the small group of licensed practitioners could not reach, Dedication and education appear to have been formative influences in the positive role played by gentlewomen. Education probably also contributed significantly to the watershed that existed between the scientific and supersti- tious practitioners of home medicine. As we have seen, some home medical practitioners adhered to the superstitious beliefs embodied in almanacs and prognostications. Others, however, were governed by the scientific precepts exemplified in Thomas Elyot's The Caste1 of helth. Aside from the natural limitations we would associate with the amateur methods of home medicine, the variability of home remedies points,to the need for formulation and consistency in a scientific discipline. On the whole, we have found that - 152 ,- consistency did exist in the medical practice of Tudor doctors. In examining another group of lay medical practitioners, the magi, we find individuals who were deeply involved in alchemical and astrolo~ical lore despite their erudition. Furthernore, there were links between the magi and neo- Platonism. In other words, the magi had a paradigm, even though it was steeped in magic and consequently was one which doctors tended to ignore. The magi, it seems, saw the world as a reification of their wishes, drives, and emotions. On this basis, their energies were directed towards the manipula- tion of nature by gaining poweri over nature. On the other hand, doctors begm with an investigation of the natural world as it exists. As scientists, they hoped by unfolding the mysteries of nature to find ways in which mankind could live in harmony with nature and therefore with greater ease and happiness. When we turn to the cunning folk, we discover that this group relied on a medley of beliefs and practices derived from medieval religion and from primitive magical symbolism. This inheritbnce from the past was generally passed on orally since the cunning folk, unlike the doctors, were usually un- lettered. Partly because of the intrinsic nature of the cunning folk's beliefs and also because of their oral tradition, the basis of their practice tended to be either * obscure or non-existent. In other words, the cunning folk lacked a paradigm, one of the first requisites of a science. - 153 - The contrast between the cunning folk and doctors is increased by the absence of efforts on the part of the cunning folk to prove clinically the merits of their heterogeneous heritage. Failure was explained away, for example, siuply by claiming that the cunning person had not been consulted in time to be of assistance. Nor can we forget that the cunning folk lacked the spirit of adventure which animated orthodox medicine and which was demonstrated in the attempts of doctors to find medical uses of a reason- able kind for hartshorn and tobacco, The primitive and stagnated aspects of the cunning folk's art emphasize the developing nature of Tudor medical science. On the other hand, it maylbe noted that the cunning folk performed a real service in the England of their day. Like the gentlewomen, they brought medical care to the rural regions where professional nedica.1 men were few. And though their techniques were questionzble, they at least brought sone measure of comfort and reassurance to clients in time of physical misfortune. It may be added, moreover, that country midwives who through ignorance, impiety, or a combination of both, resorted to a hodge-podge of superstitions to help women in childbirth performed similar functions, However, this does not alter the fact that their services remained superstitious rather than scientific in nature. The altruistic nature of the services rendered by the gentlewomen, the cunning folk, and the country midwives contrasts with the practices of the charlatans. These indi- - I54 - viduals were not only ignorant but exploitive of society. Thus they further separated themselves from orthodox medical men who by and large were guided by the high precepts of the Hippocratic Oath. When the doctors of the sixteenth century are contrasted with other medical groups of their day, the scientific nature of their practice stands out in bold relief, The doctors based their practice on the humoral paradigm, a paradigm grounded in the natural world and subject to objective malysis, Buoyed by a new xave of confidence in man's rational faculty, doctors confronted disease with the beginnings of the scientific method, including clinical observation and verificztion. Their reliance on this approach led to a corresponding weakening in the reliance on divine healing and on secular superstitions. Though supersti- tions reappemed in times of crisis, as they do in every age, even then their role was minimized by Tudor doctors. Observe the Tudor doctor, then, accoutered for work in close fitting doublet, embroidered hose, and shoes slashed in the latest French fashion. Chin sunk in his voluminous ruff, he prescribes here a herbal concoction for the gout, there a mercurial unction for syphilis, all prescriptions rationalized within the hunoral paradigm and verified by obdective analysis. Who would believe that this epitome of the scientist has paused, even so briefly, to scan his astral prognostication before sallying forth on his rounds? I.
