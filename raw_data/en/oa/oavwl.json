Common oriental medicine techniques include Acupuncture, Chinese Herbal Medicine, Tui-Na (Soft tissue treatment), Cupping, Moxibusion, and Gua-Sha. Chinese herbology uses all natural plants, shells, and minerals to help harmonize imbalances in the body that may cause disease. Unlike Western medication used to treat symptoms, Chinese herbal medicine aims to treat the root cause. Another difference from Western medicine is that Chinese formulas are designed to meet the needs of the individual patient. This special formulation is crucial and must be delicately composed for the purpose of achieving balance in each disharmonious state of being. Any deviation in dosage or herb composition can change the entire focus of the formula and therefore, the results. [What is Tui-Na?](dr-huang.html) Tui-Na is a hands-on body treatment that brings the body to balance. Tui-Na includes range of motion, traction, massage and stimulation of acupressure points. It has been used to complement the treatment of musculoskeletal and stress-related disorders of the digestive, respiratory, and reproductive systems. [What is Cupping?](dr-huang.html) Cupping is a therapeutic approach that utilizes round suction cups over a large muscular area such as the back to enhance blood circulation to the designated area. It promotes free flow of blood and energy to the acupuncture channels, dispelling cold, arthritic conditions and diminishing local swelling or fixed pain. [What is Moxibustion?](dr-huang.html) Moxibustion is a therapeutic application of indirect heat supplied by burning Mugwort over acupuncture points. It is used for conditions that would benefit from heat, such as cold arthritic conditions, cold hands, feet, lower back, menstrual irregularities, old injuries, atrophied muscles, turning breeched babies, and overall prevention of diseases and keeping healthy. It has also been shown to increase the production of white blood cells. Research has shown that the white cell count rises immediately after application of moxibustion and remains elevated for days afterwards. The production of red blood cells and hemoglobin increases after moxibustion as well. Experiments show improvement in blood and lymph circulation after treatment. Due to those biochemical changes moxibustion is effective for internal chronic ailments. [What is Gua Sha?](dr-huang.html) Gua Sha is a therapeutic treatment involving repeated pressure strokes over lubricated skin with a smooth edge to promote blood and energy circulation. It is used for headaches, muscle and tendon injuries, respiratory conditions like asthma and bronchitis, stiffness, pain, and digestive, urinary and gynecological disorders. "}
