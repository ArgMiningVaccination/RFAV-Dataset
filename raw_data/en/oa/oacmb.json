This concept is at the heart of what wedo at NHS Improving Quality - enabling healthcare staff to continuouslydevelop and use their skills for improvement. The NHS Change Model can help us to deliver this. This excellent tool has been developed with you, for you. Based on evidence and experience, itprovides a single approach to change, whether small scale, large scale ortransformational, enabling healthcare professionals to make consistent andcontinuous improvements to services and care provision. At NHS Improving Quality, we are rolling out the NHS Change Model across NHS England, CCGs, and primary care, andtesting its application in care settings. Going forward, we will continue to work with you to improve anddevelop the NHS Change Model so it can support you when leading or implementing change, whateveryour role and wherever you are in the health and care system. This evaluation is timely, providing useful intelligence that helps us understand where we currently are with the NHS Change Model and what we can do next to improve it. The report highlights the value of the NHSChange Model, demonstrating how it is has helped people as they embark on challenging and complexservice improvements. The tool is commended for its practicality, and it is encouraging that people are keento recommend it to others. As the whole of the NHS should be focused around 'continuous improvement', so too should the NHS Change Model. We will respond to the feedback highlighted in this report around applying and using themodel, and gather more feedback from others who are working to implement change. We must strive tocontinually make the NHS Change Model as good as it possibly can be and ensure its adoption and uptakeis widespread. It needs to be relevant and engaging at all levels, instantly recognised by anyone working inhealth care and beyond as the 'go to' tool for achieving successful change. As we begin this next stage of the NHS Change Model journey, I hope you will share your views and thoughts, letting us know how it has helped you and how you think it could be made better. Send yourcomments and feedback to info@nhsiq.nhs.uk . By doing this, you can help to ensure the NHS Change Model is responsive to the changing world around you, and that it continues to be a powerful and relevanttool. Perhaps more importantly, it will ensure that the NHS Change Model continues to belong to you,supporting you to successfully drive improvement and make things better and safer for patients. Professor Moira Livingston Clinical Director for Improvement Capability, NHS Improving QualitySeptember 2013ForewordFrom shared purpose to joint action: telling the story and capturing the learning from the NHS Change Model 4 The NHS Change Model ( www.changemodel.nhs.uk ) was developed to provide a single, integrated, evidence-based toolkit for achieving change in the National Health Service, in a way that attends to the fullrange of aspects of change: organisational, technical, psychological, social. Based on theory and empiricalevidence from a range of disciplines, the NHS Change Model has been adopted by NHS England as itschosen framework for instigating and managing improvement in NHS care. This report details the findingsof a formative, strengths-based evaluation of the NHS Change Model, commissioned from the SAPPHIREGroup at the University of Leicester to provide early learning from the development and uptake of the NHSChange Model, to inform further improvements to the Model itself and the way in which it iscommunicated to and used by NHS staff. The evaluation, which took place from September 2012 to March 2013, comprised two phases. The first phase considered the design, development and objectives of the NHS Change Model to generate aprogramme theory of change, using interviews with those involved in the development, analysis of officialdocuments on the NHS Change Model, and observation of webinars relating to the NHS Change Model.The second stage focused on the application of the NHS Change Model in practice, using in-depthinterviews with NHS clinicians and managers who were using it, including those from 'early mover' sites,and others who had taken up the NHS Change Model and sought to use it elsewhere. Intervieweesincluded both commissioners and providers, and clinicians and managers. Key findings from the study include: \u0081Testimony from those who had experience of using it in practice suggested that the NHS Change Model had a great deal to commend it. All said that they had found the NHS Change Model as a whole, or some of its constituent parts, useful in their change efforts, and all said that they would recommend it to others. The multifaceted nature of the NHS Change Model meant that participants were seeking to apply it to very challenging, complicated service improvement tasks (section 5.1). \u0081Much of the appeal of the NHS Change Model was to be found in its simplicity: it was not seen as novel by participants, but this was welcomed, since it was clearly grounded in existing evidence, and sought notto introduce a new, 'faddish', framework for change, but rather to bring together the best of what already exists (section 5.1). The practical orientation of the NHS Change Model was also valued, with its pointers to wider resources under each of its sections, and its guidance on what action is needed to support change. \u0081There was some suggestion in the data that participants had mixed experiences of applying the NHS Change Model in a way that was faithful to its design. In particular, participants struggled to use all eight of the components of the NHS Change Model alongside one another, and in a way that reconciled the tensions between them (section 5.3). The 'harder' aspects of change management posed a particular challenge. There were also signs in a few cases that participants saw the NHS Change Model as a solutionin itself: a process to be applied (with guaranteed results) rather than a heuristic framework that needed to be drawn on more iteratively and creatively. \u0081Those using the NHS Change Model tended to do so in a relatively isolated, individualised way: rather than using it to explicitly frame change and mobilise those around them involved in the process, they tended to use it either individually or in small teams (section 5.2). They then would draw on the skills of others as and when they arose, without bringing these other stakeholders into the process of using the NHS Change Model as a whole. They also found that some of the language in the NHS Change Model risked alienating key stakeholders in change, and so worked actively to translate it for different audiences. While such an approach to using the NHS Change Model seemed appropriate in many cases, it also posed risks in terms of the resilience and sustainability of change led and managed by such small teams.Executive summaryFrom shared purpose to joint action: telling the story and capturing the learning from the NHS Change Model 5\u0081Participants made a number of suggestions about technical improvements that might be made to the NHS Change Model, and modifications that might be made to its substance and presentation (section 5.5). \u0081Other challenges faced in using the Model were less readily remedied, most notably those relating to the organisational context in which the NHS Change Model is being applied (section 5.5). Participants identified difficulties in finding alignments with wider system drivers, and in ensuring that approaches to change achieved a balance between extrinsic and intrinsic motivators, in an NHS context characterised by rising demand, static or decreasing resources, and pressures to achieve changes rapidly. In such an organisational context, a critical factor in the degree to which the NHS Change Model can be used to instigate sustainable improvement will be how far its use can be protected from these widerpressures: this suggests a particularly important role for senior leaders in organisations in mediatingpressures and creating space for the steady, patient, thoroughgoing approach to change encouraged by theNHS Change Model. It also has important implications for the way in which NHS England seeks toencourage use of the NHS Change Model by commissioners and providers, discussed in section 6 of thereport. From shared purpose to joint action: telling the story and capturing the learning from the NHS Change Model 6From shared purpose to joint action: telling the story and capturing the learning from the NHS Change Model 7This report provides detailed findings from a two-phase, strengths-based formative evaluation of the NHS Change Model. The evaluation, commissioned from the University of Leicester by the NHS Change Modelteam, sought in Phase 1 to provide an account of the origins and development of the model and associatedtools in seeking to address the challenges faced by the NHS, and then in Phase 2 to offer an analysis of theNHS Change Model in action in selected areas across the NHS, based on the experience of those in 'early-adopter sites' selected and supported by the NHS Change Model team, and other individuals and groupswho were making early use of the NHS Change Model. The report presents findings from the two phases sequentially in two sections, with discussion and commentary following both. We draw judiciously from wider literature in order to highlight the dimensionsof some of the challenges faced, and to illuminate some of the resources that the NHS Change Model candraw on in overcoming these.1. IntroductionFrom shared purpose to joint action: telling the story and capturing the learning from the NHS Change Model 8Phase 1 of the evaluation took place from August to October 2012. It drew on three main sources of data: \u0081interviews with eight stakeholders involved in the initiation, development and spread of the NHS Change Model; \u0081documents describing the NHS Change Model available on its website or provided by the team; and \u0081a 'virtual ethnography' of NHS Change Model webinars, in which one or more researchers 'sat in' on webinars to observe both the presentations themselves and the responses of attendees (in the form of questions, chat-box comments and Twitter statuses). Interviews were semi-structured and were conducted by telephone. The topic guide focused particularly on the background, need for and development of the NHS Change Model, and also on the content of the NHSChange Model, its strengths, anticipated uses and anticipated challenges for those adopting it. After beinggiven information on the nature and purpose of the study, participants were given the opportunity to askquestions, and then asked to provide written consent to be interviewed. Interviews were audio-recorded,fully transcribed, imported into qualitative data analysis software (QSR NVivo), and then coded according toa mixture of predetermined and emergent categories, using an approach based on the Frameworkmethod. 1Notes from seven webinars were also included in this analysis, along with the text of seven internal or public documents relating to the NHS Change Model. For Phase 2, so far twenty-eight participants have been interviewed, of which analysis of 23 interviews was included in this report. Five interviews are awaiting transcribing, and subject to consent, two-to-threefurther interviews may be undertaken. These interviews are analysed and incorporated into the final versionof this report. Participants in Phase 2 were purposively sampled via three approaches. These were: \u0081Early adopter sites using the NHS Change Model (15 interviewees from four sites) \u0081Individuals who had taken part in webinars highlighting the Model, and who consented to their details being shared with the research team with a view to an interview \u0081Individuals who agreed to participate in an interview following a 'Getting Started with the NHS Change Model' survey undertaken on behalf of the NHS Change Model team. This mix provided a balance of those who had used the NHS Change Model and those who had expressed interest in using it but had yet to commence working with it. The sample, however, is thus inevitablycomprised more-or-less exclusively of those who were open to using the NHS Change Model, and who hadactively sought to investigate it or adopt it for their own purposes within the first six-to-nine months of itsexistence. The composition of the sample should be taken into account in interpreting the analysis of Phase2 data. Table 1 gives an overview of the roles of the participants in Phase 2.2.

In Phase 2, the topic guide for the interviews focused on use of the NHS Change Model in practice, strengths of the NHSChange Model, specific components, challenges in its use, and strategies used in spreading the Model.After being given information on the nature and purpose of the study, participants were given theopportunity to ask questions, and then asked to provide written consent to be interviewed. Interviewswere audio-recorded, fully transcribed, imported into qualitative data analysis software (QSR NVivo), andthen coded according to a mixture of predetermined and emergent categories, using an approach based onthe Framework method. 1The analysis to date (as at 20 March 2013) is based on 23 interviews. In the course of the analysis, the coding frame was also revised in the light of new themes that emerged from thedata. These iterative and inductive approaches allowed for flexible and recursive consideration of keythemes as and when they emerged.From shared purpose to joint action: telling the story and capturing the learning from the NHS Change Model 113.1. The background to the NHS Change Model It was clear from the sources we analysed that the NHS Change Model is a product of its time. Unprecedented increases in demand produced by the demographic changes of an ageing society, theshifting burden of disease from acute to chronic conditions, new technologies and interventions, and thechanging expectations of contemporary healthcare consumers require major changes in the way in whichhealthcare is organised and provided. At the same time, a real-terms freeze in national expenditure onhealthcare for the foreseeable future, and institutional restructuring and turbulence, compound thechallenge. Though the past couple of decades offer examples of how the NHS has successfully pursuedchange at various scales in response to such pressures, the pace and scale of change now required may beof a different order. The NHS Change Model seeks to offer a resource to help the NHS organise andmobilise its response to challenges of a nature that simply has not been seen before.3. Findings from Phase One When we look forward at theunprecedented change agendathat we face, like when we thinkabout the NHS and the system,between now and 2014/15 thereis a four per cent per yearcompound reduction. In globalterms it is unprecedented. Thereis no other healthcare system inthe world that has taken that biga hit, and particularly seeking tomake the changes through quality.\" Interviewee 2\"At the same time, however, the NHS Change Model also seeks to transcend the current fiscal,demographic and organisational context by appealingto core values that underpin the NHS. It is notintended as a snap response to the specificchallenges posed by the economic scene of the2010s, but as a durable resource that consolidatesexisting learning, can be applied in all sorts ofsituations, and above all is faithful to the ethic andcore values that underpin the NHS. There's been some fantastic changes inthe NHS so far which have improvedcare for so many people. As a nationalcare system however we are not goodat sharing those great improvementsfor all and shrinking finances make thiseven more important now. The NHSChange Model takes the best of whatwe know and gives us a checklist forthe components of change necessaryto deliver and share for the benefit of all.\" Output report from NHS Change Model: The Big Event\"From shared purpose to joint action: telling the story and capturing the learning from the NHS Change Model 12These conditions gave rise to a perceived need for a framework that would: \u0081bring together a range of evidence-based approaches to change, \u0081provide resources to NHS staff to help them to achieve that change, particularly by maximising the benefit they gained from existing, underutilised strengths, and \u0081ensure that change efforts align with other pressures and priorities in the NHS, to maximise the chances of sustainable and replicable success. The scale of transformation needed in the NHS in order to deliver improvedquality from available resources is huge. It requires an evidence-based,systematic and skilled application of change management approaches inorder to achieve it.\" Commissioning Board workshop on the NHS Change Model\" 3.2. The idea behind the NHS Change Model The NHS Change Model seeks to achieve these aims through clear diagrammatic representation,connections to supporting strategies developed by the NHS Institute for Innovation and Improvement andothers, and a range of tools\u2014some already available, some in development\u2014to ensure that componentsare used synergistically rather than antagonistically. It is intended to appeal to all sorts of NHS stakeholders,so that it becomes a common language for change and avoids creating tensions and conflicts between theNHS's 'tribes' of professionals and managers. By placing the uniting 'shared purpose' of the NHS at thecentre\u2014literally\u2014of the diagrammatic representation of the model, it also seeks to centre that sharedpurpose in the change initiatives undertaken in the NHS. By appealing to the key resource of the commonvalues of NHS stakeholders, the aim is to provide a model that attracts authentic commitment from staffwho want to make changes that adhere to the underpinning ethos of the NHS, improve its appropriatenessfor patients, and ensure its survival as a mode of providing healthcare. Alongside this emphasis on the values, content and structure of the NHS Change Model, great consideration has gone into ensuring that the way it is communicated to its potential user base does notundermine these good intentions. There has been recognition that, as a model vaunted by an NHS 'elite',developed by a national agency and adopted by the National Commissioning Board (now known as NHSEngland), the NHS Change Model risks being viewed as 'just another' managerial tool to be incorporatedinto routine work. Thus while the model may have been spurred by the need to increase the pace and scale of change, it also responds to learning from perennial problems associated with change in the NHS: failures to learn from theexisting evidence base; failures to link up and align change efforts so that they often result in piecemeal orunsustainable change; failures to spread learning so that others might benefit from both successes andmistakes. 2In trying to provide a resource that will help to overcome these failings, the NHS Change Model also seeks to harness the NHS's strengths to address some of the problems that can plague change effortsin complex organisational contexts: 'top-down', coercive approaches to change that alienate frontline staffand result in a focus on compliance rather than commitment; 'internecine' strife between differentstakeholders within the health service who, despite being united by a common set of values and motivators, are often in conflict, especially when it comes to change efforts; and tensions and apparent contradictionsbetween extrinsic and intrinsic motivators of change. In this way, the NHS Change Model builds on an increasingbody of evidence which emphasises the importance of a 'mixed economy' of change that uses various strategiesfor improvement, and also addresses the potential tensions between them. 3From shared purpose to joint action: telling the story and capturing the learning from the NHS Change Model 13It's to help the NHS make change at scale and pace, and to involve as many people as possible, but to make sure that that change is done in a rigorousway so that the change is sustained and people are engaged in the process and buy into what we're trying to do.\" Interviewee 3\" The emphasis of the NHS Change Model on multifaceted approaches to change, on actively working to ensure alignment and reduce potential tensions between its eight components, and on ensuring that allchange is underpinned and directed by the shared purpose that is seen to unite NHS staff, came throughstrongly from interviews and documentary sources; it was also clearly articulated by presenters andparticipants in webinars. Particularly evident is the work that has gone into making the language of changeaccessible and acceptable, in a context where resistance to managerial initiatives and change fatigue couldeasily generate major obstacles for a model that is essentially about change management. 5Care has gone into aligning the model itself with the central ethos and spirit of the NHS, and viewing the NHS itself as aproduct of radical innovation and responsiveness to change rather than of conservatism: More than 60 years ago, it was people taking collective responsibility forchange and working differently that led to the formation of the NHS. Sincethat time, many people who have cared deeply for the ideals of the NHShave seen the need to take action to ensure that our national health systemcontinues to deliver for future generations. Today, we are the cohort ofclinicians, leaders and improvement activists who value the NHS and who arewilling to free our minds to new possibilities. We can deliver a health andhealthcare system that is the envy of the world, even with constrainedresources but it won't just happen without concerted action. The NHSChange Model can play a key role in achieving this but it depends on thousands of us joining up our change activities.\" Output report from NHS Change Model: The Big Event\"Adoption that is driven by 'compliance' rather than 'commitment' may mean a half-hearted approach that does not reap the full benefits of the intellectual work that has gone into the alignments between itscomponents\u2014or worse still, induces a 'box-ticking' approach that achieves no real change, encourages'gaming' and contributes to cynicism. 4Considerable effort has therefore gone into the planning the manner in which the model is publicised, with several interviewees describing a launch \"by stealth\" thateschewed grand pronouncements, central launches and implementation 'roll-out' in favour of low-keyevents, word of mouth, and work to plant the seeds for a 'social movement', reliant in particular on socialmedia. This combination of approaches to content, structure and marketing are intended to make available the set of tools needed to make the changes necessary for the NHS, ensure their fidelity to its underpinning values,and spread uptake by 'leaders' from all sorts of backgrounds and in all sorts of contexts:From shared purpose to joint action: telling the story and capturing the learning from the NHS Change Model 14Participants were positive about the way in which the NHS Change Model as developed had managed tomarry this array of differing concerns, resulting in aframework that was both useful and likely to be usedby diverse stakeholder groups. At the same time, theystressed that an essential aspect of the theory ofchange of the model was that it be owned andadapted by NHS practitioners. As such it was still indevelopment and would remain so for some time: toremain effective and relevant, it would need tocontinue to build on and learn from the experiencesof its users and thus remain a 'live' resourceundergoing constant improvement, adaptation andrefinement.I think we all expect betterconvenience and better quality,and so as a nation I think ourNHS is precious, but people areexpecting more of it, and to beable to meet those needs, to beable to continue, so that the NHScontinues to deliver the things itwas set up to deliver in 1948, wehave to do something, and thatsomething means we have toimprove the quality and cost of services that we provide.\" Interviewee 5\" 3.3. Strengths, challenges, and overcoming the challenges Key strengths of the NHS Change Model perceived by interview participants were the way its design and format sought to address the important concerns noted above. By bringing together essential sources ofknowledge and tools for change, the NHS Change Model \"gives us a fighting chance of delivering what weneed to deliver\" (Interviewee 2). Equally importantly, the asset-based approach of the model, and itsattention to fostering commitment, were seen as qualities that might secure uptake: It starts from a very good place, and that's that it's asset-based, and that it'sevidence based, and I think that gives it a real 'va-va-voom' if you like,because rigorous performance management cultures and target-drivencultures have made people think about the deficit that they have yet to sortout, i.e. you're only treating 80% of your people within 18 weeks, you've got20% to sort out, how are you going to do it. The NHS Change Model doesn'tstart from that position, it starts from what's our shared purpose, what's theoutcome we're looking to deliver, and what has worked very well before, andlet's try and sort of look at that and say how did that work and start withthat. I think the other thing about the NHS Change Model is, because of the hearts-and-minds starting point, it appeals to people's values.\" Interviewee 5\"From shared purpose to joint action: telling the story and capturing the learning from the NHS Change Model 15The compatibility of the NHS Change Model with existing efforts at improvement and change management was seen as an important complement to this, helping to emphasise that the model was not a 'top-down'imposition designed to sweep away the 'bottom-up' work of frontline practitioners, but rather a helpfulframework to be used pragmatically to enhance such efforts. The alignment of extrinsic and intrinsic motivators, and the variety of rationales for change to which it draws attention, were seen as a powerful means of securing buy-in from a range of stakeholders andovercoming professional resistance: That is the ultimate strength of it, and I think the other thing is that itrecognises that people react differentlyto change, so people who are rational,and respect rational arguments\u2014likewe've got to save some money so thishas got to change\u2014they mightrespond to that, whereas most doctorswould just say no, forget it. Thenthere's the people who sort of havethe sort of intrinsic, if you like, reasonsfor changing, so you would say tothem, we must change becauseactually things could be a lot better forour patients and we're really not doingthe best by them at the moment, andthat's much more powerful argumentfor a doctor than we've got to save abit of money so we need to change.\" Interviewee 5\"The combination of coherence and flexibility ofthe NHS Change Model was seen as apotentially crucial strength given some of thechallenges in practice that it was likely to face.For example, one participant pointed out theimportance of institutions and factors externalto the NHS\u2014for example, the way in which itsfate is tied up with that of social care. A modelthat is solid in its evidence-based foundations,but whose appeal can be tailored to differentaudiences, may help in ensuring that it can beused profitably in informing system-widechange. Similarly, the ongoing development ofthe NHS Change Model, building onexperiences of using it in practice, was seen ascritical to making sure that appeal acrossstakeholder groups is maximised. Efforts to refine the language of the NHS Change Model and address earlymisinterpretations were evident in thewebinars. One participant commented, forexample, that \"it would have been good ifwe'd managed to articulate in the model theimportance of patients and the public\"(Interviewee 4). We noted that clear effort hadgone into foregrounding the place of patientsand the public in the model in several of thewebinars we observed. Feedback about thechallenges of reconciling and aligning thedivergent components of the model gave riseto work to produce a 'polarity toolkit' that iscurrently in development. All in all, the NHSChange Model's status as a work in progress,and the product of the collective wisdom andexperience of so many NHS practitioners, offersgreat opportunities to enhance its appeal andutility for all sorts of situations.From shared purpose to joint action: telling the story and capturing the learning from the NHS Change Model 16A potentially more challenging risk to the NHS Change Model is that of 'corruption'.Notwithstanding the intentions of its creators, a toolsuch as the NHS Change Model may be subject tomanagerialisation. In particular, it may be deployed incoercive, heavy-handed ways that stifle bottom-upinnovation and enthusiasm, and risk undermining theemphasis on commitment over compliance. 6Even if not incorporated into top-down managerialtechniques, there is also the risk that the NHS ChangeModel could become viewed as a 'checklist' to beticked rather than a heuristic tool that provideschallenge and inspiration: if viewed in this way, itspotential would be severely impeded: The other weakness is that it can beseen as a checklist. And I don't knowquite, I think we're doing somethingto get over that, but I think there willalways be some people who likechecklists who will see this as achecklist: you know, I've ticked all of those boxes, I'm all right.\" Interviewee 4\" The ongoing package of support, dialogue and development accompanying the NHS Change Modelwas seen as a crucial source of strength in counteringthis risk. The real experiences of those using themodel in practice could offer a vital resource, both inevidencing the value of the NHS Change Model toconvince more sceptical stakeholders of its worth, andalso to offer rich examples of how best to draw on themodel and use it intelligently to inform change efforts.I think getting back to a quickearly action review with keychampions and key shapers of thething. I think there is a danger ofusing the great and the good toomuch and not people with theirsleeves rolled up enough becausethe breadth of expertise aroundthis is much bigger than the core theme.\" Interviewee 1\" Continuing, then, to build the 'infrastructure' around the NHS Change Model\u2014includingsupplementary information and know-how,and the social infrastructure of like-minded,mutually supporting professionals\u2014was seen ascrucial in ensuring that it is used optimally.From shared purpose to joint action: telling the story and capturing the learning from the NHS Change Model 3.4 In sum: the NHS Change Model's theory of change Briefly, based upon our analysis, the theory of change that underlies the NHS Change Model might be summarised as follows. The NHS Change Model provides a framework for guiding and organising change in the NHS by bringing together evidence-based guidance and resources in a way that is accessible and comprehensible to NHSstaff, and which explicitly addresses the need for alignment between the diverse components of change. Itposits that previous efforts at generating lasting, large-scale change in the NHS have been hampered by anumber of problems: failure to take a multifaceted approach that involves achieving change throughmultiple mechanisms; failure to address sufficiently the tensions between these mechanisms, and to turnthese into synergistic polarities; an overall approach to change that is managerialised and compliance-oriented, and which thus has failed to make the most of the 'shared purpose' that unites NHS stakeholders.It also posits that an underutilised resource in instigating change is the experience, expertise and peersupport of NHS managers and professionals themselves\u2014as well as their common shared purpose\u2014andthat this is also vital to the generation of a framework that is effective, user-friendly and credible. It seeks to build on this learning by: (i) providing an integrative framework, comprising eight components, that summarises in an easily accessible format the 'ingredients' needed for successful change, addresses theneed to align these and overcome the tensions between them, and which provides access to furtherevidence-based resources that offer assistance in putting these into practice; (ii) offering a programme ofsupport to practitioners that provides further assistance from experts and peers on the NHS Change Modeland applying it effectively, and which responds to the ideas and needs identified by the model's users; (iii)relying for uptake and spread not on a top-down process which is likely to generate compliance without,necessarily, sincere and enthusiastic use of the NHS Change Model, but on 'horizontal' spread among peersin the NHS which facilitates support and knowledge sharing, pragmatic and creative adaptation toparticular circumstances, and ownership of the model among its users. 17From shared purpose to joint action: telling the story and capturing the learning from the NHS Change Model 18Our analysis suggests a few overarching challenges for maintaining the current momentum behind the NHS Change Model, and securing the role of the model in improvement. 1. Reaching beyond the proselytes. The attendance and enthusiasm of those participating in webinars and Twitter clubs is impressive, and interviewees commented upon how quickly interest in the NHS ChangeModel has spread. What is not yet clear, however, is how readily this enthusiasm will spread beyond theseearly adopters: is this the start of the 'S curve', or something which will only ever appeal to eagerenthusiasts? Some participants noted that some of the language of the NHS Change Model, despite bestefforts, continues to alienate those who are not 'tuned into' improvement and change; the 'socialmovement' approach to spreading the NHS Change Model, while avoiding managerialisation andcompliance-oriented uptake, may risk reinforcing the perception that this is a model for a certain, change-oriented, social media-savvy cadre of NHS staff, and not for others. Consolidating the place of the NHSChange Model in mainstream NHS change efforts, and appealing to the more conservative sections of theNHS community, may require complementary approaches. 2. Resisting (the perception of) managerialisation\u2014but taking advantage of alignment opportunities. Participants were clearly conscious of the narrow channel between relying solely on 'horizontal' spread through enthusiastic adopters on the one hand, and relying on top-down imposition onthe other. As noted above, both strategies have their vulnerabilities. The adoption of the NHS ChangeModel by NHS England thus presents a double-edged sword. Those sponsoring it are clearly aware of this(\"This is not a Stalinist 'we must use this'\u2014but it will underpin the commissioning system. If we just seekcompliance, we won't get the outcomes\"\u2014NHS Commissioning Board workshop on the NHS ChangeModel). While managerial imposition is unlikely to give rise to the kind of nuanced engagement with theNHS Change Model that is central to its theory of change, there is evidence that a 'mixed economy' ofintrinsic and extrinsic incentives can be an effective influence on change if used with care\u2014and of course,the model itself highlights this. What this perhaps calls for is a 'meta-alignment' exercise, with a view toidentifying how best to take advantage of the promotion of the NHS Change Model by NHS bodies thatenjoy managerial authority: how they can use this positional power to raise the profile of the modelwithout distorting its purpose; how to inspire uptake of the model without compelling. 3. Striking the right balance between creativity and fidelity. Novel application of the NHS Change Model by creative professionals in different parts of the NHS is a central component of the theory ofchange. This is a strength that will ensure uptake, ownership, effectiveness and embedding. Avoidingdictatorial imposition is essential. But the NHS Change Model is also an evidence-based approach, andindeed the evidence underpinning it is important both to its appeal and to its potential effectiveness as atool for change. How, then, to encourage ownership and creativity while also ensuring fidelity to thefundamental, evidence-based tenets of the model? Reliance on horizontal spread through the social ties ofadopters poses a particular threat here, as descriptions of components can quickly change as they aredisseminated, and there is a thin line between adaptation and distortion. Equally, however, the NHSChange Model itself recognises that inspired adaptations of the model to tailor it to contexts, scenarios andrelationships that they know best is a vital resource that should be harnessed, not sidelined. In this light,continuing to draw on the powerful opportunities for feedback, dialogue and direction that are afforded bysocial media would seem to be an important way of 'anchoring' the model in evidence-based bedrockwithout unnecessarily impeding professionals' use of it, and also enhancing the model itself by building onthe learning of users in various contexts.4. Reflections from Phase OneFrom shared purpose to joint action: telling the story and capturing the learning from the NHS Change Model 194. Overcoming scepticism and cynicism. Several interviewees noted that although founded on evidence-based tools, the evidence base for the NHS Change Model as a whole is inevitably weak so far - aclear disadvantage in an environment that values evidence of efficacy so highly. Though it is unlikely to bepossible to offer gold-standard, experimentally derived evidence for its value, it is expected that increasingadoption of the NHS Change Model will start a positive feedback loop, generating more evidence whichprompts more adoption. Clearly maintaining momentum and gathering a repository of evidence of variouskinds about how the NHS Change Model can be utilised will be important during this period. Perhaps abigger challenge than this kind of healthy scepticism, however, is overcoming the cynicism of those whoview the model as another managerial fad, to be paid lip service or treated with contempt until it goesaway. A risk here is that rather than overcoming it, the work to spread the word about the model'horizontally' works to entrench the division between 'proselytes' and 'non-believers'. The social mediacampaign might be seen less as a 'social movement' and more as evidence of irrelevance. 5. Articulating the difference made by commitment-driven adoption. Interviewees and documents were adamant that for the NHS Change Model to work in practice, engagement with it needs to be drivenby commitment, rather than by compliance with external expectations. This is clearly important if the NHSChange Model is to gain traction in an NHS with so many competing top-down demands. What is perhapsnot so clear so far\u2014though may well become more evident as learning is gathered from its use inpractice\u2014is the difference that a commitment-based approach makes to the ability of the model to guidechange. Put simply, how does a commitment-driven use of the NHS Change Model look different to acompliance-driven use of the NHS Change Model? Is commitment only important in helping users to seethe worth of the model in the first place, or does it inform how they engage with it post-adoption? 6. Addressing the tensions in the 'shared purpose'. While the values-driven approach to change that the NHS Change Model embraces has much to commend it, it is inevitable that in times of resourceconstraint, there will be real conflict between well-meaning stakeholders acting in good faith about difficultdecisions. Interviewees, and NHS Change Model-related documents, were optimistic about the potential ofthe commitment to 'shared purpose' to mediate in such disputes by providing common ground on whichall can agree: It's fairly obvious in 'shared purpose', but say in 'engagement to mobilise', someof the people that we want to do things differently are actually patients. So ifwe need to make big change, reconfiguration of hospital services for instance,which might mean closure of wards, then ideally we need patients to beunderstanding why that change is happening and supporting it, rather thanbeing on the street outside with placards saying how awful it is, given thatmostly, most of the closures that have happened so far have actually been to dowith improving safety, we clearly haven't been getting our conversation rightwith patients.\" Interviewee 4\"From shared purpose to joint action: telling the story and capturing the learning from the NHS Change Model 20Yet this perhaps underestimates the degree to which even 'rational' decisions based on service quality and safety are political, and can become politicised: service rationalisation intended to improve safety andallocate resources optimally will almost always create losers as well as winners. The risk here is that 'sharedpurpose' becomes a motif that those in favour of a particular change deploy to seek to neutraliseopposition, by characterising it as misguided or constituting vested interest. Used this way, the currency of'shared purpose' could very quickly become devalued (and the NHS Change Model itself could begin to beseen as a political tool deployed to facilitate the imposition of controversial changes). A more challenging\u2014but ultimately potentially much more profitable\u2014way of harnessing the strength of 'shared purpose' maybe to see it as a starting point to inform debates about how the change options ahead might be selected:an approach which recognises legitimate differences but provides a framework for reconciling them.From shared purpose to joint action: telling the story and capturing the learning from the NHS Change Model 215. Findings from Phase Two I don't think the NHS Change Model is rocket science or something brandnew but what it does do is bringtogether the components of howyou make change into a very simplestructure, even just the visualstructure. It makes you think aboutthe component parts of it. It is notenough just to have a shared vision.You also have to have the leadershipand the engagement to mobiliseand the system drivers or you atleast have to question yourselfabout whether they are there.\" (028)\"5.1 Appeal and application The views on the NHS Change Model of the participants in Phase 2 of the study were, overall, veryfavourable. Their early experiences of using it in their change efforts had been largely positive, and it isworth noting that every participant, when asked, stated that they would recommend the NHS ChangeModel to others as a useful tool. Participants identified a number of reasons why they found the NHS Change Model appealing. Many suggested that it was not a particularly novel way of approaching change, but saw this in positive terms:rather than 'reinventing the wheel', it was something that brought together a range of existing tools in asingle, accessible place. As such, it provided an evidence-based resource that pooled otherwise dispersedknowledge about instigating and managing change, and helped to ensure that change efforts addressedthe full range of dimensions needed for success: It's a methodology to follow isn't it, that gives us some concrete evidenceof change using proven methods ratherthan random methods. So that's why Iliked it, I liked the structure of it. Andthe simplicity of it.\" (020)\" There is only so many ways you canchange something, it's just trying to,for me it's\u2014the real benefit iscoming up with a quite easy tounderstand set of tools.\" (017)\" I think certainly they [colleagues] see it as not being something brand new thatthey have got to try and learn, and they do feel that because it has some degreeof structure although it is not a cycle that you must do this before this, before this,it is a framework of reminding you what you need to be looking at (023)\"From shared purpose to joint action: telling the story and capturing the learning from the NHS Change Model 22In bringing a complement of evidence-based resources together in this manner, the NHS Change Model was seen as having a very practical orientation that participants valued. The articulation of different aspectsof change, and the links to specific tools, meant that it was seen as something that gave clear guidance onwhat to consider, and pointers on what to do. Rather than simply outlining areas for consideration, it wasseen as offering clear direction on the need for action: Lots of these models don't\u2014you have this theory and that theory and are oftennamed after someone who invented them which is all very nice but the NHSChange Model says what it is. [...] Things like the Leadership Framework and theQuality Framework and I suppose those things are all quite good but they arequite\u2014what is the word? I want to say inactive but that is not quite the word Imean, but they are not very\u2014I suppose the NHS Change Model is more proactivein terms of what it is trying to get people to do in a way that frameworks don'tsomehow. [...]It is very much the language, leadership for change, for example, isone of the six or seven parts of the shared purpose. If you take leadership forchange, it is just that language, for example, if you were using that heading withina framework, it would probably be something like strong leadership.\" (011)\" It's based in things that we've learned and it's based in a people reality rather thanmethodology reality. [...] I've worked with NHS Change Models which try to coverall the bases but are quite simplified for the benefit of the teams that you aretrying to engage with. So it doesn't come across as an onerous task, as a processit's quite straightforward to manage, you know it's quite linear. You know we'rehere, we need to get there. These are the stages we'll go through, these are theworkshops we're going to have, these are the actions we're going to take.Whereas that hasn't worked very well I think and this feels a bit more complete.\" (008)\"From shared purpose to joint action: telling the story and capturing the learning from the NHS Change Model 23It's very holistic and rich in the way that it's designed, so it enables us to look back at a high level and ensure that we've really met the key parts of effective projectmanagement and large scale change. And I think before, we perhaps focused onyou know the more traditional project planning approaches, but not necessarily onspread of innovation, or system drivers or leadership for change. So we'vebecome very process led if you like. So the NHS Change Model has been veryhelpful with that.\" (009)\" In bringing together evidence founded in multiple theories of organisational change, and in articulating theconnections, interactions and interdependencies between these, the NHS Change Model was seen to offera clear manifesto that set out the active work required, along with links to detailed guidance on how toundertake that work. Above all, participants tended to agree, the NHS Change Model had a face validity to it: a combination of strong foundation in evidence and clear applicability. As one participant (006) put it, the NHS ChangeModel did not make an especially striking first impression: It was more, 'Oh yeah, that makes sense', than necessarily something new,because I don't think there was anything particularly new in it\u2014which is actually agood thing, because I'm not interested in novelty value, I'm interested insomething that's useful and is going to help us.\"\" This, it was agreed, meant that it was more likely to be acceptable to sceptical or change-fatiguedmanagers and clinicians than something that looked unnecessarily novel or faddish. It also meant that theNHS Change Model could potentially be used to supplement, enhance or organise efforts that were alreadyunderway: We thought this would be a really good idea to [bring] all our history together, youknow, not start afresh, really treat the model as an umbrella model, you know,we're not getting rid of things that we've done in the past, we're not throwingthe baby out with the bath water, we're actually going to use the model to buildon some of the change that we are making within the organisation.\" (003)\"From shared purpose to joint action: telling the story and capturing the learning from the NHS Change Model 24This view of the NHS Change Model as a holistic, readily applicable approach that incorporated lessons from a wide range of existing approaches was reflected in the uses to which participants were seeking toput it. Though some acknowledged that they were in the very early stages of trying to put the NHS ChangeModel into practice, the applications that many described were typically ambitious and multifaceted,involving co-ordination and shifts across organisational and professional boundaries, and often in thecontext of pressing needs for cost savings. Because this is a sort of a multi-partnership project, so not just involving NHS waysof working, it involves a range of different providers and commissioners. But Ithink we all recognise that the tools [and] methodology within the NHS ChangeModel resonated across different sectors, even though it was about the NHS.Quite often you know we go straight to delivery rather than actually thinkingabout leadership, vision, what sort of methodology we want to use, how we aregoing to measure it, and we don't necessarily develop a project thinking about allthe aspects that will make it work. We move quite often straight intoimplementation and then when we falter we don't recognise that it's becausesome of the things may not be in place. And so I think for us, it's about, 'Actuallylet's use a process where we are considering all aspects but also that we canactually measure where things have not been as successful as they could be'.\" (014)\" What we are trying to do is over the coming year, and we have already started towork on it, is look at the whole of the urgent care pathway for [this area], [and]provider relationships across the health economy. We have got one-to-onerelationships with mental health, community, acute etc., which is quiteadvantageous really for making shape changes to how we deliver services. I thinkthat really lends itself to making some kind of large step changes and that's reallywhat we are going to focus on.\" (017)\"From shared purpose to joint action: telling the story and capturing the learning from the NHS Change Model 25Generally these types of things always seem really useful... and it's one of those things where actually, sometimes you have got a problem and you are not, first ofall you are not even sure sometimes how to define that problem. So I think I washoping that the tool could help with that, but also in terms of suggesting someprocesses and techniques. [...] We know we have got some issues, so for examplewe have got some issues around delayed transfers of care. We know that ourunscheduled admission rate is increasing. We know that has a bit to do withdemographic rise. But what we don't really understand as a system is howchanges in one part of the system have a knock-on effect on the other. And alsowe don't really have a way of anticipating what those changes are going to be, sothere is something about the system and the leadership within the system notworking together, and it being such a complicated system that change andsimultaneous change can be introduced without any knowledge of theconsequences.\" (018)\" The NHS Change Model was seen as having potential\u2014albeit as yet unproven\u2014in addressing complex,systemic, 'wicked' problems which defy easy responses and require co-ordinated, multifaceted responses, 7 in a way that accounted for potential unintended consequences, engaged stakeholders and securedsustainable change. I think it is completely relevant to what we are trying to do and similar thingswhere you are trying to make a transformational change: a project that is focusedon trying to change hearts and minds and trying to change the way that staffwork and really needing to engage a lot of different people, all who havesomething to do with this. And change will fail if you haven't got people behind itso I think that kind of big-scale change programme is probably where it is bestused.\" (002)\"From shared purpose to joint action: telling the story and capturing the learning from the NHS Change Model 26Consequently there were high hopes for the way in which the NHS Change Model would guide change efforts. Failures of the past were attributed to insufficient attention to the breadth of considerationsrequired in change efforts; correspondingly, the expectation was that in accounting for all the dimensionsof change included in the Model's eight components, current work would have a greater chance ofachieving a lasting impact for the better of the NHS:The model helped [colleague] get an understanding that these were some of theareas that we need to be thinking about, because far too often we only think ofone or two of those areas on that NHS Change Model, and not looking at thesystem drivers coming in to push the change and we just think of rigorous deliveryand transparent measurement, you know, we don't always look at all the otherareas. But the Model really helped.\" (003)\" [The] NHS Change Model was really around helping us understand what weneeded to do to be successful and recognise that we needed to look at our projectfrom a number of different angles to make sure (a) it would be successful, but alsothat it was a sustainable way to manage patient care in the future.\" (014)\" Beyond its application to specific projects, severalparticipants also described how they wereseeking to use the NHS Change Model to informtheir thinking in a more thoroughgoing way. Itwas seen as something that could informongoing efforts in an NHS that was facingchanges on multiple fronts, to ensure that thesewere addressed as effectively as possible\u2014and ina way that remained faithful to its core purpose.We have structured the papers usingthe NHS Change Model, so trying toembed it in the way we work, we'vesort of used it as almost like a template,but we've made sure that the way inwhich we present things to theprogramme board is really within thatNHS Change Model.\" (007)\"From shared purpose to joint action: telling the story and capturing the learning from the NHS Change Model 27Things like the risk register, for example, so we have an extra column on the risk register to say, 'What is the impact of this risk against the shared purpose?' [...]So [to] hold a mirror up to the organisation and say, 'What's going on here then,and how do we feel we fit into this alignment grid?' And I guess that would be alonger term things around, 'OK, so what would we look to improve goingforward?'\" (008)\" Participants felt that the NHS Change Model was something that could help to facilitate the kind of culturalchange that was ultimately seen as crucial in underpinning and sustaining specific changes in the way theNHS does its business needed to secure the future of the service. The NHS Change Model role is really a framework for me to think about how Icould get that change in culture embedded. So making sure I do think about howI engage people with this. How do I spread it? How do I measure the effectivenessof it, because one of the bonus points of that is not just driving up the care butdriving up morale which also drives up patient experience because cared-fornurses are able to be more compassionate [than] others.\" (001)\" In a nutshell I want to change the culture of the current service offer in thecommunity setting, and therefore change the service offer to meet the populationneed, rather than the individual organisation's needs.\" (020)\"From shared purpose to joint action: telling the story and capturing the learning from the NHS Change Model 28Participants' use of the NHS Change Model to help them face daunting challenges was encouraging, and there was a sense across interviews that they saw in the NHS Change Model the potential to facilitatelasting change. It may not include much of great novelty, but it did bring things together in a way thatcould make change efforts more comprehensive, more sensitive, more impactful, in a way that evidencesuggests is likely to be important. 3At times, there was a sense from some participants that these were outcomes that would be achieved through adoption of the NHS Change Model in itself: that effectivechange would follow in a relatively straightforward manner from use of the NHS Change Model, fidelity toits eight components, and application of the tools included. This was the risk, as participant 010 put it, that\"the nuance and the complexity of theory in these conceptual frameworks tends to get reduced tomeaningless simplicity,\" or in participant 013's words, that \"people make the Model more important thanthe work they are trying to do.\" Undoubtedly, experienced change leaders in the NHS would not be sona\u00efve as to suppose that a framework, tool or model in itself represents anything more than the first stepon a long path to change, but just occasionally, the sense was that change would be a direct and logicalconsequence of applying the NHS Change Model. In marketing the NHS Change Model to practitioners, itwill be important to stress that while it may offer a promising recipe, it is the hard work and skill of thechefs that determine the quality of the pudding. It may even be that the title of the recipe itself needschanging. As we discuss in more detail shortly, many accounts suggested that the NHS Change Model wasbest understood as a framework that was useful in problem definition and directing attention towards theareas to be considered in solution formulation, rather than a model of change as more formallyunderstood. 5.2 Mediating the Model Interesting evidence of how participants used the model in practice emerged from our interviews. Its valueseemed to lie in informing and guiding background thinking and structuring of activity, rather than takingthe foreground as an explicit model of change held in common by all concerned parties. The normalpattern among interviewees was to use the NHS Change Model either as individuals or in a small team,such as a steering group, rather than presenting it to all stakeholders as a framework or model for thechange task in hand. Typically, participants described a process whereby they used the Model to identify thedimensions of change that they needed to address and to form an idea about how to address them, andthen sought to delegate particular tasks to other individuals in appropriate roles and positions. They wouldperhaps point these individuals in the direction of resources that could be of assistance, but rarely soughtexplicitly to introduce them to the NHS Change Model itself.From shared purpose to joint action: telling the story and capturing the learning from the NHS Change Model 29What people use it for more is a reminder, so I'm leading, say I'm one of the programme managers, they're thinking, 'Well I'm working on the urology project,these are the elements, have I considered all these elements at the outset, did Ihelp the clinical lead of this programme think through who their leads were in theorganisations they were going to link with, and what it is we're trying to do andhow we might make a difference?' [...] Whether it's a project manager or aprogramme manager, they're really key in helping clinicians to think through someof these elements, without saying, 'And here's a framework you must follow',because that would turn them off. Having a conversation about, 'Well have youthought about who the leads might be that you need, we could work with andhave we got a primary care lead and acute lead, is that the type of leadershiparrangement we need?' It's a trigger of the manager to work the clinician forchange and collaboration.\" (021)\" Participants gave a number of reasons for taking this approach. Firstly, they felt that the notion of the NHSChange Model, and the language and tools it contained, risked alienating some stakeholder groups,especially clinicians. They therefore undertook an active process of mediation where they sought to'translate' the domains of the NHS Change Model into language that they saw as being more 'clinician-friendly', making sure in the process that they did not overwhelm such groups by presenting the entireModel to them wholesale. To be honest we have not really got to the point of presenting the NHS ChangeModel to them in that format but more about sharing tools or sharing ways ofworking. I have not put the clinical leads in front of it and said this is the NHSChange Model and this is what you need to do because I don't think that wouldnecessarily be a valuable exercise or necessarily help because of the sort ofpotential for management speak versus clinical speak and what does this actuallymean we have to do.\" (002)\"From shared purpose to joint action: telling the story and capturing the learning from the NHS Change Model 30Accordingly, participants tended to describe how they used the NHS Change Model to frame dialogue with others, ensuring appropriate inputs from various stakeholder groups, but with management of andresponsibility for change remaining with the same core group. They might use the NHS Change Modelmore or less explicitly in facilitating these discussions, but they were clear that they did not adhere to itclosely, raise all aspects, or use its language with all stakeholder groups. The aesthetics of the NHS ChangeModel were important here: its potential to be alienating rather than engaging was evident to participants,and they saw themselves as mediating between different cultures. We don't, we talked almost about the components actually and our sharedpurpose and improvement methodology, but even watering those terms downslightly because frontline clinicians you know, with all the best intentions probablydon't understand, or some have trouble in understanding what a system driver is,or what engagement to mobilise means. So we help to translate that to peopleand then we listen to what they have to say and then use that information to helpbuild our plans or our structures or our processes around that.\" (009)\" I have seen it used by other people very mechanistically starting at the top andworking round; that is not the way we use it. We work with the team who havegot an issue. [...] And we wouldn't say to them, 'We are going to use the NHSChange Model', in the same way we wouldn't say to them, 'We are going tobring some transactional analysis model into this piece'. We wouldn't tell themthat, but we would have it with us and at an appropriate point now when theywere trying to think about the change process, we would again get it out and say,'Do you think this would help, shall we spend half an hour going round?' and weusually ask the question, 'Which bit interests you?'. [...] [What] change leadersneed to do is they have to be able to translate. If somebody reacts to anyparticular element of that Model, we wouldn't slavishly stick to the use of thelanguage, we would say to them, 'Well how would you describe that?' and thenwe would in that session and in our work with them we would, you know wemight even scribble out on the Model and put their words in there.\" (013)\"From shared purpose to joint action: telling the story and capturing the learning from the NHS Change Model 31Second, participants often saw effective application of the NHS Change Model as resting on mobilising the specialist skills of different groups of colleagues. In engaging with those with expertise in measurement, forexample, participants did not feel the need to refer to the entire NHS Change Model, but instead engagedwith them on the specifics of the measurement challenge, having used the NHS Change Model to frametheir own thinking about how this linked to the other components. We've been dealing with the NHS Change Model in two parts. In terms of ourinternal commissioning team it's been quite useful just to help people understandwhat they need to consider and how are tools that we started to develop actuallyfit within the model has been useful. [...] We haven't been using it in theworkshops or the clinicians, because what we thought that it may turn them off alittle bit, if you see what I mean. [...] I think there's probably subdivisions in howmuch you actually get the clinicians to understand it.\" (019)\" Third, and connectedly, this approach reflected anunderstanding of the NHS Change Model less as a'model' per se\u2014a highly specified methodologywith a clear protocol that needed to be followedexactingly\u2014and more as a guiding framework tosensitise and inform. Several participants explicitlystated that they saw the Model not as a model atall, but as a framework or guide. This was mirroredin the way that many participants described theirpersonal use of the Model in practice: as a heuristicset of reminders, prompts and checks that couldensure that they were undertaking change in a waythat was as likely as possible to achieve the desiredends:Rather than a model I would describeit as more of a framework on whichthere are change tools that you canuse, depending on I suppose thecircumstance and the organisationalstructure as well.\" (017)\" I call it a framework actually. That seems to go down well, that it is a framework.It's a reminder that if you're going to move forward in an initiative there areelements that you have to work on as a whole to achieve your ambition and thatyou have to work at the shared purpose. [...] I would recommend it as aframework to ensure that at the outset of delivering across organisational changeprogramme, you had refreshed and reminded yourself that you'd considered allcomponents.\" (021)\"From shared purpose to joint action: telling the story and capturing the learning from the NHS Change Model 32The NHS Change Model is a framework into which you can put your own different models or your own way of thinking, and it's a way to think about them, so itseemed quite a broad church and open way of thinking about it. So it was aninclusive thing, so you weren't trying to force something different onto people,but you were going, 'Look, this framework might just help you think about it andbreak down a situation or an issue into a number of elements as to how you'readdressing it'.\" (005)\" I don't go methodically through and think I have got to have an action task foreach one, but I just probably scan it and remind myself what I think is important inthis or where the potential issues are, and certainly with CQUINs I think it's gettingengaging and mobilising. A lot of them have to be delivered by clinical staff, theones I am involved in at the moment and it's getting the message across. [...] It'sjust been helping me with my thought processes, rather than sitting down with apencil and paper and going I have now got 15 minutes to write a plan.\" (005)\" In many ways this might be considered encouraging. The NHS Change Model was being used by some atleast to sensitise, to broaden thinking, to inform. The risk that the NHS Change Model might be conceivedof as a solution in itself, whose effectiveness lay simply in its application\u2014rather than as a set ofconsiderations, tools and ideas that could assist change leaders\u2014was recognised. However, such relativelyindividualised use of the NHS Change Model also meant that knowledge of the approach remained highlyconcentrated, and thus easily lost as individuals change roles and organisations. It also placed a heavyburden on the skills and efforts of the small teams applying the NHS Change Model. Use of the Model asa heuristic could result in an application that was not quite faithful to its theory of change, especially if byan individual rather than a multidisciplinary team. A key part of the NHS Change Model's programmetheory is that it involves use of all of the components in a way that attends to their alignment andpolarities\u2014and, as we discuss next, the extent to which this aspect of the theory was being adhered to inpractice seemed to vary.From shared purpose to joint action: telling the story and capturing the learning from the NHS Change Model 335.3 Applying the full NHS Change Model and attending to alignments Participants differed in the extent to which they said they were seeking to use all aspects of the NHS Change Model. Some were able to talk at considerable length about how they had used each component,how one component fed into another, and how they had managed the tensions between them. At that moment in time for the programme, those components were mostsignificant but [colleague] has also fed back that it has been a great opportunity tolook holistically as well, whereas she might have focused on two or three of thoseaspects and been quite myopic about it. But actually stepping back and looking atall eight components and [she] did a really good stop check to make sure she wason track with all of those eight components. [...] I think that as you look at theModel, they look discrete, they look like eight components with very clearboundaries between them and that is the way the Model is drawn and the imagethat you look at. Actually what I am finding in application is that the interface andboundaries between those components are very blurred, and that is not to diluteany of the components, it is just the relationship between them.\" (016)\" I've had a look and with the transparent measure, for example, we are starting tolook at different things within that, but we've only just started looking at that, so Iprobably wouldn't be able to give you that much information but it's one areawe're starting to look at. The system drivers, we've looked at that. [...] And we'vesaid about engagement. Then spread of innovation, we're starting to go toconferences in different areas to discuss what we're doing and how we're doing itand why we're doing it. Leadership for change, we've started going on courses toenable us to look at ways that we bring in change, so there's two that I'm bookedon anyway at the moment and how you lead staff through change and what thatmeans and how you do it, et cetera. So there's that. And then the rigorousdelivery we're starting to look at a little bit as well. So again it's not down indefinite way of talking about it, but it's definitely something we're starting to lookat and how we deliver that service, how we're going to, the underlying systemsand pathways that are going to be behind these teams and how we're going todeliver the care that we're talking about.\" (026)\"From shared purpose to joint action: telling the story and capturing the learning from the NHS Change Model 34More often, participants acknowledged the importance of addressing all eight of the NHS Change Model's components, but reported that to date they had only used a small proportion of them because of the stagethey were currently at in the change process. At the defined stage we wouldn't necessarily be talking about the spread ofinnovation. So we'd just use the components of the NHS Change Model or ourtools in the components within the NHS Change Model at the most appropriatestage in the process. So for the spread of innovation we probably wouldn't betalking about until the innovation stage, which is further down the process,because our first stage is all about defining the problem, so it would use the othercomponents. And then the measure would obviously be collecting data aboutwhat's going on so you may use another part of the NHS Change Model.\" (019)\" I think that particularly significant has been the our shared purpose componentbecause I think it is something, and it was coming out of the review that wecompleted in [this area] as well, as much as we might like to think that we spendsufficient time and appropriate time reaching a consensus or at least a nearconsensus to what we are trying to achieve across multiple organisations orstakeholder groups, in fact the reality is that I don't think we often do spendenough time on that, and really cement that.\" (016)\"What was clear was that for most, the central component of 'shared purpose' was very useful as anunderpinning principle of the NHS Change Model\u2014both in providing an anchor for the rest of their work,and in helping them to engage and mobilise other parties, as discussed above. 'Shared purpose' was seenby participants as both a starting point and a theme to which they returned frequently as they progressedtheir change efforts.From shared purpose to joint action: telling the story and capturing the learning from the NHS Change Model 35Some participants, however, were unsure as to whether they would ultimately be able to make sense of and use all of the components of the NHS Change Model. They had found value in some aspects, andcould see the importance of a balanced approach to change in theory, but in practice could not always seethe applicability of others to the particular challenge they were facing. I am struggling slightly with it. It all makes absolute sense and I think the conceptof the different areas that all need to be addressed as part of a change isabsolutely bang on, but in terms of the support tools within each area, it may justbe that they seem like common sense and are the things that I would use anyway,but it is very difficult to navigate. [...] We have an awareness that we need toconcentrate on all of them, but I imagine that at the moment we are probablyconcentrating more on leadership for change and engagement to mobilise and Ithink some of them come at different stages in delivering change. It is very difficultto say. To be honest I have not really looked through the improvementmethodology or got my head around the improvement methodology.\" (002)\" In practice, participants often therefore described a process whereby they used the NHS Change Model tohelp them to identify particular areas of concern, but did not necessarily embrace all its components. Somecomponents were simply seen as more important, immediate and pressing than others, given the nature ofthe problem and the stage at which they found themselves in addressing it: My focus would not be on all parts of the NHS Change Model because you knowas well as I do, organisations tend to have specific problems and specific issuesand they will tend to focus on those so, for example again, the issue might bearound engagement, 'My organisation is not working effectively because we arenot engaging well enough', so I will want to focus probably on the engagementto mobilise aspect of the NHS Change Model\u2014but not to say I would want to losethe rest of it, but I would certainly want to focus on that. As I say, I would want aNHS Change Model that would allow me to do that and to just maybe focus onthat particular issue.\" (011)\"From shared purpose to joint action: telling the story and capturing the learning from the NHS Change Model 36Similarly, there were mixed views on the extent to which the NHS Change Model was useful in facing and overcoming tensions between aspects of change, through an active process of alignment. Participantshighlighted some clear confluences between domains of the NHS Change Model in interviews, and alsotalked in more general terms about potential tensions to manage, particularly between intrinsic andextrinsic motivators and 'softer' and 'harder' components of the Model. If you take improvement methodology and rigorous delivery, well they practicallygo hand in hand, if you have got a good improvement methodology underpinningwhat you are doing, then you are feeding your rigorous delivery. If you have got agood improvement methodology, you will be undertaking appropriate andtransparent measurement and that will again give you a rigorous delivery so thesethings are self-reinforcing. [...] I think that in terms of intrinsic and extrinsicmotivators and how that plays out, I think we see how some of the things aroundthe 'our shared purpose' sits very much in the intrinsic, values orientated, driver ofchange and that feeds naturally into the engagement to mobilise, the leadershipfor change where they are very interpersonal skills and very personal skills as well.They really touch us as human beings. I tend to think of the extrinsic factors as themore structural aspects of the model so thinking about the rigorous delivery,thinking about some of the measurement side of things that to me are quitestructural. They are objective. They are the nuts and bolts of what makes this workbut they won't work on their own.\" (016)\" I may have [aligned the elements of the NHS Change Model] without realising it. Itwould be interesting to go and read through my notes to see if I can identify that Ihave done it in other ways. I possibly have.\" (001)\"However, in terms of addressing specific areas of potential dissonance between aspects of change, someparticipants found that although the NHS Change Model alerted them to these, it could not offer specific,actionable ways of dealing with them:From shared purpose to joint action: telling the story and capturing the learning from the NHS Change Model 37Interviewer: \"How far has the model been useful in helpful in helping you to make sure that the different aspects of your work are aligned witheach other and are complementary to each other?\" 002: \"I have not used it at all in that way yet.\" Interviewer: \"Is that something you are aware of? Because sometimes engagement to mobilise could be seen as conflicting to transparent measurement but actually but trying to work it so that they are both working towards a common outcome.\" 002: \"No, I had not seen it like that. I know it is all about this shared purpose and so in theory all of those things add up to a shared purpose. I think I have struggled to see how you make every single one of those add up to your shared purpose.\" Participants tended to find on the whole that the NHS Change Model was effective as a prompt toconsider the full complement of considerations that needed to be addressed if change was to be achieved.But it did not in itself provide a means of translating these into a coherent, well aligned programme ofaction. Again, this is encouraging in that it suggests that the NHS Change Model is being applied in thespirit in which it was designed, rather than being seen as a 'magic wand' to be waved at a problem thatwill lead in a straightforward manner to the anticipated outcomes. On the other hand, some participantsfound it much more challenging than others to move from a set of principles to a programme of actionthat fully addresses those principles. Because the NHS Change Model provides a framework and an approach rather than a fully formulated set of solutions, much rests on the capacity and judgement of leaders of change in making it successful. Thismeans that it presents a flexible tool, open to the kinds of applications that are likely to make it work, butit also means that those aspects that are meant to be adhered to at all times\u2014such as use of all eightcomponents and active consideration of their alignment\u2014may be neglected, especially if they are seen astoo challenging or not relevant. While adherence to 'shared purpose' seemed an intuitively useful aspect ofthe NHS Change Model that many participants could account for in their work in practice, alignment anduse of all components seemed more problematic.From shared purpose to joint action: telling the story and capturing the learning from the NHS Change Model 385.4 Challenges of using the NHS Change Model in practice Correspondingly, some of the biggest challenges identified by participants related to specific parts of the NHS Change Model. Four components of the Model in particular were picked out as being especiallydifficult to turn into practice. One related to the 'softer' side of change ('Engagement to mobilise'); theother three were harder drivers ('System drivers', 'Spread of innovation', and 'Transparentmeasurement'). Interestingly, of 'Engagement to mobilise' and 'Transparent measurement', a key challenge highlighted by participants was the way in which both of these tasks could throw into sharp relief thetensions of shared purpose. Both could reveal differences of opinion among different stakeholder groupsabout the essence of shared purpose, and how change that remained faithful to that purpose might bevalued and measured: I suppose the one bit that worries me slightly is where it says transparentmeasurement. Because anything that talks about measurement is going to getcomplicated and it is going to get difficult and is going to get contentious becauseagain, we have got lots and lots of NHS Change Models but we have also got lotsand lots of different measurements as well within the NHS. So I think anythingalong those lines is going to be difficult and contentious.\" (011)\" When you are talking about something that is about patient experience and valuebased, it is sometimes hard to talk about what are we going to measure, whatdoes good look like. [For example] the Six Cs to measure patient experience\u2014because if it is good feedback, what made it good so that we can start to thinkabout transparent measurements because then we can start sharing that witheach other.\" (001)\" I think probably it's just yet another thing the NHS want us to try and implement,and for what purpose, and who gets what out of this by having this framework,who gets the glory if you like. I think there is always some element of suspicionwhen something comes from a national directive.\" (023)\"From shared purpose to joint action: telling the story and capturing the learning from the NHS Change Model 39I think that audiences are more used to stakeholder management or stakeholder engagement rather than engagement to mobilise but engagement to mobilise isvery particular in that it is not just trying to engage people but it is engagingpeople to take action and it is about that proactiveness and that action orientatednature of it so that again takes some interpretation.\" (016)\" It's been hard to think about how we're going to measure things.\" (007)\"More generally, finding a way of measuring change transparently and effectively was something thatseveral participants accepted would be a challenge, since it was an aspect of change with which they wereless familiar: Similarly, 'Spread of innovation' represented for several participants a fresh challenge which many of them felt relatively poorly equipped to address. It was also one which many participants, in the relatively earlyphases of their work, felt premature to consider in much detail, or which had been pushed down the listof priorities by more pressing concerns: The other thing is around spread of innovation. Because one of the things that weare quite keen to do is to capture lessons learnt as we go along, because it's quitedifficult to remember what went wrong, because you have just got over that, butclearly important maybe if we want to expand this model say to children, or to themental health side, and so actually really being rigorous around capturing thoselessons learnt. [...] I keep having to remind myself that actually, it is as much aboutother people learning from our learning and where we are at as about what theycan bring to the stage we are at. And I suppose traditionally when you think ofsharing your work you think it's got to be 100% really good, fantastic before youshow anyone, when really this model says, 'Actually let's learn together as we goforward'.\" (014)\" Obviously spreading innovation because we haven't actually got to that point yet,so I think there are some bits of it that we would pick up as time goes on as westart to look at the project and move it forward.\" (023)\"From shared purpose to joint action: telling the story and capturing the learning from the NHS Change Model 40Participants identified what they saw as more fundamental problems with 'System drivers'. While in some cases, a great deal of work had been done to align change efforts with the priorities, strategic objectivesand incentives that existed in the system, several participants struggled to make such connections. Nationalpriorities were seen as too fixed to be readily aligned with some of the change efforts being undertaken,while local levers were not always easily accessible, or sufficiently powerful to orient organisations andindividuals towards the change desired: The system drivers one we find more challenging. I don't know, maybe becauseit's harder to influence and get very much\u2014you can do it within your own teamperhaps, but particularly when we start thinking about some of those systemdrivers potentially being technology driven, it's very hard to kind of influence thatreally, because it's so vast.\" (006)\" I think some of the systems drivers around the contract leaders and how we usethe systems levers to bring about change, I think have been a bit clunky for me. Injust trying to\u2014like contract levers like CQUIN. So CQUIN is payment for qualityand I'm not sure that we've been able to match what we are trying to do withsome of those contract incentives. And I think that's not helped me as much as Iwould have hoped it would.\" (020)\" There are some areas of this where the context I am working in is either non-existent or needs to be grown in some way. [...] There are people trying to growthose levers but the system drivers aren't there in terms of ones that I have nocontrol over, so I guess for something like that it is difficult to use if there isn't acontext to work within.\" (012)\" The things like with the system drivers, you know, we'd put things into place but Ithink it's difficult for us because, at the end of the day, we're only the clinicalleads, so we don't have that much clout, I suppose, in the realistically looking atthings that, you know, incentives that you can offer.\" (026)\"From shared purpose to joint action: telling the story and capturing the learning from the NHS Change Model 41While recognising the need to be cognisant of system drivers, participants found that the range of actions at their disposal to influence these, or even to align their own work with existing drivers, was limited.A related major challenge identified by several participants in using the NHS Change Model in practice wasthe organisational environment of the NHS. A hierarchical culture in general, and the specific financial andorganisational challenges facing the service at the current time, resulted in difficulty in using the NHSChange Model faithfully to its full potential. While the major challenges facing the NHS meant for manyparticipants that it was needed now more than ever, the urgency of resolving these challenges\u2014and theingrained way of dealing with change within the NHS\u2014meant that now was probably also the hardesttime to put it into practice, too: Often there's a lot of pressure to get work done immediately or quickly, andsometimes that's in direct conflict with doing things the right way.\" (009)\" [Colleagues] might be willing to express leadership, motivated to change andunderstand the values, but they would hit a brick wall because of some of thepractitioners around them and it was almost them saying to us, 'What are yougoing to do to help us? We are about to go out into this world and we know it isslightly dysfunctional in places but it is going to be tough'. So we have got tothink about that.\" (010)\" The health service at the moment, when people are losing jobs and the sicknesslevel is so high and the demand for services is so high and there's so muchchange, it's not always the best [environment] to introduce these things becausepeople just feel, they're too busy. [...] Quite often, people look for quick answerswithin a model and they're not going to be there. As I say, you need to take thisModel and work with it, facilitate, when you say the word facilitation, it means tomake easy and I think that needs to be spelled out, that the NHS Change Model isa facilitation tool which is designed to make the change easier. And I think peoplemight be looking at the NHS Change Model and saying, 'Come on then, give mesome answers really, really quick so I can then move on and get onto somethingelse', and that's not going to be the approach.\" (003)\"From shared purpose to joint action: telling the story and capturing the learning from the NHS Change Model 42A particular challenge that resulted from such a context was keeping the extrinsic and intrinsic elements of the NHS Change Model in balance. As one participant vividly described, when the extrinsic motivators wereso forceful and weighed so heavily on colleagues' minds, finding a space for mobilising for change throughintrinsic motivators could prove difficult: The tension comes when we look at the system drivers when we look at thecontracts that we're involved in. So you know things like we'll serve notice on thecontract. Or if you don't up your game you'll be in the private sector and [anoutside company] will take over. And I've had to protect the engagement bit fromthat. [...] So the last thing I want is them to be thinking they've got this big axehanging over them that unless they change the axe will change and the contractwill go out for tender. Because that's distracting. [...] I wouldn't want the systemdrivers to be involved in the engagement process, I've kept that away from it.\" (020)\" One of the big things that us and a lot of people face is when times get tough, it'slike, 'Show me the money', and that's the biggest challenge to a lot ofimprovement activity like ours, because we know that we are saving time, butthen, you could say, 'Oh well we've saved this much time and these people arepaid this much an hour, so that equates to that, if we rolled it out across all teamsit would be that'. But of course you then say, 'But what are you going to do withthe time that you've saved? Are you going to reduce staffing levels or are yougoing to increase workload?' and those kind of things are harder to deal with.\" (006)\" As one participant (018) put it, \"introducing a NHS Change Model is a change in itself which requiresthought and time and resources. How do you change to having a NHS Change Model?\" We consider inthe next section some of the prospects for creating a more receptive organisational environment in whicha sincere utilisation of the NHS Change Model might be possible. The complex organisational environment also gave rise to significant challenges of how to lead concerted, co-ordinated action using the NHS Change Model. As noted above, in the main participants sought to usethe Model as an explicit framework for co-ordinating change only with, at most, a small team; with widerstakeholders, they preferred to simplify the Model's language, and to speak only to those specificelements of the Model that affected each audience. Nevertheless, they recognised the importance ofsecuring the engagement of wider groups if change was to be achieved, and spoke of the difficulties ofdoing this in an NHS which remained dominated by organisational, sectoral and professional boundaries:From shared purpose to joint action: telling the story and capturing the learning from the NHS Change Model 43If you are in a cancer registry looking at HES data for Public Health England on transparent measurement, you are in a different world to somebody who islooking at whether an acute trust has got their financial balance right for theMonitor review. There are some things we are just going to have to be realisticabout but I think we can do a little better than we have done to align thesedifferent levels of leadership at different points of leadership and differentresponsibilities for leadership. \" (012)\" We've got clinicians leading change, so for instance I talked about our clinical leadon urgent care. She would understand it because she knows she's got to drivethe change. However if we're talking to a frontline clinician or whatever, they'renot really interested if you see what I mean? They're just thinking about how tomake improvements to the patient pathway, delivering better quality of clinical care etc. Rather than thinking about, have I thought about the spread of innovation?\" (019)\" Moreover, this preferred way of using the NHS Change Model, with only a small team actively using it toframe activity and to ensure thoroughness and balance of approaches to change, brought with it particularchallenges of co-ordination that weighed heavily on those teams: We didn't necessarily have named leads in all the statutory organisations, so theorganisation as a whole was going to contribute to delivery of a particularprogramme, but we didn't have a specific lead that was going to take that leadrole that we could engage with. And I think the biggest lesson has been a beliefthat change will not happen without programme facilitation, if you arecollaborating across organisational boundaries, it won't just happen on its own,you have to have some sort of programme facilitation behind the scenes. Soyou've got management and clinical leadership hand in hand.\" (019)\"From shared purpose to joint action: telling the story and capturing the learning from the NHS Change Model 44I think in the way that I described earlier which is that whole system co-ordination so we need to have the Director of Nursing talking the same language as theOrganisational Development Manager et cetera et cetera. It is as simple and ascomplicated as that really.\" (011)\" In adhering to a relatively concentrated approach to putting the NHS Change Model into practice,participants thus had to work hard to ensure that particular tasks were delegated to the right stakeholdersbeyond their core group, and also to ensure that these dispersed efforts were all contributing to thecommon goal and aligned with the NHS Change Model. Such an approach mitigated the risks ofmisplaced effort and unco-ordinated change that a more distributed way of using the NHS Change Modelmight have brought, but did mean a heavy burden for those core teams\u2014and attendant vulnerabilities inthe potential greater impact of personnel changes or reorganisation. 5.5 Overcoming the challenges through the strengths of the Change Model Participants were, on the whole, not overly concerned about the challenges of using the NHS ChangeModel itself. Indeed, some of the difficulties they identified were not as much problems with the Model, aschallenges of change that the Model had highlighted for them. Consequently, they welcomed the way inwhich the NHS Change Model drew their attention to the full range of areas of work needed to maximisethe chance of success, broadening their thinking. In this way it acted, as described above, as a heuristic thathelped them to ensure that they were proceeding on all necessary fronts rather than becoming 'tunnel-visioned' and focusing only on the easier areas of change, or the aspects of change that they already knewwell, to the neglect of more challenging components such as 'Transparent measurement'. The good point is the information that's there, it covers quite a bit and I dorecognise that it's an early model so, you know, changes will be done to itaccording to the results of it. But sometimes that can be its downfall as wellbecause it's sifting through all that information, isn't it, and trying to put it into anorder that you can use, because the problem is it's good that you can movearound the circle and you can jump in and out of bits as and when you needthem, as things come up and as things occur. But sometimes it's going back andthinking well where does this fit in, where does that. But I think that's just thenature of anything.\" (026)\"From shared purpose to joint action: telling the story and capturing the learning from the NHS Change Model 45Part of it is about getting as many people as possible to think about everything at the same time and part of it is about having different people thinking aboutdifferent things at the same time. Within the project group and underneath oursteering group, we have a finance and performance group so they will focus onthe transparent measurement. We have a communication and engagement groupso obviously they will think about engagement to mobilise. We have clinicalgroups that will think more about the spread of innovation and delivery so we dohave a number of different groups that think about each of these things.\" (002)\" Participants also suggested a number of ways in which the presentation and content of the NHS ChangeModel itself might be improved. These included: \u0081Materials that might be used to introduce the NHS Change Model, and individual elements of the NHS Change Model, to colleagues: \"I think there just needs to be some preamble to it to say look, here's a model, it's designed to help you ensure that each of the areas of your change project isgiven sufficient [for use with] yourself or within the project team.\" (003) \u0081In-depth examples of successful use of the NHS Change Model in co-ordinating a change project, and how this was done. There was a sense from some that although they had benefitted from the programme of support (webinars etc.) that had been provided by the Institute, this had remained largely 'theoretical', and the case studies to date had not been offered in sufficient detail to provide clear learning. \"We need some more examples of where it's being used and how are people using it really, because I think the danger is it feels quite theory based still. Andif I had one kind of 'Oh I wish this had gone better', it would be that the seminars were really useful and I think they were really valuable. [But] I think it'sbeen hard to get beneath the surface of those.\" (008) \u0081More support on the practicalities of generating alignments between components of the NHS Change Model. Some found the existing 'alignment grid' very helpful, but others suggested that examination of the specific potential tensions between components would help to concretise challenges and solutions. \"The only thing to say is provide some more information about the alignment of the process and almost the softer skill element to it. Such as how we can actually produce a plan or a particular set of processes that use all of the components.\" (009)From shared purpose to joint action: telling the story and capturing the learning from the NHS Change Model 46\u0081There was a sense from some that the simplicity and visual appeal of the NHS Change Model was quickly lost once users 'dug below the surface': for example, on the website, the clean and minimalist depiction of the Model was not matched by the way individual components were presented, with much text and links to other sources. \"As you go deeper into the model, it sort of loses it a little bit and I wonder whether that could be maintained a little bit more. [It becomes too] wordy, technical, academic.\" (011) \"Possibly by putting in bullet points of the summaries of the different sections so like the key elements of each of the sections. I think it just feels like there's a lot of text to read and sift through and I know you need to do that to get a real idea of how the whole thing gels together, but perhaps having bullet points of what are the pertinent points of each section might be helpful.\" (025) More broadly, the key challenge participants identified for the NHS Change Model was in making the transition from the 'next big thing' into an established way of approaching change in the NHS: a commonframework that would overcome scepticism and provide a common language across groups for leadingchange. Here, participants saw the adoption of the Model by NHS England as a promising step. However,as we discuss below, there are also potential risks in this approach. Overcoming the challenges they identified in the organisational environment in which the NHS Change Model was being put to work was something that, as might be expected, participants were less optimisticabout. As noted above, participants saw the current volatile NHS organisational context as one that neededa coherent NHS Change Model more than ever\u2014but one in which introducing it would be as hard as ever,if not more so. Faithful application of the NHS Change Model required an environment that renouncedmanagerialist 'quick fixes' and offered the time and space to use the NHS Change Model fully and sincerely.While few participants saw any prospect of this at the level of the whole NHS system in the near future,they did identify an important role for senior managers and clinicians within NHS organisations inmediating the pressures from the outside, modelling a commitment-oriented approach to change, andcreating time and space for sincere application of the NHS Change Model in a way that ensures thatchange is in accordance with shared purpose and the underlying mission of the NHS:From shared purpose to joint action: telling the story and capturing the learning from the NHS Change Model 47It's talking about people working together across boundaries and that bigger picture thinking and I think perhaps that's a bit daunting and I understand that, itis daunting. I think because it takes a lot of time to operate in that manner andit's a lot simpler to crack down with authority sometimes. [...] It's a challengingmessage, isn't it? Because we know when we manage change at the moment wedon't do it very well and we know that because we don't get the return that weexpect to. We don't get the outcome we expect to and we don't change theorganisation in the way that we're supposed to change it. So we know that whatwe're doing doesn't work, but yet the alternative which sounds right just lookslike it's going to take much more effort and time and organisation, and do wehave the money to do those kinds of thing when the decision making aroundwhat projects are we going to do usually takes place still without this kind ofethos behind it. So there's a challenge there about if someone was, if anorganisation was to adopt the NHS Change Model, at least the NHS ChangeModel way of approaching change, it would need to have this support from thevery top of the shop in order for people to legitimately operate in that mannerunderneath it.\" (008)\" Well I think that it's actually buy-in from the leadership. It's all very well individualswithin an organisation understanding it, but actually it has to become a cultural\u2014you talk about intrinsic change as well, intrinsically the organisations need to buyinto this way of working, otherwise it actually won't have the benefits, the fullbenefits that people are trying to deliver. So it's all very well middle managers orlower managers using it but then if the chair and chief exec, directors et ceteradon't get it, then it probably won't really deliver what it's supposed to.\" (017)\" [Managers need to give] permission to see that actually it's not just OK, it'snormal, it's proper to have all of these things which are not counterproductive,but that pull in different directions and the aim is to sort of work out which youneed when and for what and that it's OK to have them at the same time and tohave them self-reinforcing.\" (014)\"From shared purpose to joint action: telling the story and capturing the learning from the NHS Change Model 48This would, participants argued, imply a major shift in the approach to managing change and dealing with the challenges faced by the NHS on the part of many senior managers in the service: I think for people who are facilitating that and senior leadership in organisations,it's cracking open a conversation that actually a lot of organisations in myexperience would prefer to keep a lid on. Because a lot of organisations want topretend to be the staff that the world is fine, challenging but fine. I work withorganisations who don't encourage their staff to challenge policy decisions. [...]The top of the NHS probably believes it's doing the right thing but turns a blindeye to the operational realities of delivering things, kids the public that everythingcan be done. Everything can't be done; we need a national debate on what theNHS should provide.\" (013)\" We have had quite a few different people inputting into us and at one point thatwas getting traumatic because different people were asking us to do differentthings and that has stopped now or virtually, so we have now got a more definedstructure so whether other people are finding they are getting lots of input fromother areas. Do you see what I am saying? Just different agendas, so differentpeople from different areas of work. So for example, my original line managersand their general managers have obviously got an interest in the project andwanted the project to take us in one direction and get certain information andthen my project manager would be saying, 'No, I don't want you to do that, Iwant you to go and get that', and then the chaos of that made it quite difficult tokeep on track. I think it has come back on track since we have the new projectmanager and we all talk about what our shared purpose is and what our ultimategoal is which is the same sort of thing as a shared purpose and we regularly talkabout that. It is always talked about whenever we communicate.\" (015)\"Yet participants did give some examples of how, on a local scale and in particular circumstances, they hadmanaged to use the NHS Change Model with senior managers to adopt an approach to change that theyfelt did adhere to the Model's core principles. This required patience, access to and commitment fromthose senior managers, and a great deal of effort in managing the tensions between the NHS ChangeModel's components and ensuring attention to each of them in seeking to lead change. In overcomingsuch challenges, participants highlighted how the NHS Change Model in general\u2014and in particular the'shared purpose' at its centre\u2014had helped them to make the right connections with both senior managersand frontline staff, and reframe the need for change in a way that was more acceptable for all:From shared purpose to joint action: telling the story and capturing the learning from the NHS Change Model 49Participants described how they had used 'shared purpose' to try to reconcile apparently entrenched differences of views among stakeholder groups. Where senior managers saw challenges in terms offinancial pressures and frontline clinicians saw them in terms of risks to jobs, 'shared purpose' could offer acommon ground on which less polarised conversations could take place, reframing discussions instead interms of how to deliver the best possible service to patients: There is system blockages and system changes that they can ultimately resolve byusing some of these improvement tools, and actually that also helps them engagewith the change process because they may think it's about job losses or changesto the way in which services are provided, but ultimately it's about improving theway in which we all work, in terms of the way we can maybe look at wherewastage happens, and where we have got systems that aren't necessarily requiredbut cause a step in a process which staff have to deal with.\" (014)\" It's a good platform for developing common understanding. [...] The extrinsicones I think are where we tend to get more resistance from the front line, butmore, more demands from senior managers, the extrinsic stuff tends to be morestandard project management approach, so that's what their natural expectationis. [...] What we're actually doing is we're working on quality, we're working onefficiency, we're working on the patient experience, and we're working on staffwellbeing. You can make measurements say anything you want to make them say,and so I think that, certainly at the, with frontline staff, we need to be able to tellthe story as well, and for people to feel some of that emotion and impact.\" (006)\"From shared purpose to joint action: telling the story and capturing the learning from the NHS Change Model 50Similarly, it could help to bridge gaps between different organisations (providers and commissioners, or different providers on a care pathway that was being reconfigured) and offer a starting point forconversations that moved beyond narrow organisational interests: Obviously there is the big bit in the middle of the NHS Change Model about ourshared purpose and we are getting there but this project is more than just thelocal changes to staff within [local NHS trust] which is the organisation I workwithin. It is actually about more inter-agency shared working as well. We have amulti-agency steering group and people are still talking at cross purposes aboutthe purpose of what we are trying to achieve and the vision and we have got atime out for that group in a couple of weeks' time so hopefully that is theopportunity to bring that together and get everybody back on the same page.\" (002)\" I suppose the shared purpose is, yes it would be used, I suppose to give you anexample on the unscheduled care side of things as well, obviously we talked aboutwhat was going on in the current stage, so everybody started to understand theproblem. Then we got the different groups to actually say, 'OK what does thefuture look like?' And the surprising thing is that everybody near enough\u2014there'slike different tables set up\u2014and surprisingly enough everybody came up with nearenough the same kind of things, if you see what I mean? So that was reallypowerful in developing not necessarily completely coherent 'This is where we'regoing' sort of thing, but it did help us actually to bring together that largely all theclinicians are after the same thing.\" (019)\" To this extent, the NHS Change Model's users saw great potential in the ethos of shared purpose to makeconversations that had previously been frustrated by polarised opinions more possible. 8Engagement for change and the possibility of consensus flowed from this initial work. Agreeing on shared purpose couldreframe problems, and bring stakeholders to the table to develop solutions that did the best job possible ofgenerating solutions that were faithful to the underlying mission of the NHS.From shared purpose to joint action: telling the story and capturing the learning from the NHS Change Model 51What was also apparent from the way in which participants described their work, however, was that this was not always the way in which the task of achieving 'shared purpose' was put to use. Given the scale ofsome of the problems faced, and the need for haste in finding solutions, invoking shared purpose wasoften done more to overcome the opposition to change of groups seen as recalcitrant than to provide ashared basis for dialogue. Thus in practice it could be a discourse that was used to reframe stakeholderresistance, 9rather than to reframe the challenge faced as a common one: A lot of organisations still talk about cost saving. [...] Actually if we forget thatthey are badged as a cost improvement programme and ask ourselves, 'Is it betterfor patients?', if the answer is yes, we can align it to the quality intent, which isone of the statements it says in the NHS Change Model, so you can actuallyachieve the same goal and get engagement with it by reframing the language thatthe trust is using. [...] Although the driver initially is about reducing thisinefficiency and this waste and saving money, it is actually better for patients. Youcan align that to what the shared purpose is and the reason we are here is tocreate and deliver a good-quality service and care for people et cetera, so you canmake that alignment.\" (001)\" There's going to be some resistance to this change and pushing harder for thechange isn't going to work. We need to take some of the resistance away. Sowithin any of the areas that we're working in, identify where some of yourresistance lies, and let's work to try and reduce that resistance and that's howwe're going to bring successful change. And I think that's how I use it.\" (003)\"From shared purpose to joint action: telling the story and capturing the learning from the NHS Change Model 52It's tortuous. People are stuck where they are, aren't they? So it's trying to get them from where they are now and where we need them to be. It's such abehavioural change that they really find it hard to grasp. So just one example, ourspecialist nurses, we're asking them to be more generic, and they're saying, 'Youcan't take away the specialism'. No, no, no we won't take away your skill, you'llstill have your specialist skills but your offer will be broader. So at the moment wecan have a specialist nurse with a caseload of 90 patients, who is not able to passstable patients back to the general team because they say they are not specialist,yet actually don't need a specialist nurse. It's a way of working that's been goingon for years. [...] Sometimes I think I've gone too far and it helped. I've said we'vegot to save millions of pounds in excess care, unless you change we're doomed!I'm not saying I would say it in exactly those words, but unless the communitysteps up to the mark and we reduce activity...\" (020)\" Such uses of the NHS Change Model and the notion of common purpose do not necessarily represent adeviation from the approach. Undoubtedly the resistance of some groups to change is founded more invested interests than in a sincere commitment to quality of patient care, 10and 'shared purpose' may constitute a useful way of seeking to understand these concerns, and reframe them in a different light.However, it is perhaps useful to distinguish this from a model in which the need for change is approachedmore democratically. It also indicates how strong an influencing factor the pressures of finance anddemand represent: in such an environment\u2014where \"unless you change, we're doomed\"\u2014one way ofusing the NHS Change Model seems more viable than the other. In this context, and given the overwhelming nature of some of these pressures, the potential adoption of the NHS Change Model by NHS England was welcomed by participants, but they were circumspect aboutthe degree to which this would augur a major shift in the approach to change. One risk, identified in ourphase one work, is that such adoption might give rise to a perceived managerialisation, bureaucratisationor top-down imposition of the NHS Change Model, and an approach to its use that was founded oncompliance rather than commitment. While care in the way NHS England seeks to incorporate the NHSChange Model into its operating framework may mitigate such risks, some cautionary reminders in ourdata show how easily such a shift can occur. One participant recounted how, in a recent reorganisation,staff had been required to reapply for their jobs\u2014and told that, because the organisation was planning toadopt the NHS Change Model as an operating principle, they would be asked to describe how they woulduse it in the shortlisting and interview process. Such stories provide another reminder of how overbearingan influence the current financial and organisational environment of the NHS can be, not just on whetherthe NHS Change Model can be used, but also on how it is used. As another participant put it:From shared purpose to joint action: telling the story and capturing the learning from the NHS Change Model 53People get excited about a model, people like me don't get excited about a model, because I have been working with models for 20 odd years, and I think thedanger is the people make the model more important than the work they aretrying to do. What I always say to people is you know if you are knitting acardigan, you might have the picture and the pattern of what you are doing, butyou don't describe to them every row that has got to be knitted, so I think there isa difference between special use of the model by a change agent, and using themodel to help to get a cohesive approach to the things they want to achieve, butthe Model shouldn't be, ticking the box on the Model, it's a means to an end, itshouldn't be the end itself: 'We have used the model, it should be a tick in thebox'. [...] I think if trusts introduce it as an initiative, if trusts say, 'This is the onlymodel we use here', if they use it as a one-dimensional checklist of what you aredoing on these things without actually having people embedded in theorganisation that understand the evidence bases, or access to people whounderstand the evidence bases, that would stop it because it won't work.\" (013)\" 5.6 Spreading the NHS Change Model There were mixed views on the current approach to spreading knowledge about the NHS Change Model.Many participants had first encountered the NHS Change Model through webinars or via social media(Twitter), though this undoubtedly is primarily a consequence of our sampling approach\u2014as well as of thefact that this had been the primary mode of introducing and spreading the Model deployed by the Institute(see section 3 above). The webinars were seen as a very valuable source of knowledge to accompany theNHS Change Model, offering 'how to' information that helped in applying the Model, though as notedabove, some participants felt that more applied examples would be of great use. One participant describedhow she had made a social occasion of the webinars with colleagues, providing cake and watchingtogether as a small team, then sharing their thoughts on the presentation and discussing the implicationsfor their own practice.From shared purpose to joint action: telling the story and capturing the learning from the NHS Change Model 54I do feel like I have come into this a bit late and everybody else is further ahead because I was not around when we signed up to this model. I was [ClinicalCommissioning Group-based] so I was trying more to capture what it was aboutand what our involvement meant so I think it would have been quite supportive orit felt quite supportive to everybody else but I felt a little out of my depth in thelast webinar.\" (002)\"Participants suggested that the language of the NHS Change Model, as well as the way it had beenmarketed and spread to date, risked creating a boundary\u2014or perhaps entrenching an existing division\u2014between those who 'bought in' to the NHS Change Model, and those who did not. As noted above,making components of the Model appealing to clinicians was seen to require a considerable translationprocess, but there was also a sense from some that the existing 'NHS Change Model community', as itmanifested on Twitter and at webinars, could be somewhat excluding rather than including: The Twitter chats started for the first couple and I don't know if it's because of themedia, you know the actual media of Twitter being very restrictive, but I have notreally found those as useful. It's felt almost like there's a bit of a clique and thereare people who join those who are from the Institute or that seem to be. There'slike a little group of people that are NHS Change Modellers and they all knoweach other and it's been, you know they all kind of reinforce each other's viewand it's been difficult to get to actually some practical, 'What have you donethough, how have you used it to make a difference?' And it's just felt like it'squite a lot of rhetoric around you know, those Twitter chats. And it's great and itdoes need the enthusiasm around it, it does need people to be enthused by it, totake those messages back to base, but you know I feel like, after a few of theseminars I was really getting it on the WebExes and then I need something moretangible though and I think that's been lacking. And so I've stopped going to theTwitter chats because I'm not sure what I was gaining there. It was just the samepeople saying, 'That's the beauty of the NHS Change Model, blah, blah, blah.' Itwas like I know that's what it is but!\" (008)\"From shared purpose to joint action: telling the story and capturing the learning from the NHS Change Model 55I'm trying to just get it on people's radar, but when I have talked to people about it a little bit, I think almost without exception they've been encouraged to knowthat there's something of value that is evidence based, and that's quite importantfor certainly the sorts of people I'm working with, that something is evidencebased. And that can be of help to them and I've referred them to the website andso on, and that's any level of people that I'm talking with.\" (004)\"In reaching other groups, a more mixed economy of spread was seen as being required. Adoption by NHSEngland\u2014and the 'establishment' of the NHS Change Model as the NHS's preferred approach to change,rather than just another 'next big thing'\u2014was seen as a crucial part of this (though as noted in the previoussection, it also contained dangers). Also suggested by some was an approach to spreading the work aboutthe NHS Change Model that took a more traditional track, alongside the 'stealthy spread' approachcurrently taken, to appeal to different audiences within the NHS:6. Discussion of Phase Two findings Our analysis provides insight into the perceptions of 'early adopters' of the NHS Change Model, their approaches to and experiences of using the Model as a means of guiding change in the nine months sinceit was first introduced, and the implications of these for further work to spread, support and develop theNHS Change Model. We find much optimism about the potential of the NHS Change Model among thoseusing it, tempered with caution and even pessimism associated with the scale of the challenges in hand andthe pressures of the institutional context. In particular, participants expressed concern about the way inwhich wider, system-level pressures could militate against a faithful realisation of the NHS Change Modelthat responds flexibly to the tasks faced, but remains true to the principles and approach that it suggests.Box 1 (page 61) provides a summary of the strengths of the NHS Change Model, areas of the Model thatneed to be further strengthened, and wider issues that have an important bearing on how appropriatelyand effectively the NHS Change Model can be used. Many participants were able to articulate a clear understanding of the purpose of the Model, and key directions about how it should be delivered, such as the need to ensure that 'shared purpose' underpins allactivity, and the need to manage tensions between components. However, in the way they were using it inpractice, participants often described approaches that deviated somewhat from these principles. Whileacknowledging the importance of alignment and of using all components, several stated that they wereconcentrating their efforts on some aspects more than others. Sometimes this seemed to have followed acareful use of the NHS Change Model to identify areas of current deficit that needed greater emphasis. Atother times, it seemed more to be a matter of 'picking' those aspects of the Model that had the mostresonance. Generally speaking, participants seemed more comfortable with the 'softer' sides of the NHSChange Model than the harder ones, and the 'Transparent measurement', 'System drivers' and 'Spread ofinnovation' some too struggled with 'Engagement tomobilise'. This perhaps reflects the profile of participants, who, as leaders of change efforts and early adopters of the Model, tended to have backgrounds in organisational development, change management, humanresources, and in some cases nursing. It highlights the importance of ensuring the right balance ofdisciplinary and skills-based inputs into change efforts\u2014something which the NHS Change Model itself alsoemphasises\u2014but it is interesting to note that for the most part, participants were using the NHS ChangeModel either on an individual basis, or in a small team. For various reasons, they tended to be reluctant touse the NHS Change Model explicitly as their basis for organising and articulating change activities withwider groups, particularly clinicians. Rather, they tended to use the NHS Change Model in a more-or-lessheuristic way, ensuring that components were all being addressed and identifying groups that needed to beengaged, and then working with stakeholders from wider professional, clinical and organisational domainson a component-by-component basis. They acted as brokers and mediators of the Model, 11translating it into clear and delimited instructions for others, but tending not to attempt to sell it to them wholesale. TheNHS Change Model was thus something that provided a useful prospective planning tool and check onactivities, broadening thinking, ensuring that all necessary routes to change were being followed, andmanaging the tensions between these routes.From shared purpose to joint action: telling the story and capturing the learning from the NHS Change Model 56From shared purpose to joint action: telling the story and capturing the learning from the NHS Change Model 57The NHS Change Model was usually not used systematically and explicitly with the wider group of stakeholders involved in change. This had potential advantages and disadvantages. It could avoiddissipation of change efforts that might result from trying to involve too large a group in strategic work,and ensure that efforts remained focused and orchestrated. 12However, it placed large demands on key individuals who had to mediate between the principles of the NHS Change Model and these wider groups,who had to ensure that efforts remained co-ordinated, and who were fundamental to the entire enterpriseand thus difficult to replace. Some participants described an iterative process whereby a small team orsteering group would periodically review progress against the eight domains of the NHS Change Model,and consider what further steps were needed under each of these, before returning to wider stakeholdersto regroup and redouble efforts. Such an approach could ensure that the Model remained central tochange efforts rather than constituting only an initial framework to guide change, and seemed a goodcompromise between the challenge of actively engaging a large group of stakeholders with conflictinglanguages and priorities on one hand, and the risk of using the Model as nothing more than an initialheuristic checklist on the other. In describing their use of the NHS Change Model, there was also occasionally a sense from some participants that they saw it as a direct, unproblematic route to improvement that needed simply to beapplied to get the right results. Some accounts downplayed or ignored the role that the interpretation, skilland tenacity of those leading change in the NHS had in using the NHS Change Model most effectively,fetishising the Model itself. Again, this emphasises the importance of communicating the limitations as wellas the potentials of the NHS Change Model, and of using it in an iterative way that harnesses the expertiseand skills of multiple stakeholders, rather than just as a one-off checklist or starting point. Participants identified a number of ways in which the NHS Change Model might be improved, but on the whole saw the major difficulties with applying it properly as deriving from the wider organisational contextrather than the content of the NHS Change Model itself. There was a degree of optimism about\u2014and afew examples of\u2014the way the NHS Change Model could be used to mediate this wider organisationalcontext, and find space to address change in a more careful, comprehensive, appropriate and sustainableway. The Model's central foundation of 'shared purpose' was seen as something that could be used to findcommon ground in previously polarised debates, and initiate dialogue around challenging and contentiousissues that had previously been characterised by entrenched positions aligned to particular interests. But inan NHS where financial pressures, levels of demand and organisational strain were so pressing, it could bedifficult to sustain a truly balanced approach to using the NHS Change Model, in which the polaritiesbetween extrinsic and intrinsic motivators were balanced and both were drawn upon in constructingchange. Rather, as several participants described, 'system drivers' could come to dominate discussionsabout change, 13so that the discourse of 'shared purpose' became more a matter of convincing recalcitrant groups that change was necessary and inevitable, rather than engaging all in a discussion about how tocraft a form of change that was true to the NHS mission. More broadly, the urgency and scale of changeneeded could mean that senior managerial patience for the measured, careful approach to change impliedby the Model was limited, and resort to hierarchical imposition of change\u2014that could provide quick fixesand avoid the complication of a more balanced approach\u2014 might be preferred.In overcoming these challenges, there was some optimism that the adoption of the NHS Change Model by NHS England might portend an NHS environment in which senior managers felt legitimised in providingspace for a sincere application of the NHS Change Model approach. However, those burning externalpressures will remain constant, and much will depend on the detail of this adoption. We see in our findingsthe way in which, quite unintentionally, adherence to the NHS Change Model could become a matter ofcompliance rather than commitment, 6and in building the Model into the NHS's operating framework, care will be needed to ensure that it is not reduced to a check-box model: in other words, that the ethos, as wellas the content, of the NHS Change Model is endorsed, valued and communicated. As one participant putit, moving to a model of change informed by the NHS Change Model is a massive change in itself. Acultural and organisational context that facilitates faithful use of the NHS Change Model will not beachieved easily or quickly, but its endorsement and adoption by NHS England and others provide animportant step in its establishment, and in making a normative mindset of the Model, rather than just a setof domains to tick off.From shared purpose to joint action: telling the story and capturing the learning from the NHS Change Model 58From shared purpose to joint action: telling the story and capturing the learning from the NHS Change Model 597. Concluding remarks For almost all participants, the NHS Change Model provided an approach that was full of promise. They had found many of its elements useful, it had broadened their perspectives as they sought to undertakechallenging change tasks, and all of them said they would recommend it as a framework to others.However, it was clear from the testimony of many of our interviewees that they faced formidablechallenges in putting it into practice and realising its potential. In an environment that, more than ever, wascharacterised by overwhelming external pressures that required rapid change, and where resorting totraditional authoritarian approaches to change was a temptation that many managers found difficult toresist, using the NHS Change Model in a way that was faithful to its intent was very difficult. In ourinterviews we see some examples of how local organisational environments could be crafted that couldprovide protection from these external pressures, and give the time and space necessary for using the NHSChange Model in the manner intended. The adoption of the NHS Change Model by NHS England was seen as a promising development, though for this to translate into environments that were more conducive to use of the NHS Change Model at a locallevel, participants perceived that a wider change in ethos and culture was needed. Perhaps just asimportantly, though, was the need to provide tangible evidence of the NHS Change Model's potential.Participants were convinced that this was an approach that could produce more lasting change that wastrue to the shared values of the NHS. They were equally certain that the NHS's existing predominantapproach produced changes that were quick, but often ill-thought through, with unintendedconsequences, and lacking in sustainability. For now, though, these remained only convictions. Clearexamples of the value of the NHS Change Model in making this difference to change would give help togive legitimacy, spread the work, overcome scepticism of practitioners who saw this as 'just another'change tool, and advance the notion that taking more time now to do change properly would reaptangible rewards in the future.1.

ReferencesAreas of strength \u0081 The NHS Change Model was viewed as a very helpful tool by these early adopters, for whom it had strong face validity and intuitive appeal. It was seen as complementing and helping to organise existing change efforts, rather than displacing them. \u0081 Its strong basis in evidence, and the way in which it offers practical directions on what to do and links to resources on how to do it, were seen as key selling points. \u0081 Participants had found many individual components of the NHS Change Model, and the resources and tools to which they linked, helpful in structuring their efforts. \u0081 For many participants, a particular strength of the NHS Change Model was in alerting them to aspects of change that, they said, they would not otherwise have considered\u2014thereby ensuring a more comprehensive and holistic approach to change. \u0081 Consequently the NHS Change Model was seen as particularly appropriate for addressing challenging problems that crossed boundaries of organisational, professional and sectoral responsibility. \u0081 The notion of 'shared purpose' was identified as being particularly helpful for participants as they sought to transcend these boundaries and engage divergent stakeholder groups in change. Areas for strengthening \u0081 Participants identified a number of small but significant ways in which the presentation and content of the NHS Change Model could be improved. \u0081 In some cases, there was a sense that participants saw applying the Model to a problem as constituting the major part of the solution. It will be important to continue to emphasise the need for thoughtful, skilled and tenacious application of the Model. \u0081 Both the way in which the NHS Change Model has been spread to date, and the language it includes, divided stakeholders; clinicians were seen as being less enamoured of the vocabulary used by the Model, while spread via social media was seen as excluding some. It may be worth complementing existing approaches to spread and explanation of the Model with others. \u0081 Participants' use of the NHS Change Model was as a heuristic framework rather than a detailed, stepwise model for change. While this seemed appropriate (encouraging flexibility rather than slavish adherence), itcould also give rise to an approach that deviated from the Model's emphasis on using all its components, and attending to the polarities and tensions between them. \u0081 More broadly, many participants struggled to put all of the components of the Model into practice, and to attend to the tensions between them by considering alignments. \u0081 Some of these challenges related to the point in the change process at which participants found themselves, or a lack of specific knowledge on techniques to use, but other seemed more fundamental. Several participants struggled in particular to align system drivers with their change efforts. External challenges to overcome \u0081 The multi-professional nature of the NHS led participants to be cautious in the degree to which they enfranchised others in the use of the NHS Change Model, preferring to delegate specific tasks rather than explicitly use the NHS Change Model in collaborations with others. This seemed to work well for many, but does place a heavy burden of effort on the individuals or small teams who do this 'mediation' of the NHS Change Model. \u0081 Those leading efforts using the NHS Change Model did not always have the power, influence or networks to tie their efforts into wider system drivers, such as organisational priorities and commissioning levers. \u0081 The organisational environment of the NHS, and the tendency to resort to command-based approaches to change, militated against use of the NHS Change Model. This was compounded by the urgency of many changes given demand and financial pressures, which led managers to seek quick fixes rather than take the time to approach change in the way advocated by the Model. \u0081 This environment could also give rise to 'imbalances' in the Model that were difficult to mitigate, with intrinsic motivation shadowed by overwhelming extrinsic factors such as budget cuts, competition for contracts, and risks to services. \u0081 The adoption of the NHS Change Model by NHS England is a promising step in many regards, but there are risks of creating an approach to using the Model that is based more on compliance than commitment. The way in which the Model is advocated, and the broader tone set for dealing with the challenges facing the NHS, will be crucial in the prospects for commitment-based, sincere, and appropriate use of the NHS Change Model. \u0081 Senior managers in organisations also have a key role to play in creating organisational environments in which this kind of approach to change is viable, mediating external pressures and creating time and space for change leaders.Box 1: Strengths, areas for strengtheningand external challenges@NHSIQ www.nhsiq.nhs.ukTo find out more about NHS Improving Quality: Improving health outcomes across England by providing improvement and change expertiseenquiries@nhsiq.nhs.ukImproving Qualit yNHS Published by: NHS Improving Quality - Publication November 2013 - Review date: November 2014 \u00a9 NHS Improving Quality (2013).
