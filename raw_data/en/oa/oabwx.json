Then this guide will rock your world. It outlines the 10 most popular healing stones to help you choose the right energy for your crystal collection 1. Clear Quartz As its name suggests, clear quartz is a clear (or nearly clear) crystal. It's considered a universal healing stone, one that can be used to amplify the vibrational impact of other healing crystals. Used on its own, however, it's thought to be an excellent option for connecting with your higher self. 2. Amethyst Quartz This beautiful, violet-hued stone is beloved for its luxurious appearance and its powerful association with spiritual matters. Users say it enhances spiritual practices and can help protect individuals when their spiritual energy is low. 3. Rose Quartz Pretty pink rose quartz is another healing stone that's as popular for its gorgeous good looks as it is for its association with matters of the heart. Fans say rose quartz is their go-to when they want to upgrade relationships, whether those connections are with family, friends or romantic partners. 4. Flourite Flourites are a go-to healing crystal when people are looking for an upgrade to their personal vibe and energy. These pretty, multicolored healing stones (there are blue, purple, yellow, and green varieties) are thought to boost brainpower and focus, clearing negative mental energy and leaving the mind open to positive thoughts. 5. Jade If you're looking to boost your luck and take your life to the next level, luxurious-looking green jade is a wonderful option for your healing stone collection. Jade's color ranges from light pastel green to rich dark-green hues, but whatever the shade, it's said to bring a host of benefits, from wisdom and spiritual perspective to increased wealth and plain old good luck. 6. Black Tourmaline A dark, usually matte, stone, black tourmaline is the healing crystal that users choose when they want to transform negative energy in a space. Black tourmaline is known for removing bad feelings left by negative people or events and creating a refreshed atmosphere that's more upbeat and positive. 7. Blue Calcite Delicate-looking blue calcite is the healing crystal option many seekers select when they're looking to bring emotional peace. The stone is said to reduce negative feelings by encouraging energy flow: Bad energy is eased out, and soothing energy is drawn in. 8. Carnelian The smooth, rich red and orange coloring of carnelian underscores its kick-in-the-pants power. This stone is a top choice for people looking to boost their motivational mojo. Users say it spikes confidence and inspiration. 9. Hematite Crystal users looking for a sense of balance often reach for silvery-black hematite. This healing stone is said to balance the energy between the body and the mind, providing a sense of equilibrium that helps people move through down days and past their anxious moods. 10. Citrine Those that like citrine say it provides motivation, activates creativity and encourages self-expression. It is a clear yellow variety that is said to help promote emotional balance and transforms negative energy into positive.
