As a naturopathic physician and energy healer... I truly believe in our body's innate healing wisdom, and I feel passionate about helping others gain access to their inner power. I have been in naturopathic practice since 2002, and I additionally have over 15 years of experience as a craniosacral practitioner. My journey into naturopathic medicine has been an evolution from the scientific to the spiritual. I found naturopathic medicine after being a stressed-out, burnt out chemistry major/pre-med student in college. My own personal health journey has helped me to see that the physical, emotional, energetic and spiritual aspects of our human experience are intertwined. I enjoy weaving the contents of my eclectic medicine bag to support individuals wherever they are on their own healing journey.
