Comprehensive Comparisons to Demonstrate Immunosuppressed Status and Cardiovascular Dysfunction in COVID-19 Patients 29 Pages Posted: 8 Apr 2020 [More...](javascript:void(0);) Abstract Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread throughout the world since the outbreak in Wuhan, China. This paper summarized 101 patients diagnosed as COVID-19 aimed to describe the changes across different timepoints throughout the disease course. Methods: The patients diagnosed as COVID-19 pneumonia who underwent serial peripheral blood collection and chest CT scans were enrolled. Patients were grouped on the basis of the severity of illness. Clinical datas were compared were analyzed and compared across each group. Findings: 101 patients admitted to hospital were enrolled. The study included 43 (42.6%) women and 58 (57.4%) men, and the median age was 45 years (interquartile range [IQR], 16-71). We first used Monaca system to show the 3D outline of spleen, liver and kidney of the typical patients, and found spleen shrink in 27.7% patients, severe patients had suffered more than mild patients. Lymphopenia was observed in 66 (65.3%) of the 101 patients. In our study, 27.3% still have low levels of lymphocytes after discharge. Tachycardia occurred mainly in the first two days of hospitalization, with an increase in myocardial-band creatine kinase (CK-MB) in 10 patients, in troponin I in 1 patient, in brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) in 3 patients and in arrhythmia in 16 (15.8%) patients. Interpretation: In addition to the common belief that SARS-CoV-2 can cause pneumonia, our studies show that other organ systems could also be affected during COVID-19 infection. The injuries could lead to immunosuppression and cardiovascular dysfunction, which might contribute to increased mortality in critically ill patients.
