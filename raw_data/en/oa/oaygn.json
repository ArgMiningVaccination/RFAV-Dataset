Introduction and background Hello, my name is _________. I am the POD Team Leader. We are here today to provide COVID -19 vaccines to those that are el igible. Vaccination operations will be conducted from [time opening to public] to [time closing to the public]. Clients will show their appointment confirmation to Flow Monitors at the POD entrance . They will then be directed by Flow Monitor s to the Vaccination Station to receive their vaccination. Staff designated as Medical Greeters will be stationed throughout the POD. Medical Greeters are clinical staff and should be consulted when a client has a clinical or vaccine -related question. They will be stationed along waiting lines and in an area called the Post -Vaccination Waiting Area. After receiving their vaccination, clients will be asked to wait in the Post -Vaccination Waiting Area for 15 minutes where they will be observed for adv erse events. Clients with a previous history of adverse reactions to vaccines or injectable therapeutics will be observed for 30 minutes. Clinical staff at the POD may be called upon to assist with medical emergencies. In addition, EMS staff are stationed on- site and may be summoned to assist. The presence of EMS staff is not required for POD activities and the POD may continue to operate if EMS is not currently available. If this is their first dose of the vaccine, clients will work with Flow Monitors in the Post -Vaccination Waiting Area to help them schedule their second- dose appointment. Clients will likely have many questions. Use the COVID -19 Vaccine POD FAQ -Moderna {\"FAQ\") to help answer these questions. There will be Medical Greeters on site who can assist with answering questions. If clients have additional questions, remind them that they can ask their heal th care provider or a local pharmacist. If you encounter clients who seem unusually stressed, mental health professionals, known as the Emotion Support Team , are on site to help . Please ask your Unit Leader to locate them if you feel a client needs this assistance. b. Client's right to privacy Please be aware of a client's right to privacy and make every efforts to protect client information. Do not discuss clients among yourselves and ensure there is no video recording or picture taking by staff or clients in the POD without express permission of those being captured. 17 Office of Emergency Preparedness and Response Bureau of Emergency Field Operations Operational Procedure Response Phase: Mobilization Section: Point of Vaccination Document Code : IP - CVD - MP - 006 COVID -19 Vaccine POD General Briefing Last Revised or Reviewed: 20210329 Owner : Madeline Pierce c.

Procedure Conduct the following briefing after the Safety Officer conducts the COVID -19 Vaccine POD Safety Briefing. There are a bout 1 million people with disabilities living in New York City ( NYC). These individuals may have one or more disabilities that affect their mobility, dexterity, hearing, vision, speech, or cognition. The following training will briefly cover interactions with these individuals. Basics A person with a disability is not a situation or just their disability ; they are a person trying to get vaccinated and take care of themselves like every one else. If there is an issue, communicate with them, share what their options are and follow their lead on how best to assist them. 1. Customer service and functional access support Please be courteous to clients. Approach clients with a customer -service -oriented attitude. When requested to do so, make all attempts to accommodate identified needs, and ensure continuity of assistance through the entire POD experience, if necessary. When interacting with clients with disability, functional, or language access needs, it may be helpful to use the designated \"Quiet Space.\" This semi -private area located [insert location here] is quieter than the main POD area and may enhance communication, reduce stress, and make assisting clients with personal matters easier. The Disability, Access, and Functional Needs (DAFN) and Language Access Coordinator will serve as the point person at the POD to assist with these issues. This person will be stationed primarily at the entrance of the POD but will be available to assist with accommodations throughout the POD. 2. Language Services The goal at the POD is to assist and provide language access to people whose first language is not English and who have Limited English Proficiency (LEP).

Working with Individuals with Physical Disabilities If a person has difficulty getting from point A to point B due to disability, offer assistance . Do not just start assisting without asking. Don't touch or push a person's wheelchair, don't move a person's cane or crutch, and never make physical contact with a person unless you have been specifically asked to do so. If you have been asked, figure out what works best for that person. Working with Individuals who are Blind/Low Vision 80 Office of Emergency Preparedness and Response Bureau of Emergency Field Operations Operational Procedure Response Phase: Operations Section: Point Of Dispensing Document Code: IP - CVD - MP - ### COVID -19 Vaccine POD Disability, Access, and Functional Needs (DAFN) Briefing Last Revised or Reviewed: 20210328 Owner: Mayor's Office for People with Disabilities If there is someone who is blind be prepared to read signage or written materials out loud, provide verbal directions to the proper vaccination spot or physically guide them there. In order to determine the best way to assist them, always ask them first. Working with Individuals who are Deaf/Hard of Hearing If someone is Deaf or Hard of Hearing, speak clearly in short simple sentences ; do not shout. Determine the best me thod of communication whether that is speaking back and forth, writing/texting information or accessing a Video Remote Interpreting service on a smartphone. Working with Individuals who have a Speech Disability If someone is difficult to understand, be patient. Don't try to finish their sentences or talk over them, just ask if they can repeat themselves. If you still don't understand them ask if they can write it down or text you. Working with Individuals with Cognitive Disabilities Comm unicate to everyone in clear and simple sentences. Avoid figures of speech, metaphors and overly complex language. Provide easy to follow instructions and be prepared to repeat those instructions. Working with Individuals with Mental Health Disabilities The COVID -19 pandemic has been very difficult for many people. During the vaccination process, some individuals may be experiencing periods of high stress or anxiety. During these periods consider these tips: Be empathic and nonjudgmental Respect personal space Use nonthreatening nonverbal communication (body language and facial expressions) Remain calm, rational, and professional Focus on the person's concerns Offer supportive words that let the person know you understand what's happening Maintain focus on problem solving Recognize that a person who is anxious may not be able to focus on everything you say Allow silence during communication for reflection Answer questions but ignore targeted aggressive communication directed towa rd you Be mindful of the situation to maintain personal safety Conclusion Disabilities are not always visible, and you can never know who has a disability and who does not. For this reason, it's important to always communicate and be prepared to help each person. If they need assistance, follow their lead with how best to assist them. 81 Office of Emergency Preparedness and Response Bureau of Emergency Field Operations Operational Procedure Response Phase: Mobilization Section: Point of Dispensing Document Code : IP - CVD - MP - 030 COVID -19 Vaccine POD Flow Monitor Assignment and Just -In-Time Training (JITT) Last Revised or Reviewed: 20210511 Owner: Madeline Pierce Objective To provide the Client Assistance Unit Leader with instructions for assigning Flow Monitors to positions and conducting Just-In-Time Training (\"JITT\") in a COVID -19 Point -of-Dispensing (POD) .

L ikely sources of stress for clients and steps to address them: a) Uncertainty : Lack of information, conflicting information, rumors, worries about self and loved ones, perceived unfairness in treatment, etc. Response : Provide regular, truthful updates on the situation and what is being done. Don't make promises you may not be able to keep. If unsure of an answer, say, \"I don't know but will try to find out. \" b) Unmet physical needs: Physical exhaustion, adverse weather conditions, crowded environment, limited access to resources to meet basic needs, etc. Response : Inform clients about the loc ation of the bath rooms, food stores/vendors in the neighborhood, etc. Shelter clients from extreme weather to the best of your ability. c) Separation : Child's accidental separation from their guardian .

Doing unfamiliar tasks outside your normal scope of work, managing overstretched resources, making difficult decision wit h limited information, c ommunication issues, difficulties reaching loved ones, etc. Response : Find out in advance what your task may be , participate in drills . Ask if you are unsure or need support . 3. RECOGNIZE STRESS REACTIONS for what they are . Everyone at the POD will experience some level of stress. Stress reactions vary from person to person, t here is no right or wrong way to react. Recognize stress reactions for what they are: normal reactions to an unusually stressful situation . Common stress reactio ns: a) Physical : Feeling exhausted , headaches, dizziness, chills and sweating, rapid heart rate and gastrointestinal problems. b) Behavioral: Not acting \"like yourself, \" being restless, argumentative, hyperactive, or withdrawn, having conflicts, eating too much or too little. c) Emotional : Having emotional outbursts, experiencing shock, fear and anxiety, agitation, irritability and anger, helplessness, and hopelessness. d) Cognitive : Confusion, and problems with remembering, concentrating, and making decisions. e) Spiritual: Questioning basic beliefs. 4. NORMALIZE STRESS REACTIONS . a) Don't take signs of stress and frustration expressed by clients or other staff personally . (e.g., do not raise your voice, lose patience, engage in arguments ). b) Reassure distressed clients their stress reactions are normal. Validate their feelings . Say things like: \"I'm sorry to hear about ...,\" \"No wonder you feel . . .\", or \"That sounds really tough. c) \"Avoid clich\u00e9s like \"I know how you feel\" and phrases which minimize situation such as, \"It could have been worse\" or \"Others had to wait even longer/travel further t han you .\" USE STRESS-REDUCING COMMUNICATION STRATEGIES. a) Communicate respectfully. Respect personal space as appropriate for the situation . Ask client s how they wish to be addressed. Speak directly to people , (e.g., not to their companion, aide, interpreter ). 104 Office of Emergency Preparedness and Response Bureau of Emergency Field Operations Document Type Response Phase: Operations Section: Point of Dispensing Document Code: IP - CVD - MP -037 POD Psychological Environment Last Revised or Reviewed: 20210408 Owner: Monika Eros -Sarnyai Try to mak e eye contact , but never force it . Some client may prefer not to make eye-contact due to developmental , cognitive, or psychological disability, or cultural norms . When interacting with those hard of hearing /deaf making eye contact can help the communication. If a person uses a wheelchair or scooter, or is of short stature , never lean on their assistive device ; try to interact with them at their eye level. Ask the client if they would be more comfortable if you stood or knelt next to them during the conversation. There are a number of disorders such as Multiple Sclerosis , and Parkinson's , that can cause involuntary physical movements of the face muscles, arms, or legs. Do not let these divert your attention ; focus on the person's words . b) Show that you care by giving your undivided attention. Do not let your tone, words and body language communicate boredom, frustration, judgement, disinterest, or impatience. c) Speak clearly and at a moderate pace. If you talk quickly, slow down. Don't chew gum . If necessary, repeat what you are saying , or use different words. Stress significantly reduces people's ability to process information. d) Be patient and make sure you understand . Allow clients time to response to your questions . Don't interrupt or finish their sentences . Repeat back client's answers to ensure you underst ood them . Never p retend to understand if you don't. 5. USE PSYCHOLOGICAL FIRST AID ( PFA) TO REDUCE STRESS . Use PFA to assist people in emotional crisis . To use PFA: a) Help meet BASIC NEEDS for water, food, bath room , so people are comfortable as much as possible ; assist with special needs. b) Create a CALM ENVIRONMENT by providing accurate, up -to-date information ; and communicating in a supportive, calm, and controlled manner. c) Support CONNECTEDNESS by helping people contact their loved ones and keeping groups , especially families with small children , together. d) Promote SELF- SUFFICIENCY by supporting people to take simple actions such as filling out forms, look ing after family members, and help ing others, so they feel more in control of the situation. e) Support HOPE by providing truthful information about the positive aspects of the situation : people care, vaccine is available, etc. 105 Office of Emergency Preparedness and Response Bureau of Emergency Field Operations Document Type Response Phase: Operations Section: Point of Dispensing Document Code: IP - CVD - MP -037 POD Psychological Environment Last Revised or Reviewed: 20210408 Owner: Monika Eros -Sarnyai 6. UTILIZE EMOTIONAL SUPPORT SERVICES .

May I connect you with a member of our Resilience and Emotional Support Team ?\" 7. STAY SAFE. Use de-escalation techniques when interacting with angry, upset, or distressed client s. If you feel threatened or in danger, for example a client becomes verbally abusive or threatens violence, notify your supervisor and Site Security. De -escalation techniques: a) Keep calm. Stay in control of your emotions and reaction s. Take deep breaths . Count to five before responding. Let your words and body language express that you care. b) Keep your distance. Don't physically dominate another person or confront them by getting in their personal space. c) Communicate to deescalate. Show you understand . Practic ing active listening by main taining eye contact, and nodding, if it seems appropriate ; it can be perceived as patronizing and escalate the situation. Do not challenge, argue, threaten, or raise your voice, not even if the client does. Validate frustration. Acknowledge feelings . Support some controlled venting. Say, \"I'm sorry that this has been so frustrating.\" Speak in simple short sentences . Do not use jargons or acronyms. Replace negative words with positive ones: Instead of saying, \"Stop disrupting the line ,\" say, \"Please be mindful of those waiting in line near you.\" Remind people you are here to help . d) Connect with help. If people are upset, offer to connect them with REST staff. 106 Office of Emergency Preparedness and Response Bureau of Emergency Field Operations Document Type Response Phase: Operations Section: Point of Dispensing Document Code: IP - CVD - MP -037 POD Psychological Environment Last Revised or Reviewed: 20210408 Owner: Monika Eros -Sarnyai 8.

Start Every Interaction with an O pen Mind Check your conscious and unconscious biases by putting aside any expectations or pre-conceived notions. Meet the client where they are, follow their cues, and allow them to say and show their preferences for interacting. Address Client Questions Answer questions from client s based on what you know from: o Just-In-Time Training o General and Safety Briefing s o Procedure Guide s o FAQs Do not provide unconfirmed information or information that has not been verified. Maintain Confidentiality If a client needs assistance completing their form, refrain from asking questions not prompted by the form , especially regarding a person's health or disability. If they have medical questions, advise them to contact their health care provider . Never share or talk about someone's personal information. Practic e Sensitivity to Cultural and R eligious Norms If you have questions about cultural/religious etiquette, contact your supervisor or a member of the Resilience and Emotional Support Team ( REST ). Pay special attention to situations like these that require cultural sensitivity: o A female client asks to s peak to a female staff member: Make that adjustment within your team or call your Unit Leader so they can identify another staff member to take over the interaction. o A client is averting your gaze ; don't force eye contact. Address Communication Barriers Ask if there is something you can do to help communication . The client knows their needs best . The Emergency Communication Board may assist using pictorial representation of words/concepts. If you think the client has Limited English Proficiency (LEP) utilize the Language Card to determine if they speak another language. Don't use personal devices (texting /making personal calls/listening to music) while interacting with clients. Have another POD Core Team member do the talking (some speaking patterns and accents may be hard for individuals to understand). Offer the client pen and paper so they can communicate by writing. Avoid pulling the individual out of line. However, if you need to take them to a quieter area to ease communication, make clear both to them and to others n line that they will return to their place in line once the interaction has concluded. If you need to request additional support, say, or indicate with gestures that you will come back to where the individual is waiting in line . Contact your supervisor and provide information about the communication barrier. 108 Office of Emergency Preparedness and Response Bureau of Emergency Field Operations Support Document Response Phase: Operations Section: Point of Dispensing Document Code : IP - CVD - MP - 038 Interacting and Communicating with Clients in a COVID -19 Vaccine POD Guidance Last Revised or Reviewed: 20210328 Owner : Madeline Pierce Refer to Additional Interaction Guidance Communicating with an In -Person Interpreter and Using Language Line if: o The client seems to have LEP. o The client indicates they require an interpreter.

Refer to Interacting with Clients with Service Animals Guidance. Respect assistive device s. For people who are blind or low vision this may be a red, white, or probing cane, but there are many other possibilities. Do not touch an assistive device, as it is part of the individual's personal space. If the person puts down an assistive device, don't move it. If asked, agree to use an assistive device, and ask fo r directions on its proper use. This may include computers, smartphones, recording devices, screen readers, and screen magnifiers Provide Navigation Assistance If escorting a person, offer your arm for the person to take. Do not take their arm without asking . Never touch anyone without asking. If the client r equests to sit while waiting in line, describe where they can sit and the process for getting back in line. Ask if they would like you to escort them to an area for sitting and come back to help escort them back to the line. If the client requests assistance in navigating through the POD: o Agree to assist them or identify another staff member available to assist . o Ask the client the best way you can help them navigate. o Stay with the client through out the whole process and describe what will happen at each station . o Be sure to mention stairs, doorways, narrow passages, and ramps .

Determine with the Client the Best Way to Communicate Based on client's cues and using the Emergency Communication Board, identify a way to communicate with the client . Suggestions include: Identify a family member, friend, or someone the client is comfortable communicating through. Use the Language Card to determine if the client would like a sign language interpreter (point to sign language symbol) o If the person indicates that they would like an interpreter, notify your Unit Leader or the Language Access Manager. Communicate, using the Emergency C ommun ication Board or writing on a Yellow Legal Pad (in Rolling Container 1) that you are arrang ing for an interpreter. Identify ways to communicate: o Try speaking louder, slower, or in a way the client can better hear you . o Find out if client can read lips (see tips below) o The client may indicate they use a communication device. Allow the client to direct you how to use it. Such devices includi ng computers, tablets, and phone s. o Write on paper and pen or a tablet what you are trying to say . o The client may be able to t alk directly to you. Some people who are deaf or hard of hearing can communicate verbally. Don't assume that if they can't hear, they can't speak . Positive Communication Techniques Face the person when speaking. Keep your face and mouth visible to show facial expressions and to facilitate lip reading lips. o Stand far enough apart so the client can take in your facial expressions and body language . o Minimize background noise by taking the client to a quiet place . Be sure to note their spot in line and let others in the line know the y will return to their same spot. Use gestures (but don't exaggerate or pantomime) , visual aids (show a form or hand -out, etc.) and facial expressions to reinforce what you are saying. Use short complete sentences and simple words. Ask other POD staff to help. o Having an accent, unusual pronunciation, or a speech disability may make it more difficult for the client to understand you. o Individuals with facial hair are more difficult to speech -read than those without. What not to do : o Yell. o Mumble. o Use abbreviations. o Over-emphasize your facial expressions or lip move ments. o Cover your mouth or chew gum. o Turn your face away or look away.

Commonly used terms include : deaf with a lower case \"d\" refers to the audiological condition of not hearing. Deaf with an upper case \"D\" refers to a particular group who share a language - usually American Sign Language (ASL) - and a cultural identity. hard of h earing refers to an individual who has a mild -to-moderate hearing loss who may communicate through sign language, spoken language, or both. o Offensive terminology can include \"hearing impaired, \" \"deaf and dumb ,\" and \"mute .\" Note that mute is an inability to produce speech. Understand that: o The experiences of people who are deaf or hard of hearing are diverse and differs from person to person. People aren't simply either deaf or hearing; it is a continuum with varying degrees in between. o Generally, people who are deaf communicate using gestures rather than audibly but may make noises during the process. o Sign Language has different grammar and syntax from spoken/written language. o A person's comprehension of written English may be limited. o Lip reading enables a person to receive information from a speaker by watching the speaker's face to identify their speech patterns, movements, gestures, and expressions in context. This is a highly evolved process and the person will be focused on the mouth but take in a full face and upper body view. On average, about 30 percent of English is discernible through lip reading. o If a person is wearing a hearing aid, or an ear implant, do not assume the y can fully hear you. 122 Office of Emergency Preparedness and Response Bureau of Emergency Field Operations Support Document Response Phase: Operations Section: Point of Dispensing Document Code : IP - CVD - MP - 046 Interacting with Clients who May Have Dexterity Disabilities Guidance Last Revised or Reviewed: 20210328 Owner : Madeline Pierce Objective To provide staff with guidance about interacting with clients who may have dexterity disabilities at a COVID -19 Point -of- Dispensing (POD) .

Positive Communication Techniques Be respectful of the person and treat adults like adults . Ask how the client would like to be addressed . Don't use first names unless instructed to do so . Be patient, kind , and put the client at ease. If you are clarifying information, use simple words and concrete concepts. Repeat back what the client says to ensure you have understood correctly. Mirror the pace, complexity, and vocabulary of your speech to theirs. Focus on what a person is saying, no t on any physical movements. There are several developmental disabilities that may cause physical movements. Allow the client extra time to ask and answer questions. Avoid Making assumptions about a person's abilities. Asking to speak with someone else on their behalf unless you really are not able to communicate . Talking down to the client . Finish ing their sentences. Other General Guidance and Information Use person -first language: \"individuals, persons or people with developmental disabilities .\" Offensive terminology can include expressions such as \"mentally retarded\" and \"abnormal .\" Such language ignores people's individual characteristics and strengthen s stereotypes and prejudices. \"Developmental disabilities\" is an umbrella term that includes severe chronic disabilities that can be cognitive , physical or both.

What is a Service Animal? A service animal is not a pet, it is a working animal, which helps to maintain or improve an individual's functioning and independence. Some general information: Service animals are allowed in all public areas even if there is a \"no pet\" policy. Some are licensed or certified and have identification papers. This , however, is not required ; you cannot ask for proof. The handler is responsible for caring and providing for the animal. Dogs are the most likely type of service animal you will encounter, and the only animal recognized under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). A dog c an be any size or breed to be a service animal. A small percentage of clients may have other types of service animals, such as certain types of birds, which are recognized under New York City law. Many service animals will have a vest or guide apparatus, but some may not. Don't ask or make assumptions about a client's disability or reason for having a service animal. You will not need to ask any questions about a client's service animal . By law, the only questions you are permitted to ask a client about their service animal are: Is the animal required because of a disability? What work has the animal been trained to perform? Respectful Interactions Respect the service animal and its handler as a team, allow them to work together and give them space. Don't pet or engage with the service animal; it is on duty . Focus on the client. Don't separate the handler from the service animal. If staff or clients have a fear of dogs and or feel uncomfortable around animals , work together with the handler to find a solution. Tell the handler that you, other staff or other clients are uncomfortable around animals. The handler may be able to help by, for example, having the service animal pull back, re -arrang ing the position so the animal is further away, etc. If a client remains uncomfortable with the service animal, ask them if they would like to move back a few places in the line in order to feel more at ease. Inform them that the service animal has a right to be there and is not a risk to others. You will find that service animals are highly traine d and mostly well behaved . However, if you feel the handler does not have the service animal under control, ask the handler to please get the animal under control . If the client does not comply with your request : You can say , \"I'm sorry, but we cannot continue at this time until your service animal is under control. \" Do not make assumptions about services that the client may or may not need. Reference other Support Documents For additional guidance, the following support documents may be helpful: If there is indication that the client may be blind see Interacting with Clients who are Blind or Low Vision. If there is indication that the client may be d eaf or hard of hearing, see Interacting with People who are Deaf or Hard of Hearing . 127 Office of Emergency Preparedness and Response Bureau of Emergency Field Operations Support Document Response Phase: Operations Section: Point of Dispensing Document Code : IP - CVD - MP - 050 Interacting with Clients with Speech Disabilities Guidance Last Revised or Reviewed: 20210408 Owner : Madeline Pierce Objective To provide staff with guidance for interacting with people with speech disabilities at a COVID -19 Point -of-Dispensing (POD) .

The person may speak, w rite, use a n Emergency Communication Board or communication device , speak sign language , or a combination of methods. Allow the person to show you their preferred method . It is acceptable to communicate with the help of a family member or friend, or someone the client is comfortable communicating through. Just remember to face and keep eye contact with the client. If they use sign language as their primary means to communicate, and there is no family member who c an assist, request an interpreter through your Unit Leader or the Language Access Manager. Positive Communication Techniques Minimize distracting sounds to the extent possible. If necessary , find a quiet place where you can have a better interaction. When complete be sure to accompany the client back to where they were in line. Be patient. Allow time , more time than you are often comfortable with , for the person to respond. Avoid finish ing sentences or thoughts. Ask th e client to repeat themselves. Even if the client is frustrated, in most cases the person will appreciate your effort to understand what they are saying. Repeat back the part of the sentence that you did understand. Ask the client to spell the word or say it in a different way. Ask the client if they would be comfortable writ ing the word/phrase on paper or on a tablet . Offer the Emergency Communication Board so the client can point to images. Work as a Team with POD Staff If one POD Core Team member does not understand what the client means, try having another staff member assist with the interaction. If it is still difficult, ask if there is a friend/family member nearby or reachable by phone who can assist. If communication is not successful , contact the Operations Manager to access additional resources. Other General Guidance and Information Use person -first language such as, \"person with a speech disability .\" The experiences of having a speech disability are diverse and differs from person to person. A speech disability may be the result of a stroke, hearing disability, traumatic brain injury, cerebral palsy, medications, psychiatric, and many other reasons. Many speech disabilities have no known cause. Many people with speech dis abilities have no problem understanding or reasoning. These disabilities may involve not being able to register the pitch, loudness, or quality of speech . 128 Office of Emergency Preparedness and Response Bureau of Emergency Field Operations Document Type Response Phase: Demobilization Domain : Mass Prophylaxis Document Code : PG-D- MP-000 COVID -19 Vaccine POD Site Demobilization Guide Last Revised or Reviewed : 202104 17 Owner : Kamille Menil -Bivens Page 1 of 5 COVID- 19 Vaccine POD Site Demobilization Guide Objective To provide Point -of-Dispensing (POD) site staff with instructions for demobilizing POD site operations and restoring the facility to its normal function.
