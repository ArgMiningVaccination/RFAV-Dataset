The protein-based Novavax COVID-19 vaccine is widely available across the region. You can get Novavax at local healthcare providers, retail pharmacies, and community clinics, as well as County public health centers and community vaccination events. You can now make an appointment or find a walk-in clinic [here](https://myturn.ca.gov/). While the Novavax vaccine is not showing up as available in some online appointment systems, all County of San Diego locations have it in stock for anyone who asks, regardless of which vaccine was selected during scheduling. Novavax has been authorized as a two-dose primary series, given three to eight weeks apart, to people ages 18 and older. Clinical trials showed that the vaccine series is 90% effective at preventing mild, moderate and severe COVID-19. The vaccine was developed using protein-based technology, which the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has been using for decades to treat diseases such as hepatitis B, shingles and human papillomavirus. The vaccine presents a specific portion of the virus which the body generates immunity against. \"Novavax is another vaccine option we have to slowing the spread of COVID-19,\" said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. \"It represents a new choice for the prevention of serious complications from COVID.\" Right now, Novavax is only available to people who have not received any of the other COVID-19 vaccines. It is not yet authorized as a booster shot for people who have previously been vaccinated with Pfizer, Moderna or Janssen.
