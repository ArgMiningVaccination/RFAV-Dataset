Patients' irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms improved when they were in lockdown, reaffirming the gut-brain connection in functional gastrointestinal disorders, according to research presentated at Digestive Disease Week (May 21-23). The absence of micronutrient deficiency, such as vitamin D, has shown to reduce the incidence of COVID-19, as well as lowering the odds of clinical deterioration in COVID-19 patients, said the findings of a systematic review and meta-analysis. Pileje Laboratoire has revealed details of a new collaboration formed with BIOASTER to investigate the possible immune supporting benefits of probiotic strains as part of the fight against the COVID-19 virus. Pre-diabetes and diabetes are factors which could increase the risk of COVID-19 infections and mortality, and therefore the consumption of certain functional foods could be beneficial, says the guest who stars in the 17th episode of Nutra Champion podcast. The Irish Joint Committee on Health has launched a report on Vitamin D deficiency concluding that the Government must promote supplementation across the population by increasing public knowledge and reducing costs. Vitamin D supplementation should be increased to five-times what is currently recommended in the UK in order to support the population's immunity against respiratory tract infections, according to new research. Researchers have highlighted nutrition as a possible factor influencing the effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccine, as recent news establishes a link between vitamin D levels and an adequate immune response. The immune support category continues to dominate dietary supplements as the pandemic proceeds to push consumers toward prioritizing their immune health. But with more than two million Americans getting the COVID-19 vaccine every day, where does the category... After recent studies demonstrated a correlation between low vitamin K levels and more severe COVID-19, researchers are now planning to undertake the first ever prospective trial to explore whether supplementation could benefit patients. In 2020, Dutch dairy cooperative FrieslandCampina said its operating companies in 28 of the 41 markets realized strategic revenue growth in comparison to 2019. E-commerce revenue grew by more than 50% worldwide. Researchers are drawing attention to the possible role of algae in delaying the onset of COVID-19 by 'calming' the 'cytokine storm (CS),' an immune overreaction thought to be behind the condition's more serious symptoms. Vitamin D supplementation should be a standardised practice to treat COVID-19 in hospitalised older patients, according to a newly published position statement by the Spanish Society of Geriatrics and Gerontology. Product nutritional values and front-of-pack health credentials are now buying factors for many consumers. In the last 18 months, this has been augmented by government initiatives, and the Covid pandemic. Malaysia headquartered Ritamix Global has launched a tea modelled on a TCM formula used in China for COVID-19 treatment - but the new product is registered as food and beverage and makes no health claims. Nutraceutical firms have reported a higher uptake of sleep aid and stress relief supplements amid the COVID-19 pandemic, according to New Zealand brand GO Healthy and Spanish saffron ingredient supplier Pharmactive. Researchers have made a case for the use of vitamin, mineral and fatty acid supplements in the battle against the coronavirus, particularly in obese patients, who may be more susceptible to the virus' effects. Elderly patients who have previously taken vitamin D3 supplements are more likely to survive COVID-19 but a single standard dose of 80,000 IU vitamin D3 after infection is probably too low and too late in the day to generate protective effects, according...
