Although formaldehyde is diluted during the manufacturing process, residual quantities of formaldehyde may be found in several current vaccines (see table below). While formaldehyde is a likely cause of nasopharyngeal cancer, the quantities contained in vaccines are not sufficient to cause cancer. The average quantity of formaldehyde to which a young infant could be exposed to in the first two years of life may be as high as 0.7 - 0.8 mg (see table below). This quantity of formaldehyde is considered to be safe for two reasons: - Formaldehyde is essential in human metabolism and is required for the synthesis of DNA and amino acids (the building blocks of protein). Therefore, all humans have detectable quantities of natural formaldehyde in their circulation (about 2.5 ug of formaldehyde per ml of blood). Assuming an average weight of a 2-month-old of 5 kg and an average blood volume of 85 ml per kg, the total quantity of formaldehyde found in an infant's circulation would be about 1.1 mg, a value about 1,500 times more than the amount an infant would be exposed to in any individual vaccine. - Quantities of formaldehyde at least 600 times greater than the amount contained in vaccines have been fed safely to animals in drinking water.

Vaccine 2013;31:2738-2743. The authors estimated the levels of formaldehyde in blood and total body water following exposure to formaldehyde-containing vaccines and compared them with endogenous background levels. (Formaldehyde is a natural product of single-carbon metabolism.) Following a single intramuscular dose of 200 micrograms of formaldehyde, which is equivalent to the amount of formaldehyde received from DTaP, Hib, IPV, and hepatitis B at a single office visit, formaldehyde was completely removed from the site of injection within 30 minutes. Peak concentrations of formaldehyde in blood were estimated to be less than 1 percent of the level of formaldehyde naturally produced by the body. The authors concluded that formaldehyde in vaccines is safe. Next Steps Materials in this section are updated as new information and vaccines become available.
