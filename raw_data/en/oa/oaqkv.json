You can check the latest position and timescales for the nation you are working in: HSE no longer expects every business to consider COVID-19 in their risk assessment or to have specific measures in place. Employers may still choose to continue to cover COVID-19 in their risk assessments. There is a requirement to protect those who will [come into contact with the virus](#contact) due to their work activity. You can find advice for [people who may be at higher risk](#higher_risk) such as those who are immunosuppressed. Complying with general health and safety law Employers must, as always, comply with the Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulations 1992 for [welfare facilities](../simple-health-safety/workplace-facilities/index.htm). We have guidance on [providing sufficient general ventilation](../ventilation/index.htm) in workplaces. Construction sites must comply with the [Construction (Design and Management) Regulations 2015](../pubns/books/l153.htm) by providing adequate [welfare facilities](../construction/healthrisks/welfare/index.htm), as well as fresh air in line with Regulation 33. People who come into contact with COVID-19 due to their work activity Under the [Control of Substances Hazardous to Health 2002 Regulations (COSHH)](../coshh/index.htm), employers must protect workers who come into contact with COVID-19: - directly through their work, for example in researching the virus in laboratories - due to their work activity, such as health and social care workers caring for infectious patients In these cases, employers must still do a risk assessment and implement control measures. COSHH does not cover situations where: - one employee catches a respiratory infection from another - a member of the public has infected an employee with coronavirus through general transmission in the workplace You can find guidance on [infections at work](../biosafety/infection.htm) and [health and social care](../healthservices/index.htm). Talking with workers Although HSE will no longer expect COVID-19 control measures, employers must continue to consult workers and their representatives on any changes they make that might affect health and safety. You can find guidance on [consulting and involving your workers](../involvement/index.htm). RIDDOR reporting of COVID-19 There is guidance on the circumstances [when you should make a report](../riddor/coronavirus/index.htm) under the Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations (RIDDOR). Advice from public health bodies and other government departments COVID-19 remains a public health issue and there is public health advice that businesses can use to reduce the risk. Please refer to the relevant guidance for the country you are working in: Protecting those who may be at higher risk People who are immunosuppressed There is guidance from the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) on [protecting immunosuppressed people](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-for-people-whose-immune-system-means-they-are-at-higher-risk/covid-19-guidance-for-people-whose-immune-system-means-they-are-at-higher-risk).
