The explanation Radon produces a radioactive dust in the air we breathe. The dust is trapped in our airways and emits radiation that damages the inside of our lungs. This damage, like the damage caused by smoking, increases our risk of lung cancer. Radiation PROTECTiNG PEOPLE PREVENTiNG HARM PREPARiNG FOR THREATSOther radiation sources Any radiation exposure carries a risk: the higher the exposure the higher the risk Risks other than lung cancer It is mainly our lungs that are exposed to and damaged by radon. There is no consistent evidence that radon causes cancers elsewhere, or other harm.How can I reduce my risk? Find out if you live in a radon risk area - do a search on www.ukradon.org If you do, measure your home - order a test on www.ukradon.org If the radon is high, reduce it - see our fact sheet on reducing radon If you smoke, give up. What is the evidence? A European study, funded by Cancer Research UK and the European Commission showed that radon in the home increases the risk of lung cancer 1. An independent report, Radon and Public Health estimated that radon is a cause in over 1,100 lung cancer deaths each year in the UK 2. Radon risks: details The life-time risk of lung cancer due to radon is greatest for smokers.
