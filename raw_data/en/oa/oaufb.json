Fire Cupping Relax & Rest Cupping is a practice used in traditional medicine in several parts of the world, including China and the Middle East. It involves creating suction on the skin using a glass, ceramic, bamboo, or plastic cup. Negative pressure is created in the cup either by applying a flame to the cup to remove oxygen before placing it on the skin or by attaching a suction device to the cup after it is placed on the skin. It is often used to alleviate symptoms of muscular pain and the beginnings of respiratory illnesses. Gua Sha Balance your Energies Gua sha is a healing technique also called 'scraping', it can remove blood stagnation considered pathogenic in traditional East Asian medicine. Modern research shows the transitory therapeutic petechiae produce an anti-inflammatory and immune protective effect that persists for days following a single Gua sha treatment accounting for the immediate relief that patients feel from pain, stiffness, fever, chill, cough, wheeze, nausea, and vomiting, etc, and also effective in acute and chronic internal organ disorders. Herbal Medicine Harmonize Yin Yang and Five Elements In addition to acupuncture, Chinese Medicine has been using very complex medicinal herbal formulas for thousands of years. We have learned hundreds of these formulas and our own clinic is equipped with about 150 herbs to modify the formula for each patient's specific medical presentation. In TCM, herbs are often combined in formulas and given as teas, capsules, liquid extracts, granules, or powders. Balance Method Put Your Mind at Ease Balance Method Acupuncture is also known as, I-Ching Acupuncture, Distal Acupuncture, & Dr. Tan Style Acupuncture. The Balance Method is a sequence of acupuncture systems based on the concept of balancing meridians to heal the body. The Balance Method is synonymous with instant clinical efficacy and is based on Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) meridian theory and arises from the I Ching. The concepts introduced by the I Ching & Ba Gua philosophy allow mathematical systems to be fully integrated into our view of reality. Ear Seeds (Auricular Therapy) Relax & Rest Clinical trials and systematic reviews have shown that A.T. can be a promising modality in relieving preoperative anxiety, psychosomatic disorders, and various types of pain, managing hypertension and drug dependence, and controlling obesity. These seeds are attached to a small adhesive piece of tape that is applied to different ear acupuncture points that follow your treatment. The ear itself is a microcosm of our bodily system and has points that can address any external or internal area of the body. Moxibution Healing Your Entire Body \"Moxa\" is a powerful herb often used during treatments to supplement certain points and provide warmth to certain areas of the body.
