The [PachaMama Community](https://www.pachamama.com/community/) is also an intentional and alternative eco-village where people live their normal lives in harmony with nature. A day in the life at PachaMama Eco Village is a tapestry of purposeful living, environmental mindfulness, and harmonious community interactions. It is a place where individuals come to learn, grow, and embrace a sustainable way of life. The Work Exchange Program is an opportunity to experience PachaMama Eco Village and become an integral part of the community through service. It helps cover expenses through work while still keeping transformation as their main focus. PachaMama Village extends a warm welcome to families and children of all ages. Children play a central role in the community, immersing themselves in nature's magic and forging lasting friendships. Here, families bond, and everyone finds a deep connection with the forest and its mystical rhythm. Silence is the Heartbeat of the PachaMama community life. Through daily Silent Sittings, Silent Retreats, and Satsangs, a precious opportunity is given to meet with the truth within and surrender to the beauty of the present moment. The Emotional Healing Groups focus on going into the depths of one's being and cleaning out old emotions and suppressed feelings. Through healing the wounds of the past, it is possible to live more fully in the present moment. The Body Cleanse programs offer guidelines for a healthy lifestyle, detoxifying the body, and cleansing the colon and liver. Additionally, PachaMama emphasizes Yoga, providing daily classes and a month-long Yoga Teacher Training. The Red Road embodies the unity of all beings and the ancient customs of the Indigenous ancestors of the Americas. By honoring creation through sacred songs, dances, and ceremonies, everyone becomes part of a universal family. An ecosystem is a interconnected web of relationships where all living organisms and elements rely on each other. When biodiversity thrives and a state of balance is maintained, the ecosystem becomes healthy, sustainable, and self-replicating. Gathering as a family to pray, heal and sing on the wings of musical masterpieces each journey is a unique possibility to experience the medicine of divine vibration within the embrace of a loving community. Tyohar is the spiritual guide and founder of the PachaMama Eco Village. In the late 90's while travelling around the world, mostly in India, by a twist of fate, Tyohar discovered and was deeply touched by the Indian mystic Osho's transmissions and meditations. Years later Tyohar was sharing satsangs and leading silent retreats, when a seed vision to create an alternative community was born. From this seed, and a lot of love, sweat and rich experiences, a flourishing garden called PachaMama Eco Village now exists in Guanacaste, Costa Rica. A retreat center for the soul. "}
