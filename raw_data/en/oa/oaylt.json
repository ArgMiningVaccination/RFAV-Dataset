These senders will be responsible for receiving, relating, interpreting, and/or d istributing the data. A clinical laboratory specimen is described as any material derived from the human body for the purpose of diagnosis, prevention, treatment or assessment for medical or legal purposes. Inanimate substances and other s amples submitted for examination (e.g., environmental lead samples, etc. ) may be accepted from private citizens at the discretion of the Division Director, Laboratory Supervisor, Assistant Laboratory Director , or Laboratory Director. Verification o f Orally Orde red Tests When additional tests are requested by telephone, the caller is asked to follow up with a written request on letterhead or to send an additional laboratory requisition form for that test to the Public Health Laboratory. Please send written reques ts to the attention of the Section Supervisor or to the Specimen Management Section . The additional test(s) will not be performed until the written request is received. With time sensitive tests, the specimen (s) may be tested immediately, and the results held until the written request is received. Exception: No HIV tests will be performed without written request at the time of testing. All blood specimens will be discarded if a written request is not received within seven working days. Requesting Additional Testing on a Serology Specimen To request an additional serology test , call the Specimen Management Section at (803) 896- 0898. Specimens are discarded aft er seven working days. A request must be made within that time period. Additional testing on the same specimen may not always be feasible. The testing laboratory may request additio nal information to determine specimen acceptability . In some cases, a second (new) specimen for testing may be recommended. In other cases, the patient's clinical history may provide an explanation for the initial result, and additional testing or retesting may not be necessary. Specimens Referred for Testing to the CDC Laboratories wishing to send specimens directly to the CDC should contact the Microbiology Division at (803) 896- 0870. The sender will be assigned a State Health Department N umber and will be asked to forward the Public Health Laboratory (PHL) a copy of the information being sent. CDC forms are also available from the PHL . Other Reference Laboratories If a s pecimen is sent to a reference laboratory for initial, follow -up, or verification testing by the Public Health Laboratory, the sender will be notified that the specimen has been referred. Either the original result report from the reference laboratory is f orwarded to the sender, or the results will be reported using the PHL's laboratory information system, noting where the test was performed. A copy of the report is maintained by the laboratory. STAT Testing Requests received in the morning will be put in the day's run. The results will be telephoned to the requestor, followed by a hard copy report or electronic accessible report. If the request is for a test that I-4 will not be performed immediately, the requestor will be informed by telephone when the test will be performed and the result available. Confirmatory Testing When confirmatory tests are necessary, preliminary results are re ported until all testing is completed. Once all testing is complete, a final r eport will follow . Laboratory Specimens Sent to the Public Health Laboratory in Error Specimens sent to the laboratory in error will be returned to the sender as soon as possible. Correction of Patient Information All requested changes to the request form by the sender must be documented on letterhead, dated , and signed by the requestor. A returned copy of the original laboratory report requesting the missing information is also acceptable to communicate changes needed as long as the sender states clearly what is needed, dates, and signs the report. The patient's record will be updated to reflect the change. I-5 Specimen Rejection & Disclaimer Criteria The following rejection criteria and disclaimers are considered universal, as they apply to all specimens submitted for testing. Specific test related rejections are listed in the Alpha betical Listing of Test (Section II) and the Collection Procedures (Section III). No Specimen Received When a request form is received without a specimen, notificatio n to the client should be made about the specimen and the laboratory's inability to perform testing. In addition, the laboratory test report will state that no specimen was received and that testing was not performed. No Requisi tion Received If a specimen is received without a request form and the sender cannot be identified from the specimen label, the specimen will be held awaiting telephone inquiry or delayed receipt of requisition form. After seven days, blood specimens are discarded. Gen -Probe Aptima swab specimen s are discarded after 60 days and the Gen- Probe Aptima urine specimen s are discarded after 30 days. No Name on Specimen When a specimen is received without an identifying number or patient name, it WILL NOT be tested. An exception may be made at the discretion of the Supervisor, Division Director, or Laboratory Director for a specimen that cannot be recollected because of i ts unique anatomic source, collection method, or time of collection. Examples include: CSF, peritoneal pleural and synovial fluids, autopsy, biopsy, or organ specimens, and specimens collected prior to the initiation of antimicrobial therapy. No Name on Requisition When a requisition form is received without a name, and there is no other identification on the form that matches the inform ation on the specimen, a call will be placed to the submitter requesting a corrected requisition. The specimen will be t ested ONLY after the corrected lab requisition form is received. No Test Requested When a specimen is received and there is no test marked on the lab requisition, the sender should be notified by telephone, and the following documentation will be entered into the computer system if a corrected requisition is not provided, \"No test requested. For this specimen to be tested, write the test name on this form and return it to the lab. This specimen will be discarded 7 days after the received date shown.\" Whe n a corrected requisition form is received, only then will the specimen be tested. Note: B lood specimens are discarded after 7 days. Other Missing Information If other necessary information is missing, the specimen will be tested , and the missing information will be requested by phone, fax, mail , or email. The result will be held until the missing information is received. Mismatched Information When the name on the request form and the specimen do not matc h, the specimen will NOT be tested. It will be reported as, \"Name on specimen differs from name on request form \". I-6 Partial Information Matches When there is a partial name match and other data on the request form matches, it is most probably the same patient. The name on the tube is written on the request form, and the test is run, and a disclaimer added to the report. Verification should be made by contacting the client about the specimen, and the data/time and name of the person spoken with should be documented. Specimen Broken or Leaked in Transit When a broken or leaking specimen is received, every attempt will be made to salvage it without compromising the integrity of the specimen. If the sample CANNOT be salvaged, a notation that the sample broke/leaked in transit should b e made in the lab information system (LIS) to be included o n the report. The laboratory report should also inform the client that testing was not performed. Notification should be made to the client about the specimen, and the date/time and name of the person notified should be documented in the computer system. Incorrect Specimen Received If the specimen received is incorrect for the test requested, notification should be made to the client about the specimen and laboratory's inability to perform testing. In addition, the laboratory test report will state that the incorrect specimen type was received and that testing was not performed. Unsatisfactor y Specimens The Public Health Laboratory will discard specimens which are received in unsatisfactory condition. The reasons for the rejection will be reported to the sender on the standard laboratory report form. Unsatisfactory conditions include , but are not limited to: Hemolyzed, chylous, or contaminated specimen, Specimen received beyond the acceptable time for testing, Specimen collected too soon or too late during the disease -state for the test requested, Specimen was stored and shipped at improper t emperature, Specimen is nonviable, or decomposed, Specimen quantity insufficient Specimens that have some degree of hemolysis, icteric, or chylous, will be tested if the degree of hemolysis or lipemia does not interfere with the analysis . The unsatisfactory condition will be indicated on the report form. I-7 Results Reporting Policies All laboratory reports generated are considered confidential information.

Liquid resistant/impervious lab coat or apron (required during collection) 4. Additional protection as recommended by OSHA and/or Safety Data Sheet ( SDS) Specimen Collection: You MUST have completed a DHEC Workshop and be rated proficient and competent BEFORE you can collect a venipuncture without direct supervision. 1. While putting on the appropriate PPE, explain the procedure to the patient and ask the patient to identify themselves or check a picture identification card. a. BEFORE putting on ANY PPE, wash hands with soap and water or use a hand sanitizer with at least 70% alcohol content. b. Order for putting on PPE: put eye protection on first (optional), then put on liquid resistant/impervious lab coat/apron, and then put on non- latex gloves. 2. Position the patient for taking blood from the antecubital vein, or the median cubital vein, or the cephalic vein. a. DIS can ONLY use one of these sites to collect venipuncture. b. MDs, APRNs, RNs, MTs, MLTs can use other sites on the arm or hand, if trained using standard Training Checklist and passed Competency Evaluation annually. 3. Apply disposable tourniquet to the arm just above the elbow and instruct the patient to make a fist; it is NOT necessary for the patient to \"pump\" their fist. a. Always palpate the vein with the disposable tourniquet BEFORE making a decision to puncture the vein. b. DO NOT leave the tourniquet on for > 2 minutes during a venipuncture! 4. Select the best vein and clean the skin over the puncture site with 70% alcohol or benzylkonium chloride in III-15 ONE DIRECTION! a. DO NOT wipe back and forth with the 70 % alcohol/benzylkonium chloride. b. Allow to dry without blowing on the site or fanning the site. c. Once the site is dry, DO NOT palpate the vein with gloved finger; these are not sterile gloves. 5. Use sterile vacuum needle and attach (screwed onto) to a disposable adaptor. a. The vacuum collection tube may be inserted into the adaptor without danger of breaking the vacuum. b. DO NOT pierce the vacuum on the tube with the adapter needle. 6. \"Fix\" the vein selected for the venipuncture. a. Left thumb about an inch below where the needle is to enter. b. Press down on the arm and pull the skin toward the hand. c. The needle is to be in line with the vein. d. The needle is to be BEVEL SIDE UP! e. The needle is to be at approximately a 15- degree angle with the arm. f. You can adjust the angle depending on the depth of the vein. 7. Puncture the skin with a clean, smooth motion. BEVEL SIDE UP! a. DO NOT hesitate; this hurts. b. As the needle enters the vein, a little \"give\" will be felt. c. When inside the vein, grip the tube holder firmly and keep the holder steady. d. Press the vacuum tube onto the needle portion inside the holder. 8. While the needle is inside the vein, collect the required tubes of blood. a. Note: Collect blood in plain (red stopper) tubes before collecting blood in tubes with additives (e.g., EDTA) b. Note: DIS are ONLY allowed t o collect a single tube per venipuncture. c. Mix tubes with additives by gently inverting 5 - 10 times to prevent clotting. d. DO NOT shake the tube(s)! e. Allow the red top tubes to stand in a test tube rack, upright, for at least 30 minutes to allow clotting before centrifugation. f. Note: some patients may take longer to clot, so allow extra time if the patient is on maintenance doses of Coumadin and/or other platelet aggregate inhibitors. 9. Release tourniquet, withdraw needle from vein and apply pressure on venipuncture site with dry gauze. a. DO NOT cover the injection site with an alcohol sponge while withdrawing the needle. b. DO NOT apply pressure on the venipuncture site with gauze if the needle is still in the arm! 10. Have patient apply pressure on the venipuncture site for 2 - 3 minutes to prevent leakage of blood under the skin and formation of a hematoma. When site no longer bleeds, a bandage may be applied if desired. a. Ask the patient to hold their arm straight up and lock their elbow. b. If the patient cannot do this, hold the arm straight up for them. 11. Label specimen tube (s) with proper patient identification information; if not already done when getting supplies together. a. Name of patient/client (first name and last name). b. MCI number or other unique identification number. c. Date collected, time collected and initials of person who collected specimen. d.

Wash hands with soap and water or with hand sanitizer with >60% alcohol. 15. BEFORE allowing the patient/client to leave, take the gauze off of the venipuncture site to ensure it has stopped bleeding. a. DO NOT wipe the area with gauze since this will initiate bleeding again (subcutaneous) and may cause a hematoma (bruise). b. DO NOT allow patient to get up from the chair, table, etc. without being physically at the side or in front of the patient/client: THIS I S A FALL PREVENTION MEASURE! 16. NOTE: DIS staff can ONLY draw one tube; no multi -draws or multiple tubes collected from the same venipuncture collection site. 17. No DIS staff can be trained and/or use a butterfly to collect a venipuncture. Specimen Preparation: 1. Blood collected in a plain red stopper tube or in a serum separator tube (SST): allow the tube of blood to remain undisturbed in an upright position at room temperature for 20- 30 minutes. a. When the specimen has clotted, DO NOT allow the serum t o sit on the clot, whether collected in a red tube or SST tube, without separating through centrifugation; then store according to instructions in the Reference Laboratory manual for specimen collection and transport. b. Note: check manufacturer's package insert for maximum time blood can sit on clot BEFORE centrifugation, if using an SST (serum separator tube). III-17 2. After a clot has formed, gently loosen the clot at the top; \"rim\" with a sterile applicator stick, if necessary. 3. Centrifuge tubes for 10- 15 minutes. a. Since all centrifuges are calibrated by Instrumentation Department (Facilities Management Division, Public Health Laboratory), the time for most centrifugation needs will be on the instrument. b. CHECK OUT THE CALIBRATED TIME/SPEED ON YOUR CENTRI FUGE! 4. Remove the serum carefully with a sterile transfer pipette, and transfer to a clean sterile rubber - stoppered tube or to a screw -top, plastic vial/tube. Avoid transferring any red cells. 5. Label tube or plastic vial running up the length of the tube. a. Do NOT wrap the label around or \"flag\" the label by pressing ends together and extending from the tube. b. This includes ALL vacuum tubes for chemistry, hematology and serology; red top, SST, or purple (EDTA) top tubes would be the common ones. 6. Store tubes of labeled serum in a refrigerator until the specimens are ready to ship to the clinic laboratory or the Public Health Laboratory. Special Procedural Notes: 1. If sending whole blood in a vacuum tube, omit steps 2 and 4 (see page III-6). 2. If using serum separator tubes (gel in the bottom of the tube, SST) omit steps 2 and 4 above. Be sure the gel forms a distinct barrier between serum and clot. 3. During the summer months, pack all SST specimens with a cold pack since the gel can possibly breakdown at temperatures experienced during the summer months. The breakdown of the gel allows the red blood cells to \"leak\" into the serum contaminating the specimen and possibly rendering the specimen unacceptable for testing. 4. Never use a gauge needle size smaller than a 23: this can cause hemolysis! 6. Always allow the blood to flow into a vacuum tube without adding additional pressure. 7. DO NOT take disposable tourniquet off until you have collected ALL of the tubes and the tubes are filled: when you take the tourniquet o ff once you are inside you run the risk of slow blood flow and/or short draws and/or insufficient blood volume. 8. For special considerations using a butterfly for a venipuncture, see the next procedure.

Allow the red top tubes to stand in a test tube rack, upright, for at least 30 minutes to allow clotting before centrifugation. f. Note: some patients may take longer to clot, so allow extra time if patient is on maintenance doses of Coumadin and/or other platelet aggregate inhibitors. III-20 9. Release tourniquet, withdraw needle from vein and apply pressure on venipuncture site with dry gauze. a. DO NOT cover the injection site with an alcohol sponge while withdrawing needle. b. DO NOT apply pressure on the venipuncture site with gauze if the needle is still in the arm! 10. Have patient apply pressure on the venipuncture site for 2- 3 minutes to prevent leakage of blood under the skin and formation of a hematoma. When site no longer bleeds, a bandage may be applied if desired. a. Ask the patient to hold their arm straight up and lock their elbow. b. If the patient cannot do this, hold the arm straight up for them. 11. Label specimen tube (s) with proper patient identification information; if not already done when getting supplies together. a. Name of patient/client (first name and last name). b. MCI number or other unique identification number. c. Date collected, time collected and initials of person who collected specimen. d. Note: if you use a computer label, just add time and initials of person collecting specimen. 12. Complete ALL information on the test request /lab requisition form(s): DHEC 1332/1335. a. Name of patient/client (first name and last name). b. MCI number or other unique identification number. c. Date collected, time collected and initials of person who collected specimen. d. Test required e. Type of specimen f. Ordering physician, APRN, RN, DIS g. Test(s) requested h. Sender Address or Sender code number i. Any specimen instructions or other important information j. Note: if you use a computer label, just add time and initials of person collecting specimen. k. Note: if you use a computer label, be sure to place the computer label with all demographic information on copy 1, copy 2 and copy 3. l. You will send the original top copy of the DHEC 1332/1335 with the specimen(s) m. Retain the third copy for your files in the County Health laboratory. 13. Properly dispose of needles (in biohazard puncture proof sharps container) and other contaminated materials used during venipuncture. a. Place all blood- soaked material in the contaminated waste bag (Biohazard). b. Place all sharps in the sharps container and DO NOT fill above 2/3! c. DO NOT place any non- contaminated waste in the sharps container or Biohazard waste! 14. Remove PPEs in this order: a. Remove contaminated gloves. b. Wash hands with soap and water or with hand sanitizer with >60% alcohol. c. Remove any eye protection. d. Remove liquid impervious/resistant lab coat or apron. e. Wash hands with soap and water or with hand sanitizer with >60% alcohol. 15. BEFORE allowing the patient/client to leave, take the gauze off the venipuncture site to ensure it has stopped b leeding. a. DO NOT wipe the area with gauze since this will initiate bleeding again (subcutaneous) and may cause a hematoma (bruise). b. DO NOT allow patient to get up from the chair, table, etc. without being physically at the side or in III-21 front of the patient/client: THIS IS A FALL PREVENTION MEASURE! Specimen Preparation: 1. Blood collected in a plain red stopper tube or in a serum separator tube (SST): allow the tube of blood to remain undisturbed in an upright position at room temperature for 20 - 30 minutes. a. When the specimen has clotted, DO NOT allow the serum to sit on the clot, whether collected in a red tube or SST tube, without separating through centrifugation; then store according to instructions in the Reference Laboratory manual for specimen collectio n and transport. b. Note: check manufacturer's package insert for maximum time blood can sit on clot BEFORE centrifugation, if using an SST (serum separator tube). 2. After a clot has formed, gently loosen the clot at the top; \"rim\" with a sterile applicator stick, if necessary. 3. Centrifuge tubes for 10 - 15 minutes. a. Since all centrifuges are calibrated by the Instrumentation Department (Facilities Management Division, Public Health Laboratory), the time for most centrifugation needs will be on the instrument. b. CHECK OUT THE CALIBRATED TIME/SPEED ON YOUR CENTRIFUGE! 4. Remove the serum carefully with a sterile transfer pipette, and transfer to a clean sterile rubber - stoppered tube or to a screw -top, plastic vial/tube. Avoid transferring any red cells. 6. Label tube or plastic vial running up the length of the tube. a. Do NOT wrap the label around or \"flag\" the label by pressing ends together and extending from the tube. b. This includes ALL vacuum tubes for chemistry, hematology and serology; red top, SST, or purple (EDTA) top tubes would be the common ones. 7. Store tubes of labeled serum in a refrigerator until the specimens are ready to ship to the clinic laboratory or the Public Health Laboratory. Special Procedural Notes: 1. If sending whole blood in a vacuum tube, omit steps 2 and 4 (see page III-6). 2. If using serum separator tubes (gel in the bottom of the tube, SST) omit steps 2 and 4 above. Be sure the gel forms a distinct barrier between serum and clot. 3. During the summer months, pack all SST specimens with a cold p ack since the gel can possibly breakdown at temperatures experienced during the summer months. The breakdown of the gel allows the red blood cells to \"leak\" into the serum contaminating the specimen and possibly rendering the specimen unacceptable for test ing. 4. Always refer to the Public Health Laboratory Services Guide for complete instructions for specimen collection, specimen preparation, specimen storage and specimen transport for the specific laboratory test(s). Note: use current edition only. III-22 5. Never use a gauge needle size smaller than a 23: this can cause hemolysis! 6. Always allow the blood to flow into a vacuum tube without adding additional pressure. 7. DO NOT take disposable tourniquet off until you have collected ALL of the tubes and the tubes are filled: when you take the tourniquet off once you are inside you run the risk of slow blood flow and/or short draws and/or insufficient blood volume.

III-33 QuantiFERON -TB Gold Plus (QFT-Plus) Collection Procedure Principle: To properly collect a blood specimen for QuantiFeron- TB Gold Plus. Supplies: 1. 4 QFT tubes 2. form 1335 3. Designated QFT shipper Collection Procedure: Precaution: Wear gloves when collecting blood specimen s 1. For each patient, collect 1mL of blood by venipuncture directly into each of the QFT -Plus blood collection tubes (4 tubes total). a. As 1 mL tubes draw blood relatively slowly, keep the tube on the needle for 2- 3 seconds once the tube appears to have completely filled , to ensure that the correct volume is drawn. Note: The black mark on the side of the tubes indicates 1mL fill volume. QFT -Plus blood collection tubes have been validated for volumes from 0.8 mL - 1.2 mL. If the level of blood is outside the indicator line, it is recommended to obtain another blood specimen . b. If a butterfly needle is being used to collect blood, a \"purge\" tube should be used to ensure that the tubing is filled with blood prior to the QFT -Plus tubes being used. 2. Immediately after filling tubes, shake them ten (10) times just firmly enough to ensure the entire inner surface of the tube is coated with blood to dissolve the antigens on the tube walls a. Tube temperature should be between 17- 25\u00b0C at the time of blood tube filling. b. Overly vigorous shaki ng may cause gel disruption and could lead to aberrant results. 3. Label tubes appropriately. 4. The tubes must be transferred to a 37\u00b0C \u00b1 1\u00b0C incubator as soon as possible, and within 16 hours of collection. Prior to incubation, maintain the tubes at room temperature (22\u00b0C \u00b1 5\u00b0C). Do not refrigerator or freeze the blood specimen s. Note: There are incubators located at specific sites in the regions, or specimen s can be placed on courier for incubation, HOWEVER specimen s must be received within the acceptable 16 hours post -collection if incubation is to occur at the Public Health Laboratory. If the bloo d is not incubated immediately after collection, re -mixing of the tubes by inverting 10 times must be performed immediately prior to incubation at 37oC. 5. Incubate the tubes UPRIGHT at 37\u00b0C \u00b1 1\u00b0C for 16 - 24 hours. 6. After incubation at 37\u00b0C, blood collection tubes may be held between 4 - 27\u00b0C for up to 3 days before further testing. Specimens should be shipped to the Virology laboratory using the courier system in the designated boxes within the 3- day post -incubation time period. Specimen Handling: 1. Use a pati ent label to properly label each QFT -Plus tube. 2. Complete a DHEC 1335. See instructions on back of form for completing. Mark QuantiFeron Gold- Plus and complete incubation start and end time. III-34 Specimen Preservation and Transport: 1. Specimens should be shipped and received within 16 h ours of collection if not incubated in regions, or within 3 days post-incubation. 2. Place the specimen inside designated QFT -Plus shipper (large white shipper with pink label) labeled to t he attention of Virology and ship to maintain tubes in the temperature range of 17 - 27\u00b0C until receipt at the Public Health Laboratory. Specimen Rejection: 1. Universal Rejections, See Section 1 2. Use of improper collection techniques and/or under - or over -filled collection tubes. 3. Specimen not incubated within the proper incubation period after collection ( specimen s under - or over -incubated) or specimen s requiring incubation at 37oC are not received at the Public Health Laboratory within 16 hours of collection. III-35 ENTERIC PATHOGENS Purpose: To properly collect a stool specimen for the isolation of the following enteric pathogens: E coli 0157, Salmonella, Preparation: special preparation. Supplies: 1. Wide -mouthed container. 2. Enteric kit with Cary -Blair transport media. See Page III- 1 to order. 3. DHEC form 1335 Collection Precautions : Wear gloves when collecting stool specimens.

IV-1 Section IV Transporting and Shipping Infectious Substances A. Introduction Patient specimens from most of the SC Health Departments and many of the SC hospitals are transported to the SC DHEC Public Health Laboratory through a DHEC contracted courier system. This courier system picks up and delivers courier mail to over 60 DHEC h ealth departments and locations throughout the state every evening for arrival at the Public Health Laboratory the next morning. For the protection of employees and the public, patient specimens and infectious substances must be properly packaged and labeled. As packages delivered using this courier system are transported in commerce, they must be packaged to meet all DOT requirements for shipping infectious substances. Failure to follow these regulations can result in injury, exposure, and/or fines . B. Regulatory Requirements There are three regulatory entities regarding the shipping of hazardous materials; the International Air Transporters Association (IATA), the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT), and the United States Postal Service ( USPS). According to regulations, it is the shipper's responsibility to properly package shipments of infectious substances and hazardous materials. The International Air Transporters Association (IATA) is a private organization whose regulations only apply to air transport by IATA member airlines . All major airlines are members of IATA and follow the IATA Dangerous Goods Regulations taken from the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Technical Instructions for the Safe Transport of Dangerous Goods by Air. The United States Department of Transportation (US DOT) is a government agency that regulates commercial transport. Commercial transport takes place when money is exchanged for a good or service. All modes of transportation, ground, air, and wa ter, fall under DOT regulations. US DOT regulations are located in the Code of Federal Regulations 49 CFR 173. Updates to these regulations require congressional approval and are not frequently updated. The United States Postal Service (USPS), has their o wn regulations found in the domestic mail manual. As one federal agency cannot regulate another federal agency, the USPS is not required to follow US DOT regulations. As an example, the Postal Service can transport cylindrical shippers while a private courier, like Fedex, cannot. In addition to these regulations, private couriers can have additional regulations. As an example, Federal Express requires that a shippers declaration for Dangerous Goods be typed and not hand written. The US Department of Tran sportation (DOT) and the US Postal Service (USPS) harmonized their regulations with the International Air Transporter Association (IATA) regulations in 2006. Therefore, if infectious substance is packaged and labeled to meet the IATA regulations, the pack age will meet or exceed the requirements for US DOT and the US Postal Service. In addition to providing uniformity, this harmonization allowed the regulations to be more adaptive. As IATA is a private organization, it has the ability to change its regulations without congressional approval. IV-2 C. Training Requirements All employees who are a part of any step of classifying, packaging, labeling, marking, completing the paperwork, or transporting the specimen must be properly trained to package and ship infectious substances. Training records must be retained for a minimu m of thirty -six months . Retraining must be completed every two years from the date of completion for IATA regulations and every three years for DOT regulations. The training must include: An overview of the regulatory requirements Security awareness train ing Function specific training on the activities the employee will be responsible for, such as classification of infectious substances, packaging, labeling the outside container and completing shipping documentation. Safety training to include understanding the hazards of the infectious agent, safe handling and emergency response procedures. The employer must certify the employees training as adequate and maintain a record of training which includes: The individual's name The most recent training completion date A description, copy or reference to training materials used The name and address of the organization providing the training A test, which was completed satisfactorily, to verify the employee understood the training. IV-3 D. Exemptions Exempted Materials The following items are exempt from the shipping regulations for infectious substances, but must be packaged to avoid leaking during shipping and may require a special label. Specimens/samples in which all pathogens have been neutralized or inactivated Specimens/samples known to not contain infectious substances Specimens/samples which only contain micro- organisms which are non- pathogenic for humans and animals Dried blood spots and fecal occult blood samples Environmental sam ples (food and water) that are not considered to pose a significant health risk Organs for transplant and blood for transfusion Private Courier Exemptions An exemption called the \"materials of trade exemption,\" located at 49 CFR 173.6, is commonly used by hospital and DHEC employees. This exemption has multiple parts, but the part most useful for the transport of infectious substances is the following: \"a hazardous material transported on a motor vehicle, by a private carrier in direct support of a princ iple means of business that is other than transportation by motor vehicle.\" This exemption does not apply to all hazard classes and there are quantity limits to those materials that are allowed. For infectious substances, this exemption only applies to ca tegory B samples. So, a hospital courier or DHEC employee that transports samples to the health department, can use this exemption, because their principle business is not the transportation of samples but the care and treatment of patients or the communit y. Therefore, these regulations listed above do not apply to the transport of category B infectious substances transported by a hospital courier or DHEC employee transporting samples to a health department. However, in order to protect the safety of the e mployee and the public, DHEC employees and other entities shipping specimens through the DHEC contracted courier must follow all of the regulations for proper shipping described in further pages. Additionally, secure the package in the vehicle as far away as possible from the driver as possible, preferably in the trunk if available. If there is an accident, emergency responders need to know that infectious substances are in the package. IV-4 E. Definitions: BIOLOGICAL PRODUCTS: Are those products derived from living organisms which are manufactured and distributed in accordance with the requirements of appropriate national authorities, which may have special licensing requirements, and are used either for prevention, treatment, or diagnosis of disease in humans or animals, or for development, experimental or investigational purposes related thereto. They include, but are not limited to, finished or unfinished products such as vaccines. CARBON DIOXIDE, SOLID (DRY ICE): Carbon dioxide, solid (dry ice) is pr oduced by expanding liquid carbon dioxide to vapor and \"snow\" in presses that compact the product into blocks. It is used primarily for cooling and due to its very low temperature (about - 79 C) can cause server burns to skin upon direct contact. When Carbon dioxide, solid (dry ice) converts (sublimates) directly to gaseous carbon dioxide it takes in heat from its surroundings. The resulting gas is heavier than air and can cause suffocation in confined areas as it displaces air. Packages containing Carbon di oxide, solid (dry ice) must be designed and constructed so as to prevent build- up of pressure due to the release of carbon dioxide gas. CONSIGNEE: Any person, organization or government which is entitled to take delivery of a consignment. CULTURES: Cultures are the result of a process by which pathogens are intentionally propagated. This definition does not include patient specimens as defined in 3.6.2.1.4.

EXCEPTION: A provision in these Regulations which excludes a specific item of dangerous goods from t he requirements normally applicable to that item. EXEMPTION: Authorization issued by an appropriate national authority of all States concerned providing relief from the provisions of these Regulations. INFECTIOUS SUBSTANCES : are substances which are known or are reasonably expected to contain pathogens. Pathogens are defined as microorganisms (including bacteria, viruses, rickettsiae, parasites, fungi) and other agents such as prions, which can cause disease in humans or animals. INNER RECEPTACLE: Ar e receptacles which require an outer packaging in order to perform their containment function. IV-5 OVERPACK: An enclosure used by a single shipper to contain one or more packages and to form one handl ing unit for convenience of handling and stowage. Dangerous goods packages contained in the overpack must be properly packed, marked, labeled and in proper condition as required by these Regulations. For cooling purposes, an overpack may contain Carbon dioxide, solid (dry ice), provided that the overpack meets the requirements of Packing Instruction 954. (A Unit Load Device is not included in this definition.) PACKAGE: (Non -Radioactive Material).

UN NUMBER: The four digit number assigned by the United Nations Committee of Experts on the Transport of Dangerous Goods to identify a substance or a particular group of substances. (The prefix \"UN\" must always be used in conjunction with these numbers.) IV-6 F. Instructions for Packaging Infection Substances Step 1: Classifying Infectious Substances Infectious substances are divided into 2 categories - A and B. If you need assistance with classifying the materials you are shipping, please call the testing section which performs the test you are requesting. Category A An infectious substance which is transported in a form tha t, when exposure to it occurs, is capable of causing permanent disability, life -threatening or fatal disease in otherwise healthy humans or animals. Indicative examples of substances that meet these criteria are given in Table 3.6.D from the IATA Dangero us Goods Regulation (see next page). This table is not exhaustive. New or emerging pathogens, which do not appear in the table but which meet the same criteria must be assigned to category A. In this table, organisms listed with t he words \"cultures only\" indicate that clinical specimens known to contain that organism can be shipped as category B. As an example, Ebola is not listed with \"cultures only.\" Therefore specimens known to contain Ebola must be shipped as Category A. Other Examples of Category A infectious substances: Known culture of a Select Agent Known culture of Escherichia coli (toxigenic) Known culture of Neisseria meningitidis Known culture of Mycobacterium tuberculosi s Samples or cultures suspected to be Select Agents or BSL -3 organisms. (As an additional precaution and requested by the PHL) Category B An infectious substance which does not meet the criteria for inclusion in Category A. Examples of Category B infectious substances: Most cultures and patient specimens shipped to the Public Health Laboratory A swab placed in a genprobe bottle (would not meet the IATA definition of a culture) IV-7 Table 3.6.D from IATA Dangerous Goods Regulations Indicative Examples of Infectious Substances Included in Category A in Any Form Unless Otherwise Indicted (January 2021) [NOTE: \"Select Agents or Toxins\" are shown in red anthracis (cultures only) abortus (cultures only) Chlamydia psittaci - strains (cultures only) Clostridium botulinum (cultures only) Coccidioides immitis (cultures only) only) Crimean virus Dengue (cultures only) Eastern equine encephalitis virus (cultures only) Escherichia coli, verotoxigenic (cultures only) Ebola virus Flexal virus Francisella (cultures only) Guanarito virus Hantaan virus Hantavirus causing hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome Hendra virus Hepatitis B virus (cultures only) Herpes B virus (cultures only) Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (cultures only) Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (cultures only) Japanese Encephalitis virus (cultures only) Junin virus Kyasanur Forest disease virus virus Machupo virus virus Nipah virus Omsk hemorrhagic fever virus Poliovirus (cultures only) Rabies virus (cultures only) Rickettsia prowazekii (cultures only) Rickettsia rickettsii (cultures only) Rift Valley fever virus (cultures only) Russian spring -summer encephalitis virus (cultures only) Sabia virus Shigella dysenteriae type 1 (cultures only) Tick-borne encephalitis virus (cultures only) Variola virus Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (cultures only) West Nile virus (cultures only) Yellow fever virus (cultures only) Yersinia pestis (cultures only) IV-8 Examples of Classifying Infectious Substances Material Category A Category B Culture of Mycobacterium tuberculosi s X Sputum from a person infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosi s X Known culture of Salmonella spp. X Known culture of Bacillus anthracis X Suspected culture of Bacillus anthracis Safer Choice Technically Correct Tube of blood from a person known to be infected with Bacillus anthracis Safer Choice Technically Correct Tube of blood drawn from patient infected with Ebola virus X Animal head shipped for rabies testing X Step 2: Proper Shipping Names and UN Numbers Once the proper category is determined, use the corresponding UN number and proper shipping name for your package. Both of these items are required on the outer packaging and are used in later steps. The proper shipping name must be spelled exactly as seen here. For category A, notice the parenthesis at the end. In these parentheses, a technical name must be entered. Abbreviations and non- standard formatting are not allowed. So, no italics for scientific names. Examples could include; \"Escherichia coli\" and \"Neisseria meningitidis\". If you are shipping a sample suspected, but not confirmed, to be a category A infectious substance, and have elected to ship the material as a category A as an additional safety measure, the packing name must use the text \"Infecti ous Substance, Affecting Humans (suspected category A infectious substance).\" Classification Proper shipping name UN number Infectious substance, Category A \"Infectious substance, affecting humans\" (technical name) UN 2814 Infectious substance, Category B \"Biological substance, Category B\" UN 3373 IV-9 Step 3: Packing Selection and Requirements Caution: shipping requirements for your specimen may have recently changed. Check the test section in the Public Health Laboratory Services Guide to ensure proper shipping conditions and see page IV -15 for temperature controlled packaging instructions. 1. Packaging Selection Package Construction Not all packages are acceptable for shipping infectious substances. Packages must follow strict DOT and IATA regulations regarding their size, shape, construction materials, and markings. Approved packaging configurations and requirements are defined by the DOT in 49 CFR 172 and 173, and by IATA in the dangerous goods regulations, secti on 5, packaging instructions 620 and 650. Package Performance Testing Additionally, packages must follow strict manufacturing standards and performance. Performance tests simulate the potential conditions the package may encounter during transit and test the package's ability to contain the hazardous material while enduring stresses like drops, leaks, pressurized atmospheres, and stacking loads. Standards for specific performance tests are located in 49 CFR 178 for the DOT and in the Dangerous Goods Regula tions, Section 6 for IATA. Performance tests must be documented and the records must be made available to inspectors upon request. Packaging Options Performance packaging accepted by the DHEC contracted courier system, also known as a shipper, falls into three general categories: UN certified shippers, PHL approved shippers, and sender verified packaging. Do not mix and match parts of packages. The package has been certified as a unit. Mixing and matching parts invalidates the UN certification. 1. UN ce rtified shippers have been tested by the manufacturer and certified to meet all performance requirements for IATA and DOT. This certification mark (seen right) indicates that the package is UN certified. UN certified shippers are not certified for all hazardous materials. After the UN mark will be a series of letters and numbers. As an example, 4G / CLASS 6.2 / 20 USA /. Pay special attention to the second set of information. In this example \"CLASS 6.2.\" Class 6.2 is the class which contains infectious substances. If a box said \"3\" or \"8\" in this location, the box would not be appropriate for shipping infectious substances. A UN certified shipper is certified for both Category A and B infectious subs tances . UN certified shippers, also meet all of the requirements for air transportation, and are universally accepted by national commercial carriers like FedEx or UPS. IV-10 Berlin - HMS -69110 UN certified for Category A and B shipping. Can go by ground or air transport. See page IV -15 for temperature controlled packaging instructions. Infecon 5500 UN certified for Category A and B shipping. Can go by ground or air transport. See page IV -15 for temperature controlled packaging instructions. Infecon 5000 UN certified for Category A and B shipping. Can go by ground or air transport. See page IV -15 for temperature controlled packaging instructions. 2. PHL approved shippers , indicated by the mark to the right, are shippers provided by the PHL, for which the PHL has conducted performance testing. However, the Public Health Laboratory has only conducted the testing needed for ground transportation of Category B infectious substances . Do not use them for Category A shipments and do not offer this package to a national commercial carrier like FedEx or UPS as it has not met all the requirements for air transportation. ThermoSafe - Sonoco #311 PHL approved for Category B shipping. Ground transport only. See page IV -15 for temperature controlled packaging instructions. IV-11 Uline - Uline #S -7359 PHL approved for Category B shipping. Ground transport only. See page IV -15 for temperature controlled packaging instructions. 3. Sender Verified Packaging may be used if the shipper meets all DOT / IATA regulations and/or has been performance tested by your entity or by the manufacturer. If this option is selected, your entity will be responsible for providing USDOT inspectors with performance test results and/or a statement from the manufacturer. b. Triple Packaging The safe transport of infectious substances is based on \"triple -packing.\" As an example, a primary sample container, in a secondary container, in an outer shipper, offering three layers of protection. Primary Receptacle Is the container (e.g., tube vial, bottle) that holds the specimen. Must be securely sealed and leak proof (screw top tubes must have a piece of waterproof tape around the top to prevent the top from coming loose in transit). Must be su rrounded by absorbent material capable of taking up the entire liquid contents. NOTE : Remember, there must always be adequate absorbent materials next to the primary receptacle to contain all liquid contents should the container leak. The PHL provided abs orbent pads are rated to absorb 50ml. Must be packed in the secondary receptacle in such a way that it will not break. IV-12 Secondary Packaging Is the receptacle into which a primary receptacle and the absorbent and cushioning material are placed. Must be leak proof and securely sealed. Must be placed in the outer packaging so that it does not move. Must have a biohazard symbol. Never put dry ice inside a secondary container. The container may rupture because of trapped gasses. Never put paperwork inside the secondary container . Note: For PHL approved containers, a ziplock biohazard bag may serve as the secondary receptacle for a patient specimen if transport is by ground with the DHEC courier system. Outer Packaging Is the receptacle into which the secondary receptacle, along with cushioning materials, is placed. Must be rigid. Bears all required markings and labels. At least one surface of the outer packaging must have a minimum dimension of 4 inches x 4 inches. Itemized list of contents, requi sition forms, and other paperwork is placed here next to the secondary container. Dry ice and cool pack are placed here next to the secondary container. Seal the package with clear shipping tape. Do NOT use excessive tape to close the outside container. Use caution when opening outer packages. Cut the tape instead of pulling the tape to open the package. Pulling the tape can rip or tear reusable package. Also be careful not to cut the box, specifically cardboard closing tabs. Over Packaging Is not requir ed for all packages. Is a larger box containing one, or more, smaller completely packaged and labeled shippers. Must bear all the same marks and labels required by the contents of the shippers it contains and the word \"Overpack.\" Over packs may be needed i f more, surface area is needed on a shipper to accommodate the required marks and labels. IV-13 Closure Instructions When using a UN certified or PHL approved shipper, you must follow the manufacturer's instructions for closing the package. If the closure instr uctions specify an order to close the flaps of the box, that order must be followed. Failure to follow the manufacture's closure instructions can result in a DOT fine. It is important to retain a copy of these instructions both for reference as needed an d if requested by a DOT inspector. Quantity Limits For Category B infectious substances, regulations allow: Up to 1 liter per primary receptacle Up to 4 liters per outer packaging. For Category A infectious substances, regulations allow: Up to 50ml or 50g per shipper on a passenger aircraft. Up to 4 liters per shipper on a cargo aircraft. IV-14 c. Shipping at Controlled Temperatures Caution: Shipping requirements for your specimen may have recently changed. Check the test section in th e Public Health Laboratory Services Guide to ensure proper shipping conditions and specimen integrity. Generally, only three controlled shipping temperatures are used to transport specimens to the Public Health Laboratory. Samples are shipped \"frozen\" ( < -20 oC), \"refrigerated\" (2- 8oC), or at controlled room temperature (CRT) (15- 25oC). Specimens received outside of appropriate ranges may be rejected for testing. Please carefully follow the instructions below to ensure sample integrity by following proper controlled temperature shipping. Caution: It is the shipper's responsibility to ensure proper temperature control of samples during transit where necessary. Guidance provided below is intended to assist shippers with the selection and use of materials provided through the PHL. The use of equivalent materials is acceptable. Please see, Ordering Supplies/Forms/Shipping Containers, Section III, p. 1, for information on receiving free shipping materials to submit specimens to the PHL. General Instructions Shipping Frozen ( < -20oC) Follow all infectious substance shipping instructions. With UN certified shippers, do not alter the shippers packaging instructions to accommodate dry ice. Place dry ice between the secondary container and the outer packaging. Never place dry ice inside a secondary container. Generally, 6 pounds is sufficient for 24 hour shipments. Refrigerated Shipping (2 -8oC) Follow all infectious substance shipping i nstructions. With UN certified shippers, do not alter the shippers packaging instructions to accommodate temperature control materials packs. The use of phase changing materials (PCM) is preferred over water based gel packs. This avoids the need for pre - conditioning (aka \"bench time\") to prevent freezing the sample at the beginning of transit (aka \"cold shock\"). DO NOT USE WET ICE. Gel packs should be frozen flat and allowed to equilibrate for 24 hours before use. Pre-condition water based gel packs by a llowing them to sit at room temperature (\"bench time\") until their contents begin to become fluid or they begin to sweat. This prevents \"cold shocking\" and freezing the sample in the beginning of transit. The sender will need to determine the number of packs and configurations of materials needed. See instructions below for shipper configurations for PHL provided materials. IV-15 Controlled Room Temperature (CRT) (15- 25oC) Follow all infectious substance shipping instructions. With UN certified shippers, do not alter the shippers packaging instructions to accommodate temperature control materials packs. The use of phase changing materials (PCM) is preferred over water based gel packs. This avoids the need for pre -conditioning (aka \"bench time\") to prevent freezi ng the sample at the beginning of transit (aka \"cold shock\").
