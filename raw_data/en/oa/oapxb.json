It's a nightly ritual, first I use unscented baby wipes to clean them then apply the paw pad cream. It helps with the roughness from the very hot concrete. She lays back and closes her eyes and just luxuriates while I put it on. We do have a light area rug and I have noticed if she jumps down immediately after I have grease paw prints - maybe I'm using too much! Living in AZ, not only does the air get hot, but so does the concrete. This product has softened my pups paws and given them relief from walking and running on the ground. It has given them moisture on their nose, taking away any cracking. We are satisfied with 4Legger Nose and Paw Healing Balm. Best balm for for paws, nose and hot spots. Love it. I was looking for an organic nose balm for our senior dog who has allergies. Her nose was cracked & flaking. I found this online and it completely healed her nose quickly! We are amazed with the results and how fast it healed, we also use it for her paws. Thank you for such a great product! 4Legger Nose & Paws Healing Balm: I have used many paw balms over the course of a decade with my senior Pomeranian. This was nothing like I have ever used before. Typically paw balms are waxy and super solid which makes it difficult to really rub into their paws. It just leaves a layer on top of their paw pads instead of absorbing into it. This paw balm from 4Legger is a complete game changer. It has an applesauce-like consistency and spreads on SO easily. Because of this, it doesn't just sit on top of the paw pad, it actually absorbs into it and heals from within. Easy application is great because some dogs do not like their paws touched. It goes on quickly and the consistency allows you to really wiggle the product into the sides of the pads as well. I saw improvement on the quality of paws and nose after one use. Overall gentle and effective. FAQs Use your finger to dip into the balm and then apply directly to your dog's nose pad, paw pads or any other skin area that is irritated. The healing balm will quickly be absorbed. The more frequently you are able to apply the balm, the better. We recommend applying daily when the nose and paw pads are healthy and at least 2-3 times a day when needed for healing. Applying it at bed time is optimal to boost healing and regeneration! Yes. The ingredients are safe and non-toxic and since the balm is quickly absorbed, the healing properties will work even if it is licked off. We have found two things that can help if your dog loves to lick off the balm: 1. Apply the balm and then distract them with a treat, their favorite toy, or a game. 2. The stealth approach - apply it when they are exhausted after a walk or when soundly sleeping! Most customers will notice a difference after the first bath or after the first application of paw and nose protector. We have had customers tell us that after the first bath their dog wasn't scratching anymore. There are a lot of factors that can make your dog itchy. Their shampoo is just one of those factors. If your dog is still scratching after use, you should look at their food, allergies, and thyroid health. One of the dogs in our pack has thyroid issues. She has been helped by adding natural salmon oil into her daily diet. Yes. Our products are safe and non-toxic and while some is licked off, there is likely enough left on the paws after applied for it to do its job. We suggest applying when your dog is winding down to go to sleep, after a big play session, or when distracting them with their favorite toy or a treat. Tocopherol is a derivative of Vitamin E.
