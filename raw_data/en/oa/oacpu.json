Cancer is a life-threatening disease that can affect anyone regardless of race, age, and gender. Traditional cancer treatments like radiotherapy and chemotherapy often result in undesirable and uncomfortable side effects such as vomiting, numbness, nausea, and diarrhea to name a few. Herbal remedies for cancer such as those commonly found in Thai traditional medicine contain antimutagenic, anti-inflammatory, and apoptosis-inducing compounds that help in slowing the development of cancer.What is Herbal Medicine? Herbal medicine is the most widely used and oldest form of treatment in the world today. There are a wide variety of applications and methodologies but all of them rely on the sustainable use of various plant parts such as flowers, leaves, bark, and roots. Each part of a plant features different medicinal properties and uses. Over the last few decades, herbal medicine has been especially helpful in the fight against cancer. How Herbal Medicine Works Today, this branch of pharmacology works like almost any other type of medicine. Researchers and scientists utilize the knowledge and experience passed down over generations to confirm, continue, and improve positive treatment outcomes. Herbs are full of constituents \u2014 naturally occurring chemicals that offer a range of health benefits with fewer undesirable side effects. The idea is to administer the safest, most natural versions of chemical compounds needed for effective medical treatments. Although herbal medicine has countless use cases, cancer care is one of the most practical applications because of how harsh traditional oncology treatments can be on patients. Effectiveness and Benefits of Herbal Medicine Herbal remedies are a part of a growing field of medicine called integrative oncology. This approach to cancer treatment combines herbal medicine with a long list of other therapies to deliver better results. Research conducted on the use of herbal medicine for cancer treatment has proven that it: Slows the spread of cancer Reduces the side effects of cancer treatment Boosts immune system strength and functionality Minimizes the symptoms of cancer Attacks cancer cells Scientists have studied the effects of hundreds of herbs. Miskawaan herbal medicine treatments include herbs such as 1. Moringa Tree Multiple studies have confirmed that Moringa tree contains a compound that kills ovarian cancer cells. Additional research also suggests that Moringa tree can ease a variety of cancer symptoms such as joint pain, fever, sore throat, coughing, and breathing difficulty. 2. Turmeric Turmeric contains a compound called curcumin which, according to a study by Cancer Chemotherapy and Pharmacology, can be safely combined with gemcitabine chemotherapy to treat patients suffering from pancreatic cancer. On top of that, it also reduces inflammation and swelling that is common among other types of cancer. 3. Mistletoe Extracts In a study published by the European Journal of Cancer, mistletoe extract (also known as Iscandor) alleviated the side effects of chemotherapy in patients suffering from lung cancer. In a separate study, mistletoe extract was able to help cancer patients with advanced tumors endure larger amounts of gemcitabine. 4. Ginger According to lab studies, ginger is rich in anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory compounds. In fact, the British Journal of Anaesthesia published a review that documents how ginger minimizes vomiting and nausea caused by chemotherapy treatments. 2 5. Hypericin Hypericin is one of the primary compounds in St. John's Wort. According to the Medical Journal of Australia, hypericin destroys certain types of cancer cells after a patient undergoes photodynamic therapy. 6. Essiac Tea This herbal blend contains immune-boosting compounds such as burdock root. The rich concentration of antioxidants found in Essiac tea boosts immune systems to increase energy, and motivation during cancer treatment. 7. Burdock Root Laboratory studies published in Inflammopharmacology showcase that burdock root contains anti-cancer, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and liver-protecting compounds. The studies indicate that burdock root not only helps in reducing inflammation, but it also sped up recovery from liver damage associated with cancer treatment. 8. Dong Quai Dong Quai is a Chinese medicinal herb that improves overall wellness. Studies have shown this herb contains anti-tumor properties that interrupt the cell cycle and kill cancerous cells. Research on the active compounds of Dong Quai suggests it has the potential to eliminate cells responsible for colon cancer, leukemia, and brain tumors. Other cancer-fighting benefits of Dong Quai include reducing the onset of anemia, protecting the heart from damage triggered by doxorubicin, and preventing inflammation of the lungs after radiation therapy. 9. Astragalus Astragalus is known for easing the side effects of platinum-based chemotherapy treatments, including carboplatin and cisplatin. According to a research paper published in Medical Oncology, lung cancer patients who took astragalus with vinorelbine and cisplatin enjoyed increased appetite and physical performance. Patients who took astragalus also experienced less pain, vomiting, nausea, and fatigue. Types of Herbal Medicine 3 There are various types of herbal remedies for cancer but three of the most widely used are Thai, Chinese, and Western herbal medicine. Other types include Ayurvedic and Tibetan medicine. 1. Thai Herbal Medicine Thai herbal medicine stands on its own because of how it combined the traditions of surrounding practitioners. It combined the best examples of Indian, Chinese, and Khmer remedies to build a system that thrives today. The most unique element of Thai herbal medicine is its use of external applications, including balms, liniments, compresses and poultices. 2. Chinese Herbal Medicine Chinese herbal medicine or Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) focuses on restoring the balance of your Qi (pronounced as chee). Practitioners of TCM believe that Qi is the energy flowing in your body that's vital for maintaining good health. TCM practitioners draw from thousands of years of documentation to create herbal treatments specific to certain types of cancer. They will often make use of the leaves, seeds, stems, roots, and flowers to make herbal powders, tinctures, capsules, and teas. 3. Western Herbal Medicine Western herbal medicine focuses on addressing the overall wellbeing of an individual rather than limiting treatments to the symptoms of the illness. When treating certain conditions such as cancer, western herbalists will review a person's: Health and medical history Family history of diseases Lifestyle and diet Cancer is a preventable disease and not a consequence of aging. Based on decades of evidence, herbal treatment eases symptoms and in some cases even prevents the disease from spreading. This approach should be an essential component of every cancer care plan. 4 "}
