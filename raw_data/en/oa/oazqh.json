Acta Scientific Nutritional Health 3.1 (2019): 35-43.The importance of ketone body metabolism in diabetic pa- tients has been well known since the 1970s, but recently, -hydroxybutyrate (BHB) has been identified as a key component of ancient times, fasting has been performed for religious reasons or as a cure of illnesses. However, a suitable fasting method for healthy longevity or daily wellness has not been established as of yet. The possibility of BHB absorption from intestinal lumen like butyrate is not known. Therefore, we tried to clarify the occurrence of ketogenesis during fasting by measuring concurrent changes in glucose, ketone bodies, fatty metabolism and various hormonal changes in both blood and urine in relation to the intestinal microbiota. Recently the relationship between fasting and circadian rhythm has been reported [10]. The bidirectional relationship between cir - cadian disruption and metabolic abnormalities is found in diabetic patients. The circadian rhythm in food intake should be strongly affected by fasting. When glucose function is altered, circadian behavior should be altered. Mitsuo Koda [11] developed fasting dietary therapy and con- firmed beneficial effects for many patients with intractable dis - eases. About 900-1000 kcal/day by unpolished brown rice, green vegetable paste and tofu constitute the basic regimen of Koda's therapy. We found a successful patient who had recovered from spino-cerebellar degeneration at a young age by Koda's dietary therapy [12,13]. She had been living on only one glass of fresh veg- etable juice per day for 18 years since her acute episode at age 20. Her ketone bodies, especially BHB in the blood, were more than 3 mM, so the main energy should come from ketone bodies.Her biochemical changes coincided with the metabolic adapta - to yield BHB, as shown by aspartate aminotransfer - ase (AST) and creatine kinase (CK). High aspartate was a reflection of above metabolic change. Increased BHB was observed in two participants among five, and both of them had Bifidobacteriacae in thier fecal bacteria [14] Some Bacteroides had xylanase or cellu - lose activities, so these species may play an important role in fiber degradation in a strict vegetarian. Hayashi., et al [15]. had previ- ously analyzed the fecal bacteria of Mori 15 years ago. They found that Clostridium and Bacteroides were the dominant groups. They also found many Bifidobacterium by direct culture. Our previous study in wellness fasting and BHB production by Pass analysis showed that the decreased BMR and insulin signifi - cantly contributed to the increase in BHB and AcAc [12]. From our experience of the Mori case, we considered different gut microbi- ome should influence the production of BHB. We have practiced Kushi macrobiotics for more than 10 years and developed the teaching and practicing system of a 4-day \"Well - ness-fasting\". In this paper I would like to focus on the changes of intestinal microbiota during wellness fasting.Subjective and physical change by wellness fastingCitation: Shaw Watanabe., et al. \"Wellness Fasting and Intestinal Microbiota in Chronomedicine\". Acta Scientific Nutritional Health 3.1 (2019): 35-43.Wellness Fasting and Intestinal Microbiota in Chronomedicine 36 In ARSOA Wellness Fasting program, participants received a combination of a very low-energy vegetarian diet, physical exer - cise, meditation, and lectures about healthy lifestyles [12,16] (Fig - ure 1). Peripheral blood was collected on days 1 and 4 for routine biochemical analyses and for the determination of serum levels of insulin, glucagon and other hormones. Glucose and BHB were mea- sured every morning by finger-tip blood. The stools were collected in the pre-, mid- and post-fasting stage, and profiles of microbiota were analyzed by the metanalytic cytotechnicon [17-21] . Body weight decreased from 55 kg to 53.5 kg, and it continued at least one month later. Waist circumference decreased from 85 cm to 82 cm at day 4, and it also continued for one month. Body weight reduction was 2.6 kg in males and 1.7 kg in females. Body fat rate decreased 1.3% and 0.7% in males and females, respectively, and muscular weight decreased 1.4 kg in males and 0.8 kg in fe- males. Systolic blood pressure decreased 12 mmHg in both males and females, and 5 mmHg and 6 mmHg in diastolic pressure in males and females, respectively. On the contrary, the median pulse rate increased 10/min in males and 7.5/min in females. Body tem- perature decreased 0.2 - 0.3oC in both sexes. By correlation analy - sis BHB difference only correlated to the body temperature and pulse rate, and glucose decrease correlated with lowered diastolic pressure. Although headaches, hunger, GI tract distress, emesis, depres - sion and cold feeling occurred toward the 2nd day of fasting, these symptoms dramatically disappeared at the 3rd day, and active and vivid feeling increased on the 4th day and after (Figure2). Headache was common in females but improvement was better than males. Skin condition also improved by fasting.BMR decreased from 1107+/-101 kcal/day at 1st day to 1087+/-96 kcal/day on the 3rd day. Figure 1: Schedule of Wellness Fasting.Figure 2: Changes of subjective and physical condition during 4-day fasting Males (blue line), females (red line). Biochemical data showed decrease of triacylglycerol (TG) and marked increase of free fatty acids (FFA) (Table 1). Glucose and insulin became lower and glucagon increased. AST increased one third, while ALT and -GTP did not change significantly. Growth hormone lowered, but changes of thyroid hormone did not occur. Urinary catecholamins were variable, but all catecholamins, such as adrenalin, noradrenalin and dopamine increased in the high BHB producer. Creatinin was slightly increased and estimated glo- merular filtration rate (eGFR) lowered about 10% in all groups. Decreased gluconeogenesis less than 4.5 mM seemed to stimu- late ketogenesis (Figure 3).Fasting and hyperketosis BHB in the blood increased from 0.3\u00b10.2 mM at the day 1 to 2.0\u00b11.2 mM at the day 4 of fasting, while the glucose level de - creased from 5.6\u00b11.6 mM to 3.9\u00b11.3 mM at 4th day. According to the increase of blood ketone bodies, urinary excretion of median acety - lacetate 40.9 (7.76-159.2) (min-max), BHB mM (2.72-597.0) and total ketone bodies 66.1 mM (10.5-756.5) on the 4th day. These values returned to 0.16 mM (0-10.1) on 14th day (10 days after fasting). Citation: Shaw Watanabe., et al. \"Wellness Fasting and Intestinal Microbiota in Chronomedicine\". Acta Scientific Nutritional Health 3.1 (2019): 35-43.Wellness Fasting and Intestinal Microbiota in Chronomedicine 37 More than 600 microbiotas were determined by our system [17-21] . Rejected hits were 29.6% and undetermined rate was 9.4%. These were summarized to 60 genus, 29 families, 14 or - ders, 11 classes and 9 phyla. Most common bacteria was Verrucomicrobia (0.602%.). When compared bacterial profiles in 3 different times, pre-, mid- and post-fasting period, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria and Verrucomicrobia showed significant changes by fasting (Table 2).

Changes of glucose, insulin, BMR, and body weight affected the BHB increase. Acetoacetate had positive correlation with BHB and negative correlation with body weight and insulin change. The number of species in the prefasting stool was 201 speci - mens, which decrease to 140 specimen at the mid fasting, and in- creased to 221 specimens the post fasting stool. Long term stabili - ty of human gut microbiota was reported [22,23] , but rapid change was also reported by David., et al [24]. like our cases.

If we examined various relationship, significant correlation was found between highest BHB group and Enterobacteriacea fam - ily in the pre-fasting (Figure 5). Figure 5: Microbiota profile at family level in the different fast- ing stage divided by BHB level at 4th day Significant correlation was found between highest group of BHB and Enterobacteriaceae (red) in the pre-fasting stool.Further analysis of bacterial profile at the species level clari- fied that 15 species were directly or indirectly related to BHB level, such as Five cases with very low Enterobacter presence showed lowest plasma BHB increase. Only one case with high BHB level did not show any attributable bacterium. Plasma concentration of BHB was related to Enterobacteriaceae directly or indirectly. The latter suggested syntrophic effects on Enterobacteriaceae. Known butyrate producing bacteria seemed to suppress by competitive Syntrophic and suppressive changes of microbiota by ketone production Seven species directly related to BHB level, such Correlation between microbiota with significant association with BHB concentration.Citation: Shaw Watanabe., et al. \"Wellness Fasting and Intestinal Microbiota in Chronomedicine\". Acta Scientific Nutritional Health 3.1 (2019): in Chronomedicine 40 and Blautia faecis were negatively associated with BHB they showed syntrophic correlation with Providencia rettgeri, Hafnia paralvei, and other enterobacters. Five cases with very low Enterobacter profile showed lowest BHB level. Only one case with high BHB level showed no positive asso - ciation to proteobacteriae, but broad association was present, as These associations were confirmed by individual level. Entero- bactereciae species were recognized in 20/22 high BHB producers, 13/17 moderate BHB producers and 15/16 low producers. Two in high BHB, 4 in middle BHB, and 1 in low BHB did not have en- terobacteriacea species, and in to BHB production by coexistence with Enterobacteriaceae. Cooperation (syntrophic) or suppression (competitive) of bacil - li was suggested by correlation network among individual species (Table 4). Generally, BHB producing bacteria seemed to suppress butyrate producing bacteria. Summary relationship between BHB level and network of microbiota is shown in table 5. Primary correlation CC with BHB phylum Secondary relationshipCC Enterobacter families, except for Flavonifractor plauti (Table 4). Table 5. Microbiota with direct and indirect correlation with serum BHB level. Cahill studied the glucose metabolism of people who fasted for 40 days, and found that in the starving human adult, BHB and ace- to-acetate were produced in the liver from long-chain fatty acids and BHB could be the energy source in the brain and other tissues. A rise of BHB blood concentration to approximately 6 mM was characteristic. Approximately all of the lactate, pyruvate, glycerol, Relationship to butyrate producing bacteria and amino acid carbons which are removed by the liver and kid- ney are converted into glucose, as evidenced by substrate balances across these organs to keep the basic level [25]. Increased AST is a reflection of metabolic change. BHB is considered to be produced in the liver, kidney and astrocytes in the brain, but our case report suggested the involvement of intestinal microbiota [14]. Fasting caused hyperketonemia, but the degree was different from indi - vidual to individual. Citation: Shaw Watanabe., et al. \"Wellness Fasting and Intestinal Microbiota in Chronomedicine\". Acta Scientific Nutritional Health 3.1 (2019): 35-43.Wellness Fasting and Intestinal Microbiota in Chronomedicine 41 Four days of fasting induced hyperketosis without concurrent clinical symptom. The magnitude of changes in ketone body con- centrations correlates with the levels of insulin, glucose, free fatty acids and several hormones. Very stable glucose levels were note- worthy under metabolic change of fasting. Enhanced ketone body production occurred when the blood glucose level was less than 4.5 mM (90 mg/dl). The urinary excretion of BHB/acetylacetate (AcAc) ratio increased from 0.56 among low ketone concentration, and 3.36 among high ketone concentratuin. The highest excretion of ketone bodies into the urine was 756 mmole/g creatinine. Fur- ther studies are needed to clarify the hormonal effects and to es - tablish whether high urine excretion rates of ketone bodies could affect the renal function. ConclusionButyrate-producing bacteria may represent a functional group, rather than a coherent phylogenetic group, within the microbial community of the human large intestine. Butyrate formation can play a special role in bacterial energy metabolism [26-29] and this implies that certain features of energy metabolism and microbial ecology may be shared between phylogenetically distinct groups of butyrate-producing bacteria. Numerically, two of the most im- portant groups appear to be Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, which Clostridium leptum cluster, Roseburia the Clostridium of firmicute bacteria. After reduction to butyryl-CoA, butyrate can be formed either with the enzymes phosphotransbutyrylase and butyrate-kinase via butyry-l-phosphate or with the enzyme bu - tyryl-CoA: acetate CoA-transferase, which utilizes acetate as a co- substrate and generates acetyl-CoA (Figure 6). Figure 6: Synthesis and degradation of ketone bodies. Reference pathway and bacteria with key enzyme. Could synthesis of BHB come from butyrate? The current data suggested Enterobactericeae mainly correlated to the BHB produc- tion, but several other species in Clostridium and Bacteroides that had correlation with BHB were indirectly related to Enterobacteri - ceae. Enterobacter seemed to suppress Firmicutes, so butyrate pro- ducing bacteria would be suppressed in the colon. The possibility of metabolism by intestinal microbiota from butyrate to BHB in the body seemed to be unlikely. In addition, there are many bacteria in the soil that can synthe- size metabolic pathway of butyrate synthe- sis and BHB production seemed to be done by different microbiota. Absorption of BHB from intestinal microbiota could occur like a BHB supplement use, so dietary effects should be clarified more. The possible absorption of BHB through intestinal wall could be accepted independently from butyrate production. Wellness fasting caused metabolic and physiological changes, and induced hyperketonemia which showed correlation with pre- fasting microbiota profile. High BHB level showed association with family Enterobacteria- ceae directly or indirectly. The dominance of Enterobacteriaceae seemed to suppress bu - tyrate producing bacteria. So, the BHB production seemed to be independent from butyrate pathway in the gut. The rout of BHB synthesis would be multiple by syntrophic and/or competitive growth of bacteria. Composition of Intestinal microbiota influ- enced the level of plasma BHB. Prefasting Enterobacteriaceae increased BHB level. Suppression of butyrate producing bacteria was noticed. Direct and indirect relationship to produce BHB lev - els was present. As the legacy effects of wellness fasting, improved lifestyles, normalized blood pressure, increased diversity of intestinal mi- crobiota. Dietary intervention is effective for continuation of a good healthy state.Citation: Shaw Watanabe., et al. \"Wellness Fasting and Intestinal Microbiota in Chronomedicine\".
