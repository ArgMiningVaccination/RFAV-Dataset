DALES* THE FEDERAL grant-in-aid as a fiscal device for achieving program objectives, first through government, channels and later direct,ly to in- dividuals and institutions, has a history almost as long as that of the Nation. The modern allo- cation-formula grant with matching requirements for the recipient State or local government., how- ever, made its appearance only as recently as the First World War, in the Federal Aid Road Act of 1916 and the Smith-Hughes (vocational education) Act of 191'1. An even more recent development, the project grant, began to re- ceive increasing emphasis in the middle fifties, and most of the newer grant programs have been project grants in which the money is channeled directly to the project receiving assistance. I. Grants to States and Localities The purpose and financial characteristics of grant's-in-aid to St.ate and local governments vary considerably. As used in this section, the term \"grants\" is confined to grants for cooperat,ive Federal-State or Federal-local programs admin- istered at the State and/or local level, and for those programs in which the bulk of the funds is channeled through agencies of State and local governments. Emergency grants and the value of grants-in-kind are included when they conform to this definition. In 1963-64 this detini- tion applied to 57 separate Federal grant pro- grams, which are arranged here in seven groups according to purpose. Excluded from the grant series are reimbursements to States and localities for expendit'ures incurred by them as agents of the Federal Government in administering pro- grams primarily natioi.al in character, shared revenues, and payments in lieu of taxes. Federal aid granted directly to individuals and t.o public and private institutions is reviewed in t.he second part of the article. Federal grants to States and localities reached another of their successive alltime highs in 1963- * Division of Research and Statistics. BULLETIN, JUNE 1965 64, reaching $9.8 billion and topping the preced- ing year's amount by $1.5 billion or 17 percent. Increases were registered in all seven groups of grants and ranged from 5 percent for the educa- tion group to 63 percent for the miscellaneous group. The sharp rise in the latter group was largely accounted for by a sixteen-fold increase, to $257 million, in the accelerated public works program, new in 1962-63. First payments were made under two new grant programs in 1963-64. In the public health area, $3 million was granted for short-term projects to assist States and communities to carry out inten- sive vaccination programs. almost $5 million was granted in 15 States for the acquisition of open- space land for recreational purposes under title VII of the Housing Acts of 1961 and 1964. More than half-55 percent-of all grants were for social welfare purposes in 1963-64, and almost three-fourths of all social welfare grant,s were administered in t,he Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. The Department is the Federal Government's largest grant dis- penser; it paid out $3.9 billion under 30 differ- ent programs-about 40 percent of all 1963-64 grants. The Department of Commerce, with $3.7 billion under four programs, disbursed 3'7 per- cent of the total, and the Department of Agri- culture, with $977 million, paid out 10 percent.. The Housing and Home Finance Agency and the Department of Labor each disbursed 4 percent of the total. Together, these five agencies accounted for 96 percent of the 1963-64 grants to States and localities. The remaining 4 percent was granted by the six other grant-dispensing agen- cies in the Federal household: the Department of Defense, the Department of the Interior, the Office of the President, the Federal Aviation Agency, the Small Business Administration, and the Veterans Administration. The grant money is drawn from two sources- general funds appropriat,ed in the administrative budget and trust funds. For the past few years about 58-60 percent of total grants have been budget funds and the remaining 4042 percent, trust fund money. In 1963-64, 41 percent of all a TABLE l.-Federal grants to State and local governments, amount and percent of total grants by purpose, fiscal years 192930 through 1963-64 1 [Amounts in millions; on a checks-Issued basis] Social welfare Highway construction 7 - Public assistance ?

Grants for old-age assist- ance and medical assistance for t,he aged together amounted to $1.4 billion, 9 percent less than in the preceding year, and those for aid t'o families with dependent children totaled $1.0 billion or 11 per- cent more than in 1962-63. Grants for aid to the blind and aid to the dis- abled and for the combined program of aid to the aged, the blind, and the disabled came to $549 million. Of this sum, $280 million was granted to 11 States under the combined program. For States adopting a combined program, the pro- vision of separate and additional Federal funds for vendor payments for medical care, which was possible previously only for recipient,s of old- age assistance, is extended to the blind and the disabled. EMPLOYMENT SECURITY ADMINISTRATION Grants for employment security administration totaled $405 million in 1963-64. Although this amount is 22 percent higher than the grants of 1962-63, it is still almost 10 percent less than the alltime high of 1961-62. These figures should not be taken, however, as an accurate reflection of program trends in the administration of State unemployment insurance and State employment services. Rather, they represent, merely t,he tim- ing of advances of funds through the Department of Labor from the Federal unemployment' trust fund. HEALTH SERVICES Grants for health services (including the con- struction of hospitals, health research facilities, and ~v~~ste-tre:\\tmellt, works) rose to the highest sum ever granted for these purposes, $389 million. The 1963-64 grants were 13 percent higher than t,hose of the preceding year; they were two and three-fourth times the 1953-54 total. An increase was recorded for every program in the group with one exception. Grants for community health practice and research, formerly general health as- sistance, declined 8 percent from their 1962-63 t,otal to $15 million. They have averaged $15-$17 million a year during the past half-dozen years, with a peak of $17.9 million in 1960-61. Many of the year's increases were small, some even fractional. Waste-treatment works construc- tion, however, was up 28 percent to $66 million; mental health grants rose 38 percent to $10 million ; and grants for chronic diseases and health of the aged more than doubled, going from $11 million to $23 million. A new grant program began operations during 1963-64 and disbursed $3 million for short-term projects to assist States and communities to carry out intensive vaccina- tion programs to protect their populations, especially children under age 5, against poliomy- elitis, diphtheria, whooping cough, and tetanus.' OTHER WELFARE SERVICES In 1963-64 the group of grants classified as \"other welfare\" (welfare programs other than public assistance) reached $1 billion for the first time. Only about 11 percent-$117 million- of these grants were administered in the Depart- ment of Health, Education, and Welfare. The two departmental programs are child welfare services, for which $29 million was granted, and vocational rehabilitation, for which $88 million in grants was distributed. Grants for child wel- fare services-13 percent higher than in 1962-63 -have more than quadrupled in the past decade ; they were a scant $7 million in 1953-54. Voca- tional rehabilitation grants rose 20 percent in 1963-64 ; they have doubled and nearly redoubled from their $23 ,million level of a decade earlier. Most of the grants in the group are under the five agricultural commodity distribution programs, two of which are wholly grants-in- 1 The program was authorized by the Vaccination Assistance Act of 1962, P.L. N-868, approved October 23, 1962. BULLETIN, JUNE 1965 5 kind with funds that are interchangeable as the availability of individual commodities changes. Together these two-removal of surplus (\"sec- tion 32\") commodities and Commodity Credit Corporation price-support (\"section 416\") com- modities-distributed domestically foods valued at $481 million in 1963-64, or 36 percent more than in the preceding year. All told, under the five programs, $787 mil- lion was granted-almost one-fourth more than the 1962-63 total. The school lunch program, wit,h grants in both money and in kind, accounted for $179 million and the special milk program for $97 million, both somewhat higher in 1962- 63, The school lunch program in the States also receives surplus-removal and price-support foods. The remaining $29 million represents the Federal share of the value of food stamps redeemed in the third year of a pilot plan to increase food consumption among low-income persons. Every- one of that description, not necessarily assistance recipients, may purchase stamps under the pro- gram at 40-60 percent of face value and may use them in their regular stores to purchase any foods they choose. The \"other welfare\" group also includes the annual Federal contribution to public housing au- thorities, which totaled $182 million in 1963-64, or 7 percent more than in the preceding year, and the grants for State homes for soldiers and sailors, which have remained at about $7 million for several years. 9 total of $540 million was granted in 1963- 64 for the 10 education programs; eight of the 10 are administered in the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare and accounted for 86 percent of that year's education grants. The largest increase from 1962-63 was in grants for National Defense Education Act activities, which rose 35 percent to $84 million. Grants for school construction in \"federally impacted\" areas declined 27 percent to $39 mil- lion, but school-maintenance grants in these areas rose slightly to $283 million in 1963-64. The two closely allied programs of school construction and maintenance are designed to relieve the fin- ancial burden on school systems serving families living on or employed on Federal property. The construction grants began in 1950-51, reached a peak of $121 million in 1954-55, and have grad- ually declined to the present alltime low. The maintenance grants began in 194647 and have continued their growth to the present alltime high. In 1963-64, however, the 2.5-percent in- crease in maintenance grants was more than off- set by the decrease in construction grants, with the result that together the two totaled $7 million less than in the preceding year. In 1963-64 the two programs together represented 68 percent of education grants made by the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare and 59 percent of total education grants ; in 1962-63 they had accounted for 72 percent of the Department's education grants and 63 percent of all education grants. Fractional changes were shown for all t,he Department's other education grants but those to colleges of agriculture and mechanic arts, which remained at $14.5 million for the third year in a row. In 1963-64, grants for agricultural extension work increased 17 percent to $75 million, or nearly two and one-half times their size a decade earlier, and the grants to five States for merchant, marine training schools increased somewhat to $621,000. TOTAL GRANTS FOR SOCIAL WELFARE PURPOSES All the grant groups discussed up to this point fall into the general category of social welfare: public assistance, employment security adminis- tration, health, other welfare services, and educa- tion. In 1963-64, grants for these social welfare purposes amounted to $5.4 billion or 55 percent of all Federal grants to States and localities-11 percent more than in 1962-63 and 131 percent more than in 1953-54. The social welfare grants for each State are shown in table 2. The States have been ranked by per capita personal income-averaged for 3 years as required in many of the grant formulas to dampen the effect of single-year fluctuations- and divided into high-, low-, and middle-income groups. Social welfare grants represented 56 percent of all the Federal grants disbursed in the high-income group ; they were 50 percent of total grants paid out to the middle-income States 6 SOCIAL SECURITY and 56 percent in the low-income group. In 1962- tures for public assistance result in relatively 63 the relationship was roughly the same.

The $3.6 billion in grants for this purpose in 1963-64 was 20 percent more than the amount in 1962-63. They represented 37 per- cent of all Federal grants, about the same propor- tion as in the 2 preceding years. The Federal- aid highway program, financed from the highway trust fund, accounted for almost all the high- way grants. The gap between highway grants and the next largest group (public assistance) is once again broadening: In 1963-64 highway grants were nearly 25 percent more than those for public as- sistance. There has been considerable fluctuation in this gap since highway grants first (1958-59) superseded public assistance grants as the largest group. Highway grants have ranged from as much as 43 percent more than the assistance grants in 1959-60 to 11 percent more in 1962- 63. \"ALL OTHER\" GRANTS The $744 million granted in 1963-64 for the miscellany of programs not otherwise classified represents an increase of almost two-thirds for the group. The \"all other\" group-about 5 per- cent of total grants in the past few years but almost 8 percent in 1963-64-consists of grants for the agricultural and natural resources con- servation programs, urban planning and renewal, airport construction, civil defense and disaster relief, small business management, and ac- celerated public works. A new program for ac- quisition of open-land space in urban areas by public authorities began operations in 1963-64 with grants of $5 million. The large gain in the miscellaneous group is almost entirely att,ributable to the increase in grants for accelerated public works from its first to second year of operations. The 1963-64 grants ($257 million) were more than sixteen times the amount granted in the preceding year. In 1962-63, 37 States and Puerto Rico participated; in 1963- 64, all 50 States, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands received grants under the program, which is financed from funds appropriated to the President. Projects, in depressed areas only, were administered by the Housing and Home Finance Agency ($172 million) ; Department of agriculture ($2 million) ; Bureau of Public Roads, Department of Commerce ($14 million) ; Department of Interior ($3 million) ; and De- partment of Health, Educat.ion, and Welfare ($65 million). The accent of the law is on ac- celeration in already existing grant, programs. It permits a grant where, for example, an alloca- t,ion formula under other legislation limits the sum that may be spent on a project, or where an area of activity is not within the regular pro- gram's scope. In the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare the grants were used to supplement the Hill-Burton hospital construction program, the waste-treatment plant construction program, and t,he construction of Indian sanita- tion facilities, mostly on reservations. RELATION TO OTHER INDICATORS Grants per capita are shown in table 3 by State and major purpose. Asin table 2, the States are classified by size of per capita income into three groups. Within each group the States vary widely in the amount of Federal grants received per capita. States with low population density, as well as States that spend a great deal from their own resources for federally aided programs, tend to receive more than the national average, whatever their income level. In general, however, somewhat higher grants per capita may be expected in the low-income than in the middle- income States and in the middle-income than in the high-income States; but there is considerable overlap from group to group. The national average of grants per capita in 1963-64 was $51.30, with a range of $294.29 (nearly double that of 1962-63) : from $324.96 in Alaska to $30.65 in New Jersey. Both are high- income States. If these extremes were eliminated the highest grants would be in Wyoming ($137.96 per capita), and the lowest in Indiana ($34.07). Both States are in the middle-income group. Although the highest and lowest per capita recipient States have remained the same for several years, the spread between them widens each year. Minimum allotment provisions in certain of t,he grant formulas, particularly for 8 SOCIAL SECURITY highway construction, raise per capita grant,s for the more sparsely populated public-land Stat'es, most of which still receive a larger proportion of Federal grants for highways than for any other purpose. Alaska and Wyoming fall in this group. Per capita grants for many programs tend to vary inversely with per capita personal income, since the latter is often used in grant formulas as a measure of need, a measure of fiscal capacity, or both. The main exception to this observed tendency is in grants for employment security administration, which are generally higher in States with high per capita personal income-the States of greatest economic activity. In 1963-64 these grants averaged $2.13 per capita for the country as a whole ; the average was $2.43 in the TABLE 3.-Federal grants in relation to personal income and population, by State and purpose, fiscal year 1963-64 1 - 1 -- _. -- _- , / I , I I , I I I , 1 , , , I I I , > I , - I- - -- - _ ._ Total grants as x?rcent of personal income, 1963 Per capita grants States ranked by 1961-63 average per capita personal income Employ- ment security adminis- tration $2.11 2.13 Other welfare services 1.87 1.65 14.29 4.15 8.24 1.46 3.50 5.75 4.25 3.72 2.79 10.59 1.13 3.55 1.73 1.32 4.93 1.09 1.22 2.67 3.67 1.21 1.45 3.70 1.57 1.25 1.74 1.50 1.07 1.72 11.35 1.38 2.41 2.62 1.77 2.01 1.77 2.30 2.09 2.85 5.61 1.72 1.4a 3.01 7.34 1.85 2.62 2.37 t:2 1.95 1.64 1.50 .89 1.96 2.36 2.17 2.32 1.54 2.81 4.25 11.28 4.65 4.53 4.79 6.25 _. - 1 See footnotes to table 1 for programs in each group of grants.

The nationwide average in 1963-61 was 2.10 percent, ranging from 11.35 percent in Alaska to 1.07 percent in New Jersey. Grants in t,he high-income States averaged 1.65 percent of personal income ; in the middle-income group, 2.09 percent; and in the low-income States, 3.4'7 percent. In 1962-63, total grants were the equiva- lent of 1.88 percent of personal income. For the last few years, Federal grants have been the equivalent of 15 percent of State and local general revenues from their own sources.2 ,4 decade ago the ratio was only 11 percent, as shown below : Item 1952-53 1953-54 1959-N MO-61 1961-62 1962-63 ---~--________- 6,920 7,702 direct general revenwx _ _ 11.3 11.3 15.7 14.8 15.2 15.3 Of every dollar of State and local total general revenues in recent years, the States and localities collected 86 cents from their own sources and received 13 cents from the Federal Government in grants.3 In 1952-53, the distribution was 90 cents and 10 cents. II. Grants to Individuals and Institutions In 1963-64 the Federal Government. granted nearly $2 billion directly to individuals and in- stitutions,4 exceeding by more t,han $411 million 2 General revenues are classified by source as \"from own sources,\" or direct, and intergovernmental. The great bulk of intergovernmental revenues passes from the Federal Government to the States and localities, mainly in the form of the Federal grants. 3 Less than 1 cent of each revenue dollar came from types of intergovernmental revenue from the Federal Government other than grants: shared taxes, payments in lieu of taxes, and payments for services performed by States or localities on a reimbursement or cost-sharing basis. * See Sophie R. Dales, \"Federal Grants to Individuals and Institutions,\" Social Security Bulletin, September 1962, for the introductory article on this statistical series and for a technical note on sources and methodology. or 26 percent the total granted in the preceding year and almost double the grants reported for 1954-55. Table 4 shows the sums granted under these programs, by group, for the past 15 years. Grants to individuals and institutions (referred to here as grants to individuals) include pay- ments to private individuals and to academic and other institutions and agencies, public and private. They do not,, of course, include Federal grants to State and local governments or income-mainte- nance payments made through social insurance and such related programs as training allowances or veterans' pensions arid compensation. All grant groups except veterans' training showed increases from their 1962-63 amounts. The range was from l/2 of 1 percent for the agri- culture and natural resources group (to $609 million) to 160 percent (to $241 million) for the National Science Foundation grants for basic re- search in the physical sciences. SOCIAL WELFARE GRANTS Most grants to individuals for social welfare purposes are in the areas of research and train- ing. A relatively small proportion, which is in- creasing in importance, is granted for such other social welfare purposes as relief of refugees and American repatriates and rural housing. In 1963-64 more than half of all grants to individuals, 5'7 percent, were for social welfare purposes. For the first time in a decade, social welfare grants were again more than $1 billion, and they may be starting a return to their post- war heights. At that time the veterans' education and training grants accounted for the great bulk of grants to individuals. Since then, however, the veterans' programs have shown a downward trend that was not slowed by the addition of a war orphans' education program in 1957. A turning point may now also have been reached in the war orphans' program. These grants had risen steadily -from $2 milljon in 1957 to $26 million in 1962- 63-but declined to less than $25 million in 1963- 64. The upward trend in social welfare grants under programs other than those for veterans, however, has now outweighed the decline in veterans' payments and accounts for a constantly increasing proportion of all social welfare grants to individuals. 10 soclAl SECURITY Research and Training Grants In table 5 all Pederal expenditures for research and training through the fiscal device of grants to individuals have been classified according to purpose. This table also brings together the grants for research in social science and social welfare with research grants in the basic physical and life sciences. Education and training grants now total con- siderably less than research grants, largely as a result of the diminution of veterans' training pro- grams and despite the initiation and growth of the programs under the Area Redevelopment Act and the Manpower Development and Training Act. Research grants5 totaled 42 percent more than all types of training grants in 1962-63 ; in 5 The checks-issued figures in these tables create an inaccurate picture of program trend in National Science Foundation research grants : 1960-61, $141 million ; 1962- 63, $93 million; 196.%-M, $241 million. The sharp drop is only apparent, not real, but the new heights are real. The figures reflect changed methods of cash disburse- ments against grants already approved. 1963-64, at $887 million, they exceeded the latter by 45 percent. Grants for research in social welfare fields and for education and training of students other than veterans or war orphans reached an alltime peak of $1 billion in 1963-64, an increase of 38 percent from the preceding year and about twenty times the sum granted for these programs a decade earlier. He&h research and training.-Four-fifths of all social welfare research and training grants (excluding grants for veterans' programs) in 1963-64 were in the area of health. Most of the health programs are administered in the National Institutes of Health and a few-including health construction grants-in other parts of the Public Health Service. Four new health grant programs began pay- ments in 1963-64: $1.3 million was granted for vaccination assistance projects (the private in- stitution counterpart of the public program de- scribed in part I), $1 million for environmental health sciences research, $700,000 for research in TABLE 4.-Federal grants to individuals and institutions for social welfare and other purposes, fiscal years 1949-50 and 1954-55 through 1963-64 [In tuition, and supplies and equipment under the educational titles of the Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944, 194%50 to date, and, under the Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act of 1952, 1954-55 to date; tuition and supplies and equipment under the Veterans' Rehabilitation Vocational Training Act of 1943 and, under the 1950 extension of that act, 1948-50 to date; supervision of veterans' on-the-job training, 194(t50 to date; payments under the War Orphans' Educational Assistance Act of 1956, 1956-57 to date. 2 Research grants and fellowships in the fields ofcancer, dental health, heart disease, general health (Division of Research Cirsnts of the National In- stitutes of Health), and mental health, 1949-50 to date; microbiology, 1954- 55; arthritis and metabolic diseases, neurological diseases, and blindness, 1954-55 to date; allergy and infectious diseases, 195556 to date.

BULLETIN, JUNE 196.5 11 chronic diseases and geriatric health, and $17 million for research in child health and lluman development under the auspices of a new mem- ber of the National Institutes of Healt,h family. All four programs make grants for research ant1 for training. The parent National Institute of Health was created in 1930, and its first categorical Institute (Cancer) in 1937. By 1955 the categorical In- stitutes had grown to seven; no more have since been added. Rut in 1963 two more ?u'ationnl In- stitutes were established, both noncategorical- that is, not, dealing with a specific disease or diseases. The National Institute of General Medical Sciences was authorized by Congress in October 1962 as the successor to the Division of the same name created 4 years earlier. It supports exclusively extramural research and research training in basic biomedical, multicategorical, and noncategorical medical research fields. Although Institute status is new, a program of grants in these areas had been carried on under the old Division. The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, also authorized in October 1962, was established January 30, 1963, with the goal of attaining insight into normal growth and development. The late President Kennedy, who had a strong personal interest in t.he problems of congenital defects, said when he signed the au- thorizing legislation October 17, 1962 : We will look to the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development for a concentrated attack on the unsolved health problems of children and mother-infant relationships. This legislation will encourage imaginative research into the comples processes of human develop- ment from conception to old age. It should permit major advances in the conquest of those chronic conditions such as mental retardation and other congenital defects which derive from aberrations in early development. For the first time, we will have an Institute to promote studies directed at the entire life process rather than toward specific diseases or illnesses . . . The new Institute's grants are for research, training, and fellowships in the eight major pro- gram areas surrounding its goal : reproductive biology, perinatal biology, growth and develop- ment, aging, mental retardation, congenital mal- formation, developmental pharmacology, and human communication and sensory development. Other sock7 welfare research and training.- Slightly less than 5 percent of social welfare research grants in 1963-64 were in areas ot,her than health. The $28 million gramed, however, represented an increase of almost two-fifths from the grants in the preceding year. The largest in- crease occurred in grants for research in juvenile delinquency and youth problems, which rose two- thirds to $6.2 million. Grants for two other programs rose 50 percent or more : cooperative re- search in education (to $7.7 million), and research and demonstrat,ion projects in child welfare serv- ices (to $1.1 million). Grants for cooperative re- search in social security and social welfare and for special projects in vocational rehabilitation rose about 25 percent each to $1.2 million and $12.1 million, respectively. Social welfare training grants, for persons other than veterans and war orphans and in fields ot,her than health, increased 30 percent in 1963-64 to $153 million.

The act is ad- ministered jointly by the Office of Education in the Department of Health, Education, and Wel- fare and by the Department of Labor. (Training allowances, administered by the Department of Labor, are excluded from grants to individuals by definition. For the purpose of this series they are regarded as an income-maintenance program closely related to unemployment, insurance.) The 1963 amendments to the act extended the 100- percent Federal financing (of the institutional part, of t,he program only) from June 1964 to June 1965, and the 1965 amendment,s now take it up to June 1966; the Federal portion will then be 90 percent, matched by 10 percent from the States. Three new grant programs were instituted during t,he year, all operated by the Ofice of Education. Negligible amounts were granted for education of the handicapped and for foreign language and area studies as these programs got underway, but $1.8 million was granted for educational television. The remaining programs in the group had either very small increases or remained at the same level. Other Social Welfare Grants Up to 1962-63 t,here were only four programs in this series making grant,s to individuals for social welfare purposes other than research and training. Three are programs for veterans. In 1963-64, $6.0 million was granted for homes for paraplegics ($4.7 million) and for auto- mobiles especially adapted for the disabled. The third, 4-percent gratuities on Veterans Adminis- tration housing loans, has now diminished to a tag-end (since 1958-59, well below $1,000). Grants under the fourth program-rural hous- ing-began in 1950, were not made from 1953 to 1962, and are now in their t,hird year of reinstitu- tion. Under this program, grants of up to $1,000 may be made to owners of rural housing, living on their own places, for the minor repair or improvement of their homes. Almost $1 million was granted in 1962-63; almost, $10 million in 1963-64. Two new grant programs-both administered in the Children's Bureau of the Welfare Ad- ministration, Department of Health, Education, and Welfare-began payments in 1963-64 : $1.4 million for services for crippled children and $1.9 million for maternal and child health services. These programs are comparable with those discussed in part I except that the funds pass through other than government channels. Two programs had also been added in 1962-63. The largest in dollar terms is for assistance to Cuban refugees in the United States. This was not a new program but one t)hen brought under a regular (nonemergency) appropriation. In 1963- 64, $37 million, compared with $39 million in 1962-63, was expended. The other program is for assistance to repatriated United States nationals --the mentally ill and others. In 1963-64 and in 19@2-63, about the same amount-$400,000-was expended in their behalf. AGRICULTURE AND NATURAL RESOURCES Four conservation programs and the Sugar Act payments composed this group in 1963-64. Sugar Act, payments rose by more than a fourth to $87 million, after a 12-percent decline in 1962- 63. The conservation payments decreased 3 percent to $522 million; unexpired contracts under the conservation reserve ( former soil bank) program accounted for $290 million. Under the 2-year-old land-use adjust,ment pro- gram, $7 million was granted for the conversion of crop land into pasture, forest, wildlife habitat, and income-producing recreational uses, com- pared with $4 million in 1962-63.
