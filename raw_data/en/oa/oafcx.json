Best Choice Best overall The Best on a Budget Attitude Baby Leaves Baby Body Lotion Pear Nectar Attitude Baby Leaves Calendula Cream Earth Mama Face Nose and Cheek Balm Just here for a quick moment? Looking for the best baby lotion and don't have a lot of time to waste? We got you! Here are our picks for the 6 best baby lotions for safely moisturizing baby's skin: Ever since I found out about the overall badness of [phthalates](https://greenactivefamily.com/chemicals-and-materials/go-phthalate-free/) - and the finding that babies whose parents use more baby lotions, baby shampoos and baby powders on them [have higher levels of phthalates in their urine](https://greenactivefamily.com/?p=4896&preview=true) - I've been loathe to use \"normal\" personal care products on my own baby (not to mention myself!) But phthalates are just one chemical of concern that are commonly used in personal care products for adults and for children. There are a ton more chemicals used that really aren't the greatest for our health or the environment. Because of this, I've been really trying to cut down on the chemicals we have in our house. That means switching the types of products I use (like swapping plastic for [glass baby bottles](https://greenactivefamily.com/healthy-home/feeding/best-baby-bottles-glass-silicone-stainless-steel/) and [sippy cups](https://greenactivefamily.com/healthy-home/feeding/best-glass-sippy-cups-alternatives/), or plastic for silicone and more natural out the [baby shampoo](https://greenactivefamily.com/nursery/bath-time/safest-organic-kids-shampoo/), [conditioner](https://greenactivefamily.com/nursery/bath-time/best-baby-conditioner/), [detangler](https://greenactivefamily.com/nursery/baby-care/best-detangler-for-kids-non-toxic/), and - yes - lotion I use with my kid. Add to that, I even consider the surfaces I use, like choosing a [non toxic changing pad ](https://greenactivefamily.com/nursery/baby-care/best-non-toxic-changing-pad/)when diapering my kiddo. When I first read [the study from Pediatrics](https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/121/2/e260) that correlated baby's exposure to personal care products with higher levels of phthalates, I went cold turkey. I banned the use of lotion on our little one, and switched to less frequent hair washings with no extras (detangler, conditioner, etc). Since then, however, I've softened my position, somewhat. Fact is, my little one has gotten really dry since we've moved to a new climate, and her hair is getting longer, which means it's a tangled mess. Still, I definitely don't slather her with baby lotion after every bath. But I do use safe baby lotions and products when they're needed. To me, \"safe\" means non toxic, free from common harmful chemicals, and made with mostly organic ingredients like shea butter and plant-based oils (and preferably certified organic). I want things that effectively help with dry skin and sensitive skin, but be okay for my kid and the planet. While I don't think that's too much to ask for from the companies that make products for our kids, it's surprisingly hard to find. Which is why I made this list - to do the research for you, and take the guesswork out of finding natural baby lotion that's safe and effective (and that you can buy on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll2&tag=greenactive-20&linkId=f9ec4423c8ed6026afd75c7f1b81f808&language=en_US), because who has time to shop these days?) The Best Natural + Organic Baby Lotion The Winners I picked 18 baby lotions that I'd actually use on my own daughter, and all of them are EWG VERIFIED. However, of those 19 lotions, I also identified 6 baby lotions that are the very best: the winners. What made these products winners? In addition to being EWG VERIFIED, every single component ingredient in these lotions are also ranked as super safe. EWG ranked all individual ingredients in each of these 6 lotions for babies as 1/10 on their hazard scale. If you're not familiar with their scale, 1 is the lowest possible rating reserved for only the safest, and lowest hazard ingredients (and 10 is the highest/worst). So which 6 are our best baby lotion picks? [Attitude Baby Leaves Baby Body Lotion Pear Nectar](https://www.amazon.com/Natural-Baby-Body-Lotion-ATTITUDE/dp/B07DQ6SN49/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ref_=ast_sto_dp&linkCode=ll1&tag=greenactive-20&linkId=3343bc0316b7690a2ab6ada90e332304&language=en_US) [Attitude Baby Leaves Calendula Cream](https://www.amazon.com/Natural-Baby-Calendula-Cream-ATTITUDE/dp/B07FM7DRW2/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=greenactive-20&linkId=7b53b80973a5d7a0d3636be074069de0&language=en_US) [Earth Balm](https://www.amazon.com/Organic-Earth-Mama-Petroleum-Alternative/dp/B078B9JPLX/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=greenactive-20&linkId=1211f91fef997fb1c7c4273db509a101&language=en_US) Lotion](https://www.amazon.com/Hecho-loci%C3%B3n-org%C3%A1nica-para-beb%C3%A9s/dp/B07GHMDXHG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ref_=ast_sto_dp&linkCode=ll1&tag=greenactive-20&linkId=8adb072c5ceccca6269ebcf4c63401b1&language=en_US) [Earnest Mom Calendula Butter Baby Cream](https://www.amazon.com/Earnest-Mom-Calendula-Moisturizer-Ingredients/dp/B07TRP4LDJ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=greenactive-20&linkId=af10277e8fa390d2a57892f8c8ff1e98&language=en_US) [Pipette Fragrance Free Lotion](https://www.amazon.com/Pipette-Renewable-Plant-Derived-Fragrance-Free-6-Fluid-Ounce/dp/B07VP6JPX1/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=greenactive-20&linkId=27b3a26985a40b842d76367686dece4f&language=en_US) Our Runners Up Our runners up are all EWG VERIFIED too - that's the highest safety rating EWG offers for overall products. However, not all of the component ingredients in our runners up are rated as 1/10. While most of these baby lotions contain mostly individual ingredients that are ranked low hazard (1/10 or 2/10), some of these products also have a few \"moderate hazard\" ingredients. In my view, they're still great products, as they don't contain any of the ingredients on EWG's [unacceptable list](https://static.ewg.org/ewgverified/docs/EWG_License_Unacceptable_List_C01.pdf). Add to that, many of the moderate hazard ingredients are natural ingredients and organic ingredients. For example, the organic citrus limonum (aka: lemon) oil used in the Baby Baja Lavender Lotion is ranked 4/10. That doesn't mean it's bad - it just is something to be aware of, because lemon oil can be irritating, can cause allergies, and may bioaccumulate. Whether you choose to avoid products that use organic citrus limonum (aka: lemon) oil (or not) is up to you. But most people would agree lemon oil seems pretty far away on the terribleness scale than, say, phthalates or common carcinogens. Here are the 12 baby lotions on our runner up list. Again, these are all EWG VERIFIED too (at the time of writing): [Hello Bello Lavender Lotion](https://www.amazon.com/Hello-Bello-Lotion-Lavender-8-5oz/dp/B07RVFT612/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=greenactive-20&linkId=f05524c091a25b4342d39fc74bef4c10&language=en_US) [Baby Lotion](https://www.amazon.com/Babo-Botanicals-Sensitive-Fragrance-Lotion/dp/B0756CTD8T/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=greenactive-20&linkId=9cc5b715c2f9d692278c369e90f4cdf3&language=en_US) [Everyone Baby Co.

Blueberry leaf, shea butter and moringa seeds soothe and protect. In fact, moringa plants have been used since Ancient Egypt, when the Egyptians used moringa oil to protect their skin! Attitude's lotion is Parent Tested Parent Approved (PTPA) and PETA approved as vegan, cruelty free and never tested on animals. It's also ECOLOGO Certified for reduced environmental impact. It doesn't contain any of the harmful ingredients you'll find in a lot of conventional baby care brands, which makes it a great choice to put near your changing pad or throw in the [diaper bag](https://greenactivefamily.com/nursery/baby-care/diaper-bag-essentials-for-dad/). It's free from parabens, silicone, PEG, formaldehyde, and synthetic fragrances and perfumes. Add to that, it's dermatologically tested and formulated to be hypoallergenic to be non-irritating to sensitive baby skin. This version comes with the light fruity scent of pear nectar, but Attitude's [ Almond Milk scented version](https://www.amazon.com/Natural-Baby-Body-Lotion-ATTITUDE/dp/B07DQ1DYRW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ref_=ast_sto_dp&linkCode=ll1&tag=greenactive-20&linkId=a49264bf0ae878aec7fce1e25e6e305a&language=en_US) earned similar ratings: EWG VERIFIED with all ingredients scoring a 1/10 on EWG's scale, indicating they meet the lowest hazard or risk level. This baby lotion is thinner than [Attitude's baby cream](https://www.amazon.com/Natural-Baby-Calendula-Cream-ATTITUDE/dp/B07FM7DRW2/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=greenactive-20&linkId=620472f90f0de0735c93269dfba274b4&language=en_US) (see below), and is a good non greasy option for daily use on sensitive skin, rather than tackling heavy duty dry skin. This baby cream moisturizes and soothes, without the toxins. Packed with good stuff like blueberry leaf, avocado oil and shea butter, just a little will go a long way towards moisturizing, calming, soothing and smoothing your baby's skin. The natural ingredients contain antioxidants and minerals, which add to the nourishing and protecting nature of this cream. What you won't find in this cream are things like 1,4-Dioxane, phenoxyethanol, parabens, SLS, SLES, BHA, BHT, Phtalates and Triclosan. It's free from skin irritating chemicals and is dermatologist-tested and created to have a low-risk for allergies. It's also non greasy, and just a little goes a long way to soothe super dry skin. Like the lotion, this is Parent Tested Parent Approved (PTPA), and made by a trusted Canadian brand within their own factory in Sherbrooke, QC. Both the [Almond Milk](https://www.amazon.com/Natural-Baby-Calendula-Cream-ATTITUDE/dp/B07FM7DRW2/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=greenactive-20&linkId=47028aa7536fb84cc1060c0e9f9e4df6&language=en_US) and [Pear Nectar scents](https://www.amazon.com/Natural-Baby-Calendula-Cream-ATTITUDE/dp/B07DQ6PPFG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ref_=ast_sto_dp&linkCode=ll1&tag=greenactive-20&linkId=01d88af6311353a2f1fb1515d3172008&language=en_US) are EWG VERIFIED, and all ingredients in both products are rated 1/10 on EWG's hazard scale (that's the best!). This is a super rich baby balm - more of an organic alternative to petroleum jelly rather than a lotion for baby. It's great for chapped and drooly chins or noses, or super dry cheeks, etc. Made without petroleum, GMOs, parabens, and artificial fragrance or preservatives, it's even safe to slather on the chapped skin around a drooling baby's mouth. This balm is comforting, soothing and moisturizing, without being too greasy like petroleum jelly. It's paediatrician approved and dermatologist tested, and certified organic by Oregon Tilth. This product is not vegan, however, as it does contain (ethically-sourced) beeswax. MADE OF products are easy to love, formulated on the backbone of the company's ULTIMATE TRANSPARENCY promise, which allows parents to check the origin and USDA certificate for every product, review testing results, and see where each particular product was manufactured. According to their transparency promise, this baby lotion is made from 84% organic and 16% natural ingredients, and is NSF Organic and EWG VERIFIED. It's also gluten free and vegan. While the certificates and transparency is nice, it doesn't mean a whole lot if the product doesn't actually work well on baby's skin. This baby lotion is non greasy and is fast absorbing, with aloe vera and oats to soothe your little one's skin, and natural argan and avocado oil to provide a protective layer. And, of course, it's free from the yucky ingredients you want to keep away from your baby's skin. No GMO ingredients, no soy, and no phthalates, parabens, or sulfates. It's also free from synthetic fragrances and artificial ingredients that might harm your baby's skin and health. Earnest Mom's mostly organic baby lotion provides all-day relief for baby's skin. Not thinned out with water or fillers, the thick lotion will provide lasting relief to dry skin. It uses natural calendula oil - aka marigold oil - to treat common baby skin problems like eczema and diaper rash. Calendula is a popular natural skincare ingredients, because of its innate anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial, and anti-fungal properties. And it's a great year-round solution, suitable to hydrate, soothe and smooth on hot summer days and with dry winter air. Natural ingredients used in this baby lotion include aloe vera, organic shea butter, cocoa butter, avocado oil, carrot seed oil, rose water flower, kokum butter, and mango butter. This formula is also vegan, and 100% USDA Certified Biobased with 88% organic ingredients. It's gluten free and non toxic, free from the bad stuff you want to avoid for your baby's skin, like phthalates, parabens and synthetic fragrances.

It's a safe, everyday lotion that will keep your baby's skin soothed and supple, without irritating. Pippette's products are all created with the help of biologists, pediatricians, and dermatologists, so you can be sure they're suitable for your little one's sensitive skin. This lotion is hypoallergenic, and made without synthetic fragrances. It's also cruelty-free.
