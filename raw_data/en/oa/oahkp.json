Find out more about vaccines by taking this quiz. 1. The first vaccine developed was against smallpox. You didn't answer this question. You answered The correct answer is The first vaccine was developed in 1796, by a British doctor, Edward Jenner. The word vaccine comes from a Latin word relating to cows. That's because the first vaccine was based on cowpox, a mild disease of cattle and people, but it also protected against the much more deadly smallpox virus. 2. To offer the widest protection against a certain disease such as measles or diphtheria, at least 90% of children should be vaccinated. You didn't answer this question. You answered The correct answer is If 9 in 10 children are vaccinated, the disease cannot spread far even if someone not vaccinated gets it. This is sometimes called \"community\" or \"herd\" immunity. This means unvaccinated people are protected by the great number of others immune to the illness. 3. Vaccines work by teaching your immune system to know what the real infection looks like. You didn't answer this question. You answered The correct answer is Before vaccines, the only way to become immune to a disease was to actually get it and survive it. Vaccines provide an easier and less risky way to become immune. A vaccine trains the immune system by appearing like a natural infection. A vaccine is made from a weakened live germ, killed germ, or parts of the germ. 4. Some vaccines against bacterial infections contain inactivated substances or chemicals (toxins and other compounds) that those bacteria make. You didn't answer this question. You answered The correct answer is Vaccines that contain inactivated toxins include the shots for tetanus and diphtheria. Another type of vaccine uses substances called polysaccharides from the cell wall to cause immunity. 5. The yearly flu vaccine is recommended only for people 50 and older. You didn't answer this question. You answered The correct answer is Everyone 6 months or older should get an annual flu shot. 6. Adults need a booster for tetanus and diphtheria every 10 years. You didn't answer this question. You answered The correct answer is You may also need other vaccines, depending on your health and lifestyle. Check with your healthcare provider. Because of the increasing number of whooping cough (pertussis) cases in adults, these vaccines protect against pertussis. Pregnant people may get a booster shot for whooping cough shortly before childbirth to protect their newborn. 7. A vaccine is available to protect women against cervical cancer. You didn't answer this question. You answered The correct answer is All children who are 11 or 12 years old should get a 2-shot series of the HPV vaccine at least 6 months apart. The vaccine series can start at age 9. The HPV vaccine is recommended for all adults through age 26 if they did not get vaccinated when they were younger. Teens and young adults who start the vaccine series between ages 15 and 26 need 3 doses of the HPV vaccine. In some people, the HPV vaccine may be advised between the ages of 27 and 45. Talk with your healthcare provider to learn more. 8. Fever and soreness at the site of the injection are two mild reactions that may occur after getting a vaccine. You didn't answer this question.
