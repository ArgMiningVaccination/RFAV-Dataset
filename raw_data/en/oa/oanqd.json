Obviously, the safety and effectiveness of chiropractic is far better than most believe. But what we do goes far beyond just a chiropractic adjustment. I have found that properly rehabilitating an injury and educating patients on proper ergonomics goes a long way at allowing our patients to achieve long-term health and mobility. We have grown our practice each year since 2004 based almost solely on referrals from other satisfied patients and area doctors that have realized the benefits we offer. Our Ravenna Chiropractor \"I decided to become a chiropractor because it aligns with my overall philosophy on healing and the human body. The body often times just needs to have the right support to heal. Too many people have succumb to the belief that there is a pill for every ill. This is absolutely not the case for orthopedic conditions such as back, neck and joint pain. Unfortunately, that mind set is how we ended up with the opioid epidemic. I knew that it was my duty to show patients a different path. A path that allows their body to heal itself with the right support from a natural approach. After graduating from NUHS in Chicago, Illinois, I came back to Northeast Ohio. I grew up in NE Ohio and this is my home. I have nothing but good things to say about the people of Ravenna and surrounding communities. People are friendly and truly appreciate the care that we provide. Ravenna Chiropractic and Acupuncture has been serving this community since 2004 and has had the privilege of helping over 10,000 local residents move well and feel well.\" - Dr. Bill Blueter, D.C.
