Some are created within ourselves through our habitual thoughts, feelings, emotions, and behaviors. Others seem to come from around us via our interactions with people and events in our immediate lives and within the larger world community, as well as from a host of environmental sources such as weather, sound/noise, chemicals, toxins, water and food quality, and the like. These influences play a large role in creating our state of health and well-being. If positive, we experience them as life-sustaining and enriching. Reversed, they can cause accumulations and stresses within our energy systems that weaken us, and which can lead to chronic and serious diseases and imbalances in the physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual levels of our being. As Reiki practitioners and teachers, we are often called on to help our clients and students to heal from the effects of these kinds of influences as they show up within the auric field. At these subtle levels, certain negative blocks and patterns can be found, which, over time, can have undesirable effects on the person's health if left uncorrected. It is also a given that our own energy systems require the same kind of healing attention. This article is about a specific grouping of negative subtle energies most commonly known as spirit attachments, cords, entities, and psychic attack. Though these energies can vary in power and potential effects, the overall philosophy of healing these concerns is the same. The process of clearing any of them from the energy field is generally referred to as spirit releasement, and that will be the term used throughout this article to denote this type of healing work. I will begin by addressing the value of knowing about spirit releasement in your practice. Then to help you recognize when such energies may be present, I will define spirit attachments, cords, and various other negative psychic energies; what can make a person more susceptible to their influence; and how they can affect a person. An angelic spirit-releasement technique will be described, with examples of how it was applied in sessions with my clients. I will also share some of the lessons I have learned in dealing with spirit releasement. In endeavoring to accomplish the above, mention should be made that there are many varying approaches and beliefs around this topic coming from many traditions, such as Shamanism, Catholicism, Buddhism, Hinduism, metaphysics, and other forms of spiritual practices. Even in Reiki circles, there are a wide variety of opinions and methods available. Therefore, fully covering such a vast topic within a single article would be impossible. It is also not my intention to make one approach or tradition right and others wrong. In what follows, I will be talking about these subtle energies as I have come to know and experience them, both in clients and students as well as within myself, with the hope that this might help shed light on your journey into this intriguing world. The Value of Understanding Spirit Releasement There comes a time in most Reiki practitioners' development when it becomes important and valuable to learn more about spirit releasement. Doing so will better prepare you to handle such eventualities should they arise, and will make it less likely that you will be caught by surprise, as can sometimes happen. If this topic is new to you, perhaps because you are reading this article that time has come. In many ways, dealing with such energies during a healing session is no different than what you have previously been trained to do, in that a great deal of clearing and healing of the energy field takes place when simply using the basic protocol of hand positions. Many practitioners have also been trained in additional release techniques that accomplish this same end. Thus, without knowing it, it is likely that you have already done spirit-releasement work as a normal part of the Reiki treatments you have given. Negative energies, such as spirit attachments, cords, entities, and psychic attack, are quite obvious to the person trained to recognize these kinds of blocks and patterns. Becoming more aware of such energies and how to release and transform them can be highly beneficial to the recipient's health and well-being, both in the present and the long term. For example, you can help your client focus on healing the particular weakness in his or her energy field that allowed the attachment in the first place. This strengthens the energy system such that future attachments are not as likely to occur. Interestingly enough, the spirit also receives healing benefits, in that sending it to the light allows it to heal and move forward with its own evolution. Another important benefit for your own healing has to do with being able to bring to the surface any conscious and unconscious fears and superstitions you may have around good versus evil, concerns over the need for protection, and impressions that have lingered of the more memorable stories that you may have read and movies you may have seen, such asThe Exorcist nd Rosemary's Baby. Notice, for example, if you are feeling a bit nervous just thinking and reading about this topic. If so, you are not alone, as many people, including myself, at times have felt quite weird or even spooked around such things. This can all be taken care of by doing your own shadow healing around these concerns, and dealing with whatever comes up in such a way that it no longer holds any charge for you. By attending to your own healing needs in this area, you can create a supportive and open space in which your clients can deal with similar issues. (See Part II of this series in the Winter 2004 edition of this magazine for a more detailed explanation of the shadow and its dynamics.) Keep in mind also that once you've had some basic training as supplied with this article and gained some experience, it is likely that you'll consider spirit-releasement work to be no different than other kinds of healing work you already do... How the Shadow Plays a Role The preceding can easily give the impression that these kinds of negative energies are floating about and are randomly choosing those to whom they attach. Though it can certainly sometimes feel this way when on the receiving end of such energies, this is not the case, as on some level the seeming \"victim\" must have either given permission or is cooperating in some way, creating a weakness in the energy field. This extends an open invitation that, like a magnet, draws the negative energies to the person. This is where the shadow comes in, as anything that is denied or repressed having to do with a person's negativity or fears of evil and the dark side could, in effect, subconsciously attract this type of energy to him or herself. The person could also unconsciously project the negativity and evil onto others, turning him or herself into the victim of seemingly external forces. Unresolved past-life concerns around these issues could also be found within the shadow. A Spirit-Releasement Technique from the Angels There are many ways to accomplish spirit release during a healing session. One of my favorites is a method that was taught to me by the angels. It involves working with Archangel Michael to open a column of light that has both a vacuuming and an infusing effect on the body and energy field. This is a very powerful way to do spirit releasement in that it very thoroughly cleanses the entire energy system and then fills it to saturation with Reiki energy. It is very effective and is like being inside a multidimensional aura wash, with Reiki being the wax that shines you up! As well, the technique can be used at any time when you have a client who is dealing with other types of difficult situations where releasing accumulations of all kinds of negative energies is needed, followed by saturating the energy system with Reiki. In addition, you can use this technique from a distance and for self-healing. You can also use the technique both before and after a session to prepare and clear your own energy field and your healing room. The beauty of this technique is that it addresses several important healing objectives including releasing attached negative energies and entities, cleaning up and repairing the damaged energy system, healing the deeper causes of the client's presenting issues, and bringing as much immediate symptom relief as is possible. The following is a description of benefits the technique creates: Step 1 - Preparing yourself and the healing room by calling in Reiki energies and the angels and ascended masters creates a clear and supportive space wherein the session may take place, and where all present are safe and protected. Step 2 - Doing some preliminary hand positions in key areas helps to relax the client and prepare the energy field for step 3, so that it is open and flowing as much as possible. Step 3 - Opening the column of light with the assistance of Archangel Michael for the vacuuming phase allows for deep cleansing of the many layers of the energy field and body simultaneously, including any areas that require more focused attention. This step also readies the energy system for the repair work of step 4 by cleaning up the places in the energy field where there may be rips or tears, energy blockages, and cords that need to be released. Note that a client will only release what he or she is ready to let go of, so oftentimes more than one session may be necessary for full release to take place. Step 4 - Using the column to infuse Reiki into the client's entire energy system, together with your hand positions, fills in those spaces that have been cleared with healing frequencies. This furthers repair of the energy system, helps with symptom relief, and allows the healing to address the root causes of the client's condition one level at a time, in accordance with the client's readiness. As these issues are addressed, further releases will likely take place, opening the energy system to ever-deeper levels of healing. A series of sessions is often helpful, as generally a client needs to gradually work through these issues. Step 5 - Gratitude and appreciation are natural extensions of the healing that has just taken place. Step 6 - This integration period is very important as it allows the client time to become accustomed to the new frequencies and structure of their energy system. Remember that your client came in one way, and during the session has gone through quite a bit of energetic change in a relatively short period of time. Drinking water helps with hydrating the body and with any detoxification effects of the session (see my article entitled \"Reiki and the Healing Process\" in the Fall 04 edition of this magazine for a full discussion of detoxification effects). The water also acts as a conductor of the enhanced frequencies that are now circulating throughout the energy system. Bathing in the prepared water also facilitates further detoxification and transmuting emotional and mental energies that may be released following the session.
