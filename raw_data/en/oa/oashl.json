But, anti hangover pill only helps with the symptoms. Most prescription anti-hangover pills don't take care of damage that the liver has to endure. So in the following article, we discuss the characteristics of a hangover, hangover prevention, and a special Ayurvedic dual purpose anti-hangover pill. Characteristics of Hangover Feeling of nausea, vomiting, headache, heightened senses, lethargy, dehydration and a sense of heaviness are some of the general characteristics of a hangover. Certain symptoms might vary from person to person. If people have a very low tolerance for alcohol they might also experience diarrheas, fevers and joint pains. The alcohol consumed is generally ethyl alcohol. It is a colorless liquid in its purest form. It tends to dissolve in the bloodstream as soon as it is consumed. It quickly affects the nervous impulses leading to the intoxicated feeling. It is metabolized into Ethan aldehyde which is the actual toxin. Ethanaldehyd not only causes a hangover but also liver damage. Hangover causes severe dehydration. This drains the body of its mineral wealth and its energy source. This causes all the symptoms. So, when a hangover cure is created all these factors have to be considered. The hangover cure should replenish the mineral and energy sources and also take care of the liver. Hangover Treatments Several effective therapies were developed by Ayurvedic medicine a long time ago. The main objective of Ayurved based hangover cures was to: - Cope with the symptoms. Curb the damage done to the liver. Promote de-addiction. And if it is a hangover prevention pill it should act quickly. Some easy steps can act as effective hangover cures Eat before you drink: - Drinking on an empty stomach might cause a quick assimilation of alcohol by the stomach. This could cause a very bad hangover as large amounts of alcohol would be assimilated quickly. Eating something very substantial would prevent this from happening. Re-Hydrate: - Water is one of the best and most accessible hangover cure. Most symptoms of a hangover are caused because of dehydration. So, consumption of water deals with dehydration. It also helps in cleansing the body of toxins. Fruits (the natural anti-hangover pill): - Consumption of citrus fruits can effectively combat the symptoms of a hangover. Consuming a glass of orange or lemon juice replenishes the nutrients that were lost. Bananas are both great electrolyte supplement and incredible energy supplements. Eating a couple of bananas might serve as the perfect hangover cure. Other fruits you could consume include Kiwi. Hearty Breakfast: - A wholesome breakfast consisting of Eggs predominantly with a side of bread could help cure a hangover. Eggs have essential amino acids that help eliminate toxins from the body. Meanwhile, the bread provides the required carbohydrates Shirodhara as a hangover cure: - Shirodhara is an Ayurvedic therapy that involves applying cold packs to the head and the body. This has proven to be a very effective hangover cure.
