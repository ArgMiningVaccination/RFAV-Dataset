All pass holders will also be subjected to the prevailing immigration entry requirements and health protocols in Singapore. - Individuals who have received their vaccination overseas must update their vaccination records in the National Immunisation Registry (NIR). They will be given a grace period of 30 days upon arrival in Singapore, to undergo and show a positive serology test result taken at a Public Health Preparedness Clinic. Should they test negative, they will be required to complete the full vaccination regimen in Singapore or face revocation of their passes. - The vaccination condition will not apply to the following: a. Individuals below 12 years old; b. Individuals aged 12 to below 18 years old - they can continue to make a declaration to complete the full vaccination regimen after arriving in Singapore; c.

If applicants are not registered in the NIR (e.g. unvaccinated or vaccinated overseas but tested serology negative), they will have to complete the full vaccination regimen in Singapore to fulfil the vaccination condition before they can be granted PR or long-term passes. The vaccination condition will not apply to PR, LTVP and STP applicants who are aged below 12 years old, as well as those who are medically ineligible for vaccination. "}
