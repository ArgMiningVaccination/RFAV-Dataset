The first [study](https://aha.mmsend.com/link.cfm?r=XE59Z1k_w0qW2E7h7RLpcA~~&pe=Ggi30cc8SS27Co0nGZa5Z0siw9Eyt6fxwe-EmhRVuzFjN5-YzR8qCZkIF5kwvvG-EURcL2lEVBAqumPll7ClCg~~&t=INSERT_TRACKING_ENCID) evaluates the effectiveness of Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine as a mean for preventing multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, more commonly known as \"MIS-C.\" Researchers found that the Pfizer vaccine, when used for individuals between the ages of 12 and 18, was 91% effective in preventing MIS-C, which is observed to occur two to six weeks after SARS-CoV-2 infection and can be fatal in some cases. According to the study, among critically ill MIS-C case-patients who required life support, all were unvaccinated. A second [study](https://aha.mmsend.com/link.cfm?r=XE59Z1k_w0qW2E7h7RLpcA~~&pe=0CIrOHFnKWkotfuJrj_P-Pxhy10Hf2VWhYEP_RpfK0-xG9vGo4Od94p5Ds-xm-zrujAaKWsEHnh6uK4qgYoeTQ~~&t=INSERT_TRACKING_ENCID) suggests an increased risk of children developing diabetes following a COVID-19 infection. Researchers after reviewing data from the IQVIA and HealthVerity databases found that patients under the age of 18 were more likely to receive new diabetes diagnoses, beginning 31 days following a COVID-19 infection. The researchers said these findings are consistent with previous research demonstrating an association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and diabetes in adults. "}
