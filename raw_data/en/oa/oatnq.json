Over the past few months, we have implemented many changes to our website, as well as to our building and services offered. We invite you to explore our site and visit our center to become educated on all of the many ways you can experience optimal health. In honor of Autism Awareness Month, we encourage you to also become educated on Autism and how it effects children and their families. According to statistics by the Center for Disease Control, Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) now affect one in every 110 children in the United States. ASDs are a group of developmental disabilities characterized by atypical development in socialization, communication, and behavior. The symptoms of ASDs are often accompanied by abnormalities in cognitive functioning, learning, attention, and sensory processing Autism is not a cut-and-dry issue; like the disorder itself, it brings with it questions, uncertainty and challenges the supposed facts. We cannot rely on mainstream media and the traditional medical community only, because very simply, they are not necessarily the ones eating, sleeping and breathing autism. Rather, it is the parents, families, friends and teachers who can offer just as much insight into this rapidly increasing epidemic. There are an increasing number of professionals, as well as parents of children with Autism, who believe that RECOVERY from AUTISM is POSSIBLE. These individuals are determined to help those challenged by Autism heal by embracing a path to wellness that includes a comprehensive alternative therapy program. Children especially are making great progress with this approach but the parents of these children are struggling - not as much with their holistic choices as with those opposing forces - i.e. family, friends and the conventional medical community - who challenge such \"alternative\" care as a means for recovery. It is up to us to support families and children with Autism. The Northport Wellness Center staff is passionate about supporting adults and children of all ages in achieving their wellness goals, including families and children with Autism. This month, we respectfully request your support too, in helping these individuals, by respecting their journeys and getting the word out there that \"life and healing come from within; and ultimately the promotion and maintenance of health is superior to the treatment of disease.\" Together, we can promote wellness and support the autism community. Yours in Good Health, [Dr. Alan P. Sherr](http://www.northportwellnesscenter.com/chiropractic) Founder, Director Northport Wellness Center | | Understanding Parents of Children with Autism For most parents of children with autism, discovering their child has the disorder is an overwhelmingly traumatic experience. We can support parents of children with autism by understanding as much as we can about autism and how it affects children and their families. Keep in mind that our reactions to them set examples of tolerance, respect and compassion for our own children.
