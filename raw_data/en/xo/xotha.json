Only 24 hours after, Dr June Raine, Chief Executive of MHRA, issued updated guidance to COVID -19 vaccination centers about the management of anaphylaxis, following two reports of anaphylaxis and one report of a possible allergic reaction following immunization. The guidelines say verbatim \"Any person with a history of anaphylaxis to a vaccine, medicine or food should not receive the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. A second dose should not be given to anyone who has exper i- enced anaphylaxis following administr ation of the first dose of this vaccine.\" [1]. This letter has been generated as a response to the great amazement induced by the first part of this sentence in the Spanish allergists community. The mRNA vaccines are experiencing a burst in basic and clinical research. Whereas the majority of early work in mRNA vaccines was focused on cancer applications. In the same way a number of recent reports have demonstrated the potency and versatility of mRNA to protect against a wide variety of infectious pathogens, including parasites and finally the one that concerns us coronavirus 2 (SARS -CoV -2) [2-4]. These mRNA vaccines are safety because mRNA is a non-infectious, non-integrating platform and therefor e, there is no potential risk of infection or insertional mutagenesis. The various modific a- tions make mRNA more stable and highly translatable for rapid, inexpensive, and scalable manufacturing, mainly owing to the high yields of in vitro transcription reactions [2]. The COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 manufacture by Pfizer/BioNTech, is highly purified single -stranded, 5'-capped messenger RNA (mRNA) produced by cell-free in vitro transcription from the correspondin g DNA templates, encoding the viral spike (S) protein of SARS -CoV -2. As excipients this vaccine contains polyethylene glycol/macrogol (PEG) as part of ALC -0159. This vaccine use fat bubbles called lipid nanoparticles to deliver messenger RNA (mRNA) to cells. Once there, the mRNA directs cells to produce the virus spike protein provoking an immune response to that foreign protein [3]. This same technology is used in mRNA -1273 vaccine, manufactured by Moderna , as -lipid\" [4]. PEG is a polyether compound that is widely used as an additive in pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and food because of its stabilizing properties [7]. Anaphylactic reactions to PEG are rarely reported. It is more frequ ently the incidence of contact sensitivity to PEG [8]. Both COVID -19 mRNA Vaccines, BNT162b2 vaccine manufactured by Pfizer/BioNTech and mRNA -1273 vaccine manufactured by Moderna, have been reported to be safe in clinical trials. The most common reported adverse reactions (AR) were injection site reactions, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, chills, joint pain and fever. Severe adverse reactions were more frequent after Dose 2 than after Dose 1, in similar proportions in both vaccines. There is a third vaccin e that uses mRNA, CureVac, it has taken a slightly different approach, choosing to use the potency of untranslated re- gions to optimize the RNA rather than make chemical modifications. CureVac is on track to initiate phase 3 testing of its COVID -19 vaccine by the end of this year [9]. A list of potential allergens in currently available vaccines is maintained on the Institute for Vaccine Safety Web site, and listed in recently published reviews , too, [4, 8, 10, 11]. The of the SARS -CoV2, BNT162b2 vaccine should not be generalized to all patients who had suffered severe reactions to drugs and/or foods. The adverse effects that occurred these English patients after the administrati on of the vaccine must be studied in greater depth. The immunization is highly effective in preventing infectious diseases. Allergic patients deserve access to the same publicly recommended immunizations as nonallergic patients unless risks asso- ciated with vaccination outweigh the gains. Whereas the number of reported possible AR to vac- cines is high, confirmed vaccinetriggered allergic reactions are rare [12]. The BNT162b2 vaccine, Pfizer/BioNTech, has the same contraindications as any other vaccine, with regards allergic patients. That is, its use is not recommended in patients who had suffered pre- vious allergic reactions to its components. Only patients with documented history of allergy to PEG, Tween 80 or previous reaction to vaccines that may contain them, should avoid these Pfizer /BioNTech -Moderna vaccines against COVID -19 if we take into account the contraindic a- tions from the strictly allergic point of view. The adverse events related to the BNT162b2 vaccine are explained in the drug data sheet. The number of subjects reporting hypersensitivity -related adverse events was numerically higher in the vaccine group compared with the placebo group (137 [0.63%] vs. 111 [0.51%]), but the overall risk is relatively low [11]. It is mandatory carrying out an allergy study in subjects who refer allergic reactions to SARS -CoV2 vaccines, in order to identify the culprit substance. It is not necessary car- rying out a systematic preventive study of allergy, previous to the administration of the vaccine to all indiv iduals who had suffered severe allergic reactions to drugs and/or foods. Data related to risk in individuals with a history of allergic reactions to previous vaccinations is very limited and evolving. A decision to receive the Pfizer -BioNTech COVID -19 vaccine should be undertaken by the patient with his physician using their professional judgment balancing the bene- fits and risks associated with taking the vaccine. 5 -19, and Moderna vaccine are not live virus vaccines and therefore, it can be administered to immunocompromised patients. It does not know at this time if people with a weakened immune system will respond to the vaccine and be protected from COVID -19 [13]. Table 1 summarizes the management of COVID -19 vaccination for allergic patients, as suggested by SEAIC recommendations here presented. These recommendations are based on the best knowledge to date and follow CDC guidelines for allergic patients vaccination [14]. On the same day that the cases of anaphylactic reactions to the Pfizer /BioNTech COVID -19 vaccine were reported , SEAIC released an official statement. The purpose of this letter is to make available to the entire scientific community these recommendations in order of carrying out the vaccination in the safest way possi- ble in allergic patients.
