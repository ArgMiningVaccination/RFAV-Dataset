A public water supplier means any person who owns or operates 1 or more public water systems. A public water system means a water supply system for the provision to the public of water for human consumption through pipes or other constructed conveyances either directly from the user's free-flowing outlet or indirectly by the water being used to manufacture ice, foods and beverages or that supplies water for potable or domestic purposes to employees, tenants, members, guests or the public at large in commercial offices, industrial areas, multiple dwellings or semi-public buildings including, but without limitation, rooming and boarding houses, motels, tourist cabins, mobile home parks, restaurants, hospitals and other institutions, or offers any water for sale for potable domestic purposes.

Such standards shall be at least as stringent as those adopted by the United States Environmental Protection Agency under the Safe Drinking Water Act [42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300f et seq.]. A certificate of noncompliance shall be issued to any public water supplier that serves more than 500 service connections whose public water system violates secondary drinking water quality standards as adopted by the Department. Such certificate shall require the public water supplier to report within 60 days what measures have been or will be taken to bring the public water system into compliance. Should any public water supplier serving more than 500 service connections within the State fail, without good cause, to meet secondary drinking water quality standards pursuant to this section for a period of time greater than 7 consecutive days, or should the public water supplier have a history of a recurring problem, the Secretary shall file a report with the Public Service Commission detailing such failure or such a history of a recurring problem. The Public Service Commission may utilize the report as cause to review the public water supplier's ability to provide adequate service under its present certificate of public convenience and necessity and may also use such report as a factor in considering any application by the water system supplier's for any further certificate. In addition, for public water systems operated by public utilities which are subject to the jurisdiction of the Public Service Commission under \u00a7 203C of Title 26, the Commission may utilize such report as cause to review the appropriate rates to be charged by the utility in light of the quality of service being provided. 3.

This includes the ability to identify applicants or regulated parties with histories of environmental violations or criminal activities and/or associations; or applicants who cannot demonstrate the required responsibility, expertise or competence which is necessary for the proper operation or activity permitted by the Department. 4. Whoever refuses, fails or neglects to perform the duties required of public water suppliers under paragraph (3)c. of this section; or who violates, neglects or fails to comply with duly adopted regulations or orders of the Department of Health and Social Services regarding the duties of public water suppliers, shall be subject to a judicially imposed penalty of up to $10,000 per day, together with costs, for every day from and after the effective date of an order of the Department of Health and Social Services, specifically directing compliance until such compliance has been achieved.

The Department of Health and Social Services may investigate the financial operations of a public water supplier to the extent necessary to enter an adequate compliance order. 5. In lieu of judicially imposed penalties, the Secretary may impose administrative penalty upon any public water supplier who refuses, fails or neglects to perform the duties required of it under paragraph (3)c. of this section. The administrative penalty shall be as follows: A. For a system serving a population of more than 10,000 people the administrative penalty shall be not less than $1,000 nor more than $10,000 per day per violation; and B. For any other system, the administrative penalty shall be not less than $100 nor more than $10,000 per day per violation. Assessment of an administrative penalty shall be determined by the nature, circumstances, extent and gravity of the violation, or violations, ability of the violator to pay, any prior history of such violations, the degree of culpability, economic benefit or savings (if any) resulting from the violation and such other matters as justice may require.Title 16 - Health and Safety Page 5In the event of nonpayment of the administrative penalty after all legal appeals have been exhausted, a civil action may be brought by the Secretary in any court of competent jurisdiction, including any Justice of the Peace Court, for collection of the administrative penalty, including interest, attorneys' fees and costs, and the validity, amount and appropriateness of such administrative penalty shall not be subject to review. 6.

Laws, c. 389, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 802A. Legislative findings and purpose. The General Assembly hereby finds and declares that: (1) Significant hearing loss is 1 of the most common major abnormalities present at birth and, if undetected, will impede the child's speech, language, and cognitive development. (2) Screening by high-risk characteristics alone (e.g., family history of deafness) only identifies approximately 50% of newborns with significant hearing loss. (3) Reliance solely on physician and/or parental observation fails to identify many cases of significant hearing loss in newborns and infants. (4) There is evidence that children with hearing loss, who are identified at birth and receive intervention services shortly thereafter, have significantly better learning capacity than children who are identified with hearing loss later than 6 months after birth. (5) Legislation is needed to provide for the early detection of hearing loss in newborns and infants and to prevent or mitigate the developmental delays associated with late identification of hearing loss. (75 Del. Laws, c. 116, \u00a7 1; 78 Del. Laws, c. 389, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 803A. Definitions. For the purposes of this chapter: (1) \"Child\" means a person up to 21 years of age.

(3) \"False negative rate\" means the proportion of infants not identified as having a significant hearing loss by the screening process who are ultimately found to have a significant hearing loss. (4) \"False positive rate\" means the proportion of infants identified as having a significant hearing loss by the screening process who are ultimately found to not have a significant hearing loss. (5) \"Family\" or \"families\" means a birth parent(s), stepparent(s), adoptive parent(s), legal guardian(s), or other legal custodian of a newborn, infant, or child. (6) \"Family-centered\" means the beliefs, values, and practices that emphasize the essential role of the family in all aspects of the decision-making and intervention process regarding the young child. (7) \"Health-care insurer\" means any entity regulated by the Insurance Commissioner, including, but not limited to, health-care insurers; health, hospital or medical service plan corporations; or health maintenance organizations. Health-care insurer does not include self-insured plans or groups regulated by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 et seq.), to the extent that state regulation of such plans is preempted by ERISA. (8) \"Health insurance policy\" means any health insurance policy, contract, plan, or evidence of coverage issued by a health-care insurer, which provides medical coverage on an expense incurred, service or prepaid basis. (9) \"Hearing screening test\" means automated auditory brain stem response, otoacoustic emissions, or another appropriate screening test approved by the Department of Health and Social Services.

(c) Temporary emergency protective custody for purposes of this section may not exceed 4 hours and must cease upon the Department's response pursuant to subsection (b) of this section.Title 16 - Health and Safety Page 77(d) For the purposes of this section, \"temporary emergency protective custody\" means temporary placement within a hospital, medical facility, or such other suitable placement; provided, however, that an abused or neglected child may not be detained in temporary custody in a secure detention facility. (e) A Department investigator conducting an investigation pursuant to \u00a7 906 of this title has the same authority as that granted to a police officer, nurse practitioner, or physician in subsection (a) of this section, subject to all the same conditions as those listed in subsections (a) through (d) of this section, provided that the child in question is located at a school, day care facility, or child care facility at the time that the authority is initially exercised. In no other case may an employee of the Department exercise custody under this section. (71 Del. Laws, c. 199, \u00a7 5; 70 Del. Laws, c. 186, \u00a7 1; 72 Del. Laws, c. 173, \u00a7 7; 81 Del. Laws, c. 144, \u00a7 7; 83 Del. Laws, c. 228, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 907A. Safe Arms for Babies. (a) The General Assembly finds and declares all of the following: (1) The abandonment of a baby is an irresponsible act by a parent and places the baby at risk of injury or death from exposure, actions by other individuals, and harm from animals. (2) Delivering a live baby to a safe place is far preferable to a baby being killed or abandoned by a parent. (3) The purpose of this section is not to circumvent the responsible action of a parent who adheres to the process of placing a baby for adoption, but to prevent the unnecessary risk of harm to or death of that baby by a desperate parent who would otherwise abandon or cause the death of that baby. (4) Medical information about the baby and the baby's parents is critical for the adoptive parents and every effort should be made, without risking the safe placement of the baby, to obtain that medical information and provide counseling information to the parents. (5) If this section does not result in the safe placement of babies or is abused by a parent attempting to circumvent the process of adoption, it should be repealed. (b) If a baby is surrendered alive and unharmed, an individual may voluntarily surrender the baby directly to an employee or volunteer of 1 of the following designated safe havens: (1) An emergency department of a hospital, inside the emergency department. (2) A police station, inside the police station. For the purposes of this paragraph (b)(2), \"police station\" does not include a Delaware State Police station. (c) (1) A safe haven under subsection (b) of this section may take temporary emergency protective custody of a baby who is surrendered under this section. (2) Except as otherwise required under paragraph (c)(4) of this section, a safe haven under subsection (b) of this section may not ask or require an individual who surrenders the baby to provide any information pertaining to the individual's identity. (3) If the identity of the individual is known to the safe haven under subsection (b) of this section, the safe haven shall keep the identity confidential. (4) A safe haven under subsection (b) of this section shall do 1 of the following: a. Make reasonable efforts to directly obtain pertinent medical history information pertaining to the baby and the baby's family. b. Attempt to provide the individual with a postage paid medical history information questionnaire. (d) A safe haven under subsection (b) of this section shall attempt to provide the following to an individual surrendering a baby at the safe haven: (1) Information about the Safe Arms Program. (2) Information about adoption and counseling services, including information that confidential adoption services are available and information about the benefits of engaging in a regular, voluntary adoption process. (3) Brochures with telephone numbers and websites for public or private agencies that provide counseling or adoption services. (e) A safe haven under subsection (b) of this section shall attempt to provide an individual surrendering a baby with the number of the baby's identification bracelet to aid in linking the individual to the baby at a later date, if reunification is sought. The identification number is an identification aid only and does not permit the individual possessing the identification number to take custody of the baby on demand. (f) If an individual possesses an identification number linking the individual to a baby surrendered at a safe haven under subsection (b) of this section and parental rights have not already been terminated, possession of the identification number creates a presumption that the individual has standing to participate in an action. Possession of the identification number does not create a presumption of maternity, paternity, or custody. (g) (1) A safe haven under subsection (b) of this section that takes a baby into temporary emergency protective custody under this section shall immediately notify the Department and the State Police of the safe haven's actions. (2) The Department shall obtain ex parte custody and physically appear at the safe haven under subsection (b) of this section within 4 hours of notification under this subsection unless there are exigent circumstances. (3) Immediately after being notified of the surrender, the State Police shall submit an inquiry to the Missing Children Information Clearinghouse established under subchapter III of Chapter 85 of Title 11.Title 16 - Health and Safety Page 78(h) The Department shall notify the public that a baby has been abandoned and taken into temporary emergency protective custody by placing notice prominently on the Division's website and publishing notice to that effect in a newspaper of statewide circulation. (1) The notice must be published at least 3 times over a 3-week period immediately following the surrender of the baby unless the Department has relinquished custody. (2) The notice, at a minimum, must contain the place, date, and time where the baby was surrendered; the baby's sex, race, approximate age, identifying marks, and any other information the Department deems necessary for the baby's identification. (3) The notice must include a statement that unless the surrendering individual manifests an intent to exercise parental rights and responsibilities within 30 days of the abandonment, both of the following apply: a. The abandonment of the baby is the surrendering individual's irrevocable consent to the termination of all parental rights, if any, of the individual on the ground of abandonment. b. The abandonment of the baby is the surrendering individual's irrevocable waiver of any right to notice of or opportunity to participate in any termination of parental rights proceeding involving the baby. (i) When an individual who surrenders a baby under this section manifests a desire to remain anonymous, the Department may not initiate or conduct an investigation to determine the identity of the individual, and a court may not order an investigation unless there is good cause to suspect child abuse or neglect other than the act of surrendering the baby. (j) The Department of Health and Social Services shall do all of the following: (1) Establish a public information program to promote safe placement alternatives for babies, the confidentiality offered to birth parents, and information regarding adoption procedures. This program must include the use of a 24-hour, toll free hotline to assist in making information about the intent, purposes, and operation of this section as widely available as possible. (2) Adopt a handout to be distributed to a safe haven under subsection (b) of this section. The handout must be furnished to an individual who surrenders the care or custody of a baby to the safe haven. The handout must advise the individual of the availability of counseling services and must elicit from the individual via a postage prepaid questionnaire relevant health history of the baby and the baby's parents. (3) Provide a safe haven under subsection (b) of this section with information about relevant social service agencies to be made available to an individual who voluntarily surrenders a baby under this section.

Immunity from liability, and special reimbursement to safe havens for expenses related to certain babies. (a) Any person, including an agency, organization, or entity, participating in good faith in the making of a report or notifying police officers pursuant to this chapter; assisting in a multidisciplinary case as required by \u00a7 906(b)(4) of this title; performing a medical examination without the consent of those responsible for the care, custody, and control of a child under \u00a7 906(e) of this title; or exercising emergency protective custody in compliance with \u00a7 907 of this title is immune from any liability, civil or criminal, that might otherwise exist, and such immunity extends to participation in any judicial proceeding resulting from the above actions taken in good faith. This section does not limit the liability of any health-care provider for personal injury claims due to medical negligence that occurs as a result of any examination performed pursuant to this chapter. (b) (1) Except for negligence or intentional acts, a safe haven under \u00a7 907A(b) of this title that, or an employee or volunteer of the safe haven who, accepts temporary emergency protective custody of a baby under \u00a7 907A of this title is absolutely immune from civil and administrative liability for any act of commission or omission in connection with the acceptance of that temporary emergency protective custody or the provision of care for the baby while the baby is in the safe haven's temporary emergency protective custody. (2) If a safe haven under \u00a7 907A(b) of this title accepts temporary emergency protective custody of a baby under \u00a7 907A of this title, the State shall reimburse the safe haven for eligible, medically necessary costs under the Medicaid Fee for Service Program.

Laws, c. 448, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 909. Privileged communication not recognized. (a) No legally recognized privilege, except that between attorney and client and that between priest and penitent in a sacramental confession, applies to situations involving known or suspected child abuse, neglect, exploitation, or abandonment and does not constitute grounds for failure to report as required by \u00a7 903 of this title or to give or accept evidence in any judicial proceeding relating to child abuse or neglect.

(a) Whenever an investigation has been opened with the Department pursuant to \u00a7 906 of this title for potential abuse or neglect of a child, the Department shall have the authority to petition for an order from the Family Court: (1) To obtain access to the child, or children, and the residence of child, or children; or (2) To compel the appearance of a person at an office of the Department in furtherance of the investigation; or (3) To compel compliance with a treatment plan previously agreed to by a child's parent or guardian, if noncompliance with the plan endangers a child's safety; or (4) To compel completion of a substance abuse or mental health evaluation by the parent or guardian or completion of a developmental health screening for the child or children. (b) The Family Court shall issue such an order upon the Department establishing by a preponderance of evidence that it provided written notice of its intent to file the petition and: (1) For petitions requesting relief under paragraph (a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(3) of this section: a. That the Department has in good faith attempted on at least 2 separate prior occasions, at least 1 of which was by written communication sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, to contact the person in question without success; or b. That a child is in actual danger or there is an imminent risk of danger due to the Department's inability to communicate with the person or see the child or the child's residence; (2) For petitions requesting relief under paragraph (a)(4) of this section, the investigation has revealed that substance abuse, mental health conditions, or developmental delays may be factors placing the child at risk of abuse or neglect. (c) The Family Court shall enforce noncompliance with such an order pursuant to \u00a7 925(3) of Title 10. (d) Petitions filed pursuant to this section may be granted on an ex parte basis if a child is at risk of imminent physical danger, provided that the Family Court shall consider all requests pursuant to paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(2) and (a)(3) of this section within 2 business days of the request being made.

Laws, c. 412, \u00a7 7; 79 Del. Laws, c. 314, \u00a7 1; 83 Del. Laws, c. 228, \u00a7 1.)Title 16 - Health and Safety Page 84\u00a7 927. Automatic stay of substantiation proceedings.

(c) Upon conclusion of a criminal or delinquency proceeding involving the same allegations or facts as those alleged in the incident of abuse or neglect, if the accused is acquitted of the charge or the charge is dismissed and the Department intends to pursue substantiation, the acquittal or dismissal does not automatically work as issue or claim preclusion against a civil finding of abuse or neglect, nor does it prevent the taking of evidence, notwithstanding any other law to the contrary. (73 Del. Laws, c. 412, \u00a7 7; 79 Del. Laws, c. 314, \u00a7 1; 83 Del. Laws, c. 228, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 928. Persons entered on the Registry between August 1, 1994, and February 1, 2003.

(b) A person who has been entered on the Child Protection Registry for the time prescribed in the designated Child Protection Level for the person's incident of abuse or neglect must be automatically removed from the Child Protection Registry, provided that the person has not been substantiated for an incident of abuse or neglect while on the Child Protection Registry.

(b) A person who has been entered on the Child Protection Registry at Child Protection Level II or Level III may file a Petition for Removal in the Family Court prior to the expiration of the time designated for the level.

The term \"exigent circumstances\" means a short-term emergency or other unavoidable situation, and all reasonable alternatives to the use of a temporary employee as a nursing supervisor have been exhausted. Within 24 hours of the exigent circumstances that require the use of temporary employment agency staffing to fill a nursing supervisor position in a residential health facility, the facility shall notify the Division in writing of the exigent circumstances and the expected duration. For any shift that exceeds the minimum RN/LPN shift ratio mandated by \u00a7 1162 of this title, the amount of RN time that exceeds the minimum ratio may be counted towards the minimum 25 percent supervision required for that shift; provided, however, that said RN time was dedicated to supervisory functions. For those facilities that are not required by state or federal regulations to have a registered nurse on duty on each shift, a licensed practical nurse with 3 years long-term care experience may serve as a nursing supervisor, provided that no registered nurse is on duty. There shall be a nursing supervisor on duty and on-site at all times. By June 1, 2002, the Nursing Home Residents Quality Assurance Commission shall issue to the Governor and to the General Assembly a report evaluating the requirement that nursing supervisors spend a minimum of 25 percent of their time on supervisory functions. The purpose of the report is to determine if the required minimum amount of supervision time is appropriate and necessary, and whether it should be adjusted. (g) \"Residential health facility\" shall mean any facility that provides long-term health-related care and nursing services to individuals who do not require the degree of care and treatment that a hospital is designed to provide. These are those facilities, licensed pursuant to this chapter, that: (1) Provide skilled nursing services to persons who require medical or nursing care; or (2) Provide nursing services above the level of room and board to those who, because of a mental or physical condition, routinely require these services. Also included are units, licensed pursuant to this chapter, of facilities that provide active treatment and health and rehabilitation services to persons with mental retardation or related conditions, in which care is delivered to residents in accordance with medical plans of care. This definition does not include group homes for the mentally ill, mentally retarded or persons with AIDS, rest family care homes, neighborhood homes, rest/residential health facilities, assisted living facilities and intermediate care facilities that, as of March 1, 1999, were solely private pay, provided they remain exclusively intermediate care facilities.

Every residential health facility employee shall wear a nametag prominently displaying his or her full name and title. Personnel hired through temporary agencies shall be required to wear photo identification listing their names and titles. (b) By March 1, 2001, the minimum staffing level for nursing services direct caregivers shall not be less than the staffing level required to provide 3.0 hours of direct care per resident per day, provided that funds have been appropriated for 3.0 hours of direct care per resident for Medicaid eligible reimbursement. Nursing staff, rounded to the nearest whole person, must be distributed in order to meet the following minimum shift ratios: RN/LPN CNA (or RN/LPN or NAIT 1:9 Evening 1:25 1:10 Night 1:40 1:22 (c) On or before December 1, 2001, a comprehensive report assessing and reviewing the quality of nursing facility care in Delaware shall be completed by the Delaware Nursing Home Residents Quality Assurance Commission and submitted to the Governor and the General Assembly. The purpose of the report is to determine the efficacy of the minimum staffing levels required under this chapter, including, but not limited to, the availability of qualified personnel in the job market to meet the requirement, the cost and availability of nursing home care, and patient outcomes based on scheduled facility surveys, surprise inspections and other reviews conducted by the Division. Based on this information, the Commission will determine if increasing the minimum nurse staffing levels to 3.28 hours of direct care with the corresponding increased required shift ratios is appropriate and necessary. By January 1, 2002, the minimum staffing level for nursing services direct caregivers shall not be less than the staffing level required to provide 3.28 hours of direct care per resident per day, subject to Commission recommendation and provided that funds have been appropriated for 3.28 hours of direct care per resident for Medicaid eligible reimbursement.

All nursing facilities shall conspicuously display the minimum shift ratios governing the nursing facility, along with posting requirements pursuant to subsection (a) of this section. Notwithstanding subsection (g) of this section, the time period for review and compliance with any alternative minimum shift ratios or ratios pursuant to a special waiver under this subsection shall be 1 day. (d) Within 6 months of an appropriation by the General Assembly funding the staffing requirements of subsection (e) of this section, a comprehensive report assessing and reviewing the quality of nursing facility care in Delaware shall be completed by the Delaware Nursing Home Residents Quality Assurance Commission and submitted to the Governor and the General Assembly. The purpose of the report is to determine the efficacy of the minimum staffing levels required under this chapter, including, but not limited to, the availability of qualified personnel in job market to meet the requirement, the cost and availability of nursing home care, and patient outcomes based on scheduled facility surveys, surprise inspections and other reviews conducted by the Division. Based on this information, the CommissionTitle 16 - Health and Safety Page 126will determine if increasing the minimum nurse staffing levels to 3.67 hours of direct care with the corresponding increased required shift ratios is appropriate and necessary. (e) By May 1, 2003, the minimum staffing level for nursing services direct caregivers shall not be less than the staffing level required to provide 3.67 hours of direct care per resident per day, subject to Commission recommendation and provided that funds have been appropriated for 3.67 hours of direct care per resident for Medicaid eligible reimbursement.

The individual shall be referred to as a nursing assistant in training (NAIT). The Division shall conduct a study of the certified nursing assistant training programs in Delaware, both those sponsored by facilities and those sponsored by educational institutions. It shall report its findings to the Nursing Home Quality Residents Assurance Commission (Commission). The factors to be studied include, but are not limited to, the percentage of each training program's graduates who passed the certified nursing assistant certification test and the number of attempts it took each graduate to become certified, along with the total number of hours, divided by classroom and clinical time, spent in the overall certified nursing assistant training program. The study shall encompass a period of 6 months commencing with the promulgation of the certified nursing assistant regulations. The report shall be issued no later than 2 months after the completion of the study period. Based on the results of its study, the Division shall recommend to the Commission whether a nursing assistant, while in training and prior to certification, should be counted as a CNA in the minimum staffing ratios, and, if so, at what point in the training program. (g) The time period for review and determining compliance with the staffing ratios required under this chapter shall be 1 week. To the extent a residential health facility subject to the required ratios of this chapter desires an alternative shift schedule, they shall notify the Division of such alternative shift schedule prior to implementation; the proposed shift schedule and corresponding staff ratios must meet the minimum hour requirements and must not exceed the patient to staff ratios provided under this chapter for the night shift. Any alternative shift schedule must be clearly posted along with the postings required pursuant to subsection (a) of this section. (h) Notwithstanding the minimum staffing requirements established in this subchapter, to the extent additional staffing is necessary to meet the needs of residents, nursing facilities must provide sufficient nursing staffing. If the Division finds unsatisfactory outcomes in a facility, the Department may impose protocols for staffing adequacy, including but not limited to staffing levels above the minimum required under this subchapter.

(2) Such resolution or trust agreement may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustees in the case of a trust agreement and may restrict the individual right of action by bondholders as is customary in trust agreements or trust indentures securing bonds or debentures of corporations. (3) In addition to the foregoing, such resolution or trust agreement may contain such other provisions as the authority may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders. (c) Except as is in this chapter otherwise provided, the authority may provide for the payment of the proceeds of the sale of the bonds and its revenues to such officer, board or depositary as it may designate for the custody thereof and for the method of disbursement thereof, with such safeguards and restrictions as it may determine.

(73 Del. Laws, c. 358, \u00a7 2.) \u00a7 2208. Licensing of treatment facility; regulations. (a) The Secretary, upon recommendation from the Division, shall approve the licensure of entities applying to be substance abuse treatment facilities and may designate certain facilities for treatment of individuals on an involuntary basis. Additionally, the Secretary may restrict, condition, limit and/or set the term of the license of a treatment facility as may be reasonable or prudent. In the case of treatment facilities for minors, the Secretary of the Department of Services for Children, Youth and Their Families, or the Secretary's designee, may designate certain facilities for the treatment of minors on a voluntary or involuntary basis.Title 16 - Health and Safety Page 169(b) The Secretary is authorized to promulgate regulations for licensing and develop standards for the proper operation of treatment facilities and conduct of any hearing that may be required so as to implement this chapter.

(b) In addition to any other remedy, the Secretary, through the Attorney General, may commence proceedings in the Chancery Court of the State to enjoin any violation of this chapter and may, in the case of a wilful and wanton violation, be awarded the costs of prosecution, including a reasonable amount for attorney fees, if the Secretary prevails. (73 Del. Laws, c. 358, \u00a7 2.) \u00a7 2210. Voluntary treatment for substance abuse. (a) A person in need of treatment or anyone engaging in substance abuse may request voluntary treatment from a licensed treatment facility. If the applicant is a person who is incompetent or a minor under 14 years of age, a parent, legal custodian, relative caregiver or legal guardian shall make the request for voluntary treatment and give written consent for treatment. (b) If a minor is 14 years of age or over, then either the minor, or a parent, legal custodian, relative caregiver or legal guardian may give written consent to a treatment facility for voluntary treatment for nonresidential treatment. In the case of residential treatment, consent to treatment shall be given only by a parent, custodian, relative caregiver or legal guardian. Consent so given by a minor 14 years of age or over shall, notwithstanding the minor's minority, be valid and fully effective for all purposes regardless of whether such minor's substance abuse is subsequently medically confirmed and shall be binding upon such minor, the minor's parents, custodian, relative caregiver and legal guardian as effectively as if the minor were of full legal age at the time of giving such written consent. Consent so given shall not be subject to later denial or disclaimer, and the consent of no other person or court shall be necessary for the treatment rendered such minor. (c) Subject to regulations adopted by the Secretary, or in the case of a treatment program for minors, the Secretary of the Department of Services for Children, Youth and Their Families, an administrator of a treatment facility may determine who shall be admitted for treatment. If a person is refused admission to a facility, the Division, subject to the rules adopted by the Secretary, shall refer the person to another facility for treatment if available and appropriate. (d) If a voluntary patient requests or attempts to leave a treatment facility against the advice of the treatment team and administrator of the facility, the facility may initiate involuntary treatment procedures as provided for under this chapter. If the patient is a minor or is incompetent, the request for discharge against advice shall be made by a parent, custodian, relative caregiver, legal guardian or other appropriate legal representative, and the provisions of this subsection shall apply as if the patient had made the request. (73 Del. Laws, c. 358, \u00a7 2; 78 Del. Laws, c. 179, \u00a7 166.) \u00a7 2211. Involuntary treatment. (a) A person in need of treatment shall be involuntarily admitted to a licensed residential treatment facility or outpatient treatment program upon a written request for involuntary treatment that provides a factual basis for the request by anyone with knowledge that an individual may be a person in need of treatment and the written certification by a physician that the individual is a person in need of treatment as provided for in this chapter. The request for involuntary treatment shall concisely provide the observations, circumstances and knowledge of the requestor regarding the requestor's belief that a particular individual is in need of treatment. The request shall also contain the written certificate of a physician stating that the physician has reviewed the request and examined the patient and concluded that in the physician's medical opinion the particular individual is a person in need of treatment and is either incapable of or unwilling to consent to treatment. If the individual is incapable of consenting to treatment, the certificate shall state with particularity the physician's findings regarding why the individual is incapable of providing voluntary informed consent to treatment. The refusal to undergo treatment does not in itself constitute evidence of lack of judgment as to the need for treatment. (b) Any peace officer or designated transport personnel may lawfully transport an individual whom they reasonably believe is a person in need of treatment without the consent of said individual, to or from a hospital, physician's office or licensed treatment facility for the purpose of carrying out this section.Title 16 - Health and Safety Page 170(c) Upon admission of the person in need of treatment, the facility shall evaluate and treat the individual as medically necessary and appropriate for a period not to exceed 2 working days. (d) The State Treasurer shall pay sheriffs and deputy sheriffs for service as peace officers under this section at the rate of the state's mileage reimbursement amount for each mile necessarily traveled and a custody fee of $25 for the first peace officer and $15 for each additional peace officer, and shall pay medical doctors for services under this section $15 for each case, unless the medical doctor is reimbursed under another public or private plan. (e) The administrator in charge of a licensed treatment facility shall refuse an application if the request for treatment or physician's certificate fails to meet the requirements of this section. (73 Del. Laws, c. 358, \u00a7 2; 70 Del. Laws, c. 186, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 2212. Commitment; judicial proceedings. (a) Not more than 2 working days after the date a patient is admitted to a licensed treatment facility or program under a request for involuntary treatment, the administrator of the treatment facility, through the Attorney General, shall file a petition for involuntary commitment to a licensed treatment facility, supported by affidavit with the Court, unless the patient is discharged or admitted on a voluntary basis. The petition shall state that the administrator, as petitioner, based upon an evaluation by a physician, reasonably and in good faith believes that the involuntary patient (who shall be named as respondent) is a person in need of treatment who should be continued as a patient at the facility pursuant to this chapter until the patient is determined no longer to be in need of treatment at the treatment facility or program. The petition shall also state that the involuntary patient has been advised of the patient's procedural and substantive rights under this chapter. A copy of supporting certificates by an examining physician shall be attached to the petition. (b) Upon the filing of a petition, the facility may continue to treat the patient as medically necessary and appropriate on an involuntary basis pending a judicial hearing on the petition. (c) The petition shall indicate the facility's reasonable belief, based upon investigation, as to whether the involuntary patient is able to afford counsel and an independent expert witness. (73 Del. Laws, c. 358, \u00a7 2.) \u00a7 2213. Limitation on involuntary treatment. Subject to Chapters 50 and 51 of this title, no person shall be involuntarily admitted or committed to or confined as a patient at a residential treatment facility, and such facilities, other than general hospitals, shall not admit or confine as an involuntary patient any person, unless: (1) Such person is determined to be a person in need of treatment in accordance with the procedures of this chapter; and (2) Said treatment facility has been specifically designated as an appropriate facility for the treatment of involuntary adult patients by the Secretary of Health and Social Services and by the Department of Services for Children, Youth and Their Families for the treatment of involuntary minor patients. (73 Del. Laws, c. 358, \u00a7 2.) \u00a7 2214. Hearing on petition; notice; decision; review. Upon the filing of the petition the court shall promptly: (1) Schedule a hearing to determine based on clear and convincing evidence whether the patient is a person in need of treatment and that cause exists for the involuntary treatment of the patient, and if unable to afford counsel, to appoint counsel to represent the involuntary patient. Such hearing shall be held as soon as practicable, but no later than 8 working days from the filing of the petition. (2) Direct that notice of the hearing and copies of pleadings be supplied to the involuntary patient and the patient's counsel. In the case of a minor, copies of the pleading will be supplied to the patient's parents or legal guardian. (3) Enter such other orders as may be appropriate, including an order authorizing the continued involuntary treatment of the patient until further order of the court. (4) If the court determines after a hearing that the patient is not a person in need of treatment or that such patient does not need involuntary treatment, the patient shall be discharged in accord with the court's order. If the court determines that the patient is a person in need of treatment who is unwilling to accept or incapable of accepting voluntary treatment, it may order continued treatment for an additional period not to exceed 30 days. Thereafter, the court shall schedule an additional hearing within 30 days to review the need for continued involuntary treatment unless the court is informed the patient is under voluntary treatment or has been appropriately discharged from treatment. If continued involuntary treatment is warranted beyond the 30 days, the court shall hold hearings to determine the necessity for continued involuntary treatment at intervals of not more than 6 months. A patient involuntarily receiving treatment, if represented by counsel, may waive, orally or in writing, any hearing under this section. The waiver must be submitted in writing to the court or be orally presented in open court. (5) The court for good cause may order that judicial proceedings under this chapter take place in the Superior Court or Family Court in a county other than the county in which the action was initiated. (73 Del. Laws, c. 358, \u00a7 2.)Title 16 - Health and Safety Page 171\u00a7 2215. Procedural rights of involuntary patients. An individual whom the staff of a facility has determined to be a person in need of treatment will be provided: (1) Notice (including a written statement) of the factual grounds upon which the proposed treatment is predicated and the reasons for the necessity of involuntary treatment and confinement. (2) Judicial review and determination of: a. Whether the involuntary patient's confinement is based upon sufficient cause; b. Whether the involuntary patient is a person in need of treatment; and c. Whether a less restrictive placement such as nonresidential treatment is more appropriate. Such hearings shall be without jury and not open to the public and shall be preceded by adequate notice to the involuntary patient, and the involuntary patient shall be entitled to be present at all such hearings. (3) Representation by counsel at all judicial proceedings, such counsel to be court-appointed if the involuntary patient cannot afford to retain counsel; (4) Examination by an independent, licensed professional in the area of substance abuse and treatment and to have such persons testify as a witness on the patient's behalf, such witness to be court-appointed if the involuntary patient cannot afford to retain such witness. (5) Reasonable discovery, the opportunity to summon and cross-examine witnesses, to present evidence on the person's own behalf and to all other procedural rights afforded litigants in civil causes. The privilege against self-incrimination shall be applicable to all proceedings under this chapter and the patient's testimony, if any, shall not otherwise be admissible in any criminal proceedings against the patient. (6) To have a full record made of the proceedings, including findings adequate for review. All records and pleadings shall remain confidential unless the court for good cause orders otherwise. (73 Del. Laws, c. 358, \u00a7 2.) \u00a7 2216. Discharge by the facility. Notwithstanding the pendency of the action or any order previously entered by the court, if at any time after the petition is filed the staff of the facility determines that the involuntary patient is no longer in need of involuntary treatment, the facility may so certify in writing and discharge the patient, and shall promptly notify the court of its discharge, and the court may dismiss the action. (73 Del. Laws, c. 358, \u00a7 2.) \u00a7 2217. Changing to voluntary status. An involuntary patient is entitled to change that patient's own status to that of a voluntary patient if a member of the staff of the facility certifies that: (1) The patient is reasonably capable of understanding the nature of the decision to change status; and (2) Such a change is in the patient's best interest. If such a change in status is challenged within 2 days by the patient's next of kin or legal representative, the court will schedule a hearing to finally determine the matter. (73 Del. Laws, c. 358, \u00a7 2; 70 Del. Laws, c. 186, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 2218. Enlargement of time. Notwithstanding the above provisions of this chapter, except for the time to appeal, the court may enlarge the time for performance for a reasonable period upon a showing of good cause. (73 Del. Laws, c. 358, \u00a7 2.) \u00a7 2219. Appeal; rules of procedure. (a) Any party to the proceedings may appeal an order of discharge or involuntary treatment to the Supreme Court within 30 days of the entry of such order. The appeal shall not operate as a stay of the order of disposition unless the court or the Supreme Court so directs. (b) The Superior Court and the Family Court may adopt such rules of procedure as may be required to implement the procedural requirements of this chapter. (73 Del.

Laws, c. 371, \u00a7 13.) \u00a7 2507. Surrogates. (a) A surrogate may make a health-care decision to treat, withdraw or withhold treatment for an adult patient if the patient has been determined by the attending physician to lack capacity and there is no agent or guardian, or if the directive does not address the specific issue. This determination shall be confirmed in writing in the patient's medical record by the attending physician. Without this determination and confirmation, the patient is presumed to have capacity and may give or revoke an advance health-care directive or disqualify a surrogate. (b) (1) A mentally competent patient may designate any individual to act as a surrogate by personally informing the supervising health- care provider in the presence of a witness. The designated surrogate may not act as a witness. The designation of the surrogate shall be confirmed in writing in the patient's medical record by the supervising health-care provider and signed by the witness. (2) In the absence of a designation or if the designee is not reasonably available, any member of the following classes of the patient's family who is reasonably available, in the descending order of priority, may act, when permitted by this section, as a surrogate and shall be recognized as such by the supervising health-care provider: a. The spouse, unless a petition for divorce has been filed; b. An adult child; c. A parent; d. An adult sibling; e. An adult grandchild; f. An adult niece or nephew; g. An adult aunt or uncle.

(3) If an adult patient is in an acute care setting or is a client of the Department of Health and Social Services and none of the individuals eligible to act as a surrogate under subsection (b) of this section is reasonably available, an adult, other than a paid caregiver, who has exhibited special care and concern for the patient, who is familiar with the patient's personal values and who is reasonably available may make health-care decisions to treat, withdraw or withhold treatment on behalf of the patient. Such person shall provide an affidavit to the health-care facility or to the attending or treating physician which includes statements that he or she is: a. A close friend of the patient; b. Is willing and able to become involved in the patient's health care; and c. Has maintained such regular contact with the patient as to be familiar with the patient's activities, health, personal values and morals. The affidavit must also recite facts and circumstances that demonstrate such person's familiarity with the patient. End of life decisions involving the withdrawal or withholding of treatment must meet the requirements of this chapter. (4) Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as limiting the Court of Chancery's authority to appoint a guardian of a person to act as a surrogate under the Court's rules and procedures. (5) A supervising health-care provider may require an individual claiming the right to act as a surrogate for a patient to provide a written declaration under the penalty of perjury stating facts and circumstances sufficient to establish the claimed authority. (6) A mentally competent patient may at any time disqualify a member of the patient's family from acting as the patient's surrogate by a signed writing or by personally informing the health-care provider of the disqualification. (7) A surrogate may make a decision to provide, withhold or withdraw a life-sustaining procedure if the patient has a qualifying condition documented in writing with its nature and cause, if known, in the patient's medical record by the attending physician. (8) A surrogate's decision on behalf of the patient to treat, withdraw or withhold treatment shall be made according to the following paragraphs and otherwise meet the requirements of this chapter: a. Decisions shall be made in consultation with the attending physician.Title 16 - Health and Safety Page 194b. 1. The surrogate shall make a health-care decision to treat, withdraw or withhold treatment in accordance with the patient's individual instructions, if any, and other wishes to the extent known by the surrogate. 2. If the patient's instructions or wishes are not known or clearly applicable, the surrogate's decision shall conform as closely as possible to what the patient would have done or intended under the circumstances. To the extent the surrogate knows or is able to determine, the surrogate's decision is to take into account, including, but not limited to, the following factors if applicable: A. The patient's personal, philosophical, religious and ethical values; B. The patient's likelihood of regaining decision making capacity; C. The patient's likelihood of death; D. The treatment's burdens on and benefits to the patient; E. Reliable oral or written statements previously made by the patient, including, but not limited to, statements made to family members, friends, health care providers or religious leaders. 3. If the surrogate is unable to determine what the patient would have done or intended under the circumstances, the surrogate's decision shall be made in the best interest of the patient. To the extent the surrogate knows and is able to determine, the surrogate's decision is to take into account, including, but not limited to, the factors, if applicable, stated in paragraph (b)(8)b.2. of this section. (9) In the event an individual specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section claims that the individual has not been recognized or consulted as a surrogate or if persons with equal decision making priority under paragraph (b)(2) of this section cannot agree who shall be a surrogate or disagree about a health-care decision, and a patient who lacks capacity is receiving care in a health-care institution, the attending physician or an individual specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section may refer the case to an appropriate committee of the health-care institution for a recommendation in compliance with this chapter, and the attending physician may act in accordance with the recommendation of the committee or transfer the patient in accordance with the provisions of \u00a7 2508(g) of this title. A physician who acts in accordance with the recommendation of the committee is not subject to civil or criminal liability or to discipline for unprofessional conduct for any claim based on lack of consent or authorization for the action. (70 Del. Laws, c. 392, \u00a7 3; 70 Del. Laws, c. 186, \u00a7 1; 74 Del. Laws, c. 328, \u00a7\u00a7 1-3; 79 Del. Laws, c. 28, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 2508. Obligations of health-care provider. (a) Before implementing a health-care decision made for a patient, a supervising health-care provider, if possible, shall promptly communicate to the patient the decision made and the identity of the person making the decision. The decision of an agent or surrogate does not apply if the patient objects to the decision to remove life-sustaining treatment, providing that the objection is (1) by a signed writing or (2) in any manner that communicates in the presence of 2 competent persons, 1 of whom is a physician. (b) A supervising health-care provider who knows of the existence of an advance health-care directive or a revocation of an advance health-care directive shall promptly record its existence in the patient's health-care record and, if it is in writing, shall request a copy and, if it is not in writing, shall request a copy of the witness statement, and shall arrange for its maintenance in the health-care record. (c) A primary physician who makes or is informed of a determination that a patient lacks or has recovered capacity or that another condition exists which affects an individual instruction or the authority of an agent, surrogate or guardian, shall promptly record the determination in the patient's health-care record and communicate the determination to the patient, if possible, and to any person then authorized to make health-care decisions for the patient. (d) Except as provided in subsections (e) and (f) of this section, a health-care provider or institution providing care to a patient shall: (1) Comply with an individual instruction of the patient and with a reasonable interpretation of that instruction made by a person then authorized to make health-care decisions for the patient; and (2) In the absence of an individual instruction, comply with a health-care decision for the patient made by a person then authorized to make health-care decisions for the patient to the extent the agent or surrogate is permitted by this chapter. (e) A health-care provider may decline to comply with an individual instruction or health-care decision for reasons of conscience. A health-care institution may decline to comply with an individual instruction or health-care decision if the instruction or decision is contrary to a written policy of the institution which is based on reasons of conscience and if the policy was communicated to the patient or to a person then authorized to make health-care decisions for the patient. (f) A health-care provider or institution may decline to comply with an individual instruction or health-care decision that requires medically ineffective treatment or health care contrary to generally accepted health-care standards applicable to the health-care provider or institution. (g) A health-care provider or institution that declines to comply with an individual instruction or health-care decision shall: (1) Promptly so inform the patient, if possible, and any person then authorized to make health-care decisions for the patient; (2) Provide continuing care, including continuing life-sustaining care, to the patient until a transfer can be effected; and (3) Not impede the transfer of the patient to another health-care provider or institution identified by the patient, the patient's agent or the patient's surrogate. (70 Del. Laws, c. 392, \u00a7 3; 70 Del. Laws, c. 186, \u00a7 1.)Title 16 - Health and Safety Page 195\u00a7 2509. Health-care information. (a) Unless otherwise specified in an advance health-care directive, a person then authorized to make health-care decisions for a patient has the same rights as the patient to request, receive, examine, copy and consent to the disclosure of medical or any other health-care information. (b) Unless otherwise specified in an advance health-care directive or court order, an agent appointed by a valid advance health-care directive under this chapter, a surrogate determined and confirmed under \u00a7 2507 of this title or a guardian of the person of a minor or adult appointed pursuant to a court order shall be authorized as a \"personal representative\" with full authority and standing thereof as provided in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 [P.L. 104-191], its regulations and the standards issued by the Secretary of the United States Department of Health and Social Services. (70 Del. Laws, c. 392, \u00a7 3; 76 Del. Laws, c. 307, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 2510. Immunities. (a) A health-care provider or institution acting in good faith and in accordance with generally accepted health-care standards applicable to the health-care provider or institution is not subject to civil or criminal liability or to discipline for unprofessional conduct for: (1) Complying with a health-care decision of a person apparently having authority to make a health-care decision for a patient, including a decision to withhold or withdraw health care; (2) Declining to comply with a health-care decision of a person based on a belief that the person then lacked authority; (3) Complying with an advance health-care directive and assuming that the directive was valid when made and has not been revoked or terminated; (4) Providing life-sustaining treatment in an emergency situation when the existence of a health-care directive is unknown; or (5) Declining to comply with a health-care decision or advance health-care directive because the instruction is contrary to the conscience or good faith medical judgment of the health-care provider or the written policies of the institution. (b) An individual acting as agent or surrogate under this chapter is not subject to civil or criminal liability or to discipline for unprofessional conduct for health-care decisions made in good faith. (70 Del. Laws, c. 392, \u00a7 3.) \u00a7 2511. Safeguards. (a) Anyone who has good reason to believe that the withdrawal or withholding of health care in a particular case: (1) Is contrary to the most recent expressed wishes of a declarant; (2) Is being proposed pursuant to an advance health-care directive that has been falsified, forged or coerced; or (3) Is being considered without the benefit of a revocation which has been unlawfully concealed, destroyed, altered or cancelled; may petition the Court of Chancery for appointment of a guardian for such declarant. (b) The Department of Health and Social Services and the Public Guardian shall have oversight over any advance health-care directive executed by a resident of a long-term care facility, as defined in \u00a7 1102 of this title. Such advance health-care directive shall have no force nor effect if the declarant is a resident of a long-term care facility, as defined in \u00a7 1102 of this title, at the time the advance health- care directive is executed unless 1 of the witnesses is a person designated as a patient advocate or ombudsperson by the Department of Health and Social Services. The patient advocate or ombudsperson must have the qualifications required of other witnesses under this chapter except as provided in \u00a7 2508 of this title. (63 Del. Laws, c. 386, \u00a7 1; 64 Del. Laws, c. 204, \u00a7 8; 69 Del. Laws, c. 345, \u00a7 5; 70 Del. Laws, c. 186, \u00a7 1; 70 Del. Laws, c. 392, \u00a7\u00a7 3, 4; 79 Del. Laws, c. 204, \u00a7 2; 81 Del. Laws, c. 207, \u00a7 3.) \u00a7 2512. Assumptions and presumptions. (a) Neither the execution of an advance health-care directive under this chapter nor the fact that health care is withheld from a patient in accordance therewith shall, for any purpose, constitute a suicide. (b) The making of an advance health-care directive pursuant to this chapter shall not restrict, inhibit nor impair in any manner the sale, procurement or issuance of any policy of life insurance, nor shall it be deemed or presumed to modify the terms of an existing policy of life insurance. No policy of life insurance shall be legally impaired or invalidated in any manner by the withholding or withdrawal of health care from an insured patient, notwithstanding any term of the policy to the contrary. (c) No physician, health facility or other health-care provider, nor any health-care service plan, insurer issuing disability insurance, self-insured employee welfare benefit plan or nonprofit hospital service plan, shall require any person to execute an advance health-care directive as a condition to being insured, or for receiving health-care services, nor shall the signing of an advance health-care directive be a bar, except as provided in \u00a7 2508 of this title. (d) [Repealed.] (63 Del. Laws, c. 386, \u00a7 1; 64 Del. Laws, c. 204, \u00a7 7; 70 Del. Laws, c. 392, \u00a7\u00a7 3, 5.)Title 16 - Health and Safety Page 196\u00a7 2513. Penalties.

(b) Whoever knowingly conceals, destroys, falsifies or forges a document with intent to create the false impression that another person has directed that maintenance medical treatment be utilized for the prolongation of that person's life is guilty of a class C felony. (c) The Superior Court shall have jurisdiction over all offenses under this chapter. (63 Del. Laws, c. 386, \u00a7 1; 70 Del. Laws, c. 186, \u00a7 1; 70 Del. Laws, c. 392, \u00a7\u00a7 3, 6.) \u00a7 2514. Capacity. (a) This chapter does not affect the right of an individual to make health-care decisions while having capacity to do so. (b) An individual is presumed to have capacity to make a health-care decision and to give or revoke an advance health-care directive. (70 Del. Laws, c. 392, \u00a7 7.) \u00a7 2515. Accommodation. Notwithstanding this chapter, an individual who elects to have treatment by spiritual means in lieu of medical or surgical treatment shall not be compelled to submit to medical or surgical treatment. (70 Del. Laws, c. 392, \u00a7 7.) \u00a7 2516. Effect of copy. A copy of an advance health-care directive or revocation of an advance health-care directive, has the same effect as the original. (70 Del. Laws, c. 392, \u00a7 7.) \u00a7 2517. Recognition of advance directives executed in other states. An advance directive or similar health-care declaration validly executed under the laws of another state in compliance with the laws of that state or of this State is valid for purposes of and subject to the limitations of this chapter. (70 Del. Laws, c. 392, \u00a7 7.) \u00a7 2518. Effect on prior declarations and directives. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to modify or affect the terms of any declaration, appointment of agent or durable power of attorney validly executed prior to June 26, 1996, which grants the authority for medical treatment or directs the withholding or withdrawal of medical treatment, except that a prior declaration shall not be interpreted to allow the withdrawal or withholding of artificial nutrition or hydration unless that desire is specifically stated in that directive. If withdrawal or withholding of artificial nutrition or hydration is not specifically addressed in a prior declaration, a health-care provider shall comply with a decision regarding withdrawal or withholding of artificial nutrition or hydration for the patient made by a person then authorized to make health-care decisions for the patient to the extent the agent or surrogate is permitted by this chapter. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to limit the use of any previous living will forms conforming to law or any other form which meets the requirements of this chapter. (70 Del. Laws, c. 392, \u00a7 7; 71 Del. Laws, c. 419, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 2519. Health-care institutions and guardianships for nonacute patients. (a) A health-care institution must, as early as 3 but no later than 5 business days of determining that a patient no longer requires acute care in the health-care institution, provide a written notice to the patient, the patient's surrogate, and, if the patient does not have a surrogate, to any member of the patient's family who is reasonably available, in the descending order of priority set forth in \u00a7 2507 of this title, that the health-care institution has concluded that the nonacute patient would benefit from the appointment of a guardian, who shall be fully authorized with powers necessary to transfer the patient from acute care to less restrictive nonacute care, and that a petition for the appointment of a guardian should be filed within 10 business days of the date of the notice. (b) If the process of appointing a guardian for the nonacute patient has not been initiated within the period set forth in the notice required under subsection (a) of this section, the institution shall provide a second written notice to the patient, the patient's surrogate, and if the patient does not have a surrogate, to any member of the patient's family who is reasonably available, in the descending order of priority set forth in \u00a7 2507 of this title, that the petition for the appointment of a guardian must be filed within 10 business days of the date of the second notice, or the institution will initiate the process of appointing a guardian. (c) If the process of appointing a guardian for the nonacute patient has not been initiated within the time set forth in the second notice required under subsection (b) of this section, or if a guardian who is fully authorized with powers necessary to transfer the patient from acute care to less restrictive nonacute care has not been appointed within 30 days from the date of the filing of a petition for appointment of a guardian, the health-care institution may initiate the process of appointing a guardian. (82 Del. Laws, c. 270, \u00a7 1.)Title 16 - Health and Safety Page 197Part II Regulatory Provisions Concerning Public Health Chapter 25A Delaware Medical Orders for Scope of Treatment Act \u00a7 2501A. Short title. This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the \"Delaware Medical Orders for Scope of Treatment Act\" (\"DMOST Act\"). (80 Del. Laws, c. 18, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 2502A. Statement of purpose. (a) An adult individual who has decision-making capacity has the right to refuse medical or surgical treatment in order to allow natural death if such refusal is not contrary to existing public health laws. (b) An adult individual with decision-making capacity has the right to plan ahead for health-care decisions through an advance health- care directive pursuant to Chapter 25 of this title, or through a DMOST form pursuant to this chapter or both, and to have the wishes expressed in those documents respected, subject to certain limitations, in order to ensure that the right to control decisions about one's own health care is not lost if a patient loses decision-making capacity and is not able to participate actively in making his or her own decisions, either temporarily or permanently. (c) An advance health-care directive is recommended for every adult whether or not the individual anticipates a period of incapacity. (d) The DMOST form is separate from and is not an advance health-care directive. It expresses an individual's wishes regarding scope of treatment through medical orders. The DMOST form does not require an advance health-care directive. (e) Data reveal that many individuals may reside or be situated in multiple locations such as home, acute care, and post-acute care settings near the end of life. Changes in such settings require that an easily understood, standardized, portable document be available to communicate the individual's care preferences. A DMOST form provides such a document. (80 Del. Laws, c. 18, \u00a7 1; 70 Del. Laws, c. 186, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 Definitions. (a) \"Advance health-care directive\" means an advance health-care directive under Chapter 25 of this title, a durable power of attorney for health-care decisions, or any individual instruction or power of attorney for health care valid in the state where such document was executed or where the individual executing such document was a resident at the time that such document was executed that appoints an agent. Said document must have been executed by the individual authorizing the appointed agent to make decisions about the individual's health care when such individual no longer has decision-making capacity. (b) \"Decision-making capacity\" means a patient's ability to understand and appreciate the nature and consequences of a particular health-care decision, including the benefits and risks of that decision and alternatives to any proposed health care, and to reach an informed health-care decision. (c) \"Delaware Medical Orders for Scope of Treatment\" (DMOST) means a clinical process to facilitate communication between health- care professionals and patients living with serious illness or frailty whose health-care practitioner would not be surprised if they died within the next year or, if the patient lacks decision-making capacity, the patient's authorized representative. The process encourages shared, informed medical decision-making. The result is a DMOST form, which contains portable medical orders that respect the patient's goals for care in regard to the use of CPR and other medical interventions. The DMOST form is applicable across health-care settings, is reviewable, and is revocable. (d) \"Department\" means the Department of Health and Social Services. (e) \"DMOST form\" means a standardized document created or approved by the Department that is uniquely identifiable and has a uniform format or color, which: (1) Is used on a voluntary basis by patients living with serious illness or frailty whose health-care practitioner would not be surprised if they died within the next year; (2) Is not an advance health-care directive; (3) Is not valid unless it meets the requirements for a completed DMOST form as set forth in this chapter; (4) Is intended to provide direction to emergency care personnel regarding the use of emergency care and to health-care providers regarding the use of life-sustaining treatment by indicating the patient's preference concerning the scope of treatment, the use of specified interventions, and the intensity of treatment for each intervention; (5) Is intended to accompany the patient, and to be honored by all personnel attending the patient, across the full range of possible health-care settings, including but not limited to the patient's home, a health-care institution, at the scene of a medical emergency, or during transport;Title 16 - Health and Safety Page 198(6) May be reviewed or voided at any time by a patient with decision-making capacity or, if the patient lacks decision-making capacity, the patient's representative in accordance with the provisions of \u00a7 2511A of this title; and (7) Must be signed by a health-care practitioner. (f) \"Emergency-care provider\" means an emergency medical technician, paramedic, or first responder authorized under Chapter 97 of this title. (g) \"Health-care institution\" means an institution, facility, or agency licensed, certified or otherwise authorized or permitted by law to provide health care in the ordinary course of business. (h) \"Health-care practitioner\" means a physician or an individual licensed and authorized to write medical orders under Title 24 who is providing care for the patient or overseeing the health care provided to a patient and has completed all training required by the Department for individuals participating in the completion of a DMOST form. Over time, a patient's health-care practitioner may change. (i) \"Health-care provider\" means an individual licensed, certified, or otherwise authorized or permitted by law to provide health care in the ordinary course of business or practice of a profession. A health-care practitioner is also a health-care provider. (j) \"Life-sustaining treatment\" includes any medical intervention, including procedures, administration of medication, or use of a medical device, that maintains life by sustaining, restoring, or supplanting a vital function. It does not include care provided for the purpose of keeping a patient comfortable. (k) \"Patient\" means the individual who is under the care of the health-care practitioner or health-care provider. (l) \"Patient's authorized representative\" or \"authorized representative\" means the individual signing a DMOST form on behalf of a patient without decision-making capacity, who has the highest priority to act for the patient under law, and who has the authority to make decisions with respect to the patient's health-care preferences being made on the DMOST form such individual is executing on behalf of the patient. The health-care practitioner shall determine the individual who is the patient's authorized representative by referencing the documentation giving such individual the required authority under law. The regulations implementing this chapter shall explain the priority set by law regarding who can act as an authorized representative. Based on the documentation provided by such individual as evidence of his or her authority, the patient's authorized representative could be an individual designated by a patient under an advance health-care directive, an agent under a medical durable power of attorney for health-care decisions, a guardian of the person appointed pursuant to Chapters 39 and 39A of Title 12, in accordance with the authority granted by the appointing court, a surrogate appointed under Chapter 25 of this title, or an individual who is otherwise authorized under applicable law to make the health-care decisions being made by execution of the DMOST form on the patient's behalf, if the patient lacks decision-making capacity. (m) \"Physician\" means an individual authorized to practice medicine under subchapter III, Chapter 17 of Title 24. (n) \"Scope of treatment\" means those medical interventions, procedures, medications, and treatments that a patient, in consultation with a health-care practitioner, has determined are appropriate, necessary and desired by and for the patient and that a patient has determined to refuse or to allow. Scope of treatment always respects the patient and includes the provision of comfort measures. A patient may decline life-sustaining treatment. (80 Del. Laws, c. 18, \u00a7 1; 70 Del. Laws, c. 186, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 2504A. Duty of patient's authorized representative. (a) At such time as a patient lacks decision-making capacity, the patient's authorized representative shall make a health-care decision to treat, withdraw, or withhold treatment in accordance with the patient's individual instructions as expressed in an advance health-care directive or DMOST form, if any, and other wishes to the extent known, or, if a guardian appointed pursuant to Chapters 39 and 39A of Title 12, in accordance with the authority granted by the appointing court. The patient's authorized representative shall have the power to make any health-care decision authorized under this chapter unless limited by the order of a court of competent jurisdiction or limited in the document provided by the authorized representative as evidence of his or her authority. (b) If the patient's instructions or wishes are not known or clearly applicable, the authorized representative's decision shall conform as closely as possible to what the patient would have done or intended under the circumstances. To the extent the authorized representative knows or is able to determine, the authorized representative's decision shall take into account the following nonexclusive list of factors, if applicable: (1) The patient's personal, philosophical, religious, and ethical values. (2) The patient's likelihood of regaining decision-making capacity. (3) The patient's likelihood of death. (4) The treatment's burdens on and benefits to the patient. (5) Reliable oral or written statements previously made by the patient, including, but not limited to, statements made to family members, friends, health-care providers, or religious leaders. (c) The decision of an authorized representative regarding whether life-sustaining procedures should be provided, withheld, or withdrawn shall not be based on a patient's status either as an individual with a preexisting long-term mental or physical disability, or as an individual who is economically disadvantaged. (80 Del. Laws, c. 18, \u00a7 1; 70 Del. Laws, c. 186, \u00a7 1.)Title 16 - Health and Safety Page 199\u00a7 2505A. Powers and duties of Department of Health and Social Services. (a) The Secretary of the Department of Health and Social Services shall be authorized to promulgate regulations and develop protocols to fulfill the following responsibilities: (1) Promulgation of a DMOST form and development of the process for completion, modification, and revocation of the DMOST form including training requirements. (2) Promotion of awareness among health-care practitioners, health-care providers, emergency-care providers, and the general public in this State about the option to complete a DMOST form.

(c) The patient's authorized representative may, at any time after the patient loses decision-making capacity and after consultation with the patient's health-care practitioner, request the health-care practitioner to modify or void the completed DMOST form, or otherwise request alternative treatment to the treatment that was ordered on the DMOST form, as the patient's authorized representative deems necessary to reflect the patient's health status or goals of care, unless the patient expressly limits the authorized representative's authority to modify or void the completed DMOST form. The DMOST form shall provide the patient with the option to authorize or not to authorize the patient's authorized representative to void or modify the patient's completed DMOST form if the patient who has a completed DMOST form loses decision-making capacity. If the patient indicates on the DMOST form that the authorized representative is not authorized to void or modify the patient's completed DMOST form, the patient's authorized representative may not do so.

(b) A health-care provider involved in the patient's care or an administrator of a health-care institution may seek to resolve a disagreement concerning the appropriate interpretation and application of the terms of a completed DMOST form to the patient's course of treatment in the same manner as set forth in subsection (a) of this section. (80 Del. Laws, c. 18, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 2513A. Conflicting directives. (a) The patient's scope of treatment shall be governed by the latest directive available. (b) If the treatment directives of a later advance health-care directive conflict with the patient's directives on a DMOST form, a health- care practitioner shall be informed so that the DMOST form can be modified or voided in order to reflect that patient's later directive. (c) If there is a conflict between the patient's expressed oral or written directives, the DMOST form, or the decisions of the patient's authorized representative, the patient's last expressed oral or written directives shall be followed and, if necessary, a new DMOST form shall be prepared and executed.

(80 Del. Laws, c. 18, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 2516A. Assumptions and presumptions. (a) Neither the execution of a DMOST form under this chapter nor the fact that health care is withheld or withdrawn from a patient in accordance therewith shall, for any purpose, constitute a suicide. (b) The completion of a DMOST form pursuant to this chapter shall not be deemed or presumed to modify the terms of an existing insurance policy.

(2) Cause a contractor who is qualified under Delaware state regulations to conduct a lead risk assessment of a lead-exposure site that was constructed before January 1, 1979. The lead risk assessment must meet the lead-based paint inspection and lead hazard screen standards established under 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.110, must include paint testing and dust sampling and analysis as described under 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 745.227(c) and (d), and must, where indicated, include soil sampling and analysis as described under 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 745.227(d).Title 16 - Health and Safety Page 206(3) If the lead risk assessment under paragraph (a)(2) of this section indicates the presence of a lead-based paint hazard, as defined at 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 745.65, inform the owner of the lead-exposure site that lead-based paint abatement or remediation efforts, to be funded by the State except under subsection (b) of this section, may be undertaken, and that the owner of the lead-exposure site is required to take all steps necessary to make the property accessible and available to individuals conducting lead-based paint abatement or remediation work for the Program. a. The owner of the lead-exposure site shall take all steps enumerated by the Program to make the property accessible and available. b.

The annual report required under \u00a7 2606 of this title must include information on the number of lead-exposure sites with identified lead-based paint hazards that have been, and have not been, the subject of lead-based paint remediation or abatement efforts. (4) Provide adequate advance notice to a resident of a lead-exposure site that the lead-exposure site is uninhabitable due to lead- based paint abatement or remediation efforts by the Program. (5) Provide reasonable alternative lodging for a resident of a lead-exposure site when the lead-exposure site is uninhabitable due to lead-based paint abatement or remediation efforts by the Program. Alternative lodging must be sufficient to ensure that the resident does not suffer disproportionate injuries because of displacement. The Program shall pay the resident's cost for meals and transportation during displacement. (6) Assume all costs associated with abating or remediating any lead-based paint hazard in a lead-exposure site being abated or remediated by the program under paragraph (a)(3) of this section. (b) The failure of an owner of a lead-exposure site to comply with the deadlines established by the Program under paragraph (a)(3) of this section constitutes a criminal nuisance which adversely impacts the community under \u00a7 7111 of Title 10. A finding by a court of competent jurisdiction that a failure to comply with the deadlines established by the Program under paragraph (a)(3) of this section has resulted in a criminal nuisance results in the owner's forfeiture of the owner's right to state-funded abatement or remediation under this section and in the owner's assumption of the cost of abatement or remediation unless the court specifically orders otherwise. (c) All lead-based paint abatement or remediation work conducted under this section must be performed by a contractor who has been certified by the State to perform the abatement or remediation and must be awarded under a competitive bid process overseen by the Program. A contractor may submit bids to perform lead-based paint abatement or remediation work under this section before the contractor's certification on commitment to be certified before the performance of any abatement or remediation work. The Program may not pay a contractor for lead-based paint abatement or remediation work unless the contract is certified as required by this subsection. (d) Competitive bid invitations issued by the Program for lead-based paint abatement or remediation must contain all of the following: (1) Provisions requiring verification by bidders of procedures to be used for risk assessment. (2) Provisions requiring verification by bidders of procedures to be specified by the Program to limit the generation of lead dust, contain lead dust within work areas, conduct daily and final cleanings, and perform clearance testing. (3) Provisions requiring verification by bidders of procedures regarding treatment of exteriors, including siding and carpentry repairs, porch repairs, and garage repairs.

(5) Provisions requiring verification by bidders of procedures regarding interior treatment, including initial and daily cleaning; repairs and component replacements; paint stabilization treatment of windows, doors, stairs, walls, ceilings, hard surface and basement floors, and radiators; and final cleaning. (e) (1) A county or municipal government entity notified by the Program that a property is designated as a lead-exposure site and is to have lead-based paint abated or remediated shall grant priority status to any approvals needed by any applicant for any abatement or remediation work that must be performed. (2) A contractor whose request for project approval is not approved or denied within 30 days by the county or municipal government entity shall report the delay to the Program. (3) The Program shall make a public report by January 1 of each calendar year to the Governor and General Assembly of each delay reported under paragraph (e)(2) of this section. (f) (1) The owner of any multi-unit property or property that has been rented to a third party in the year before notification under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, for which abatement or remediation work has been performed at State expense under this chapter, is prohibited from increasing the rental fee assessed to any tenant on that property for 3 years from the date of notification under paragraph (a)(4) of this section.

Is domiciled; b. Has a place of residence; or c. Is a citizen. (g) If a document of gift is valid under this section, the law of Delaware governs interpretation of the document. (h) A person may rely on a document of gift or amendment of an anatomical gift as being valid unless that person knows that it was not validly executed or was revoked. (24 Del. C. 1953, \u00a7 1783; 57 Del. Laws, c. 445, \u00a7 2; 59 Del. Laws, c. 330, \u00a7 1; 65 Del. Laws, c. 487, \u00a7 3; 67 Del. Laws, c. 360, \u00a7 1; 70 Del. Laws, c. 186, \u00a7 1; 71 Del. Laws, c. 453, \u00a7 4; 80 Del. Laws, c. 182, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 2714. Delivery of document of gift. If the gift is made by the donor to a specified donee, the will, card or other document of gift, or an executed copy thereof, may be delivered to the donee to expedite the appropriate procedures immediately after death, but delivery is not necessary to the validity of the gift. The will, card or other document of gift, or an executed copy thereof, may be deposited in any hospital, bank or storage facility or registry office that accepts them for safekeeping or for facilitation of procedures after death. On request of any interested party upon or after the donor's death, the person in possession shall produce the document for examination. (24 Del. C. 1953, \u00a7 1784; 57 Del. Laws, c. 445, \u00a7 2; 65 Del. Laws, c. 487, \u00a7 3; 80 Del. Laws, c. 182, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 2715. Amendment or revocation of the gift.

(b) Any document of gift which has not been delivered to the donee may be revoked by the donor in the manner set in subsection (a) of this section or by destruction, cancellation or mutilation of the document and all executed copies thereof. (c) Any gift made by a will may also be amended or revoked in the manner provided for amendment or revocation of wills or as provided in subsection (a) of this section. (d) Unless a revocation of a gift under this section includes an objection or refusal to make a gift of a part, it shall not prohibit a person listed in \u00a7 2711(c) of this title from authorizing such a gift. (24 Del. C. 1953, \u00a7 1785; 57 Del. Laws, c. 445, \u00a7 2; 65 Del. Laws, c. 487, \u00a7 3; 70 Del. Laws, c. 186, \u00a7 1; 80 Del. Laws, c. 182, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 2716. Rights and duties at death. (a) The donee may accept or reject the gift. If the donee accepts a gift of the entire body, the donee may, subject to the terms of the gift, authorize embalming and the use of the body in funeral services. If the gift is of a part of the body, the donee, upon the death of the donor and prior to embalming, shall cause the part to be removed without unnecessary mutilation. After removal of the part, custody of the remainder of the body vests in the surviving spouse, next of kin or other persons under obligation to dispose of the body. The heir of any donor, at the time the disposition of the body takes place, may submit a request in writing to the donee that the body be returned to the heir at such time as the donee either refuses the disposition of the entire body or the parts thereof or determines that the donee no longer has use of the remains. (b) A surgeon, physician, funeral director, recovery specialist or eye bank technician who is authorized to remove any part in accordance with this subchapter is also authorized to draw or secure a blood sample from the donor, in order to screen the tissue received for medical purposes. (c) The time of death shall be determined by a physician who attends the donor at the donor's death or, if none, the physician who certifies the death. This physician shall not participate in the procedures for removing or transplanting a part.Title 16 - Health and Safety Page 215(d) A person who acts in good faith in accord with the terms of this subchapter or under the anatomical gift laws of another state (or a foreign country) is not liable for damages in any civil action or subject to prosecution in any criminal proceeding for that act. (e) Where no other provision for the same exists, a body, or the remains thereof, after it is no longer needed for the purpose indicated by the donor, may be buried at public expense on order of the Medical Council of Delaware, but in no case shall the expense of the burial exceed $100. (f) This subchapter is subject to the laws of this State prescribing powers and duties with respect to autopsies. The OPO is authorized to obtain a copy of an autopsy report in a timely fashion upon request and payment of reasonable copying fees. (24 Del. C. 1953, \u00a7 1786; 57 Del.

(a) (1) At or near the time of death of any patient in a hospital, the attending physician or hospital designee shall make contact with the OPO in order to determine the suitability for organ, tissue and eye donation for any purpose specified under this chapter. This contact and the disposition shall be noted in the patient's medical record. (2) a. If the OPO determines that additional medical history or information is required to determine suitability for the donation, the OPO may seek additional health information on the potential anatomical donor from the Delaware Health Information Network (DHIN). b. If the OPO has entered into an agreement with the DHIN for access to clinical data in DHIN's possession, DHIN shall provide the OPO with timely access to medical information on the potential anatomical donor. (b) Protocol for referral of potential anatomical donors to OPO. (1) The person designated by the hospital to contact the OPO shall have the following information available: a. Patient's name and identifier number; b. Patient's age; c. Anticipated cause of death; d. Past medical history; and e. Other pertinent medical information. (2) a. If the OPO determines that donation is not appropriate based on established medical criteria, this shall be noted by hospital personnel in the patient's record and no further action shall be necessary. b. If the OPO determines that donation may be appropriate, the OPO shall make a reasonable search of the records of the Donate Life Delaware Registry or the applicable state donor registry that it knows exists for the geographic area in which the individual resided or resides in order to ascertain whether the individual has made an anatomical gift. c. If the referred patient has a document of gift, including registration with the Donate Life Delaware Registry, the OPO representative or the designated requestor shall attempt to notify a person listed in \u00a7 2711(c) of this title of the gift. d. If no document of gift is known to the OPO representative or the designated requestor, 1 of these 2 individuals shall ask the persons listed in \u00a7 2711(c) of this title whether the decedent had a validly executed document of gift. If there is no evidence of an anatomical gift by the decedent, the OPO representative or the designated requestor shall notify a person listed in \u00a7 2711(c) of this title of the option to donate organs and tissues. The request for donation shall be made by the OPO representative, or the designated requester in consultation with the attending physician or the hospital designee. (3) The person in charge of the hospital or that person's designated representative shall indicate in the medical record of the decedent: a. Whether or not a document of gift is known to exist or whether a gift was made; and b. The name of the person granting or refusing the gift and that person's relationship to the decedent. (4) If the OPO determines, based upon a medical record review, that a hospitalized individual who is dead or whose death is imminent may be a prospective donor, the hospital shall, if requested by the OPO, conduct a blood or tissue test or minimally invasive examination,Title 16 - Health and Safety Page 216which is reasonably necessary to evaluate the medical suitability of a part that is or may be the subject of an anatomical gift. Specific consent to testing or examination under this paragraph (b)(4) is not required. The results of tests and examinations under this paragraph (b)(4) shall be used or disclosed only: a. To evaluate medical suitability for donation and to facilitate the donation process; and b. As required or permitted by law. (5) The attending physician, in collaboration with the OPO, shall ensure that, prior to the withdrawal or withholding of any measures which are necessary to maintain the medical suitability of a part that is or may be the subject of an anatomical gift, the OPO has either: a. Had the opportunity to advise the applicable persons set forth in \u00a7 2711(c) of this title of the option to make an anatomical gift; or b. Ascertained that the individual expressed a known objection. (6) Each hospital in the State shall develop and implement a protocol for referring potential anatomical donors as provided in this section. The protocol shall require that, at or near the time of the death of any patient, the hospital shall contact by telephone the OPO to determine suitability for anatomical donation of the potential donor. The protocol shall encourage discretion and sensitivity to family circumstances and beliefs in all discussions regarding donations of organs, tissue or eyes. a. Limitation. \u2014 If the hospital staff advises the OPO that the hospital staff has actual knowledge that the decedent did not wish to be an anatomical donor, the gift of all or any part of the decedent's body shall not be requested. b. Medical record reviews. \u2014 Death medical record reviews must be performed annually in each acute care general hospital for the sole purpose of determining anatomical donor potential at the hospital. The hospital may perform the medical record review or may designate the OPO to conduct the review. If the hospital chooses to conduct its own review, it must do so in accordance with clinical specifications and guidelines established by the OPO. If the hospital conducts the review, the OPO must provide the necessary training to hospital personnel conducting the review. The hospital must report the results of the review to the OPO no later than 45 days following the completion of the review. If the hospital designates the OPO to conduct the review, the OPO shall provide the hospital with written assurance that the OPO shall maintain the confidentiality of patient identifying information. c. After a donor's death, a person to whom an anatomical gift may pass under \u00a7 2712 of this title may conduct a test or examination which is reasonably necessary to evaluate the medical suitability of the body or part for its intended purpose. d. Any examination conducted under this section may include an examination and copying of records necessary to determine the medical suitability of the part. This subsection includes medical, dental and other health-related records. e. A hospital shall enter into agreements or affiliations with the OPO for coordination of procurement and use of anatomical gifts. (7) A physician or technician may remove a donated part from the body of a donor that the physician or technician is qualified to remove. (8) A revocation of a gift made under this chapter is effective only if the applicable organ procurement organization, tissue bank, eye bank, or transplant hospital knows of and can reasonably communicate the revocation to the involved physicians or technicians before an incision has been made to remove a part from the donor's body or before invasive procedures have begun to prepare the recipient. (c) A person, including a medical examiner, that seeks to facilitate the making of an anatomical gift for the purposes of transplantation or therapy from a decedent who was not a hospital patient at the time of death shall notify the OPO at or around the time of the person's death in order to allow the OPO to evaluate the potential donation and, if applicable, coordinate the donation process. (d) The OPO may, upon request and payment of associated fees, obtain certified copies of death records of a donor from the Delaware Department of Health and Social Services, Office of Vital Statistics. (65 Del. Laws, c. 487, \u00a7 4; 70 Del. Laws, c. 186, \u00a7 1; 71 Del. Laws, c. 453, \u00a7 7; 80 Del. Laws, c. 182, \u00a7 1; 83 Del. Laws, c. 139, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 2722.

(80 Del. Laws, c. 182, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 2723. Donate Life Delaware Registry. (a) The database maintained by the Department of Transportation to record donor designations shall be known as the \"Donate Life Delaware Registry.\" The Registry shall include only affirmative donation decisions. Registration by a donor in the Registry shall constitute sufficient authorization to donate organs and tissues for transplantation and therapy.Title 16 - Health and Safety Page 217(b) The Department of Transportation shall provide access by residents of the State to an internet-based interface that promotes organ and tissue donation and enables residents 18 years of age or older who apply for, hold, or seek to renew a Delaware driver's license or identification card or otherwise have a record in the database to register as donors and have their decisions integrated into the Donate Life Delaware Registry. The form and content of the interface shall be maintained in collaboration with the OPO. (c) By October 3, 2016, the Department of Transportation shall establish a system which allows individuals who apply for, hold, or seek to renew a Delaware driver's license or identification card, or otherwise have a record in the database to add their donor designation to the Donate Life Delaware Registry by submitting a form to the Department at no cost to the registrant. The Department of Transportation may also provide the opportunity to individuals who do not otherwise have a record in the database to add a record and the donor designation to the Donate Life Delaware Registry. (d) Donor designation information entered into the Donate Life Delaware Registry shall supersede prior conflicting information: (1) Provided to the Donate Life Delaware Registry; (2) On the individual's physical driver's license or identification card; (3) On an advance health-care directive; (4) Submitted under \u00a7 2711 of this title; or (5) Submitted under any other statutory provision. (e) An information technology system adopted by the Department of Transportation or its successor after October 3, 2015, shall continue to accommodate the inclusion of donor designation information into the database and the ongoing operation of the Donate Life Delaware Registry.

Beginning as soon as practicable but no later than July 1, 1998, the Delaware Division of Motor Vehicles shall modify the driver's license and identification card application process and renewal system to obtain information regarding an individual's consent to anatomical donation, including a process to allow persons under age 18 to register as donors with parental consent as defined in \u00a7 2711(b) of this title. The following question shall be asked: Do you wish to have the organ donor designation printed on your driver's license? Only an affirmative response of an individual shall be noted on the front of the driver's license or identification card with the word \"Organ Donor\" or a symbol indicating the donor designation and recorded in the Donate Life Delaware Registry. The Department shall record and store all donor designations in the Donate Life Delaware Registry, regardless of whether a driver's license or identification card is issued. The OPO shall be given access to the foregoing donor information 24 hours a day through the Division of Motor Vehicles computer database. Notwithstanding the Driver's Privacy Protection Act, \u00a7 305 of Title 21, the Division of Motor Vehicles is authorized to provide the OPO with the foregoing donor information. The OPO shall not be assessed a fee or other charges for such access. The donor designation on the driver's license or identification card or inclusion in the Donate Life Delaware Registry shall be deemed sufficient to satisfy all requirements for consent to organ and tissue donation. (71 Del. Laws, c. 453, \u00a7 8; 80 Del. Laws, c. 182, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 2725. Collaboration between departments and organ procurement organizations.

(80 Del. Laws, c. 182, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 2726. Liability. A person who acts in good faith in accord with the terms of this subchapter is not liable for damages in any civil action or subject to prosecution in any criminal proceeding for that act. (65 Del. Laws, c. 487, \u00a7 4; 70 Del. Laws, c. 186, \u00a7 1; 71 Del. Laws, c. 453, \u00a7 9; 80 Del. Laws, c. 182, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 2727. Facilitation of anatomical gift from decedent whose death is under investigation. (a) The OPO shall in all cases collaborate with the medical examiner to ensure the preservation of forensic evidence and collection of photographs and specimens. A medical examiner shall, upon request, release to the OPO the name, contact information and availableTitle 16 - Health and Safety Page 218medical and social history of a decedent whose death is under investigation. If the decedent's body or part is medically suitable for transplantation, therapy, research or education, the medical examiner shall release postmortem examination results to the OPO. The OPO may make a subsequent disclosure of the postmortem examination results or other information received from the medical examiner to support the purposes of the donation. (b) Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter or any other law to the contrary, if the medical examiner has notice, by an advance health-care directive, will, card or other document or as otherwise provided in this chapter, that a deceased person whose death is under investigation is a donor, the medical examiner shall perform an examination, autopsy or analysis of tissues or organs only in a manner and within a time period compatible with the preservation of the tissues or organs for the purpose of transplantation. (c) If the examination, autopsy or analysis has not been undertaken under subsection (b) of this section, all of the following apply to cases involving a prospective organ donor: (1) A physician or technician authorized to remove an anatomical gift from a donor may remove the donated part from the body of a donor whose death is under investigation for acceptance by a person authorized to become a donee subject to paragraph (c)(2) of this section. (2) The medical examiner shall be invited to be present during organ recovery if, in the judgment of the medical examiner, those organs may be involved in the cause of death. While in attendance, if the medical examiner determines that the organs are involved in the cause of death, the medical examiner may request a biopsy of those organs or deny removal of the anatomical gift. The medical examiner shall explain in writing the reasons for determining that those organs may be involved in the cause of death and the basis for denying removal of the anatomical gift and shall include the written explanation in the records maintained by the medical examiner. (3) The OPO shall pay the reasonable costs for the professional services of the medical examiner associated with attending the recovery under paragraph (c)(2) of this section above.

This chapter modifies, limits and supersedes the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (Public Law 106-229, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7001 et seq.) but \u00a7 101(c) [15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7001(c)] of the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act or authorize electronic delivery of any of the notices described in \u00a7 103(b) [15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7003(b)] of the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act. (80 Del. Laws, c. 182, \u00a7 1.) Subchapter III Nondiscrimination in Access to Organ Transplantation \u00a7 2741. Legislative intent. The General Assembly finds that: (1) A mental or physical disability does not diminish a person's right to health care; (2) The \"Americans with of 1990\" [42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101 et seq.] prohibits discrimination against persons with disabilities, yet many individuals with disabilities still experience discrimination in accessing critical health-care services; (3) Individuals with mental and physical disabilities are at risk of being denied life-saving organ transplants based on assumptions that their lives are less worthy, that they are incapable of complying with post-transplant medical regimens, or that they lack adequate support systems to ensure such compliance; (4) Although organ transplant centers must consider medical and psychosocial criteria when determining if a patient is suitable to receive an organ transplant, transplant centers that participate in Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal funding programs are required to use patient selection criteria that result in a fair and nondiscriminatory distribution of organs; and (5) Delaware residents in need of organ transplants are entitled to assurances that they will not encounter discrimination on the basis of a disability. (81 Del. Laws, c. 169, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 2742. Definitions.

Findings and purpose. The General Assembly of the State has found that each year more than 350,000 Americans experience out-of-hospital sudden cardiac arrest. More than 95% of them die. In many cases, people die because life-saving defibrillators arrive on the scene too late, if at all. It is estimated that more than 100,000 deaths could be prevented each year if defibrillators were more widely available to designated users (responders). Many communities around the country have invested in 911 emergency response systems, emergency personnel and ambulance vehicles. However, many of these same communities do not have enough defibrillators. It is therefore the intent of this General Assembly to encourage greater acquisition, deployment and use of automated external defibrillators in communities within the State. (72 Del. Laws, c. 412, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 3002C. Definitions.

Subchapter II Animal Population Control Program and Spay/Neuter Fund \u00a7 3010F. Short title. This subchapter shall be known and may be cited as the \"Animal Population Control Program.\" (75 Del. Laws, c. 326, \u00a7 1; 79 Del. Laws, c. 377, \u00a7 2.) \u00a7 3011F. Findings. The General Assembly for the State of Delaware hereby finds that: (1) During 2002, of the 22,165 dogs and cats which were received at Delaware's primary animal facilities, of those received: a. Two thousand four hundred and nine (11%) were returned to their owners/guardians; while b. Seven thousand two hundred and ninety (33%) were adopted; and c. Twelve thousand six hundred and fifty-nine (57%) were euthanized. (2) During 2003, of the 24,510 dogs and cats which were received at Delaware's primary animal facilities, of those received: a. Two thousand one hundred and eighty-six animals (9%) were returned to their owners/guardians; while b. Seven thousand one hundred and twenty-five animals (29%) were adopted; and c. Thirteen thousand six hundred and fifty-three animals (56%) were euthanized.Title 16 - Health and Safety Page 245(3) During 2004, of the 21,254 dogs and cats which were received at Delaware's primary animal facilities, of those received: a. Two thousand one hundred and ninety-three animals (10.3%) were returned to their owners/guardians; while b. Five thousand five hundred animals (25.8%) were adopted; and c. Thirteen thousand and sixty-seven animals (61.4%) were euthanized. (4) During 2005, of the 21,062 dogs and cats which were received at Delaware's primary animal facilities or those received: a.

Thirteen thousand five hundred and eighty three animals (64.4%) were euthanized. (5) As Delaware's human population growth rate increases so too will the population growth rate of the dog and cat populations, the intake at animal facilities and the consequent disposition rates associated therewith. (6) Controlling the dog and cat population would have a significant benefit to the public health and safety in the following manner: a. Reducing nuisance complaints regarding homeless dogs and cats; b. Reducing the number of homeless dogs and cats seeking to mate; c. Reducing the number of dog and cat bite cases involving children; d. Minimizing opportunities for rabies transmission; e. Decreasing the number of automobile accidents caused by stray dogs and cats; and f. Reducing cruelty to animals opportunities by addressing and decreasing the presence of unwanted/nuisance populations. (7) This subchapter recognizes the economic hardships associated with animal population control, the problems associated with homeless animals, and the societal impacts associated with failing to address these problems and establishes a program focused upon addressing dog and cat population control by providing a means by which population control and rabies vaccinations may be financed.

In the event a dog tag is issued, the tag shall be of a design to be adopted by the Department, and shall be affixed to the collar by the owner of such dog. Dog collars with associated state tags may be removed and need not be worn at all times when the dog is licensed under a kennel or retail dog outlet and is housed in an enclosure or a pen. If the collar has been removed, a valid dog tag and license must be readily available for review by an animal welfare officer as proof that the individual dog is licensed. Dogs engaged in the act of hunting are exempted from wearing tags while they are in the act of hunting, but individuals hunting with dogs must have some means of valid identification on the dog, and a valid dog tag and license must be available for review by an animal welfare officer while the dog is in the act of hunting.

(2) Pursuant to a legally obtained search warrant. (c) If, upon inspection or investigation, the premises or facilities are found not to satisfy the requirements specified in \u00a7 3044F of this title for the humane handling, care, and treatment of dogs, the operator of such premises or facilities shall be issued a warning identifying the deficiencies. Such operator shall have a warning period of a minimum of 10 business days to bring the premises or facility into compliance with \u00a7 3044F of this title, but the Department may extend the warning period by up to 60 days. If, upon expiration of the warning period, such premises or facilities have not been brought into compliance, the operator shall be fined in accordance with the terms specified in \u00a7 107(a) of this title. The Department may also issue an order suspending the kennel license or retail dog outlet license, if any, until the cited deficiencies are remedied.

The tether shall be of a type commonly used for the size dog involved, made of material not normally susceptible to being severed by the dog through chewing or otherwise. Tethers shall be attached to the dog by means of a well-fitted collar that will not cause trauma or injury to the dog. Tethers shall not be attached to a choke, pinch, prong, or martingale collar. The tether shall be a minimum of 10 feet in length and allow the dog convenient access to the dog house and to food and water containers. The dog may not be tethered for more than 2 hours when the dog owner or a responsible person is not present on the property.

(a) Declaration of policy. \u2014 (1) The dairy industry is a paramount industry of the State and the production, processing, packaging, distribution and sale of frozen desserts is an important segment of the dairy industry and is of vast economic importance to the State and of vital importance to the consuming public of the State and should be encouraged and promoted in the public interest. It is in the interest of the dairy industry and of the consuming public that there be uniformity of standards for frozen desserts as between the various states and the federal government to the end that there may be free movement of frozen desserts between the states and to the end that the inefficiency, needless expense and confusion caused by differences in products sold under the same name, and differences in labeling of identical products may be eliminated. (2) It is the purpose of this chapter to promote honesty and fair dealing in the interest of consumers, to insure fair competition between the manufacturers and distributors of the different products and to prevent confusion and deception in the sale of all such products by establishing definitions and standards of identity for such products and by providing for rules and regulations which will effect their orderly marketing and insure uniform and proper sanitary standards. (b) Definitions. \u2014 For the purpose of this chapter and for any rules, regulations, definitions, standards of identity or labeling requirements promulgated pursuant thereto, the term \"frozen desserts\" shall be deemed to include ice cream, frozen custard, French ice cream, French custard ice cream, artificially sweetened ice cream, artificially sweetened ice milk, ice milk, fruit sherbet, water ice, quiescently frozen confection, quiescently frozen tortoni, mellorine frozen desserts as all such products are commonly known, together with any mix used in such frozen desserts, and any products which are similar in appearance, odor or taste to such products or are prepared or frozen as such products are customarily prepared or frozen whether made with dairy or nondairy products.

It is further intended that this chapter and definitions and standards of identity promulgated in accordance herewith be construed in a manner similar to the corresponding federal regulation, aforesaid, whenever possible. (b) The Department of Agriculture shall, after public hearing, promulgate definitions and standards of identity for frozen desserts, regulations for the labeling of any frozen desserts and regulations to implement the purposes of this chapter. Definitions and standards of identity promulgated by the Department shall not be in conflict with federal standards. The Department may adopt such definitions and standards of identity as are adopted by the United States Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare as aforesaid. (c) Public hearings as provided in subsection (b) of this section shall be held only upon reasonable notice to all interested parties as provided by law in like cases. Following any hearing to consider rules, regulations, definitions, standards of identity, labeling requirements or any of these, the Department shall issue a recommended decision and shall afford interested parties an opportunity to file exceptions based upon the hearing record. The Department in issuing a final decision shall rule on any exceptions filed setting forth its reasons therefor. No definition or standard of identity promulgated by the Department shall conflict with federal definitions or standards of identity. With each rule or regulation adopted there shall be filed and made available upon request to any interested person the findings of fact supporting such rule or regulation. A copy of each proposed rule or regulation of the Department of Agriculture shall be printed and generally distributed, and specially distributed to any person who signified an interest theretofore or thereafter. No rule or regulation shall take effect or be effective until 30 days after general distribution or such longer time as the Secretary of Agriculture shall deem to be in the public interest. Rules and regulations promulgated in accordance with this authority shall have the force and effect of law and supersede all local ordinances and regulations inconsistent therewith. Any interested person aggrieved by any rule or regulation promulgated in accordance with this authority may have an appeal within 20 days after the effective date of such rule or regulation by petition to the Court of Chancery and may appeal from the decision of the Court of Chancery as provided for in other cases.

(a) The Secretary shall register an applicant as a pharmacy, distributor, manufacturer, practitioner, researcher or other controlled substance registrant for purposes of manufacturing, distributing or dispensing, some or all of the controlled substances included in Schedules I-V who has an active, relevant underlying professional license in the State unless the Secretary determines that the issuance of that registration would be inconsistent with the public interest.

Practitioners registered under federal law to conduct research with Schedule I substances may conduct research with Schedule I substances within this State upon furnishing the Secretary evidence of that federal registration. (d) Compliance by manufacturers and distributors with the federal law respecting registration (excluding fees) entitles them to be registered under this chapter. (16 Del. C. 1953, \u00a7 4733; 58 Del. Laws, c. 424, \u00a7 1; 70 Del. Laws, c. 186, \u00a7 1; 71 Del. Laws, c. 288, \u00a7 8; 79 Del. Laws, c. 164, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 4734.

Laws, c. 243, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 6.) \u00a7 4801B. Findings and purpose. (a) It is the intent of the General Assembly that the Prescription Opioid Impact Fund be established under this chapter to fund prevention and treatment of opioid addiction. In establishing the Prescription Opioid Impact Fund, the General Assembly finds as follows: (1) The Prescription Opioid Impact Fund is needed to prevent and respond to the dramatic increase in opioid addiction in this State. (2) The Prescription Opioid Impact Fund is needed to protect the public health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of this State. (3) In the 4 years prior to the creation of the Prescription Opioid Impact Fund, prescription opioids were dispensed to Delaware residents as follows: a. In 2015, 870,017 prescriptions for 59,138,601 individual doses totaling 1,104,171,268 MMEs. b. In 2016, 831,005 prescriptions for 56,440,474 individual doses totaling 1,050,147,346 MMEs. c. In 2017, 750,944 prescriptions for 49,875,000 individual doses totaling 921,842,143 MMEs. d. In 2018, 750,691 prescriptions for 46,125,690 individual doses totaling 826,770,680 MMEs. (4) There is a direct connection in this State between the quantity and strength of opioids prescribed to citizens and the rates of opioid addiction and overdose deaths. (5) There is a substantial nexus between the opioid manufacturers subject to the impact fee and the State, in part because only those manufacturers whose prescription opioids are dispensed in the State in amounts sufficient to meet the quarterly threshold in \u00a7 4804B(a) of this title are subject to the impact fee. (6) Opioid manufacturers receive revenues in connection with prescription opioids dispensed in in this State. (7) The Prescription Opioid Impact Fund will pay for a share of the cost incurred by the State of opioid substance abuse treatment and prevention. (8) The impact fee does not discriminate against interstate commerce, because both in-state and out-of-state opioid manufacturers are equally subject to its provisions. (9) The impact fee is fairly apportioned because it is based upon the volume of an opioid manufacturer's product dispensed within Delaware, with recognition that some manufacturers' products have different underlying costs and are sold at substantially different prices. (10) By paying a share of the cost of opioid addiction treatment and prevention, the opioid manufacturers receive assistance in promoting responsible product use and offset negative effect that these products have on Delaware residents. (b) It is the intent of this chapter to ensure that adequate public funds are available to do all of the following: (1) Prevent more individuals from becoming addicted to opioids. (2) Provide funding to defray expenses incurred by the Prescription Monitoring Program under this chapter. (3) Provide opioid addiction treatment to all Delawareans who have opioid addiction. (4) Fund emergency medical assistance to treat opioid overdoses. (82 Del. Laws, c. 37, \u00a7 1; 83 Del. Laws, c. 243, \u00a7 6.) \u00a7 4802B. Definitions.

(5) \"Morphine milligram equivalent\" or \"MME\" means the conversion factor used to calculate the strength of an opioid using morphine dosage as the comparative unit of measure.

Laws, c. 52, \u00a7 5.)Title 16 - Health and Safety Page 369Part IV Food and Drugs Chapter 49A The Delaware Medical Marijuana Act \u00a7 4901A. Findings. (a) Marijuana's recorded use as a medicine goes back nearly 5,000 years. Modern medical research has confirmed the beneficial uses for marijuana in treating or alleviating the pain, nausea, and other symptoms associated with a variety of debilitating medical conditions, including cancer, multiple sclerosis, and HIV/AIDS, as found by the National Academy of Sciences' Institute of Medicine in March 1999. (b) Studies published since the 1999 Institute of Medicine report have continued to show the therapeutic value of marijuana in treating a wide array of debilitating medical conditions. These include relief of the neuropathic pain caused by multiple sclerosis, HIV/AIDS, and other illnesses that often fails to respond to conventional treatments and relief of nausea, vomiting, and other side effects of drugs used to treat HIV/AIDS and hepatitis C, increasing the chances of patients continuing on life-saving treatment regimens. Specifically, in February 2010, the Center for Medicinal Cannabis Research released a lengthy report that summarized 15 recent studies clearly demonstrating marijuana's medical efficacy for a broad range of conditions. These studies, many of which were double blind, placebo-controlled trials, included neuropathic pain trials published in the Journal of Pain, Neuropsychopharmacology and Neurology , a study on the analgesic efficacy of smoked marijuana published in Anesthesiology , a study on the mechanisms of cannabinoid analgesia in rats published in Pain, and a study on vaporization as a \"smokeless\" marijuana delivery system published in Clinical Pharmacology & Therapeutics . (c) Marijuana has many currently accepted medical uses in the United States, having been recommended by thousands of licensed physicians to at least 350,000 patients in states with medical marijuana laws. Marijuana's medical utility has been recognized by a wide range of medical and public health organizations, including the American Academy of HIV Medicine, the American College of Physicians, the American Nurses Association, the American Public Health Association and the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society. (d) Data from the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Uniform Crime Reports and the Compendium of Federal Justice Statistics show that approximately 99 out of every 100 marijuana arrests in the U.S. are made under state law, rather than under federal law. Consequently, changing state law will have the practical effect of protecting from arrest the vast majority of seriously ill patients who have a medical need to use marijuana. (e) Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, Maine, Michigan, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, New Jersey, Oregon, Vermont, Rhode Island, and Washington have removed state-level criminal penalties from the medical use of marijuana. Delaware joins in this effort for the health and welfare of its citizens. (f) States are not required to enforce federal law or prosecute people for engaging in activities prohibited by federal law. Therefore, compliance with this chapter does not put the State of Delaware in violation of federal law. (g) State law should make a distinction between the medical and nonmedical uses of marijuana. Hence, the purpose of this chapter is to protect patients with debilitating medical conditions, as well as their health-care practitioners and providers, from arrest and prosecution, criminal and other penalties, and property forfeiture if such patients engage in the medical use of marijuana.

(e) A voluntary patient may make a written request to the attending psychiatrist to be discharged at any time. Upon the receipt of such request, the attending psychiatrist shall discharge the person within 72 hours from the receipt of the request, except if a psychiatrist or licensed independent practitioner certifies that the voluntary patient is currently demonstrating behaviors believed to be dangerous to self or dangerous to others and these behaviors are documented in the medical record, an emergency detention may be initiated for the person. No person may be involuntarily hospitalized unless in compliance with the emergency detention procedures set forth in \u00a7 5004 of this title. (f) If any applicant is under the age of 18 years old, the following provisions shall apply: (1) In the case of voluntary admission to a designated psychiatric treatment facility or hospital, consent to treatment shall be given only by a parent, legal guardian, or the Department's Director or Deputy Director of the Division of Family Services when the applicant is in DSCYF custody pursuant to Chapter 25 of Title 13. The request for admission to the designated psychiatric treatment facility or hospital shall be signed by either the applicant's parent, legal guardian, or the Department's Director or Deputy Director of the Division of Family Services when the applicant is in DSCYF custody pursuant to Chapter 25 of Title 13. (2) A voluntary patient or the voluntary patient's parent, legal guardian, or the Department's Director or Deputy Director of the Division of Family Services when the applicant is in DSCYF custody pursuant to Chapter 25 of Title 13 may make a written request to the attending psychiatrist to be discharged at any time. a. The provisions of subsection (e) of this section shall apply in such instances, except that the voluntary patient's discharge may be conditioned upon the consent of the voluntary patient's parent, legal guardian, or the Department's Director or Deputy Director of the Division of Family Services when the applicant is in DSCYF custody pursuant to Chapter 25 of Title 13. b. If the voluntary patient's parent, legal guardian or the Department's Director or Deputy Director of the Division of Family Services when the voluntary patient is in DSCYF custody pursuant to Chapter 25 of Title 13 requests the patient's discharge from a treatment facility against the advice of the treatment team and administrator of the facility, the facility may initiate involuntary treatment procedures as provided for under this chapter. The provisions of this paragraph shall apply as if the patient had made the request. (3) Voluntary outpatient treatment. \u2014 A person between 14 and 18 years of age, who is in need of mental health treatment, may request voluntary outpatient treatment from a licensed treatment facility or community provider. If the individual in need of treatment is a minor under 14 years of age, a parent, legal custodian, or legal guardian shall make the request for voluntary outpatient mental health treatment and give written consent for treatment. a. If a minor is 14 years of age or over, then either the minor, or a parent, legal custodian, or legal guardian may give written consent to a licensed treatment facility or community provider for voluntary, outpatient treatment. b. Consent so given by a minor 14 years of age or over shall, notwithstanding the minor's minority, be valid and fully effective for all purposes and shall be binding upon such minor, the minor's parents, custodian, and legal guardian as effectively as if the minor were of full legal age at the time of giving such written consent. The consent of no other person or court shall be necessary for the treatment rendered such minor. c. A minor's consent is not necessary when a parent, legal custodian, or legal guardian of an individual less than 18 years of age provides consent to voluntary outpatient mental health treatment on behalf of the minor. d. A minor, including those age 14 and older, may not abrogate consent provided by a parent, legal custodian, or legal guardian on the minor's behalf. Nor may a parent, legal custodian, or legal guardian abrogate consent given by a minor age 14 and older on his or her own behalf. e. This section does not authorize a minor to receive psychotropic drugs without the consent of the minor's parent, legal custodian, or legal guardian. Only a parent, legal guardian, or legal custodian may provide consent for the administration of such medication. (4) A psychiatrist designated by the Secretary of the Department of Services for Children, Youth and Their Families may conduct an independent review to determine whether an applicant who receives financial assistance from such Department or who is in the custody of such Department is appropriate for voluntary hospitalization. (g) Notwithstanding any other section of the Delaware Code, the Medical Director of the Department's Division of Substance Abuse and Mental Health shall have the independent authority to discharge persons at the Delaware Psychiatric Center. (h) The Department will pay for a voluntary admission of a patient to a designated psychiatric treatment facility or hospital pursuant to the same Departmental criteria as an involuntary admission or community placement. (79 Del. Laws, c. 442, \u00a7 1; 70 Del. Laws, c. 186, \u00a7 1; 81 Del. Laws, c. 79, \u00a7 22; 83 Del. Laws, c. 432, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 5004. Emergency detention of a person with a mental condition; justification; procedure. (a) Any person who believes that another person's behavior is both the product of a mental condition and is dangerous to self or dangerous to others may notify a peace officer or a credentialed mental health screener or juvenile mental health screener and request assistance for said person. Upon the observation by a peace officer or a credentialed mental health screener or juvenile mental healthTitle 16 - Health and Safety Page 389screener that such individual with an apparent mental condition likely constitutes a danger to self or danger to others, such person with an apparent mental condition shall be promptly taken into custody for the purpose of an emergency detention by any peace officer in the State without the necessity of a warrant. Any such observation shall be described in writing and shall include a description of the behavior and symptoms which led the peace officer or credentialed mental health screener or juvenile mental health screener to such conclusion. The documentation required herein shall set forth any known relationship between the person making the complaint and any other connection to the person with an apparent mental condition and, if known, the name of the nearest known relative. (b) An emergency detention may only be initiated by a credentialed mental health screener or, if the individual is under the age of 18, by a juvenile mental health screener. An individual may be held on an emergency detention if it reasonably appears to a credentialed mental health screener or juvenile mental health screener that the person is acting in a manner that appears to be dangerous to self or dangerous to others. The credentialed mental health screener or juvenile mental health screener shall verify this finding in writing and complete the Department-approved emergency detention form; this documentation shall include the credentialed mental health screener or juvenile mental health screener's rationale for the detention, including specific information regarding the alleged mental condition and dangerous behaviors observed. Once the emergency detention form is completed, designated transportation personnel shall be directed by the Department to transport the person to a designated psychiatric treatment facility to for an evaluation. The emergency detention does not start until the person is presented to a designated psychiatric treatment facility. (c) An emergency detention will result in admission to a designated psychiatric treatment facility for psychiatric observation, assessment, acute treatment, and any recommendations for referral for other services. Any referral for an emergency detention shall include a review of any advance health-care directive as set forth in this title or any other similar agreement relating to the person's wishes regarding potential hospitalization, care, treatment, and notifications to others if known to the credentialed mental health screener and available for review at the time of such referral. (d) Individuals under the age of 18 may be emergently detained when the minor's parent or legal guardian is unwilling to consent to the individual being admitted to a facility voluntarily for assessment or care, or whose parent or legal guardian cannot be identified and located. A psychiatrist designated by the Secretary of the Department of Services for Children, Youth and Their Families may conduct an independent review of a determination that a person under 18 years of age admitted to a designated psychiatric treatment facility or hospital pursuant to an emergency detention is dangerous to self or dangerous to others. (e) Once an individual is emergently detained in a designated psychiatric treatment facility pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, a psychiatrist shall review all documentation, conduct an examination of the individual, and document the findings of examination within the emergency detention time period both in the person's medical record and the emergency detention findings form. If the examining psychiatrist finds that the individual with an apparent mental condition is not dangerous to self and is not dangerous to others the psychiatrist shall certify these specific findings in writing and the individual who has been emergently detained shall be discharged from custody forthwith. All documentation required by this section will be recorded and retained in the medical record of that individual and reported to the Delaware Division of Substance Abuse and Mental Health, or if the individual is a minor to the Division of Prevention and Behavioral Health Services, upon the discharge of the individual. (f) If, at any time, an individual who is emergently detained agrees to go to a designated psychiatric treatment facility for further observation, a voluntary admission will be sought to fulfill the needed evaluation and the emergency detention order will become void. If a physician affiliated with an emergency department has completed an emergency medicine health assessment, as determined solely by such physician, and refers the patient to a credentialed mental health screener or juvenile mental health screener, with or without consultation with a psychiatrist, such a referral constitutes an appropriate discharge plan and after such discharge the physician affiliated with an emergency department will have no further responsibility for the evaluation and disposition of the patient. (g) In the event that the psychiatrist at a designated psychiatric treatment facility determines that the person who has been emergently detained meets the criteria for further care and treatment and that such required care cannot be provided in an available, less restrictive, more community-integrated setting, such psychiatrist shall immediately initiate the provisional admission process as set forth in \u00a7 5005 of this title. Any such determination must be based upon observed and evaluated behavior and, if available, reliable information provided by other sources regarding the person's mental condition. Any involuntary commitment of said person shall be only to a hospital designated by the Secretary to provide such care and treatment. (h) A designated psychiatric treatment facility that receives a minor on an emergency detention shall promptly make a reasonable and good-faith effort to contact that person's parent or legal guardian. (i) All professional personnel employed by the State or private providers are mandated to disclose any potential or apparent conflicts of interest regarding their participation in the emergency detention of any individual with an apparent mental condition to any psychiatric facility. Such conflicts of interest shall be disclosed on the emergency detention form and may include, but are not limited to, employment by a privately operated psychiatric facility, a personal relationship with the individual being detained or committed involuntarily, a relationship with family or significant others of the individual being detained or committed involuntarily, or being the victim of a crime by the person being detained or committed involuntarily. (j) No person will be detained or otherwise involuntarily committed to a designated psychiatric treatment facility unless a credentialed mental health screener or juvenile mental health screener determines that such detention or commitment is the least restrictive and most community-integrated means to adequately treat the person that is immediately available.Title 16 - Health and Safety Page 390(k) The Department is authorized to establish regulations consistent with this chapter. These regulations shall include rules regarding the disclosure by credentialed mental health screeners and juvenile mental health screeners of potential conflicts of interest. (79 Del. Laws, c. 442, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 5005. Provisional hospitalization by psychiatrist's certification. (a) No person will be involuntarily admitted to a hospital as a patient until the person is detained for observation pursuant to the procedure set forth in \u00a7 5004 of this title. At the completion of the emergency detention period, the person shall not be admitted to a hospital except pursuant to the written certification of a psychiatrist that based upon the psychiatrist's examination of such person: (1) Appears to be a person with a mental condition; (2) The person has been offered voluntary inpatient treatment and has declined such care and treatment or lacks the capacity to knowingly and voluntarily consent to such care and treatment; (3) As a result of the person's apparent mental condition, the person poses a present threat, based upon manifest indications, of being dangerous to self or dangerous to others; and (4) Less restrictive alternatives have been considered and determined to be clinically inappropriate at the present time. (b) The psychiatrist's certificate shall state with particularity the behavior and symptoms upon which the psychiatrist's opinion is based, shall include (where available) the name and address of the spouse or other nearest relative or person of close relationship to the alleged person with a mental condition, and shall state that such person is not willing to accept hospital care and treatment on a voluntary basis or that the person is incapable of voluntarily consenting to such care and treatment. The certificate shall also set forth the date of the psychiatrist's determination. The hospital shall thereupon advise the involuntary patient of the patient's rights under this chapter in language that is understandable to the individual. Upon completion of the psychiatrist's certificate, the individual shall be detained for an additional 48-hour period. (c) If the examining psychiatrist at the hospital determines that the involuntary patient no longer meets the criteria for provisional admission, the psychiatrist shall so certify in writing and the hospital shall immediately discharge the person. Prior to such discharge, the hospital shall provide the person with a copy of the certificate stating that the person was not involuntarily committed for any legal purpose. (d) If the person seeks voluntary care and treatment after being provisionally admitted under this section, the provisional admission will terminate and the person shall be voluntarily admitted to a hospital without delay. (e) The 48-hour observation period prescribed in this section shall be referred to as \"provisional admission.\" An individual who is provisionally admitted pursuant to this chapter shall not be considered \"involuntarily committed\" for any legal purpose. (60 Del. Laws, c. 95, \u00a7 1; 70 Del. Laws, c. 186, \u00a7 1; 78 Del. Laws, c. 179, \u00a7 175; 79 Del. Laws, c. 442, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 5006. Duties of hospital upon provisional admission. During the 48-hour period of provisional admission: (1) The hospital shall try to evaluate the involuntary patient to assess the person's psychological and physical needs, and may provide treatment to the involuntary patient as clinically appropriate and consistent with the State's Mental Health Patients' Bill of Rights pending the involuntary patient's probable cause hearing; (2) A psychiatrist designated by the Secretary of the Department of Services for Children, Youth and Their Families may, at any time prior to the commencement of judicial proceedings to determine the mental condition of a minor or an individual over the age of 18 who is receiving financial assistance or is in the custody of the Department, conduct an independent review of a determination that such a person is a person with a mental condition. If the psychiatrist determines that such person is not a person with a mental condition, the Department may withhold financial assistance for the diagnosis, care or treatment of such person; (3) The hospital shall document in the patient's medical record whether or not the involuntary patient can afford counsel and an independent psychiatrist or other licensed mental health professional to serve as an expert witness on the individual's behalf. (60 Del. Laws, c. 95, \u00a7 1; 66 Del. Laws, c. 424, \u00a7\u00a7 3, 4; 68 Del. Laws, c. 310, \u00a7 1; 70 Del. Laws, c. 186, \u00a7 1; 78 Del. Laws, c. 179, \u00a7\u00a7 177, 178; 79 Del. Laws, c. 442, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 5007. Procedural rights of involuntary patients. When a designated treatment facility, hospital or outpatient treatment provider seeks to require an individual to be involuntarily hospitalized pursuant to a probable cause hearing or an involuntary inpatient commitment hearing, or seeks to have the individual placed on involuntary outpatient treatment over objection, or engage in a specific mode of treatment without the individual's consent, the individual shall be entitled: (1) To notice, including a written statement, of the factual grounds upon which the proposed hospitalization, outpatient treatment over objection, or treatment without consent is predicated and the reasons for the necessity of such course of action. (2) To hearings before the court and to judicial determinations of whether or not the individual satisfies the requirements for a probable cause hearing, involuntary inpatient commitment, outpatient treatment over objection, or treatment without consent pursuant to the criteria set out in the relevant sections of this chapter. Such hearings shall be without jury and not open to the public, shall be preceded by written notice to the individual, and the individual shall be entitled to be present at all such hearings.Title 16 - Health and Safety Page 391(3) To be represented by counsel at all judicial proceedings, such counsel to be court-appointed if the individual cannot afford to retain counsel; and to be examined by an independent psychiatrist or other qualified medical expert and to have such psychiatrist or other expert testify as a witness on the individual's behalf, such witness to be court appointed if the involuntary patient cannot afford to retain such witness. (4) To conduct discovery, to summon and cross-examine witnesses, to present evidence on the person's own behalf and to avail the individual's own self of all other procedural rights afforded litigants in civil causes. The privilege against self-incrimination shall be applicable to all proceedings under this chapter. (5) To have a full record made of the proceedings, including findings adequate for review. All records and pleadings shall remain confidential unless the court for good cause orders otherwise. (6) To be notified in writing of the right to appeal a decision made by the court pursuant to \u00a7 5014 of this title. (60 Del. Laws, c. 95, \u00a7 1; 70 Del. Laws, c. 186, \u00a7 1; 78 Del. Laws, c. 179, \u00a7 179; 79 Del. Laws, c. 442, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 5008. Probable cause complaint. (a) If an involuntary patient has not been discharged by the hospital by the end of the 48-hour provisional admission period, the hospital shall file a verified complaint for involuntary civil commitment in the Superior Court or in the Family Court if the involuntary patient would otherwise be amenable to Family Court jurisdiction under other provisions of law. The complaint shall set forth in detail facts to show that the hospital, as petitioner, reasonably and in good faith believes that the involuntary patient (who shall be named as respondent) is a person who meets the standard for involuntary inpatient commitment set forth in \u00a7 5011 of this title, and who should be continued as a patient at the hospital pursuant to this chapter until the patient is determined no longer to meet the criteria for involuntary inpatient hospitalization. The complaint shall also aver that the involuntary patient has been advised of the patient's rights under this chapter. Copies of the emergency detention certificate and the provisional admission certificate shall be attached to the complaint. A notarized affidavit indicating that a hospital official has reviewed each complaint shall be filed, with the original copy sent to the court to be maintained in the patient's file. (b) The hospital's affidavit filed with the complaint shall indicate whether the involuntary patient is able to afford counsel and whether the patient requested an independent psychiatric witness. (60 Del. Laws, c. 95, \u00a7 1; 62 Del. Laws, c. 300, \u00a7\u00a7 2-5; 68 Del. Laws, c. 310, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 3; 70 Del. Laws, c. 186, \u00a7 1; 78 Del. Laws, c. 179, \u00a7 180; 79 Del. Laws, c. 442, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 5009. Probable cause hearing. (a) Upon the filing of the probable cause complaint the court shall forthwith: (1) Schedule a probable cause hearing to determine whether probable cause exists for the involuntary patient's confinement, and, where necessary, appoint counsel to represent the involuntary patient. Such probable cause hearing shall be held as soon as practicable, but no later than 8 working days from the filing of the complaint. Hearings may be conducted using electronic means, such as video conferencing. (2) Direct that notice of the probable cause hearing and copies of the pleadings be supplied to the involuntary patient, the patient's counsel and to the involuntary patient's spouse, other relative, close personal friend of the patient or any other person identified by the patient, provided that the patient is given the opportunity to agree, prohibit, or restrict the disclosure. (3) Enter such other orders as may be appropriate, including an order authorizing the continued provisional confinement of the involuntary patient until further order of the court. (b) (1) If, pursuant to the probable cause hearing, the court determines that probable cause does not exist for involuntary inpatient commitment, the involuntary patient shall be immediately discharged. (2) If the court determines that probable cause does exist for involuntary inpatient commitment, it shall schedule an involuntary inpatient commitment hearing, pursuant to \u00a7 5011 of this title, for the earliest practicable date, and no later than 8 working days after the probable cause hearing; and where necessary, it shall appoint an independent psychiatrist or other qualified medical expert to examine the involuntary patient and act as an expert witness on the involuntary patient's behalf. Notice of the hearing shall be given to the involuntary patient and the patient's counsel. (c) If the court determines that probable cause does not exist for involuntary inpatient commitment, but finds that an individual meets the criteria for outpatient treatment over objection, the court may order that an individual be placed on outpatient treatment over objection, pursuant to \u00a7 5013 of this title, and the next hearing shall be scheduled for 3 months after the probable cause hearing. The court may only place an individual on outpatient treatment over objection at a probable cause hearing if the issue has been appropriately noticed. (d) For good cause shown, the court may order that judicial proceedings under this chapter take place in the court in and for a county other than the county in which the action was initiated. (e) For purposes of this chapter and for any other legal purpose, no person shall be considered \"involuntarily committed\" until the court so orders following a probable cause hearing held pursuant to the requirements of this chapter. (f) If the court makes a determination under paragraph (b)(2) of this section or subsection (c) of this section, the court shall order an individual subject to a determination under paragraph (b)(2) of this section or subsection (c) of this section to relinquish any firearms or ammunition owned, possessed, or controlled by the individual.Title 16 - Health and Safety Page 392(g) The court may do any of the following through an order of relinquishment issued under subsection (f) of this section: (1) Require the individual subject to a determination under paragraph (b)(2) of this section or subsection (c) of this section to relinquish to a law-enforcement agency receiving the court's order any firearms or ammunition owned, possessed, or controlled by the individual. (2) Allow the individual subject to a determination under paragraph (b)(2) of this section or subsection (c) of this section to relinquish firearms or ammunition owned, possessed, or controlled by the individual to a designee of the individual. A designee of the individual must not reside with the individual and must not be a person prohibited under \u00a7 1448 of this title. The court must find that the designee of the individual will keep firearms or ammunition owned, possessed, or controlled by the individual out of the possession of the individual. (3) Prohibit the individual subject to a determination under paragraph (b)(2) of this section or subsection (c) of this section not to reside with another individual who owns, possesses, or controls firearms or ammunition. Nothing in this section may be construed to impair or limit the rights, under the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution or article I, \u00a7 20 of the Delaware Constitution, of an individual who is not the subject of the court's order of relinquishment. (4) Direct a law-enforcement agency having jurisdiction where the individual resides or the firearms or ammunition are located to immediately search for and seize firearms or ammunition of the individual subject to a determination under paragraph (b)(2) of this section or subsection (c) of this section if the Department of Justice shows that the individual has ownership, possession, or control of a firearm or ammunition. (h) An individual subject to an order of relinquishment under subsection (f) of this section may seek relief from the order under \u00a7 1448A(l) of Title 11. (60 Del. Laws, c. 95, \u00a7 1; 62 Del. Laws, c. 300, \u00a7 6; 68 Del. Laws, c. 310, \u00a7 4; 78 Del. Laws, c. 179, \u00a7 181; 79 Del. Laws, c. 442, \u00a7 1; 81 Del. Laws, c. 232, \u00a7 4.) \u00a7 5010. Discharge by the hospital. Notwithstanding the pendency of the action or any order previously entered by the court, if at any time after the complaint is filed the hospital determines that the involuntary patient no longer meets the criteria for provisional admission or involuntary inpatient commitment, the hospital shall so certify in writing and immediately discharge the person and advise the court of its determination and the discharge. Upon receipt of such certification, the court shall dismiss the action. A person involuntarily hospitalized pursuant to the emergency detention, provisional admission or involuntary commitment sections of this chapter may be discharged pursuant to this section without further order of the court. (60 Del. Laws, c. 95, \u00a7 1; 78 Del. Laws, c. 179, \u00a7 182; 79 Laws, c. 442, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 5011. Involuntary inpatient commitment hearing and procedure. (a) An individual shall be involuntarily committed for inpatient treatment only if all of the following criteria are met by clear and convincing evidence: (1) The individual is a person with a mental condition; (2) Based upon manifest indications, the individual is: a. Dangerous to self; or b. Dangerous to others; (3) All less restrictive alternatives have been considered and determined to be clinically inappropriate at the time of the hearing; and (4) The individual has declined voluntarily inpatient treatment, or lacks the capacity to knowingly and voluntarily consent to inpatient treatment. When evaluating capacity, the court shall consider an individual's ability to understand the significant consequences, benefits, risks, and alternatives that result from the individual's decision to voluntarily request or decline inpatient treatment. (b) The court shall set out specific findings of facts and conclusions of law which address each of the required criteria for involuntary commitment and which support its decision to involuntarily commit or discharge the individual. (c) If the court determines that an individual meets the criteria for involuntary commitment, the court shall enter an order of disposition which shall not exceed 3 months based upon the court's individualized assessment of the facts and circumstances at the time of the hearing. (d) Upon the expiration of the court order pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, if the individual has not been discharged by the hospital, and the hospital believes that the individual continues to require involuntary commitment, the court shall schedule a subsequent hearing which will be held in compliance with \u00a7 5007 of this title and this section. The individual shall be entitled to at least 14 working days' notice of any subsequent hearings. As long as an individual receives involuntary inpatient treatment, the court must convene a hearing in compliance with \u00a7 5007 of this title and this section at least once every 3 months to review whether continued involuntary inpatient treatment is necessary. (e) An individual, if represented by counsel, may waive, orally or in writing, any hearing under this section. The waiver must be submitted in writing to the court or be orally presented in open court. (60 Del. Laws, c. 95, \u00a7 1; 68 Del. Laws, c. 310, \u00a7\u00a7 6-8; 78 Del. Laws, c. 179, \u00a7 186; 79 Del. Laws, c. 442, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 5012. Waiver of rights; voluntary hospitalization. (a) An involuntary patient may waive any of the rights provided by this chapter if:Title 16 - Health and Safety Page 393(1) The court determines that such waiver is voluntary and with the involuntary patient's knowing and intelligent consent; or (2) Where the involuntary patient is incapable of knowingly and intelligently consenting, the court, upon application by counsel and after appropriate inquiry and finding of facts, approves such waiver for good cause shown. If the hearing provided for in \u00a7 5011 of this title is waived, the court shall enter an order of disposition in accordance with \u00a7 5011(c) of this title. (b) If prior to any hearing the court determines that the involuntary patient has knowingly and voluntarily applied for, and has been accepted for hospitalization pursuant to \u00a7 5003 of this title, the action shall be dismissed, and \u00a7 5003 of this title shall govern. (c) A legal guardian may not waive any right of an adult, including any right related to admission and judicial review, under this chapter. (60 Del. Laws, c. 95, \u00a7 1; 79 Del. Laws, c. 442, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 5013. Involuntary outpatient treatment over objection. (a) A person shall be involuntarily committed by the court for outpatient treatment over objection only if all of the following criteria are satisfied by clear and convincing evidence: (1) The person is 18 years of age or older. (2) The person has a documented mental condition. (3) The person is reasonably expected to become dangerous to self or dangerous to others or otherwise unlikely to survive safely in the community without treatment for the person's mental condition. (4) The person is currently refusing to voluntarily participate in the treatment plan recommended by the person's mental health treatment provider or lacks the capacity to determine whether such treatment is necessary. (5) The person has a documented history of lack of adherence with recommended treatment for the mental condition, or poses an extreme threat of danger to self or danger to others based upon recent actions, that has either: a. Resulted in a deterioration of functioning that was observed to be dangerous to the individual's personal health and safety; or b. Resulted in a deterioration of functioning that was observed to be imminently dangerous to self or dangerous to others, including but not limited to suicidal ideation, violent threats, or violence towards others. (6) All less restrictive treatment options have been considered and have either been determined to be clinically inappropriate at this time or evidence is offered to show that the person is not likely to adhere to such options. (b) The court shall set out specific findings of facts and conclusions of law which address each of the required criteria for involuntary outpatient treatment over objection and which support its decision to involuntarily commit or discharge the individual. (c) If the court determines that an individual meets the criteria for involuntary outpatient treatment over objection, the court shall enter an order of disposition which shall not exceed 3 months based upon the court's individualized assessment of the facts and circumstances at the time of the hearing. (d) The Department is responsible for ensuring the provision of all necessary services and supports to fully implement the court order, or for informing the court as quickly as possible if such services are not available and providing the court with an explanation of why such services are not available and when they are anticipated to become available. (e) Notwithstanding an order entered by the court pursuant to this section, an individual may be discharged by the individual's treating psychiatrist at any time if the treating psychiatrist determines that the individual no longer meets the clinical criteria for involuntary outpatient commitment. Upon such determination the psychiatrist shall so certify in writing and advise the court of its determination and the discharge. Upon the receipt of such certification, the court shall dismiss the action. (f) An individual or the individual's counsel may waive, orally or in writing, any hearing under this section. The waiver must be submitted in writing to the court or be orally presented in open court. (g) Should an individual committed by the court to involuntary outpatient treatment over objection engage in behavior in the community that is dangerous to self or dangerous to others, an emergency detention, consistent with \u00a7 5004 of this title, may be initiated. No individual may be involuntarily hospitalized unless the individual is initially emergently detained and is given the due process protections provided for in this chapter. (79 Del. Laws, c. 442, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 5014. Appeal; habeas corpus; rules of procedure. (a) Any party to the proceedings may appeal an order of disposition issued by a Commissioner to either a Superior Court Judge or Family Court Judge as appropriate within 10 days of the entry of such order. The appeal shall not operate as a stay of the order of disposition unless the Commissioner or Judge so directs.

Subchapter II-A Criminal Background Checks; Mandatory Drug Testing \u00a7 5137. Legislative intent; definitions. (a) Legislative intent. \u2014 The General Assembly's purpose in requiring criminal background checks and drug testing of Department of Health and Social Services' employees working at the Delaware Psychiatric Center is to protect the safety and well-being of the patients and staff of such facility. The provisions of this subchapter shall be broadly construed to accomplish this purpose. (b) Definitions. \u2014 (1) \"Applicant\" means any of the following: a. A person seeking employment with the Department in any position at the Delaware Psychiatric Center; or b. A current Department employee who seeks a promotion or transfer to any position at the Delaware Psychiatric Center; or c. A former employee who consents prior to leaving employment to periodic review of his or her criminal background for a fixed period of time. (2) \"Background Check Center (BCC)\" means the electronic system which combines the data streams from various sources within and outside the State of Delaware in order to assist an employer in determining the suitability of a person for employment. (3) \"Criminal history\" means a report from the Department of Health and Social Services regarding its review of the applicant's entire federal criminal history from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, pursuant to Public Law 92-544 as amended (28 U.S.C. \u00a7 534) and his or her Delaware record from the State Bureau of Identification. (4) \"Department\" means the Department of Health and Social Services; (5) \"Grandfathered employee\" means an employee of the Delaware Psychiatric Center, who was not fingerprinted pursuant to this statute because the employment commenced before June 15, 2010, and no requirement for fingerprinting has since applied (see paragraph (b)(1) of this section above). (6) \"Reasonable suspicion\" means the Department, acting through its supervisory personnel, has a reasonable basis to suspect that a Delaware Psychiatric Center employee: a. Has been convicted of a disqualifying crime since becoming employed; or b. Is impaired by an illegal drug. (77 Del. Laws, c. 292, \u00a7 1; 70 Del. Laws, c. 186, \u00a7 1; 78 Del. Laws, c. 303, \u00a7 4.) \u00a7 5138. Criminal background checks. (a) The Department shall not hire or employ an applicant for any position at the Delaware Psychiatric Center without first obtaining a report of the person's criminal history. (b) The Department shall promulgate regulations establishing the criteria for unsuitability for employment, including the types of criminal convictions which shall automatically disqualify a person from working at the Delaware Psychiatric Center and, as to other criminal convictions, the criteria for determining whether a particular individual is unsuitable for employment at the Delaware Psychiatric Center. (c) Conditional hire. \u2014 The requirements of subsection (a) of this section may be suspended for 60 days if the employer wishes to employ the applicant on a conditional basis. Before an employer may offer conditional employment, the employer must receive verification that the applicant has been fingerprinted by the SBI for purposes of the criminal history. No criminal history will be issued if the applicant fails to provide information to the Department regarding the status or disposition of an arrest within 45 days from the date of notice from the Department of an open criminal charge. (d) The Department shall immediately terminate the employment any Delaware Psychiatric Center employee who is, or has been, convicted of any disqualifying crime upon notification of such conviction. (e) The criminal history information provided to the employer, is strictly confidential. It may be used solely to determine the suitability of an applicant for employment or continued employment at the Delaware Psychiatric Center. (f) Before an applicant is permitted to be employed at the Delaware Psychiatric Center, the applicant must, upon request: (1) Provide accurate information sufficient to get a criminal history; (2) Execute a full release to enable the employer to secure a criminal history and to periodically update the criminal history while employed; (g) An applicant who fails to comply with subsection (f) of this section is subject to a civil penalty of not less than $1,000 nor more than $5,000 for each violation. (h) All grandfathered employees must be fingerprinted by the SBI within 120 days from the date of BCC (see \u00a7 7972(a) of Title 29) implementation. SBI:Title 16 - Health and Safety Page 401(1) Shall use the fingerprints to establish the grandfathered employee's identity and to assign an SBI identification number for the sole purpose of enabling the person's criminal record to be monitored for new arrests while the grandfathered employee continues to work at a long-term care facility, as defined in \u00a7 1102 of this title. (2) Shall not run a state or federal background check of the grandfathered employee, unless the grandfathered employee is also an applicant as defined in \u00a7 5137(b) of this title above; (3) Shall comply with \u00a7 1911 of Title 11. (77 Del. Laws, c. 292, \u00a7 1; 70 Del. Laws, c. 186, \u00a7 1; 78 Del. Laws, c. 303, \u00a7 4; 81 Del. Laws, c. 207, \u00a7 4.) \u00a7 5139. Drug testing required. (a) Preemployment testing. \u2014 The Department shall not hire or employ an applicant for any position at the Delaware Psychiatric Center without first obtaining the results of such applicant's mandatory drug screening. (b) Reasonable suspicion testing. \u2014 The Department, acting through its supervisory personnel, may also conduct a drug test based on a reasonable suspicion that a Delaware Psychiatric Center employee is impaired by an illegal drug. (c) Any person applying for employment with the Department in a position at the Delaware Psychiatric Center shall be required to submit to mandatory drug screening pursuant to this section and the regulations promulgated by the Department. Such regulations shall require drug testing for the following controlled substances: (1) Marijuana/cannabis; (2) Cocaine; (3) Opiates; (4) Phencyclidine (\"PCP\"); (5) Amphetamines; (6) Any other controlled substances specified by the Department in the regulations promulgated pursuant to this subchapter. (d) Conditional hire. \u2014 Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, whenever exigent circumstances exist, and the Department must fill a position in order to maintain an appropriate level of patient care, the Department may hire an applicant on a conditional basis when the Department receives evidence that the applicant has actually had the appropriate drug screening. The final employment of any applicant conditionally hired pursuant to this subsection shall be contingent upon receipt of the results of the drug screening. In addition, all applicants conditionally hired pursuant to \u00a7 5138 of this title shall be informed and acknowledge in writing that the results of those applicants' drug screens have been requested. Under no circumstances shall an applicant hired on a conditional basis pursuant to this subchapter remain employed on a conditional basis for more than 2 months. (e) Any applicant who wilfully fails to comply with the requirements of this section shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than $1,000 nor more than $5,000. (f) The Department shall adopt policies and procedures for imposing sanctions, which may include suspension and termination, upon any Delaware Psychiatric Center employee whose drug screen indicates that such employee has consumed an illegal drug or drugs. However, no such employee shall be sanctioned when the person has used or consumed the drug or drugs detected according to the directions and terms of a lawfully obtained prescription for such drug or drugs. (77 Del. Laws, c. 292, \u00a7 1; 70 Del. Laws, c. 186, \u00a7 1; 78 Del. Laws, c. 303, \u00a7 4.) Subchapter III Mental Hygiene Clinic \u00a7 5141. Establishment and composition.

The Department of Health and Social Services shall proceed under Chapter 50 of this title with respect to any decision to commit offenders transferred from the Department of Correction on an emergency basis. (Code 1935, c. 76; 46 Del. Laws, c. 190, \u00a7 3; 16 Del. C. 1953, \u00a7 5153; 49 Del. Laws, c. 57, \u00a7 1; 57 Del. Laws, c. 591, \u00a7 25; 66 Del. Laws, c. 424, \u00a7 10; 70 Del.

In addition to the posting, the Department shall distribute a copy of the list to each patient and to other persons, as provided in Department regulations. Each patient shall have the rights listed below, which shall be liberally construed to fulfill their beneficial purposes. Furthermore, in defining the scope or extent of any duty imposed by this section, higher or more comprehensive obligations established by otherwise applicable federal, state, or local enactments as well as certification standards of accrediting agencies may be considered. (1) Each patient shall receive care and treatment suited to the patient's needs, skillfully, safely and humanely administered with full respect for the patient's dignity and personal integrity. The care and treatment shall be provided in a setting and under conditions that restrict the patient's personal liberty only to the extent required by the patient's treatment needs, applicable law and judicial orders. (2) Each patient shall have an outcome-oriented, individualized, written treatment plan; treatment based on such plan; periodic review or revision of the plan consistent with treatment progress; and a description of treatment and other support services that may be needed upon discharge. (3) Each patient, and, if the patient is a minor, the patient's parents or legal guardian shall have the right to ongoing participation in a manner appropriate to the patient's capabilities, in the development and revision of an individualized treatment plan. In furtherance of this right, each patient, and, if the patient is a minor, the patient's parents or legal guardian shall minimally be provided with a reasonable explanation of the following: a. The patient's general mental condition and, if a facility has provided a physical examination, the patient's general physical condition; b. The objectives of treatment and the reasons why a particular treatment is considered appropriate; c. The expected benefits and risks of recommended treatments, including all significant potential adverse effects and the steps which may be taken to obviate or ameliorate such effects; d.

A realistic assessment of the patient's post-discharge social, financial, vocational, housing and treatment needs; b. Identification of available support services and provider linkages necessary to meet the assessed needs; and c. Identification and a timetable of discrete, predischarge activities necessary to promote the patient's successful transition to the community-based services system or to another appropriate post-discharge setting. (5) Absent a patient's informed, voluntary, written consent to a mode or course of treatment, each patient shall have the right not to receive the mode or course of treatment established pursuant to a treatment plan, except as follows:Title 16 - Health and Safety Page 404a. During an emergency situation, if such treatment is pursuant to and documented contemporaneously by the written order of a physician; or b. As authorized under applicable law or court order in the case of a person involuntarily committed to the facility; or c. In the case of a minor, as authorized by a parent or legal guardian. (6) Each patient shall have the right to be free from the following: a. Abuse, mistreatment and neglect, as proscribed by Chapters 9 and 11 of this title. b.

Seclusion, physical restraint, drugs or other interventions administered primarily for purposes of staff convenience; provided, however, that restraint or seclusion may be administered pursuant to and documented contemporaneously by the written order of an authorized, licensed mental health professional to the extent necessary to prevent physical harm to self or others. Administration of restraint under this subsection shall include the following safeguards: 1. Authorizing orders shall specify the form, duration, and conditions of restraint based on a deliberative determination that the restraint is the least restrictive alternative intervention to prevent physical harm to the patient or others; 2. The patient shall receive a medical examination within an hour of initiation of restraint by a physician, or, if a physician is not available, a nurse; 3. During the course of restraint the patient shall be closely monitored to assess well-being and facilitate prompt discontinuation of restraint when no longer necessary to prevent physical harm to the patient or others; 4. Subsequent to administration of restraint, an interactive clinical assessment shall be undertaken, which includes the patient, and, at the request of the patient, a representative of the protection and advocacy agency, to review catalysts resulting in the necessity of the restraint and appropriateness of revision to the individualized treatment plan. (7) Each patient shall be advised of the availability of any internal and external systems for reporting abuse, neglect and mistreatment, including those established by Chapters 9 and 11 of this title and the protection and advocacy agency. (8) The hospital or residential center shall require: a. Careful reexamination and evaluation of each patient not less than every 6 months; b. Periodic physical examination of each patient by a physician at least once a year; c. An order of a staff member, operating within the scope of a professional authority and based upon appropriate examination, before any treatment is administered; d.

(9) Each patient shall be entitled to communicate freely and privately with persons and groups inside and outside the facility, consistent with the safety and welfare of other patients and with avoiding serious harassment of others. Correspondence initiated to others by the patient shall be sent along promptly without being opened. The facility shall establish procedures to insure that patients have a full opportunity to conduct correspondence, to have reasonable and confidential access to telephones, and, subject to treatment team limitation based on a clinical determination of serious patient harm, to have frequent and convenient opportunities to meet with visitors. Any treatment team's limitation of such patient communication shall be documented in the patient's treatment plan and shall include the team's specific rationale. (10) A patient's right to retain reasonable personal belongings shall be respected, except that the facility may temporarily retain custody of a patient's personal property for the patient's protection; provided, that such property is used or conserved for the support of the patient. The patient is entitled to a receipt for any personal property over which the facility retains temporary custody. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to relieve any patient from the obligations arising out of \u00a7 5019 of this title. (11) Each patient shall have the right to participate in available vocational rehabilitation, community care or release programs consistent with the patient's treatment plan. It is recognized that work programs can be therapeutic and, therefore, may be included in a patient's individualized treatment plan provided that the following conditions are met: a. The facility must document in the individualized treatment plan the patient's need or desire for work; b. The individualized treatment plan must specify the nature of the work to be performed and whether the work is to be voluntary or paid; c. The patient must consent to the work program described in the treatment plan; and d. The patient must be aware that the patient may withdraw consent to the work program at any time. To the extent specifically authorized by the Department of Labor, workers' compensation law and unemployment insurance law shall not apply to any patient engaged in work programs pursuant to this paragraph.Title 16 - Health and Safety Page 405(12) Each patient who, but for a mental disability, would be entitled to attend a public school shall receive the same training and education that the patient would otherwise be entitled to receive in the patient's local school district. The facility shall arrange for such training and education, which shall be consistent with the mental ability of the patient, and shall arrange for suitable resources and equipment to address the needs of those patients with visual or hearing impairments. (13) The hospital or residential center shall maintain a clinical record for each patient admitted. The clinical record shall contain complete information on all matters relating to the admission, legal status, care and treatment of the patient, and shall include all pertinent documents relating to the patient. Copies of informed consent forms signed by patients or guardians pursuant to paragraph (b)(8)d. of this section shall be kept with each patient's ward chart. The Department shall, by regulation, determine the scope and method of recording information maintained on the clinical records. Those regulations shall ensure the completeness and accuracy of data pertaining to admission, legal matters affecting the patient, records and notations of the course of care and treatment, therapies, the patient's progress if in research and adverse or other reactions thereto, restrictions on the patient's rights, periodic examinations and other information required by the Department. No information reported to the Department and no clinical records maintained with respect to patients shall be public records.

If the mentally disordered offender is a patient in a receiving state, the appropriate authorities of the sending state, upon recommendation of the appropriate authorities in the receiving state, shall, if they concur in the recommendation, file the petition contemplated by this paragraph. (b) The court shall hold a hearing on the petition within 30 days of the filing thereof.

(e) Promptly upon conclusion of the hearing, the court shall dismiss the untried indictment, information or complaint, if it finds that the purposes enumerated in paragraph (b) of this Article would be served thereby. Otherwise, the court shall make such order with respect to the petition and the untried indictment, information or complaint as may be appropriate in the circumstances and consistent with the status of the defendant as a mentally disordered offender in the custody of and subject to the jurisdiction of the sending state. (f) No fact or other matter established or adjudicated at any hearing pursuant to this Article, or in connection therewith, shall be deemed established or adjudicated, nor shall it be admissible in evidence in any subsequent prosecution of the untried indictment, information or complaint concerned in a petition filed pursuant to this Article unless: 1.

The defendant personally offers or consents to the introduction of the determination or adjudication at such subsequent proceedings.

In the case of an escape to a jurisdiction other than the sending or receiving state, the responsibility for return shall be that of the sending state, but nothing contained herein shall be construed to prevent or affect the activities of officers and agencies of any jurisdiction directed toward the apprehension and return of an escapee. ARTICLE VII Federal Aid Any state party to this compact may accept federal aid for use in connection with any facility or program the use of which is or may be affected by this compact or any contract pursuant thereto and any patient in a receiving state pursuant to this compact may participate in any such federally aided program or activity for which the sending and receiving states have made contractual provision, provided that, if such program or activity is not part of the customary regimen of the facility or program, the express consent of the appropriate official of the sending state shall be required therefor.

Interstate Compact on Mental Health. The Interstate Compact on Mental Health is enacted into law and entered into by this State with all other states legally joining therein in the form substantially as follows: INTERSTATE COMPACT ON MENTAL HEALTH The contracting states solemnly agree that: ARTICLE I The party states find that the proper and expeditious treatment of persons with mental conditions and mental disabilities can be facilitated by cooperative action to the benefit of the patients, their families and society as a whole. Further, the party states find that the necessity of and desirability for furnishing such care and treatment bears no primary relation to the residence or citizenship of the patient but that, on the contrary, the controlling factors of community safety and humanitarianism require that facilities and services be made available for all who are in need of them. Consequently, it is the purpose of this compact and of the party states to provide the necessary legal basis for the institutionalization or other appropriate care and treatment of persons with mental conditions and mental disabilities under a system that recognized the paramount importance of patient welfare and to establish the responsibilities of the party states in terms of such welfare. ARTICLE II As used in this compact: (a) \"Sending state\" shall mean a party state from which a patient is transported pursuant to the provisions of the compact or from which it is contemplated that a patient may be so sent. (b) \"Receiving state\" shall mean a party state to which a patient is transported pursuant to the provisions of the compact or to which it is contemplated that a patient may be so sent. (c) \"Institution\" shall mean any hospital or other facility maintained by a party state or political subdivision thereof for the care and treatment of mental conditions or mental disabilities. (d) \"Patient\" shall means any person subject to or eligible as determined by the laws of the sending state for institutionalization or other care, treatment or supervision pursuant to the provisions of this compact. (e) \"After-care\" shall mean care, treatment and services provided a patient, as defined herein, on convalescent status or conditional release. (f) \"Mental condition\" shall mean mental disease to such extent that a person so afflicted requires care and treatment for his or her own welfare or the welfare of others or of the community. (g) \"Mental disability\" shall mean mental deficiency as defined by appropriate clinical authorities to such extent that a person so afflicted is incapable of managing himself or herself and his or her affairs, but shall not include mental illness as defined herein. (h) \"State\" shall mean any state, territory or possession of the United States, the District of Columbia and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. ARTICLE III (a) Whenever a person physically present in any party state shall be in need of institutionalization by reason of mental condition or mental disability, he or she shall be eligible for care and treatment in an institution in that state irrespective of his or her residence, settlement or citizenship qualifications. (b) The provisions of paragraph (a) of this article to the contrary notwithstanding, any patient may be transferred to an institution in another state whenever there are factors based upon clinical determinations indicating that the care and treatment of said patient would be facilitated or improved thereby. Any such institutionalization may be for the entire period of care and treatment or for any portion or portions thereof. The factors referred to in this paragraph shall include the patient's full record with due regard for the location of the patient's family, character of the illness and probable duration thereof, and such other factors as shall be considered appropriate. (c) No state shall be obliged to receive any patient pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (b) of this article unless the sending state has given advance notice of its intention to send the patient, furnished all available medical and other pertinent records concerning the patient, given the qualified medical or other appropriate clinical authorities of the receiving state an opportunity to examine the patient if said authorities so wish, and unless the receiving state shall agree to accept the patient. (d) In the event that the laws of the receiving state establish a system of priorities for the admission of patients, an interstate patient under this compact shall receive the same priority as a local patient and shall be taken in the same order and at the same time that he or she would be taken if he or she were a local patient.Title 16 - Health and Safety Page 439(e) Pursuant to this compact, the determination as to the suitable place of institutionalization for a patient may be reviewed at any time and such further transfer of the patient may be made as seems likely to be in the best interest of the patient. ARTICLE IV (a) Whenever, pursuant to the laws of the state in which a patient is physically present, it shall be determined that the patient should receive after-care or supervision, such care or supervision may be provided in a receiving state. If the medical or other appropriate clinical authorities having responsibility for the care and treatment of the patient in the sending state shall have reason to believe that after-care in another state would be in the best interest of the patient and would not jeopardize the public safety, they shall request the appropriate authorities in the receiving state to investigate the desirability of affording the patient such after-care in said receiving state, and such investigation shall be made with all reasonable speed. The request for investigation shall be accompanied by complete information concerning the patient's intended place of residence and the identity of the person in whose charge it is proposed to place the patient, the complete medical history of the patient and such other documents as may be pertinent. (b) If the medical or other appropriate clinical authorities having responsibility for the care and treatment of the patient in the sending state and the appropriate authorities in the receiving state find that the best interest of the patient would be served thereby, and if the public safety would not be jeopardized thereby, the patient may receive after-care or supervision in the receiving state. (c) In supervising, treating or caring for a patient on after-care pursuant to the terms of this article, a receiving state shall employ the same standards of visitation, examination, care and treatment that it employs for similar local patients.

(c) No provision of this compact shall be construed to alter or affect any internal relationships among the department, agencies and officers of and in the government of a party state or between a party state and its subdivision as to the payment of costs or responsibilities therefor. (d) Nothing in this compact shall be construed to prevent any party state or subdivision thereof from asserting any right against any person, agency or other entity in regard to costs for which such party state or subdivision thereof may be responsible to any provision of this compact. (e) Nothing in this compact shall be construed to invalidate any reciprocal agreement between a party state and a nonparty state relating to institutionalization, care or treatment of persons with mental conditions or mental disabilities, or any statutory authority pursuant to which such agreements may be made.

(b) To every extent possible, it shall be the policy of states party to this compact that no patient shall be placed or detained in any prison, jail or lockup, but such patient shall, with all expedition, be taken to a suitable institutional facility for mental conditions or mental disabilities. ARTICLE X (a) Each party state shall appoint a \"compact administrator\" who, on behalf of his or her state, shall act as general coordinator of activities under the compact in his or her state and who shall receive copies of all reports, correspondence and other documents relating to any patient processed under the compact by his or her state either in the capacity of sending or receiving state.

ARTICLE XIII (a) A state party to this compact may withdraw therefrom by enacting a statute repealing the same.

Such practices shall be reported in accordance with the following categories unless the Secretary finds other categories to be more appropriate: a. Equipment, technology, process or procedure modifications. b. Reformulation or redesign of products. c. Substitution of raw materials. d. Improvement in management, training, inventory control, materials handling or other general operational phases of industrial facilities. (5) The amount expected to be reported under paragraphs (l)(1) and (2) of this section for the 2 calendar years immediately following the calendar year for which the report is filed. Such amount shall be expressed as a percentage change from the amount reported in paragraphs (l)(1) and (2) of this section. (6) A ratio of production in the reporting year to production in the previous year. The ratio should be calculated to most closely reflect all activities involving the toxic chemical. In specific industrial classifications subject to this section, where a feedstock or some variable other than production is the primary influence on waste characteristics or volumes, the report may provide an index based on that primary variable for each toxic chemical. (7) The techniques which were used to identify source reduction opportunities. Techniques listed should include, but are not limited to, employee recommendations, external and internal audits, participative team management and material balance audits. Each type of source reduction listed under paragraph (l)(4) of this section should be associated with the techniques or multiples of techniques used to identify the source reduction technique. (8) The amount of any toxic chemical released into the environment which resulted from a catastrophic event, remedial action or other 1-time event and is not associated with production processes during the reporting year. (9) The amount of the chemical from the facility which is treated (at the facility or elsewhere) during such calendar year and the percentage change from the previous year. (m) The Secretary may require the reporting of additional items of information as necessary to provide a comprehensive review of toxic chemical use, including the flow of toxic materials through a community to a facility; an understanding of the processes, release patterns and potential exposures within a facility; and an understanding of the final disposition of toxic materials. (n) To simplify reporting, the Secretary may modify the form established under subsection (k) of this section to include the items of information established under subsections (k), (l) and (m) of this section. (o) In order to provide the information required under this section, the owner or operator of a facility may use readily available data (including monitoring data) collected pursuant to other provisions of law or, where such data are not readily available, reasonable estimates of the amounts involved. Nothing in this section requires the monitoring or measurement of the quantities, concentration or frequency of any toxic chemical released into the environment beyond that monitoring and measurement required under other provisions of law or regulation. In order to assure consistency, the Secretary shall require that data be expressed in common units. (71 Del. Laws, c. 59, \u00a7 1; 70 Del. Laws, c. 186, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 6308.

Code for Energy Conservation. (a) Except as herein noted, no county or municipal building or plumbing code shall contain any provision which shall be materially at variance with most recent version of the International Code Council (ICC), International Energy Conservation Code (IECC). In effect, the highest available energy conservation code of the ICC/IECC as determined by the Delaware Energy Office shall be the referenced energy code for all new detached 1- and 2-story family dwellings and all other new residential buildings 3 stories or less in height. Energy standards for all other new buildings, to include high-rise residential, shall be established to meet the latest available standard of the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers/Illuminating Engineering Society of North America (ASHRAE/IESNA) as determined by the Delaware Energy Office; provided, however, the respective county or municipal governments may exclude agricultural structures from these provisions. The Delaware Energy Office shall adopt these updates pursuant to Chapter 101 of Title 29. (b) The Delaware Energy Office, or its successor, shall promulgate procedures for certification of compliance with these codes and standards to be utilized by respective local governments; provided, however, with respect to compliance with these codes and standards, for a commercial building of less than 5,000 square feet in size, the respective local government, rather than requiring that such compliance be certified by licensed engineers or architects, as is required with commercial buildings of 5,000 square feet or more, may elect to utilize a commercial buildings ASHRAE/IESNA Compliance Guide, to include computerized software compliance packages such as the Department of Energy developed COMcheck compliance software for insuring commercial energy code compliance and the Department of Energy developed REScheck compliance software for residential energy code compliance. An alternate compliance method for residential code compliance using ENERGY STAR documentation software may be used in lieu of the REScheck software. Code officials shall allow submission of documents that demonstrate energy efficiency that exceeds the requirements of the code when these state, local or national programs have been demonstrated to exceed the requirements of the code. (c) The Delaware Energy Office, or its successor, in consultation with the Green Building Council of the Home Builders Association of Delaware, shall establish programs to promote the construction of zero net energy homes. A \"zero net energy home\" or \"zero net energy building\" is defined as a residence or commercial building that, through the use of energy efficient construction, lighting, appliances and on-site renewable energy generation, results in zero net energy consumption from the utility provider. Therefore, a net zero energy capable home must be energy efficient enough that if the home or building owner chooses to add on-site generation, net zero energy consumption could be achieved. As of December 31, 2025, all new residential building construction in the State of Delaware shall be zero net energy capable. As of December 31, 2030, all new commercial building construction must also be zero net energy capable. (d) The Delaware Energy Office shall review the State Energy Code triennially for potential updates to the IECC energy code and ASHRAE energy code standard. (e) This section shall become effective on July 1, 2010. (f) From January 1, 2010, to June 30, 2010, sellers of new construction shall notify buyers of an option to purchase the construction built to the ICC/IECC 2009 code standard. (g) The Delaware Energy Office will conduct energy code training work shops for code officials, builders, architects, and engineers prior to July 1, 2010. (62 Del. Laws, c. 133, \u00a7 1; 70 Del.

Laws, c. 152, \u00a7 3.) \u00a7 9213. Credit of State not pledged.

All such bonds or notes shall contain on the face thereof a statement to the effect that neither the State nor any political subdivision thereof other than the Authority shall be obligated to pay the same or the interest thereon except from revenues of the project or projects or the portion thereof for which they are issued and that neither the faith and credit nor the taxing power of the State or of any political subdivision thereof other than the Authority is pledged to the payment of the principal of or the interest on such bonds. The issuance of bonds under this chapter shall not directly or indirectly or contingently obligate the State or any political subdivision thereof to levy or to pledge any form of taxation whatever therefor, or to make any appropriation for their payment. Nothing contained in this section shall prevent or be construed to prevent the Authority from pledging its full faith and credit or the full faith and credit of a participating facility to the payment of bonds or issue of bonds authorized pursuant to this chapter.

Such rates, rents, fees and charges shall be fixed and adjusted in respect of the aggregate of rates, rents, fees and charges from such project so as to provide funds sufficient with other revenues, if any, (1) to pay the principal of and the interest of such project as the same shall become due and payable and (2) to create and maintain reserves required or provided for in any resolution authorizing, or trust agreement securing, such revenue bonds of the Authority. Such rates, rents, fees and charges shall not be subject to supervision or regulation by any department, commission, board, body, bureau or agency of this State, other than the Authority. A sufficient amount of the revenues derived in respect of a project shall be set aside at such regular intervals as may be provided in such resolution or trust agreement in a sinking or other similar fund which is pledged to, and charged with, the payment of the principal of and the interest on such bonds or notes as the same shall become due, and the redemption price or the purchase price of bonds or notes retired by call or purchase as therein provided. Such pledge shall be valid and binding from the time when the pledge is made; the rates, rents, fees and charges and other revenues or other money so pledged and thereafter received by the Authority shall immediately be subject to the lien of such pledge without any physical delivery thereof or further act, and the lien of any such pledge shall be valid and binding as against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract or otherwise against the Authority, irrespective of whether such parties have notice thereof. Neither the resolution nor any trust agreement by which a pledge is created need be filed or recorded except in records of the Authority. The use and disposition of money to the credit of such sinking or other similar fund shall be subject to the provisions of the resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds or notes of such trust agreement. Except as may otherwise be provided in such resolution or trust agreement, such sinking or other similar fund shall be a fund for all such bonds or notes issued to finance a project or projects at 1 or more participating facilities as the case may be, without distinction or priority of 1 over another; provided the Authority in any such resolution or trust agreement may provide that such sinking or other similar fund shall be the fund for a particular project at a facility and for the bonds issued to finance a particular project and may, additionally, permit and provide for the issuance of bonds or notes having a subordinate lien in respect of the security authorized to other bonds or notes of the Authority and, in such case, the Authority may create separate or other similar funds in respect of such subordinate lien bonds.

(c) The paramedic services program shall be utilized for medical emergencies, either at the scene or while the patient is in transit to a health facility. (d) It is the further purpose of this chapter to provide a program which shall have a direct impact on the morbidity and mortality rates of this State and which, over a period of time, will also reduce health-care costs to each emergency patient. (e) It is the further purpose of this chapter to establish a framework for the creation of an effective and efficient means for the provision of advanced life support services to the citizens of the State regardless of their economic status, who require such services without prior inquiry as to the patient's ability to pay. (f) This chapter is intended to promote the public health, safety and welfare of the citizens of this State by providing for the creation of a statewide advanced life support services system, in conjunction with the efforts of all providers of emergency medical services in this State, with uniform standards for all such providers of advanced life support services. (g) It is the further purpose of this chapter to insure that emergency patients requiring advanced life support services are transported from the scene of a medical emergency to the nearest emergency medical institution or the institution of their choice, within reason, that possesses the equipment and staff resources to immediately attend to the particular needs of the patient. This statement is tempered by the understanding that, in certain circumstances, it may be necessary to bypass the closest medical facility if specialized medical care is required. It shall also be understood that the use of paramedics to assist in the transfer of patients to facilities and programs which offer such follow-up care and rehabilitation as is necessary to effect the maximum recovery of the patient, shall be permitted when deemed medically necessary.

The Commission shall give notice of intent to suspend or terminate to the governor of the defaulting state, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature, and each of the member states. 4.

The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. If judicial enforcement is necessary, the court shall award all costs of the litigation, including reasonable attorneys' fees, to the prevailing party. 3. The remedies contained in this section shall not be the exclusive remedies available to the Commission. The Commission may pursue any other remedies available under federal or state law. (81 Del. Laws, c. 178, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 98A-114. Date of implementation of the Interstate Commission for EMS Personnel Practice and associated rules, withdrawal, and amendment. A. The Compact takes effect on the date on which the Compact statute is enacted into law in the tenth member state. The provisions that become effective at that time are limited to the powers granted to the Commission relating to assembly and the promulgation of rules. Thereafter, the Commission shall meet and exercise rulemaking powers necessary to implement and administer the Compact. B. Any state that joins the Compact after the Commission's initial adoption of the rules is subject to the rules as they exist on the date on which the Compact becomes law in that state. Any rule that has been previously adopted by the Commission has the full force and effect of law on the day the Compact becomes law in that state. C. Any member state may withdraw from this Compact by enacting a statute repealing the statute. 1. A member state's withdrawal shall not take effect until 6 months after enactment of the repealing statute. 2. Withdrawal does not affect the continuing requirement of the withdrawing state's EMS authority to comply with the investigative and adverse action reporting requirements of this Compact prior to the effective date of withdrawal. D. Nothing contained in this Compact invalidates or prevents any EMS personnel licensure agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a member state and a nonmember state that does not conflict with the provisions of this Compact. E. The member states may amend the Compact. An amendment to this Compact is not effective and binding upon any member state until it is enacted into the laws of all member states. (81 Del. Laws, c. 178, \u00a7 1.)Title 16 - Health and Safety Page 601\u00a7 98A-115. Construction and severability. This Compact shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes of the Compact. If a court finds that this Compact is contrary to the constitution of any member state, the Compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining member states. Nothing in this Compact supersedes state law or rules related to licensure of EMS agencies. (81 Del.

Subchapter II Delaware Institute of Medical Education and Research \u00a7 9905. Findings. (a) The General Assembly finds and declares that the purpose of the Delaware Institute of Medical Education and Research (DIMER), created in 1969 as an alternative to a state sponsored medical school, is sound and should be continued and strengthened. Delaware should continue to provide opportunities for Delaware residents to receive a medical education, but it would not be a wise use of resources for the State to build and maintain a medical school. (b) The General Assembly finds and declares that the current arrangement between the State and Jefferson Medical College of Thomas Jefferson University, which allows Jefferson to function as Delaware's medical school, is extremely valuable to the State and has produced benefits which far surpass the admission of 20 Delaware residents into Jefferson Medical College each year. The relationship with Jefferson Medical College through DIMER is built upon years of a solid working relationship and should be perpetuated. (c) The General Assembly finds and declares that a new structure of the DIMER Board will more appropriately reflect DIMER's abilities to meet its responsibilities as outlined in this legislation. (d) The General Assembly finds and declares that placing administration of DIMER within the Delaware Health Care Commission will enhance its ability to accomplish its goals and ensure that DIMER's future functions will be focused on promoting medical education while helping the State to meet its health-care needs.

(a) The Delaware Health Care Commission shall develop a program to help Delaware children without access to health insurance to obtain health insurance at affordable cost to their families. The Program shall promote the important objectives of improving the health of uninsured Delaware children and reducing the cost-shifts to policyholders and hospitals caused by uncompensated care. Such program shall be called the Delaware Healthy Children Program (hereinafter in this section, the \"Program\" or \"CHIP\"). (b) The Program shall be administered and implemented by the Department of Health and Social Services [DHSS]. (c) The Program shall operate within the limits of the appropriations made for such purpose in the annual appropriations act. To the extent that private charitable or foundation support is available to implement the Program, such appropriations may be used for a public- private partnership to implement the Program in compliance with of this section. (d) The Program shall be designed to provide the ability to purchase insurance at a reasonable cost to uninsured Delaware children without access to affordable health insurance through their parents'/guardians' employers. The Program shall offer a managed care product that may require participants to pay regular premiums and may require participants to pay co-payments, and shall be designed to create incentives for participants to use health services in a prudent and responsible fashion. The Program shall also be designed to minimize the ability of private employers who provide health insurance coverage for their employees to eliminate such coverage, and, to the extent practicable, provide incentives for employers who provide no health insurance coverage for their employees to begin to provide such coverage. (e) The Program shall offer to children health insurance which emphasizes the prudent and responsible use of preventive services so as to improve the health of participants, promote the early detection of serious health problems such as cancer and to help reduce the need for more expensive care by addressing health problems which can be treated more inexpensively if identified in a timely manner. To this end, the health insurance plan offered by the Program shall offer participants the ability to obtain regular preventative health care in accordance with accepted medical guidelines. (f) The Program shall be designed to integrate with other state health initiatives to ensure that state resources are used efficiently to extend health insurance access and not to duplicate services available through other state programs, including, but not limited to, the State's Medicaid program, particularly the primary care managed care plan known as the Diamond State Health Plan, the School-Based Health Center program, and the public-private children's health access initiative involving the Nemours Foundation. To the extent practicable, the Program shall be administered by the State Medicaid Office and the health insurance plan offered to participants shall be designed to operate in tandem with the Diamond State Health Plan so as to maximize service to participants, contain costs through coordinated purchasing and contracting and minimize administrative costs. (g) The DHSS is authorized to promulgate rules and regulations and take such other actions as are necessary to implement this section and to secure federal funding to support the Program, including any actions necessary to comply with the Federal Child Health Assistance Act, Title XXI of the federal Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1397aa et seq.]Title 16 - Health and Safety Page 610(h) The Program shall be designed with the intent that program coverage could be extended to low-income uninsured adult Delawareans in the future if sufficient resources are appropriated for such purpose. (i) The Program shall be designed with the intent that program coverage could be extended to families with incomes above 200% of the Federal poverty level. (j) (1) The provision of health-care insurance under CHIP shall be extended to eligible children under the age of 19 whose families have personal incomes above 200% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL), as determined pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1397jj(c)(5). (2) For an eligible child whose family income is greater than 200% of the FPL, the family may purchase a healthcare benefit package, determined by DHSS and subject to any necessary approval under federal law, that provides benefits identical to those provided to an eligible child covered under this section. (3) To be eligible for coverage under CHIP where family income is greater than 200% of the FPL, a child over 2 years of age must have been uninsured for a continuous period of not less than 3 consecutive months immediately preceding enrollment in CHIP unless: a. The child's parent is eligible to receive benefits pursuant to the State's unemployment compensation laws, as set forth in Title 19; b. The child's parent was covered by a health insurance plan, a self-insurance plan or a self-funded plan and involuntarily lost coverage; or c. A child is transferring from 1 government-subsidized health-care program to another. (4) DHSS shall have the authority to establish and adjust the levels of co-payments, premiums, and deductibles for children enrolled under this subsection for the purpose of ensuring that the state cost of the plan does not exceed funds specifically appropriated for purposes of this subsection. (k) The program shall be designed such that program coverage shall include the provision of dental services to children enrolled in the program. (l) By September 1 of each calendar year beginning in 2008, DHSS shall develop a form and instructions for school districts to use in communicating to DHSS the information regarding free and reduced price meal eligibility whose submission is required by \u00a7 4134 of Title 14. Said form and instructions shall be communicated by October 1 of each calendar year to each school district. (m) By January 1 of each calendar year beginning in 2009, DHSS shall communicate in writing with the family of each child who may be eligible for the CHIP or Medicaid programs based upon information submitted by the school districts pursuant to \u00a7 4134 of Title 14. Said communication shall inform the family that its children may be eligible for free or reduced price health insurance based upon income information received from the school district, and provide information to the family for applying for the CHIP and Medicaid programs. The form provided to families notified pursuant to this subsection shall allow DHSS to calculate how many families have enrolled in the CHIP or Medicaid programs as a result of such notification, and the Department of Insurance shall reimburse DHSS for any administrative costs incurred as a result of such additional enrollments. No funds transferred pursuant to this subsection shall be used to fund insurance benefits for the CHIP or Medicaid programs. (n) Only persons authorized to carry out initial processing of Medicaid or CHIP applications or make eligibility determinations with respect to Medicaid or CHIP applicants may review information received from the school districts pursuant to \u00a7 4134 of Title 14. (o) Prior to August 1, 2008, DHSS shall enter into written agreements with each of the school districts meeting the requirements of \u00a7 4134(e) of Title 14. (p) \"School district\" as used in this section shall have the meaning assigned to it in \u00a7 4134(g) of Title 14. (q) DHSS shall cooperate with the school districts and the Insurance Commissioner in developing the written materials required by subsections (l) and (o) of this section. DHSS shall cooperate with the Insurance Commissioner in developing the written materials required by subsection (m) of this section. (71 Del. Laws, c. 452, \u00a7 1; 75 Del.
