Meridians are also known as acupuncture meridians and energy vessels. The meridians function as a network, much like a highway system, that can be mapped out throughout the entire body.

In Traditional Chinese Medicine, a meridian is a channel through which qi, or energy, and the other fundamental substances flow. Meridians are also known as acupuncture meridians and energy vessels. The meridians function as a network, much like a highway system, that can be mapped out throughout the entire body. Meridians, unlike systems of Western medicine (circulatory and nervous systems, for example) are not physical entities. Rooted in traditional Chinese medicine, the Chinese body clock is based on the idea that you can make the most of your energy and specific organs by using them when they're at their peak. The peaks of individual organs within the body vary. For example, the liver are at their height between 3 a.m. and 5 a.m. every day. The Chinese body clock is built on the concept of qi. During 24 hours, qi is thought to move in 2-hour intervals throughout the organ systems. While you're sleeping, qi is believed to draw inward to fully restore your body. One of the most important 2-hour intervals is between 1 a.m. and 3 a.m., which is when the liver is believed to be cleansing the blood. It's during this time frame that the body begins to prepare for qi to move outward from the body again. This tables show which organs correlate to the 2-hour intervals of the Chinese body clock. "}
