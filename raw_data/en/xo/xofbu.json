The long-awaited vaccines are now circulating, and yet, there are still individuals who are afraid of the side effects. As a responsible citizen, set an appointment right away at your nearest vaccine clinic and take advantage of the free COVID-19 vaccines. But in case you are done with your vaccine appointment, know that you still need to follow health protocols and take good care of yourself to stay healthy. To strengthen your well-being, you always have to be physically active and mindful of the foods you consume. Just because you are fully vaccinated doesn't mean you are done fighting COVID-19. Remember that there are people who are still getting infected by the virus even after the second dose. Not everything is about modern medicine either. A big part of staying healthy is also living a healthy lifestyle. Keep on reading and consume the foods that will keep you healthy whether you've gotten your vaccine or not. Foods That Keep You Stronger Even After You Get Vaccinated Pfizer, Moderna, Janssen, AstraZeneca, and Sinovac are the most-circulated vaccines around the globe. Although the majority won't experience any worrying side effects, there are a few who experience mild symptoms after getting vaccinated. Fever, headaches, and body pain are the common side effects of these vaccines. Don't panic when you feel these things because it means that the vaccine is working. However, if the side effects, like a fever, don't ease up after a couple of days then we urge you to consult a medical professional immediately. After getting vaccinated, it is essential for you to follow CDC guidelines like staying hydrated and avoiding alcohol and smoking. The vaccine is more effective if you stay fit and healthy. Aside from exercising and working out, you have to be more mindful with your meal plan to strengthen your immune system. Here are the nutritious foods you should incorporate into your daily meal plan. - Fish Rich in Omega-3 Fish is a good substitute for chicken, beef, and pork. However, if you want to get the best out of your fish, ensure that they are wild-caught and not farmed. Tuna, mackerel, sardines, anchovies, herring and salmon are rich in omega-3 fatty acids\u2014nutrients and energy sources that help build and maintain a healthy body. - Green and Leafy Vegetables Fill your plate with green and leafy vegetables after getting vaccinated, and let the various nutrients do wonders for your system. However, you have to be careful with your vegetable selection because some can do harm to your immune system with overconsumption. The best move you can make is to stick with cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli, Brussels sprouts, kale, bok choy, cabbage and cauliflower. Cruciferous vegetables are good sources of fiber, phytochemicals, and other nutrients essential for good health. - Onions and Garlic Your favorite dishes won't be as delicious without the aid of garlic and onions. Luckily for you, dieticians strongly recommend consuming foods with lots of garlic and onions because they are natural prebiotics that strengthen good bacteria in the gut. They are also rich in vitamin C and selenium that can boost the immune system. So if you love garlic and onions, you should add even more to your rice and favorite main courses! - Tomatoes Are you a pasta lover? Then you should be consuming lots of tomato-based sauces. Tomatoes are known to be packed with nutrients like vitamin C, lycopene, and potassium. Lycopene is a powerful antioxidant better absorbed by the body when partnered with a source of healthy fat like olive oil, so drizzle that generously on your pasta! - Mushrooms All the B vitamins, together with copper, phenols, selenium, and antioxidants, are the nutrients mushrooms offer. Some mushrooms, like Lion's Mane mushrooms, are popularly used in Asian cuisines and believed to help reduce obesity-related inflammation. - Fresh Fruits Fruits are very rich in vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and synthetic compounds. Consume your favorite fruits and fortify your immune system. Blueberries, grapes, apples, and bananas are just a few that you can eat daily. - Bone Broth Though it takes time before you enjoy a bowl of hot and healthy bone broth, this health tonic is worth the wait because of its health benefits. Make sure that you use animal bones, especially with marrow, and add vegetables and spices of your choice. The bones provide a large amount of collagen that fixes and strengthens the gut lining. You can also enjoy a supply of amino acids that fights inflammation. Try to prepare chicken or beef broth soup and enjoy it while it's hot. - Green Tea and Turmeric Green tea has antioxidants, and it can protect your cells from damage caused by inflammation. You can use natural green tea leaves or the green tea bags that are readily available in your favorite stores. Turmeric is yellow in color because of the presence of curcumin that is good for your health; it can treat certain conditions such as aggravation. Drinking turmeric tea protects the brain from stress, and you can consume it with milk for a tastier treat. - Dark Chocolates Cheer up! Aside from fruits, you can also enjoy dark chocolates for dessert or as an energy booster. Dark chocolates are full of essential supplements that can light up your mood and a whole wealth of antioxidants, making them a perfect companion after getting vaccinated.
