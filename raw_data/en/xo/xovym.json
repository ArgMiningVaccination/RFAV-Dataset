Our sexual energy is so important to understand and below are some key strategies in making the most of your love life - from an enjoyment but also health perspective. Sex and our behaviour around it, is deeply connected to our immune system and flow of vital energy, known in Ayurveda as Ojas. Ojas can be best understood as vitality, our ability to not just live but flourish through life with a strong internal and external body. When Ojas in the body is abundant, the individual radiates good health - radiant eyes, lustrous hair, glowing skin, a strong immune system, a positive and balanced outlook on life with joy, mental clarity and compassion. In opposition, an individual with lowered Ojas in the body will present with dry skin, cold hands and/or feet, low immunity, constipation, anxiety, pain (in all forms), mental stagnation, negativity and fatigue. Sex and a positive flow of sexual energy can increase Ojas in the mind and body if engaged with correctly. If suppressed or overused, sexual interaction can seriously deplete and deeply hinder a person's health. Our sexual being is not to be taken lightly and must be an area of our lives that is nurtured and attended to regularly. TOP TIPS FOR MAINTAINING A FLOURISHING SEXUAL ENERGY 1. CHANGE YOUR SEXUAL ROUTINE WITH THE SEASONS Sex is a heating activity that can deplete and aggravate the body if done too often at particular times of year. It is recommended Ayurvedically, to have sex only every two weeks or so in Summer as our vitality is at the lowest when under such hot conditions. In opposition, during Winter and with using the below Ojas building strategies, you can freely have sex daily. For Spring and Autumn, every 3-4 days is recommended but only if the body is strong - meaning no fatigue, illness or pain. Remember, just as food is seen in Ayurveda, sex is designed to not only be enjoyed but also of benefit to our well being. 2. IMPLEMENT YOGA AND MEDITATION INTO YOUR DAILY ROUTINE To improve mobility, mind/body/soul connection and increase Ojas in the body, incorporate a regular Yoga routine into your day - including Pranayama (breath practice), Asana (posture practice) and Meditation. This will heighten the enjoyment of your sexual experience but in addition, make you more connected and in tune with your libido. Speaking of which, this brings me to my next point.... 3. IF YOU DON'T FEEL LIKE HAVING SEX, PLEASE DON'T! Remember the body is highly intuitive and if your body is telling you it is too tired, not feeling the chemistry or there is no libido for any reason - it is not ready to have sex. Doing the deed in this state can deplete and aggravate your entire system - mind, body and soul. Your libido is a form of appetite and is a good indication of Ojas or healthy sexual energy. Libido is also an indicator of many things our minds often can't register. This can be that perhaps your body needs healing and down time, you are feeling disconnected within yourself and often - it is an indication that the chemistry between you and your chosen partner is not right. This is why having sex under the influence of any kind can be detrimental as your connection to Self and your partner can be compromised. 4. CHOOSE ONLY ONE SEXUAL PARTNER WHENEVER POSSIBLE In order for sex to be of ultimate pleasure, with true connection and to be nourishing for the body, the mind and the soul - sex with multiple partners is not Ayurvedically recommended. From the medicinal viewpoint in Ayurveda, sex with multiple partners is extremely depleting to the Ojas and can lead to a plethora of imbalances long term. In addition, sex is seen as a spiritual experience as well as a physical one. It is an exchange of spiritual energy between one being to another, therefore being selective of who you allow to be present with you is very important. To enjoy sex physically is one factor, but to enjoy it within the mind and soul needs to be equally prioritised. 5. PRIORITISE INTIMACY OVER ALL ELSE Remember that sex is for connection, for pleasure, for divine experience. Incorporate intimate acts of connection before, after and during sex including massage, exploring the physical body aside from the sexual organs, talk, gaze and simply make time before and after. This in itself can be so healing and nourishing for the body, alongside the magic of sex itself with a connected partner. 6. NOURISH YOURSELF Particularly if you are having sex often for fertility or just for enjoyment, rebuild your system after each intimate interaction. Sex takes a lot of energy from your system and can deplete Ojas. After sex, I strongly recommend giving yourself a warm, oil self-massage called Abhyanga (please see [here](https://www.thesattvacentre.com/post/ayurvedic-morning-routine-step-5-abhyanga-massage) for more details and instructions) followed by a warm shower. This strengthens and nourishes the body after such significant physical and energetical expenditure. In addition, consume a warm, well cooked and moisture filled meal after or the below warm milk drink to replenish the body internally. WHAT YOU WILL NEED 1 cup milk of your choice (cow's and almond milk are good choices) 1-2 mejool dates, pitted A good pinch of cinnamon & cardamom powder 1/2 tsp ghee or coconut oil (optional) 1/2- 1 teaspoon of raw cocoa powder (optional). METHOD In a blender or with a Bar Mixer, blend all ingredients. In a small saucepan, bring the liquid to a boil for 1-2 minutes and serve straight away.
