Naturopathic medicine is a comprehensive approach to health and healing that combines modern scientific knowledge with traditional and natural forms of medicine. Naturopathic Medicine is a distinct primary health care profession, emphasizing prevention, treatment and optimal health through the use of therapeutic methods and substances which encourage the person's inherent self-healing process, the vis medicatrix naturae. Who are licensed Naturopathic Doctors (ND)? Naturopathic doctors (NDs) address the mental, emotional and physical aspects of an individual, and aim to treat the root causes as well as the symptoms of illness. NDs are trained as primary care doctors at accredited four-year naturopathic medical schools. The training includes comprehensive study of the conventional medical sciences, as well as detailed study of a wide variety of natural therapies. NDs integrate standard medical diagnostics with a broad range of natural and non-invasive therapies, including clinical nutrition, herbs, homeopathy, lifestyle counseling, physical medicine and counseling. NDs may also prescribe medication if needed. Naturopathic therapies can be used to complement traditional medical treatments. The result is a patient-centered approach providing the most appropriate treatment for an individual.
