The following suggestions may be used as a guideline to help you prepare to discuss your health with your doctor. Keep in mind, your doctor is there to help and guide you, but ultimately you have responsibility for your own health. List all supplements, medications, and alternative therapies you are using for your health. The best way to have a discussion with your doctor about alternative therapies is to ask questions. Ask if any of the supplements or therapies on your list may cause complications and mention additional therapeutic treatments you might want to try. It is a good idea to write down your questions ahead of time so you won't forget them. If your doctor doesn't have the time to answer all of your questions, ask to talk with a physician's assistant or nurse. They may be more open to such communication and can advise you on how to safely integrate alternative and conventional therapies. If your doctor cannot answer your questions or doesn't want to have a discussion about alternative therapies then you may have to do your own research. The internet can be a valuable source of information - but there is so much information - what is the patient to believe? Again, ask a physician's assistant, a nurse, or even a pharmacist to help you evaluate the information. If you are seeing an alternative care practitioner (e.g. Naturopath or chiropractor) then it is just as important to talk with them about your conventional treatments. The information may have a bearing on the natural treatments they recommend. You want the alternative therapy to complement your conventional treatment protocol. Ask your conventional doctor to send your alternative doctor a copy of your record, and vice versa. Many patients may already be doing this. Additionally keep copies of your medical records at home. Studies show that most patients do share their medical records with their alternative therapy practitioners but are more reluctant to reveal alternative therapies to conventional doctors. When patients believe their conventional doctors are open-minded they are more likely to reveal details about alternative treatments. The outcome is better care when you can speak openly about your use of natural therapies. It is truly complementary medicine! If, despite your best efforts, you can't get your doctor to talk to you about alternative therapies then you may have to find another doctor. One suggestion is to look at major medical centers and teaching institutes. Staff physicians and surgeons at these institutions have access to the latest research and may be more open-minded about alternative medicine. Or contact an organization of medical practitioners specifically geared to alternative medicine like one of the following: American Association of Naturopathic Physicians: provides a list of naturopaths (866-538-2267; [www.naturopathic.org](http://www.naturopathic.org/)).
