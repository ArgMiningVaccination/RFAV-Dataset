Passengers who have taken their Covid-19 tests at selected clinics in Jakarta and Kuala Lumpur can use the digital health passport, known as [Travel Pass](https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2021/02/23/aviation-aims-for-the-sky-with-iata-travel-pass), to verify their Covid-19 test results and ensure they meet Singapore's [entry requirements](https://my.asiatatler.com/life/travel-safe-guide-to-travelling-during-the-covid-19-pandemic).

Dubbed a 'vaccination passport' by industry observers, the pass is intended to streamline travel once borders reopen by allowing passengers to store their health credentials in one place.
