The non-lamellar formed mesophases, such as bicontinuous cubic (cubosomes) and inverse hexagonal (hexosomes), attract great scientific interest in the field of pharmaceutical nanotechnology. In the present review, an overview of the engineering and characterization of non-lamellar lyotropic liquid crystalline nanosystems (LLCN) is provided, focusing on their advantages as drug delivery nanocarriers and innovative vaccine platforms. It is described that non-lamellar LLCN can be utilized as drug delivery nanosystems, as well as for protein, peptide, and nucleic acid delivery. They exhibit major advantages, including stimuli-responsive properties for the \"on demand\" drug release delivery and the ability for controlled release by manipulating their internal conformation properties and their administration by different routes. Moreover, non-lamellar LLCN exhibit unique adjuvant properties to activate the immune system, being ideal for the development of novel vaccines. This review outlines the recent advances in lipid-based liquid crystalline technology and highlights the unique features of such systems, with a hopeful scope to contribute to the rational design of future nanosystems.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2022-03-31", "cleaned_text": "Platforms [https://doi.org/10.3390/ph15040429](https://doi.org/10.3390/ph15040429) [Antiviral Drugs 2021]( /journal/pharmaceuticals/special_issues/Antiviral_Drugs_2021 )) Abstract: 1. Formation of Liquid Crystalline Nanostructures [1](#B1-pharmaceuticals-15-00429), [2](#B2-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)]. The molecules position themselves in such a way in order to minimize the free energy of the system, by exposing the hydrophilic regions to the aqueous environment and tightly packing their hydrophobic domains in the interior as an effort to minimize the interface with the existing solvent. The type of the self-assembled nanostructure is mainly governed by the surfactant molecular shape that can be predicted by the critical packing parameter (CPP) (CPP = v/(A l)). The CPP is a geometrical value consisting of the ratio between the volume of the hydrophobic lipid tail (v) and the product of the cross-sectional lipid head area (A) and the lipid chain length (l). Taking into account the changes of the CPP, order-order transitions associated with the change in the curvature of the water-lipid interface can be forecasted. Cylindrical shaped surfactant molecules (CPP 1) tend to form planar membranes (fluid lamellar (La) phase), and conversely, cone-shaped (CPP < 1) and wedge-shaped surfactant molecules (CPP > 1) prefer the formation of convex (type 1/normal type, oil-in-water (O/W) phases) and panel). [1](#B1-pharmaceuticals-15-00429), [4](#B4-pharmaceuticals-15-00429), [5](#B5-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)]. In the present review, we are focus on the inverted-type/type 2 liquid crystalline phases. Among the different mesophases some well-defined, thermodynamically stable structures can be observed, such as lamellar (La or LC depending on whether the alkyl tail is amorphous or has crystallized), as well as inverted liquid crystalline phases, such as hexagonal (HII or H2) and bicontinuous (QII called as sponge phase (L3), has also been identified, containing a bicontinuous bilayer, but without a long-range order structure [ [12](#B12-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)]. Finally, the Fd3m micellar cubic phase is composed of two discrete inverse micelle populations organized into a double diamond network that is isolated from the external environment, enabling the lowest diffusion coefficient among the studied mesophases. The described self-assembled lipid nanostructures are illustrated in [Figure 3. Non-Lamellar Lyotropic Liquid Crystalline Nanoparticles and Hexosomes) 3.1. Materials and Preparation Methods [Figure 1](#pharmaceuticals-15-00429-f001)(right panel). GMO is a polar unsaturated monoglyceride and it is characterized as a nontoxic, biodegradable, and biocompatible material being listed in the FDA's Inactive Ingredients Guide. It has also been called a \"magic lipid\", exhibiting numerous applications in the fields of drug delivery, emulsion stabilization, and protein crystallization and resulting in an extraordinary increase in publications, where it has been referred [ [14](#B14-pharmaceuticals-15-00429), [15](#B15-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)]. However, hydrolysis of the headgroup, or oxidation of unsaturated bonds in the hydrocarbon backbone are potential disadvantages, yielding a restriction of long-term storage and stability. On the other hand, PHYT is a well-known, commercially available, active ingredient used in cosmetic industry for skincare products. One of the referred advantages of PHYT is its improved chemical stability compared to other fatty acid-based materials, such as GMO, in aqueous and model gastrointestinal conditions, due to the presence of the phytanyl backbone without ester and unsaturated bonds, protecting PHYT from hydrolysis and enzymatic degradation. However, GMO is generally preferred over PHYT due to a lower propensity to cause haemolysis at dose-relevant concentrations. [1](#B1-pharmaceuticals-15-00429), [15](#B15-pharmaceuticals-15-00429), [16](#B16-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)]. polymers, such as Pluronic\u00ae F-108 (F108). According to Chong et al. [ [17](#B17-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)], the minimum hydrophobic domain length of the polymeric stabilizer of the family of Poloxamers that can successfully stabilize the liquid crystalline nanoparticles is 40 PPO units and a hydrophilic domain containing at least 19 PEO units. Other stabilizers that have been reported are -casein, polysorbates (Tween 80 and Tween 85), modified cellulose, polyethoxylated oil (Cremophor EL), polyethoxylated phytosterols, for the first time gradient copolymers of poly(2-oxazoline)s as polymeric stabilizers and compared their stabilizing behavior with block copolymers consisting of poly(-caprolactone). Zabara et al. [ [22](#B22-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)] managed to create for the first time a stabilizer-free nanocarrier, colloidally stable upon time, for the human cathelicidin derived antimicrobial peptide LL-37, by the spontaneous integration of LL-37 into GMO-based cubosomes, which were prepared by dispersing the GMO bulk phase in water using ultrasonication. [23](#B23-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)] as the hydrotrope method, due to the utilization of an auxiliary solvent, such as ethanol. In the BU method, cubosomes are formed by crystallization from precursors using low amounts of energy, while the formation of the viscous bulk phase is avoided. The hydrotrope is used to solubilize the host lipid, creating a liquid precursor that is diluted into an aqueous medium (water) resulting in the lipid droplet nucleation and spontaneous formation of the nanoparticles. Although the BU method uses milder energy than the TD method, it results in less controllable sizes and residues of solvent in the final formulation, which should be totally removed in the case of all medical applications. However, the main advantages of this method, compared to the TD technique, is that less energy is used, and the processing is being carried out also at ambient temperatures, which allows for the large-scale preparation of cubosomes, with a small fraction of present vesicles and also the incorporation of sensitive compounds [ [6](#B6-pharmaceuticals-15-00429), describe, the major advantage of cryo-TEM is the fact that after plunge freezing of dispersions provides the direct illustration of colloids in the vitrified, frozen-hydrated state, therefore being much closer to their native state, also revealing information about their internal and three-dimensional structure, as well as the shape (e.g., multilamellar vesicles, cubosomes, hexosomes). Liquid crystalline nanoparticles can only self-assemble in the presence of a solvent (typically water), and thus the use of cryo-TEM, where the samples are vitrified preserving their structure, is superior to conventional TEM, where water should be removed and therefore the internal structure most probably will be altered [ [2](#B2-pharmaceuticals-15-00429), [28](#B28-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)]. [28](#B28-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)]. Cryo-field emission scanning electron microscopy (cryo-FESEM) can also be used to obtain new 3D information about the structure of cubosomes, by using sublimation of the surface water at 90 \u00b0C and coating with platinum [ [29](#B29-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)]. Biological synchrotron small-angle X-ray scattering (BioSAXS), a special subcategory of SAXS, provides structural data from weakly scattering biological solutions in real time, accessing the internal nanostructure; the shape and the structural evolution of various kinds of proteins, peptides, and nucleic acids, such as siRNA, and lipid-protein assemblies; and their effect as encapsulated agents to the internal organization of the nanostructures [ [13](#B13-pharmaceuticals-15-00429), [25](#B25-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)]. [26](#B26-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)]. [30](#B30-pharmaceuticals-15-00429), [31](#B31-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)]. By using the SLS technique in conjunction with the DLS technique, and measuring in a wide angular range, the Rg/Rh ratio can be estimated in order to understand the structure of nanoparticles in dispersion. The Rg/Rh ratio of the non-lamellar liquid crystalline nanoparticles was first calculated by Chountoulesi et al. [ [9](#B9-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)]. Moreover, by SLS, fractal analysis can be carried out, resulting in the calculation of the fractal dimension (df), which represents a parameter of the quantification of the morphology. For example, Pippa al. the morphology of liposomes composed of different lipids, as well as mixed polymer-lipid liposomal nanocarriers. In the case of non-lamellar liquid crystalline nanoparticles, the fractal dimension was first calculated by Chountoulesi et al. [ [30](#B30-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)] and was also correlated with the Gaussian curvature changes of the nanostructures upon temperature and pH alterations. [30](#B30-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)]. Last but not least, other parameters of the internal microenvironment apart from the internal nanostructure, such as the microfluidity and micropolarity, should also be investigated. For this purpose, fluorescence spectroscopy employing a hydrophobic probe, such as the pyrene, can be applied, as was first reported by Chountoulesi et al. [ [9](#B9-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)]. 3.3. The Influence of the Environmental and Formulation Parameters in the Liquid Crystalline Nanostructure [9](#B9-pharmaceuticals-15-00429), [30](#B30-pharmaceuticals-15-00429), [37](#B37-pharmaceuticals-15-00429), [38](#B38-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)]; the solvent conditions, such as the salt concentration/ionic strength [ [39](#B39-pharmaceuticals-15-00429), [40](#B40-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)], the pH value [ [30](#B30-pharmaceuticals-15-00429), [38](#B38-pharmaceuticals-15-00429), [41](#B41-pharmaceuticals-15-00429), [9](#B9-pharmaceuticals-15-00429), [38](#B38-pharmaceuticals-15-00429), [43](#B43-pharmaceuticals-15-00429), [44](#B44-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)]; and the interactions with cells [ [45](#B45-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)]. Regarding temperature and pH, we discuss these parameters in more detail in the next paragraph on stimuli-responsive nanoparticles. [39](#B39-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)], where the increase in formulation increased the curvature toward the hydrophobic region, resulting in the phase transition from cubic to lamellar phase, and contrariwise the increase in the ionic strength of the environment (metallic ions) decreased repulsion between the headgroups of the ionic surfactant, resulting in a phase transition from lamellar to cubic phase, confirmed by using SAXS and cryo-TEM. Awad et al. [ [40](#B40-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)] added the negatively charged dioleoylphosphatidylglycerol (DSPG) in monoolein, resulting in lamellar phases that were successfully transformed into cubic phases of either Im3m or Pn3m symmetry via Ca2+ cation-induced changes in the overall surface charge density. [43](#B43-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)] investigated the interactions of PHYT-based non-lamellar crystalline dispersions with the plasma components and observed a decrease of the particle size, due to structural transition from the biphasic phase (Pn3m cubic coexisting with a hexagonal (HII) phase) to a neat hexagonal (HII) phase. Similarly, Chountoulesi et al. [ [9](#B9-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)] observed acute size decrease of GMO and PHYT prepared liquid crystalline nanoparticles, stabilized by Poloxamer P407, after being incubated in fetal bovine serum containing albumin. [45](#B45-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)] carried out a bio-SAXS study, combined with a biological cell flow-through system, in order to monitor the effects of human blood circulating cells on the phase behavior of phytantriol-based liquid crystalline nanosystems. According to the results of this study, the nanosystems exhibited a time-dependent phase evolution after having been incubated with human monocytic cells (THP-1) in suspension. [46](#B46-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)]. An increase in Poloxamer P407 concentration in the formulation can result in an increase of vesicles versus the non-lamellar structures percentage [ [9](#B9-pharmaceuticals-15-00429), [24](#B24-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)]. Furthermore, the type of the lipids, of the steric stabilizers, the nanoparticle surface charge, and the internal nanostructure (or lipid phase behavior), are all considered to be crucial factors affecting the cell-nanoparticle tolerability. For example, bicontinuous cubic mesophases are found to induce relatively higher cytotoxic and hemolytic effects than the more negatively curved inverse hexagonal and lamellar phase analogues across different cell lines and red blood cells of different species. This toxicity trend can possibly be correlated with the viscoelastic properties, while cubic is more \"stiff\" than hexagonal ones. Regarding the used lipid, PHYT, for example, is aggressive toward disrupting the cell nuclei membrane and blocking the plasma membrane turnover, which is an essential property for macropinocytotic activities [ [47](#B47-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)]. Hinton et al. [ [16](#B16-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)] also investigated the different cell-particles interactions, depending on the used lipid. In detail, the toxicity of phytantriol cubosomes is considerably greater than that of GMO cubosomes, because phytantriol cubosomes possess a greater ability to disrupt the cellular membrane (hemolytic activity) and cause oxidative stress. [48](#B48-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)]. In a nanodispersion prepared by GMO/Vitamin E mixtures, the incorporation of the novel stabilizer d--tocopheryl poly(ethylene glycol)2000 succinate (TPGS-PEG2000) in specific concentrations resulted to a biphasic structure of coexisting inverse hexagonal (H2) phase and inverse discontinuous (micellar) cubic phase of the symmetry Fd3m, as well as causing the presence of \"flower-like\" vesicles, covering the non-lamellar LLCN, which were not ever observed in the dispersions stabilized by Pluronic F-127 [ [49](#B49-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)]. [50](#B50-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)] developed an injectable in situ liquid crystal formulation for intra-articular administration, in the form of viscous gel with long-term release of sinomenine hydrochloride upon water absorption. The addition of 5% vitamin E acetate yielded an in situ hexagonal liquid crystal being able to sustain the drug release for more than 10 days and was suitable for intra-articular injection for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. [51](#B51-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)] incorporated the antifungal lipophilic agent undecylenic acid, an increase of the negative curvature was caused due to an alteration of the lipid molecular packing, yielding a transformation from cubic phase towards the formation of hexosomes, as identified by the presence of [53](#B53-pharmaceuticals-15-00429), [54](#B54-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)]. 4.1. Controlling Drug Release Kinetic [55](#B55-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)] studied the in vitro sustained release behavior of a number of model hydrophilic drugs with various molecular weights. According to the obtained results, the cumulative amount of drug diffusion through the matrix followed a linear relationship with the square root of time, which represented a Higuchi diffusion controlled release profile, as was also previously confirmed by Boyd et al. [ [56](#B56-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)] by testing a series of model hydrophobic and hydrophilic drugs (paclitaxel, irinotecan, glucose, histidine, and octreotide). [57](#B57-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)] studied the performance of cubosomes as sustained percutaneous delivery systems with the model hydrophobic drug indomethacin. A prolonged release of indomethacin was observed by the cubosomes, thus exhibiting a significant long-lasting anti-inflammatory activity. The authors suggested that the content GMO lipid interacted with the stratum corneum lipids, causing the formation of a cubosomes depot in stratum corneum, from which the indomethacin was released in a controlled manner. The release of hydrophobic drugs is primarily controlled by the partition coefficient of the drug, its diffusion into the lipid bilayer, and its diffusion into the surrounded aqueous environment. For example, when Clogston et al. [ [58](#B58-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)] increased the hydrophobicity of hydrophilic model drug tryptophan by alkylation, they observed a delayed release from GMO cubic phase that was attributed to an increase of its partitioning within the lipid layer. [59](#B59-pharmaceuticals-15-00429), [60](#B60-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)]. As Kulkarni et al. [ [59](#B59-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)] describe, cubic phases of Pn3m type exhibit four aqueous channels (meeting at a tetrahedral angle), whereas the Im3m type consists of six aqueous channels (meeting at right angles) of larger size, yielding a rather rapid release. Between reversed micellar cubic phase (Fd3m) and bicontinuous cubic phase (Pn3m), in the case of the micellar one, the hydrophilic molecules need to systematically transport/cross a large number of lipophilic domains, while in the bicontinuous cubic phases, the molecules are diffused without crossing the lipid bilayer, resulting in a faster release rate [ [61](#B61-pharmaceuticals-15-00429), [62](#B62-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)]. Between hexagonal HII phase and bicontinuous cubic phase, there is a slower release in HII than the cubic phase, due to HII smaller pore size and reduced overall surface area, compared to the open nanostructured cubic phase [ [41](#B41-pharmaceuticals-15-00429), [63](#B63-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)]. Summarizing the correlation of the internal symmetry of the mesophase to the drug diffusion rate and thus the release rate: Dlamellar phase > Dcubic phase > Dhexagonal phase > Dmicellar cubic [ [55](#B55-pharmaceuticals-15-00429), [64](#B64-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)]. We should mention that also in the case of poor water-soluble drugs, the internal nanostructure can affect their release kinetics. For example, Boyd [ [65](#B65-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)] described the \"burst\" release of hydrophobic model drugs from bicontinuous cubic phase, due to its increased surface area and its nanostructure consisting of open water channels. [40](#B40-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)] and dioleyl bromide (DDABr) [ [69](#B69-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)], have been that can trigger the formation of salt-induced non-lamellar nanostructures by interacting with surrounding ions. By employing pore-forming membrane proteins, for example, the bacterial pore-forming protein outer membrane protein F (OmpF) [ [70](#B70-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)], unique topological interconnectivities between the aqueous nanochannels can be facilitated, significantly enhancing mesophase transport properties from the newly opened communication pathways. [71](#B71-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)], or hydration enhancers, [73](#B73-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)]. For example, Barriga et al. [ [74](#B74-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)] created a library of highly swollen cubosome dispersions formed from ternary mixtures including monoolein, cholesterol, and an anionic lipid component. The authors also concluded that by changing the lipid type and the percentage of the incorporated anionic lipid, the lattice parameter and pore sizes can be precisely controlled, enabling opportunities of encapsulation and protection of biomolecules, as well as development of confined interfacial reaction environments. Sarkar et al. [ [75](#B75-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)] investigated the phase behavior of quaternary lipidwater systems consisting of three different lipids (monooleincholesterolphospholipid) and water, creating a large library of lipidic materials with bilayer structures, which mimic the native cell membrane more effectively and own significantly increased tunability, on the basis of nanostructural parameters, such as lattice parameter, aqueous channel size, and bilayer thickness. (PE), and (PS) head groups with a range of physiologically relevant saturated chain lengths from C12 to C18, as well as the singly unsaturated (C18:1), were investigated. According to the obtained results, the library contained also several extremely swollen cubic phases, being beneficial towards the successful encapsulation of large macromolecules such as proteins or nucleic acids. Recently, Zabara et al. [ [76](#B76-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)] combined monoacylglycerols and phospholipids to design thermodynamically stable ultra-swollen bicontinuous cubic phases, with water channels five times larger than traditional lipidic mesophases, which exhibited re-entrant behavior upon increasing hydration. They utilized these phases in order to crystallize membrane proteins with small extracellular domains (ECDs), demonstrating the methodology on the Gloeobacter ligand-gated ion channel (GLIC) protein and overcoming the limitations of conventional in meso crystallization. We should mention that the control of drug release kinetics from liquid crystalline nanostructures can also be modulated by environmental stimuli, such as the temperature and the pH. The category of stimuli-responsive liquid crystalline nanostructures is analyzed in detail in [Section 5](#sec5-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)of the present review and thereby it is not further described here. 4.2. Non-Lamellar Lyotropic Liquid Crystalline cases of anticancer therapies being administrated by other routes are also described in the following paragraphs. Various examples have also been reported where liquid crystalline nanocarriers provided promising anti-cancer effects, after being administrated in vitro in cancer cell lines, such as human carcinoma cell line HeLa [ [82](#B82-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)], glioblastoma T98G cells [ [54](#B54-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)], human hepatocellular (HepG2) cells [ [83](#B83-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)], and human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells [84](#B84-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)]. [85](#B85-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)] worked with amphiphilic pro-drugs of 5-fluoroacil (5-FU) against breast cancer and other solid tumors. For example, amphiphilic prodrugs consisting of C18-alkyl derivatives of 5-fluorocytosine, with different numbers of unsaturations on the C18-alkyl chain, have been reported [ [85](#B85-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)]. In a similar case, a phytanyl derivative of 5-fluorocytosine, which can also undergo enzymatic hydrolysis towards 5-fluorouracyl, has been studied to form nanostructured LLC particles [ 4.3. Non-Lamellar LLCN Improving Oral Bioavailability [26](#B26-pharmaceuticals-15-00429), [87](#B87-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)]. [88](#B88-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)] demonstrated for the first time the ability of nanostructured liquid crystalline particles to maintain the absorption of a poorly water-soluble drug after oral administration in vivo. Moreover, they highlighted the effect of the different lipid (GMO or PHYT) of the formulation on the resultant pharmacokinetic profile. In detail, cubosomes formed from PHYT were shown to maintain the absorption of cinnarizine beyond 48 h after oral administration to rats, as depicted by the plasma concentrations. Contrariwise, cubosomes prepared by the digestible GMO did not sustain the absorption of the drug, leading to decreasing concentrations after 24 h. As a result, there was a significant enhancement in oral bioavailability from PHYT nanoparticles, compared to a cinnarizine suspension and oleic acid emulsion. The authors stated that the prolonged retention of the PHYT cubosomes in the stomach is attributed at least in part to the non-digestible nature of the lipid and the retaining of the cubosome structure. In conclusion, the potential use of non-digestible liquid crystalline nanostructured particles creates opportunities for novel sustained oral drug delivery systems. [80](#B80-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)]. [89](#B89-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)], other peptides such as cyclosporine A [ [90](#B90-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)], anti-cancer treatments [ [91](#B91-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)], anti-hypertensive treatments [ [92](#B92-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)], and antibiotics [ [93](#B93-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)], as well as oral vaccination with Ovalbumin and Quil-A adjuvant [ [94](#B94-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)]. Swarnakar et al. [ [95](#B95-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)] described the enhancement of antitumor efficacy, improving bioavailability and safety of orally co-administered doxorubicin with the antioxidant Q10 with doxorubicin-liquid crystalline nanoparticles completely abolished doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity, as confirmed by the levels of all biochemical parameters. [96](#B96-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)]. Cefpodoxime proxetil, a typically bitter drug used as an antibiotic in pediatric medicine, was encapsulated into the nanoparticles as an effort to improve its taste. The formulation exhibited a sustained-release profile well fitted to the Higuchi model, indicating that diffusion and erosion were both responsible for the drug release, while the desired taste-masking ability was confirmed by electronic tongue and compared to free Cefpodoxime proxetil and commercial product. The authors concluded that the liquid crystalline formulation showed a great potential for pediatric oral delivery, being able to improve the compliance of pediatric patients by masking the bitterness of API and reducing the dosing frequency by 24 h sustained release. 4.4. Non-Lamellar LLCN for Skin Administration [26](#B26-pharmaceuticals-15-00429), [97](#B97-pharmaceuticals-15-00429), [98](#B98-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)]. [99](#B99-pharmaceuticals-15-00429), [100](#B100-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)]; topical delivery of antimicrobial peptides for treatment of skin infections caused by bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus [ [101](#B101-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)]; topical photodynamic therapy [ [102](#B102-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)]; therapy [106](#B106-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)]; hair loss [ [107](#B107-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)]. Apart from drug molecule dermal delivery of peptides [ [108](#B108-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)], as well as siRNAs [ [109](#B109-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)], have been reported. For example, GMO-based hexosomes with cationic charge, for complexing with siRNA, showed higher penetration into the skin without causing skin irritation [ [109](#B109-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)]. [100](#B100-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)] developed cubosomal hydrogels (cubogels), loaded with silver sulfadiazine and aloe vera for topical treatment of infected burns, with a higher burn healing rate than the corresponding marketed product as depicted by in vivo studies, useful against deep second-degree burns. [110](#B110-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)]. Ringing gels are a cubic liquid crystalline-based system with a high concentration of surfactants, increasing the permeability through the stratum corneum, being commercially available and used as topical NSAID formulations. Typical examples are Dolgit Mikrogel (ibuprofen) and Contrheuma Gel Forte N (bornyl and methyl nicotinate) ringing gels [ [111](#B111-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)]. [103](#B103-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)] prepared cubic phase from GMO loaded with mitoxantrone as a transdermal formulation for the convenient melanoma therapy. The transdermal permeability of mitoxantrone was higher by the cubic phase compared to that of the mitoxantrone solution because the unique internal structure of the cubic phases can deliver the hydrophilic drug, crossing through the skin and penetrating the melanoma tissue. 4.5. Non-Lamellar LLCN for Ocular, Brain, and Pulmonary Delivery [112](#B112-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)], flubiprofen [113](#B113-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)], and glaucoma treatment such as pilocarpine [ [114](#B114-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)] and brinzolamide [ [115](#B115-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)]. For example, cyclosporine A was incorporated in GMO nanoparticles, stabilized by Poloxamer P407, resulting in a decreased ocular irritancy and improved corneal penetration, when compared with a control cyclosporine A formulation [ [116](#B116-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)]. Liu et al. [ [117](#B117-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)] developed a liquid crystalline nanosystem, owning a HII nanostructure, prepared by GMO, wherein they against chronic keratitis, cataracts, retinopathy, and glaucoma, which exhibited enhanced transcorneal penetration of tetrandrine in a rabbit model. Similarly, GMO cubosomes of Pn3m internal symmetry stabilized with Poloxamer P407 and loaded with Timolol maleate, a beta blocker commonly used to treat glaucoma, exhibited higher penetration ex vivo than the commercially available product, increased retention times in vivo, and had an enhanced ocular pressure lowering effect, while neither cytotoxicity nor histological impairment in the rabbit corneas were observed [ [118](#B118-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)]. More recently, Alharbi et al. [ [119](#B119-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)] developed a ciprofloxacin-cubosomal in situ gel in order to improve eye permeation, prolong the ocular retention time, and enhance the antimicrobial activity of the antibiotic, compared with commercial drops. [120](#B120-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)]. Abdelrahman et al. [ [121](#B121-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)] enhanced the risperidone delivery to the brain through the transnasal route via optimization of cubosomal gel. Cubosomes were prepared from GMO lipid and were stabilized by Poloxamer P407 and Tween 80. The optimal cubosomal formulation exhibited significantly higher transnasal permeation and brain distribution, being ideal for brain targeting through the transnasal route. Elnaggar et al. [ [122](#B122-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)] incorporated Tween 80 in liquid crystalline formulations for the brain-targeted oral delivery of piperine. The prepared cubosomes were able to significantly sustain drug in vitro release, while the in vivo studies revealed a significantly enhanced piperine cognitive effect and even a restored cognitive function to the normal level at rats with sporadic dementia of Alzheimer's type, indicating the potential of the proposed nano-formulation to stop Alzheimer disease progression. Proteins related with treatment of central nervous system diseases, which must cross the brain-blood barrier, can also be delivered by liquid crystalline nanoparticles. For example, odorranalectin surface-decorated cubosomes a very promising anti-Alzheimer peptide, have been developed, and according to the results, showed enhanced therapeutic effect via intranasal administration, as well as sustained peptide release [ [123](#B123-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)]. [124](#B124-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)]. 4.6. Injectable Non-Lamellar Liquid Crystalline Depot Systems for Sustained Delivery [125](#B125-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)] developed a novel LCFS of hexagonal phase for the sustained delivery of entecavir. A pharmacokinetic study in rats was carried out, showing sustained release of entecavir for 3-5 days from LCFS formulation. In another study [ [126](#B126-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)], LCFS containing sorbitan monooleate (SMO) was investigated for sustained release injections of leuprolide acetate. The LCFS formed the hexagonal liquid crystalline phase. Both in vitro release test and in vivo pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies showed a sustained release of leuprolide. When compared with a commercial depot formulation of leuprolide, the LCFS exhibited a significantly reduced initial burst with sufficient suppression of testosterone. Later, B\u00e1ez-Santos et al. [ [127](#B127-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)] showed that tocopherol acetate can play a major role in mitigating drug release by altering the physicochemical properties of the liquid crystalline matrix, indicating the use of tocopherol acetate as a tailoring agent. More specifically, formulations with low amounts of tocopherol acetate and higher water uptake capacities had a higher propensity towards erodibility and thus in vivo biodegradability. [128](#B128-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)] developed an injectable in situ liquid crystal formulation for the local delivery of minocycline hydrochloride, being administered as a periodontal pocket topical delivery system, for chronic periodontitis treatment. Precursor formulations were prepared by PHYT with propylene glycol (PG) in specific ratios ( [Figure 4](#pharmaceuticals-15-00429-f004)a), until the formulation was optimized and loaded with the drug to an injectable formulation. The in vitro release experiments showed that the minocycline hydrochloride-loaded in situ cubic liquid crystalline formulation presented higher cumulative and sustained releases for 4 days in comparison with Periocline\u00ae ( [Figure 4](#pharmaceuticals-15-00429-f004)b), while therapeutic effects 4.7. Non-Lamellar glycerol-1 (MMG-1). The effect of the nanostructure on the adjuvant activity was studied by comparing the immunogenicity of phytantriol/MMG-1 hexosomes with MMG-1-containing liposomes in mice. According the MMG-1-based hexosomes potentiated significantly superior MOMP-specific humoral responses in comparison with liposomes. The authors suggested that hexosomes exhibit great adjuvant potential, and engineering of the supramolecular structure can be used to design adjuvants with customized immunological properties. (MaMo), which is an emulsifier applied in several adjuvant systems, was developed by Rodrigues et al. [ [130](#B130-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)]. A bulk phase composition of phytantriol/MaMo (14 wt %) showed hexagonal (HII) phase over body temperature, and subsequently hexosome nanoparticles were stabilized with different concentrations of either poloxamer 407, Myrj 59, or Pluronic F108. The nanosystems maintained their HII structure during the modification with either positively or negatively charged lipids and the loading with model antigens, indicating remarkable structural robustness and demonstrating that they can be utilized as antigen delivery carriers. In another work, an antigen against the helminth parasite Fasciola hepatica, namely, F. hepatica Kunitz-type molecule (FhKTM), was formulated with a liquid formed by self-assembly of 6-O-ascorbyl unmethylated cytosine-guanine motifs (CpG-ODN). According to the results, the immunization of mice with FhKTM/CpG-ODN/Coa-ASC16 induces protection against F. hepatica infection by preventing liver damage and improving survival after F. hepatica infection. The vaccination-induced IL-17A blockade during infection decreased IgG2a and IgA antibody levels as well as IFN-g production, leading to an increase in mortality of vaccinated mice [ [131](#B131-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)]. widely used as immune-modulators and pharmaceuticals. The Cub-GSLSCS showed excellent storage stability and sustained OVA release for up to 28 days, improving immunopotentiation, cellular uptake, and stimulated cytokine secretion. According to in vivo results in mice, the ratio of CD4+/CD8+ T lymphocytes was increased, and dramatically high OVA-specific IgG, IgG1, and IgG2a levels and stimulated secretion of cytokines were induced. Cub-GSLSCS may be a potential vaccine delivery system with long-term sustained immunogenicity by inducing both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. Another immunostimulant polysaccharide (PS), extracted from Ganoderma lucidum, a promising adjuvant for vaccines, was incorporated into cubosomes to generate PS-cubosome (Cub-PS) nanoparticles. The results demonstrated that Cub-PS elicited more potent immune responses than Cub or PS alone. The enhanced immune responses might be attributed to the promotion of antigen transport into draining lymph nodes and efficient dendritic cell activation and memory T-helper cell differentiation in draining lymph nodes. These results demonstrate that cubosomes can enhance the adjuvant activity of immunostimulants [ [133](#B133-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)]. Moreover, in the study of Liu et al. [ [134](#B134-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)], cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and poly (diallydimethy ammoniumchloride) (PDDAC) were on Ganoderma lucidum polysaccharide PDDAC-GLPC nanoparticles. The observed enhanced humoral and cellular immune responses of PDDAC-GLPC-OVA were attributed to the maturation of dendritic cells into draining lymph nodes, activation of the spleen, and secretion of cytokines into systemic circulation, being a potential adjuvant for protein-antigen vaccines. [135](#B135-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)] investigated promote the production of OVA-specific IgG in serum, increase the ratio of CD4+ to CD8+, significantly activate dendritic cells, and promote lymphocyte proliferation. The results also indicated that it could promote the secretion of related cytokines and the proliferation of lymphocytes, stimulate the cellular immune response, and increase the level of humoral immunity. Above all, CTAB-modified PSP-Cubs had good adjuvant activity, thus being able to serve as an effective vaccine adjuvant to induce immune responses. [136](#B136-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)]. Among the different market-approved or still candidate vaccines, there are many of them being formulated in nanotechnological platforms, in a liquid crystalline state, such as the lipid nanoparticles. For example, BioNTech/Pfizer and Moderna encapsulate their mRNA vaccines within lipid nanoparticles of lamellar form. Apart from the lipid-based nanoparticles, there is also another type of nanoparticle that is formulated by the saponin glycosides. The Novavax vaccine (NVX-CoV2373) is a subunit vaccine, based on a technology already used in a few approved products. It contains the spike protein genetic sequence of the original SARS-CoV-2 strain, derived from moth cells, and its Matrix-M adjuvant is based on a saponin extracted from the Chilean soapbark tree (Quillaja saponaria). Thus, NVX-CoV2373 is a MatrixM-adjuvanted recombinant nanoparticle vaccine engineered form. The containing protein is recombinant SARS-CoV-2 (rSARS-CoV-2) protein, constructed from the full-length (i.e., wild-type SARS-CoV-2 [136](#B136-pharmaceuticals-15-00429), saponin extracted from the Quillaja saponaria Molina tree that induces high and long-lasting levels of broadly reacting antibodies supported by a balanced TH1 and TH2 type of response, including biologically active antibody isotypes, multifunctional T cells, and cytotoxic T lymphocytes, as well as promoting rapid and profound effects on cellular drainage to local lymph nodes, creating a milieu of activated cells including T cells, B cells, natural killer cells, neutrophils, monocytes, and dendritic cells. Matrix-M is composed of 40 nanometer particles based on saponin extracted from the Quillaja saponaria Molina bark together and phospholipid [138](#B138-pharmaceuticals-15-00429), [139](#B139-pharmaceuticals-15-00429), [140](#B140-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)]. Matrix-M provides strong and long-lasting immune responses that can enable dose-sparing. The vaccine led to antibody neutralization titers in all patients both against the S protein (after one dose), as well as to the wild-type virus (after two doses). Vaxine announced positive safety data as their latest subunit vaccine has entered advanced clinical trials [ [136](#B136-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)]. Importantly, the Matrix-M1 adjuvant was dose-sparing and induced CD4+ effector memory T-cell responses that were biased toward a Th1 phenotype, which may play a role in reducing the theoretical possibility of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The fact that the formulation can be stored in refrigerators is a practical advantage that could boost distribution to low- and middle-income countries [ [137](#B137-pharmaceuticals-15-00429), [139](#B139-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)]. pH-sensitive polymer designed to strongly interact with the lipid structure at low pH, providing pH sensitivity to monoolein cubosomes and promoting a triggered drug release at acidic pH. The used polymer was the pseudopeptidic polymer poly(l-lysine-iso-phthalamide), designed to mimic the membrane penetrating peptides, exhibiting carboxylic groups that can promote conformational changes. More specifically, at neutral pH, the polymer exhibits extended charged polymeric chains, which are transformed to globular state at acidic conditions, promoting binding with the lipidic membrane and eventually causing its disruption, facilitating triggered drug release in the intracellular acidic conditions. [144](#B144-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)] triggered a pH-dependent release from MO cubic phase by a complex coacervation between alginate (HmAL) and silk fibroin (HmSF) in the water channels. The silk fibroin and alginate were hydrophobically modified in order to be immobilized in the water channels. Thus, the release can be controlled in a pH-dependent manner due to the complex coacervation between the protein and the negatively charged stearylamine groups of polysaccharide. Under acidic conditions, coacervate will block the water channels of cubic phase, suppressing the release. As the pH of release medium increased to neutral and alkali conditions, there was a higher release, possibly due to the dissolution of complex coacervation. Authors concluded that the cubic phase could be exploited as a pH-sensitive carrier for the oral delivery of an acid-labile drug. [145](#B145-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)] synthesized a weak polyacid-lipid conjugate, namely, (acrylic acid) (PAA) with the 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn- glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DMPE) and incorporated it into a lipid mesophase. At low pH and in the absence of salt (NaCl), the neutral protonated PAA chains adopt a coil (brash) conformational state that leads to the formation of a swollen lamellar structure. Upon the addition of salt at low to intermediate pH values, two lamellar phases, one collapsed without a polymer and one expanded structure with a polymer, are coexisting. Finally, when the polymer is fully ionized (at alkaline pH), the extended conformation of the polymer generates a cubic phase, co-existing with the lamellar. The authors also concluded that the state of ionization of the polyelectrolytes and their pH-dependent conformation should be taken into account during the development of such self-assembled soft nanostructures. 5.1.2. employed linoleic acid as the pH-sensitive triggering molecule in order to develop a food-grade pH-responsive lyotropic liquid crystal system. The developed system was able to switch in a reversible way both its structure and physical properties, resulting in pH-controlled release from a monolinolein cubic phase. By employing the SAXS technique, the authors managed to monitor the structural transition between the neutral pH (simulating intestine conditions) and the pH = 2 (simulating stomach conditions). The linoleic acid, being a weak fatty acid (pKa 5), is protonated at acidic pH, inducing structural changes from cubic phase at neutral pH to hexagonal phase in an acidic environment. Depending on its different structures, it exhibits different release kinetic profiles in the different pH conditions. The proposed system was able to retain the model hydrophilic drug phloroglucinol in the acidic human stomach and release the drug in neutral pH conditions, thereby being suitable for oral administration to intestine or colon tracts. [146](#B146-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)] also proposed another liquid crystalline pH-responsive system with transition from hexagonal phase at higher pH to cubic phase at lower pH < 5.5, induced by the protonation of the incorporated weak amphiphilic base pyridinylmethyl linoleate taking place at acidic pH. Pyridinylmethyl linoleate is neutral at pH 7 and above but is protonated to positive under acidic pH conditions. This protonation induces changes in the lipid bilayer curvature. Due to the controlled anticancer drug doxorubicin release from the mesophases that was carried out in the low pH microenvironment of tumors, the system provoked human colon cancer cell death at an acidic pH, mimicking tumor condition. [147](#B147-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)] developed pH-sensitive acid (2OHOA), prepared from GMO. The pH-induced phase transformations were caused by the carboxylic group of 2OHOA, resulting in charge-repulsions at the lipid-water interface, confirmed by -potential measurements. At pH < 4.0, the mostly protonated 2OHOA was inserted into the hydrophobic domains of the cubosomes towards the formation of the inverse hexagonal phase. The gradual deprotonation of the 2OHOA molecules upon increasing pH resulted in electrostatic repulsions among its deprotonated carboxylic head groups, causing the swelling of the cubic Pn3m and Im3m phases and eventually, at pH 4.5, to the cubosomes to vesicle modification. The authors concluded that these results are promising towards new pH-responsive anticancer nanocarriers for the targeted delivery of chemotherapeutics to the local microenvironment of tumor cells. [148](#B148-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)] developed pH-responsive liquid crystalline lipid nanoparticles, from monoolein and acid, were dual-loaded javanica oil (BJO) and the antitumor doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX). The pH sensitivity of the nanocarriers is attributed to the oleic acid fraction of the lipid phase and the BJO ingredient, which contains unsaturated fatty acids. BJO is a traditional herbal medicine that strongly inhibits the proliferation and metastasis of various cancers. SAXS revealed a pH-induced inverted hexagonal (normal) to cubic (pH around cancer cells) to emulsified microemulsion (pH inside cancer cells) phase transition. The optimized DOX-BJO-LCNP formulation showed long-term stability, high encapsulation efficiency, and controlled drug release properties. Moreover, an enhanced antitumor effect, in comparison to the suspension of the free drugs, as well as a reversing the resistance of the MCF-7/DOX cells to DOX, were observed. [149](#B149-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)], by adding 10.0% dispersions, managed to gradually induce lamellar-to-cubic-to-hexagonal phase transitions, in response to neutral/alkaline pH. SAXS was used to monitor the mesophase transition upon the addition of DBC and pH variation. TEM revealed the presence of niosomes after the addition of DBC. The niosomes formed in these systems are pH-responsive with lamellar (niosomes)-to-reverse cubic-to-reverse hexagonal phase transitions in neutral and alkaline environments. Conversely, the formulations resisted phase changes in acidic environments. The authors concluded that there is a new perspective of oral applications, with potential pH-triggered release of drugs at the site of action under conditions that require gastro-resistance. 5.2. Thermoresponsive Non-Lamellar LLCN [11](#B11-pharmaceuticals-15-00429), liquid crystalline mesophase, namely, the monolinolein lipid (MLO), it was found that MLO particles have a cubic internal structure at 25 \u00b0C that is transformed to inverse hexagonal after heating at 58 \u00b0C and to inverse micellar phase upon further heating to 87 \u00b0C, in a reversible manner. MLO-based particles also expel water upon heating (deswelling/shrinkage) and take up water again upon cooling (swelling) also in a reversible way, termed as the \"breathing mode\" [ [151](#B151-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)]. In the case of P407-stabilized PHYT particles, an inverse micellar solution is observed above 50 \u00b0C, while the cubic structure of Pn3m symmetry re-appears with cooling down [ [152](#B152-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)]. [153](#B153-pharmaceuticals-15-00429), [154](#B154-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)]. By adding additive molecules, the temperature-responsiveness of the liquid crystalline nanosystems can be fine-tuned. Fong et al. [ [63](#B63-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)] developed a thermo-responsive lipid-based liquid crystalline system, being the first in situ-triggered on-demand drug delivery system, by adding non-lipid molecules, such as vitamin E acetate and oleic acid. More specifically, two formulations were investigated, namely, phytantriol-vitamin E acetate and GMO-oleic acid. By using glucose as a model hydrophilic drug, the drug diffusion was shown to be reversible on switching between the HII and QII nanostructures at temperatures above and below physiological temperature, respectively. Stimulated changes in drug release from the matrix were observed during in vivo proof of concept experiments, being subcutaneously administrated in rats also. A heat or cool pack at the injection site was applied in order to confirm their thermo-responsive ability, as was anticipated from in vitro release behavior. The authors commented in the promising utility of these systems as \"on-demand\" drug release delivery vehicles. [155](#B155-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)] employed a combination of different lipids in order to trigger the thermo-responsiveness of monoolein-prepared liquid crystalline nanosystems. They combined monoolein, cholesterol, the negatively charged phospholipids 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho(10-rac-glycerol) (DOPG) and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-l-serine (DOPS) in order to prepare highly swollen primitive (Im3m) symmetry bicontinuous cubic phases, highly sensitive to both temperature and pressure. [156](#B156-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)] provided temperature responsiveness in lipid-based non-lamellar cubic lipid layers by embedding spherical, submicron-sized polymeric (PNIPAM) nanoparticles. The polymeric nanoparticles were used as thermoresponsive controllers of the hydration of the liquid crystalline surface layers. PNIPAM exhibits limited solubility at elevated temperature, changing from the swollen to the collapsed state with subsequent release of water around 32 \u00b0C. Through this PNIPAM change, nanogels enable on-demand release of water while the lipid matrix remains intact. The authors concluded that the proposed systems can be further exploited as new switchable nanostructured materials for controlled release. 5.3. Dual Stimuli-Responsive (pH and Temperature) Non-Lamellar LLCN [38](#B38-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)] incorporated polycations of PDMAEMA for the first time in liquid crystalline nanoparticles. In this study, the stimuli-responsive amphiphilic block copolymer poly(2-(dimethylamino)ethylmethacrylate)-b-poly(laurylmethacrylate) (PDMAEMA-b-PLMA) was proposed as a novel stabilizer for liquid crystalline nanoparticles with extra advanced stimuli-responsive properties. High positive values of -potential were observed, probably due to the charged amino groups of PDMAEMA in their structure. The morphology of the nanosystems was illustrated by cryo-TEM studies, revealing diversity of vesicles, organized cubic phases of Im3m internal symmetry, and sponges of medium-level internal organization ( [Figure 5](#pharmaceuticals-15-00429-f005)). All of their charge ( [Figure 5](#pharmaceuticals-15-00429-f005)). More specifically, their positive charge was increased in a more acidic environment and was decreased at neutral pH, which is useful in pharmaceutical applications. However, alterations of Rg/Rh ratio values were observed in acidic pH, indicating a pH-induced structural re-arrangement. Taking into account the temperature-responsiveness of the PDMAEMA block, the response to temperature was also monitored. Irreversible physicochemical (size and size distribution) and morphological alterations (Rg/Rh ratio) were observed, probably due to the temperature-induced shrinkage of PDMAEMA by its conversion from being hydrophilic to more hydrophobic at increased temperatures. Thus, the resultant nanosystems were characterized as dual stimuli-responsive (both towards pH and temperature). [37](#B37-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)] carried out SAXS studies in temperature- and pH-sensitive cubic phases of monoolein individually incorporating five cis unsaturated fatty acids with hydrocarbon chain lengths between 18 and 24 carbons, namely, oleic acid, vaccenic acid, gondoic acid, erucic acid, or nervonic acid, that all possess wedge-shaped surfactant molecular geometry. The authors managed to establish their partial temperature-composition phase diagrams and structure, identified the presence of micellar cubosomes, and evaluated their pH-responsiveness in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The micellar Fd3m cubic phase was formed at pH around 4.9 and a very low ionic strength. The temperature, the fatty acid concentration, and the pH all directly impacted the formation and stability of Fd3m cubic phase. Finally, the authors concluded that the observed low-energy inverse micellar cubic-to-emulsion phase transformations in the monoolein with oleic acid and vaccenic acid systems at physiological temperatures may be advantageous for further pharmaceutical applications. The transformations were observed within a physiological temperature tolerance (30-45 \u00b0C) over a wide compositional window. [Section 3.3](#sec3dot3-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)and [Section 4.1](#sec4dot1-pharmaceuticals-15-00429)) that can influence the internal organization and the behavior of the LLCN, are summarized in [Table 2](#pharmaceuticals-15-00429-t002). 6.
