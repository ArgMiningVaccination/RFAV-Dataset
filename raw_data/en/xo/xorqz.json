These approaches are not generally taught as part of conventional medical curricula or used in mainstream medicine. Most patients who use CAM also use conventional care, but many do not communicate their use with their conventional providers. There is value in providers familiarizing themselves with CAM philosophies and practices. This would facilitate open communication and ultimately improve patient care. CAM modalities are broadly grouped under the categories of mind and body therapies (e.g., mindfulness, meditation, hypnosis, yoga, tai chi, acupuncture, massage, chiropractic, and reiki), natural products (e.g., herbs, botanicals, vitamins, minerals, and probiotics), and whole medical systems (e.g., traditional Chinese medicine, Ayurveda, homeopathy, and naturopathic medicine). Burgeoning CAM research shows that specific CAM therapies and whole medical system approaches can have positive impacts on illness, well-being, and function, especially in older adults. Moreover, integrative medicine - the selective incorporation of CAM diagnostic and healing approaches into mainstream health care - can enhance health and quality of life for older persons, throughout the continuum of care. - Type - Chapter - Information [Reichel's Care of the Elderly](/core/books/reichels-care-of-the-elderly/98F8D3C8BB0F223E0043E21E63208419)Clinical Aspects of Aging, pp. 684 - 698Publisher: "}
