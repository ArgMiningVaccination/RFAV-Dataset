It might sound like a living nightmare, but for some people, it is the ultimate form of self-care. Acupuncture involves the insertion of thin needles (the diameter of a thick strand of hair) into specific points of the body to treat a wide variety of physical and mental health conditions. While it can be seen as unconventional, in China the practice is nothing if not traditional. In fact, its origins go back 2,500 years. Acupuncture's popularity in Chinese medicine stems from the belief that ill health is caused by an [imbalance between \"yin\" and \"yang](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/156488.php%20-)\". Yin and yang are found in the energy that flows through our bodies called \"qi\". The idea is that by tapping into qi through meridians (or lines of energy), balance and wellness can be restored. In recent decades, acupuncture has also become increasingly accepted by Western medicine as a treatment for a variety of physical and mental health conditions and is even accessible through the NHS for particular ailments. How is acupuncture performed? In your first session, your practitioner will typically take a full medical history as well as note your present-day concerns. In some cases, a physical exam of your tongue and pulse will accompany this. Why these two? Your tongue is the only interior organ we can see without any invasive procedure. The pulse is fundamental, as a professional acupuncturist and Chinese medicine expert [Paul Kempisty](https://goop.com/wellness/health/gp-paul-kempisty-the-acupuncture-session/) explains, 'A pulse diagnosis technique gives us a great snapshot of the patient's functional energy at that moment. This helps us decide which points and meridians to focus the treatment on'. Needles are then inserted into the relevant acupuncture points just under the skin or deeper through to the muscle. They are left in this position anywhere from a couple of minutes to half an hour. Benefits for Physical Wellbeing One of the most popular uses of acupuncture is for pain relief. The reason for this can be explained by simple neuroscience. The needles cause micro-injuries in the skin that can stimulate sensory nerves. Once these nerves are stimulated, endorphins (a group of hormones that help diminish pain) are released, and this triggers the immune system causing a reduction of inflammation. This explains why, after a session, many people claim to experience a wash of relief through their bodies. The effects of relief are said to become stronger the longer the course of treatment. Indeed, acupuncture is frequently used to alleviate chronic-tension headaches, migraines, back, neck and joint pain. Period pain and reproductive health are also prime reasons to visit your acupuncturist. Merrit Jones, the founder of [Natural Harmony Reproductive Health](https://naturalharmonyhealth.com/), claims that acupuncture's promotion of reproductive health is four-fold: \"It promotes optimal blood flow to and through the reproductive organs, reduces chronic inflammation, improves hormone balance, and reduces stress.\" 2014 research also found that acupuncture stimulated the vagus nerve \u2014 a nerve that stretches from the stem of your brain to your abdominals \u2014 causing a rise in dopamine, reducing inflammation and therefore period pain and cramping. This explains why it can also be effective for those struggling with digestive issues. Mental Health Benefits Research has illustrated that acupuncture can benefit those struggling with a vast range of mental health issues including anxiety, depression, eating disorders, insomnia, post-traumatic stress disorder, substance misuse, and generalised stress. Acupuncture regulates levels of neurotransmitters and hormones including serotonin, dopamine, and noradrenaline (amongst others) that are responsible for anxiety and depressive states. In short, it quite literally changes the mood chemistry of your brain. The power of this should not be understated. Indeed, a [2013 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3768227/) found that electroacupuncture (the kind that uses mild electric currents) was equally as effective as fluoxetine \u2014 or as its more commonly known, Prozac \u2014 in easing the symptoms of depression, and without the numerous side effects that come with the medication of that sort. Not to mention, the anecdotal success stories are aplenty. Things to Consider If acupuncture sounds like an experience you want to try out, there are a few things to consider beforehand. Acupuncture is primarily seen as a [CAM](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/complementary-and-alternative-medicine/) \u2014 a complementary or alternative medicine. This means that it serves as an addition or alternative to typical forms of treatment. If you are suffering from any physical or mental illness, you should still consult your local GP or health practitioner. Another factor of consideration is cost. Since the availability of acupuncture on the NHS is scarce, most people have to pay a private practitioner. Prices range from around \u00a335 to \u00a370 per session, although some practices charge substantially more. In England, there is no statutory regulation of acupuncture. This means it is not regulated by government bodies. Fortunately, resources do exist to find a certified healthcare professional or acupuncturist. Acupuncture is, however, a low-risk procedure. The needles are single-use and sterilised, so infection is very unlikely. Light bleedings, bruising and soreness can occur, but this should quickly subside. Furthermore, the process is not inherently painful. Indeed, many people describe the sensation of the needles as a \"tingling\" feeling or a very mild ache. Conclusion Due to Eastern medicine's holistic approach, in many cases, acupuncture addresses the root of the problem, rather than merely managing the symptoms, which is the case for many Western prescriptions. All that said, the real point about acupuncture is that it often works to alleviate pain \u2014 both mental and physical. If the tablets or the traditional treatments aren't working then giving acupuncture a try maybe a stellar health investment \u2014 even if you do look like a porcupine for half an hour. "}
