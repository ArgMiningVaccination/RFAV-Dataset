Trial Purpose and Description Detailed Description: PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the objective response rate (ORR) using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version (v) 1.1 of atezolizumab in patients with advanced alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS) in adult subjects >= 18 years and in pediatric/adolescent subjects >= 6 years. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine duration of response (DOR) using RECIST v 1.1 and/or change in clinical symptoms. II. Measure progression-free survival (PFS) time as determined by investigator using RECIST v 1.1. III. Correlate response with expression of potential immune biomarkers in paired biopsies. IV. Compare RECIST v 1.1 versus (vs) immune RECIST (iRECIST) in patients with ASPS on atezolizumab. OUTLINE: Patients receive atezolizumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 27-30 days.
