The big difference is that nowadays horses can be protected against tetanus by a safe and effective vaccine. The bacteria responsible for tetanus produce a toxin that attacks nerves. Because these bacteria can survive indefinitely in the environment, horses\u2014and people\u2014are always at risk of infection. Tetanus isn't contagious\u2014that is, it can't spread from horse to horse. Instead, it's caused by environmental contamination of wounds. In horses, the most vulnerable sites are punctures\u2014especially in the feet or deep muscles\u2014cuts and surgical incisions. Other tissues at risk are the umbilicus in foals or reproductive tissues in mares. Once tetanus strikes, horses very rarely recover. That's why protection by vaccination is the obvious choice. "}
