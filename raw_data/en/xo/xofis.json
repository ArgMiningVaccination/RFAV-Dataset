What if they were affordable and quick to prepare as well? This is a question that pretty much anyone who has tried to clean up their diet has asked themselves before.

Kevin McCray\u2014founder of [Kevin's Natural Foods](https://www.kevinsnaturalfoods.com/collections/heat-eat-entrees)\u2014came against these same obstacles when cleaning up his diet in his 20s.

However, he concluded that healthy eating was incompatible with his busy schedule and tight budget. Instead of giving up, McCray considered his dilemma as an opportunity to fill the needs of underserved health-conscious consumers. He then used the unique perspective he acquired from his personal health struggles to create Kevin's Natural Foods. The power of a clean diet and nutrition planning Kevin's wellness issues began while he was at San Diego State University studying business. After a lifetime of relatively good health, McCray was stricken with an autoimmune disorder that shook his world to the core. He was bedridden in the hospital for weeks before he was well enough to return to his regular life. It wasn't long until he found himself back in the hospital once more suffering from the very same disorder. This painful pattern continued for years, and it likely would have lasted the rest of Kevin's life. Fortunately, he found an essay extolling the virtues of the Paleo diet. The essay explained the diet's ability to combat autoimmune disorders, such as the one he was suffering from. The report inspired him to design a regime full of whole foods and free of refined sugar. The results were miraculous. Kevin quickly found himself feeling healthier, stronger, more energetic, and more inspired than he was before his struggles even began.

That of which going to the hospital on a regular basis and relying on conventional medicines was necessary. If he didn't get creative, Kevin would wind up eating the same old foods the same old way for the rest of his life. This problem motivated Kevin to find ways to develop and expand his diet menu.
