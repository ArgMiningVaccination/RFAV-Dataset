When something is off, your entire body and health is likely to suffer. And while there may be other natural treatments for your bodily ailments out there, visiting a chiropractor is perhaps one of the best. Chiropractic care is a trusted practice that has been popular for many decades. Many people rely on our [Fort Lauderdale chiropractor](https://www.coast2coastchiropractic.com) to help sooth their aches and increase their overall bodily health. Chiropractic care has benefits on a wide variety of bodily aspects, including your immune system. But how does chiropractic care help your immune system? And why is your immune system important anyway? The Importance of a Healthy Immune System The immune system is invisible, but just because you can't see it, doesn't mean it's not exceptionally important. Your immune system carries a heavy job, as its main purpose is to defend against disease-causing microorganisms, keeping you healthy and happy. The immune system is our first line of defense against disease and illness. It's a vast and complex interconnected network of organs, cells, and proteins that all work together to protect your body. At first alarm, your body will rush to swarm any disease or invading body with anti-bodies. Your body's immune system will bind to the invader, attacking it, protecting you from illness. However, when your immune system isn't working properly, it will be less effective in preventing and fighting illness. This is why keeping your immune system in good shape is so very important, as it's your main defense against very serious consequences, such as illness, disease, and even eventually death. Without your immune system, you're at high risk of developing complications that could even be fatal. Your chiropractor can help keep this system working smoothly, opening connections and making sure that your body is adapting and reacting as it should. Your chiropractor has many tools and methods to help improve your immune system. And by visiting one regularly, you're giving your immune system a much needed boost. The Effect of Stress on Your Immune System According to the American Psychological Association, stress can reduce the number of natural killer cells, or lymphocytes in your body. These are needed to fight viruses and are vital to keeping your body safe and healthy. Other studies have gone on to state that stress also can cause the immune system to produce inflammatory responses, which in short bursts are beneficial, however in the long term, they become troublesome. When inflammation is persistent and lasting, it can contribute to chronic diseases and illnesses, including backup of plaque on your arterial walls. Your body has a complicated, almost toxic relationship with stress. In short doses, stress has the ability to do amazing things, but when you're exposed to stress a lot, your body will begin to struggle, especially in terms of your immune system. Stress can produce hormonal imbalances, including a dump of the hormone cortisol. This can hamper the body's anti-inflammatory response, and can cause infections and other issues, including weight gain. The longer your body is under great amounts of stress, the longer it's beat up by the severity of it all. Think of it like trying to carry a very large rock around for days on end, never putting the weight down. Eventually, you'll start to tire, you'll start to feel sick, painful, and your body will likely suffer damage. Think of stress like a boulder you can't shake, dragging down your body and your health. Chiropractic care has been shown to have a huge impact on stress levels, with many using the practice as a means of drug-free stress relief. Chiropractors have the skills to flush your body with stress-relieving proteins and hormones. This helps lower cortisol, regulate hormones, and lower your stress and anxiety. Over time, visiting your chiropractor regularly can even help manage depression for some individuals, making it a perfect addition to any healthy routine. How Chiropractors Can Help Reduce Stress and Boost Your Immune System As mentioned above, chiropractors have the skills and knowledge to help reduce stress, even helping some cases of depression and anxiety with regular treatment. Stress is nasty, and it comes with a lot of nasty side effects, some of these include things like: - Muscle pains - Extreme tension - Chest pain - Panic attacks [Digestive issues](https://www.coast2coastchiropractic.com/can-chiropractic-adjustments-improve-digestive-healthy/) - Sleep problems And more! Stress has the ability to drag your body down in so many ways, so it's important to fight it in any way you can. Unfortunately, many will jump right to taking potentially harmful pharmaceuticals. These medications are dangerous, potentially harmful, fatal, and addictive. However, chiropractic care is natural, non-invasive, and doesn't require you to take any medications. There are several ways that chiropractic care can help you manage stress, usually involving a variety of treatment methods, including: Spinal Adjustments Spinal abnormalities can manifest due to stress, especially if you struggle with posture. [Chiropractic adjustments](https://www.coast2coastchiropractic.com/what-is-a-chiropractic-adjustment/) help realign your spine and can help restore your body's functioning to normal. Adjustments have also been known to help promote relaxation for some. When your spinal health is good, the rest of your body will have a better chance of operating correctly as well. This means that everything will be flowing and working as it should, reducing stress, and boosting your immune system. Massage Massage can reduce muscle tension and pain, especially when it's caused by stress. When this pain and tension is reduced, your body's systems are able to function properly. This can create a feedback loop that lowers your stress levels, benefiting your immune system and overall health. Relaxation Techniques Your chiropractor will be able to teach you useful techniques to help you relax. You'll also likely be offered advice on getting good sleep, and eating properly, all of which is important for a healthy body and immune system. There are many treatments which your chiropractor may suggest to help improve your body, your stress levels, and your immune system. Chiropractic care has been known to release endorphins, dopamine, and even serotonin. These hormones are referred to as the \"happy hormones\" and are important for regulating stress and mental health. The less stress you have, the less cortisol you'll carry, and the better you'll feel. When you have less stress, your body is also less focused on dealing with those issues, meaning your immune system will stabilize, allowing you to fight infections as you should. Your overall health is also likely to improve with chiropractic care. Your body relies on all processes and organs to work properly. When something isn't working as it should, your entire body and health will suffer. Your immune system is crucial for your overall health and well-being. Chiropractic care is able to help lower stress, boost your immune system, help manage anxiety, and even help your overall health. However, it's important that you visit your chiropractic specialist regularly, as spot treatments aren't as effective as continuous care. Your chiropractor will be able to effectively create a treatment plan for you, often in conjunction with your PCP. If you're struggling with stress, or other ailments, consider contacting your chiropractor today for non-invasive, drug-free, and overall safe treatments today. Your immune system is counting on it, take care of yourself. "}
