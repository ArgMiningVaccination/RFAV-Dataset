Through Project PACT, the federal government will vigorously support and foster the development of broad-based, fully coordinated local and statewide anti-violence initiatives that work strategically to secure community safety. The goals are to remove barriers among all levels of government to ensure that all federal agencies join together to form strong partnerships with cities, counties, and states. This strategy will work with the President's Empowerment Initiative both to suppress violence and restore the sense of community necessary to effectively recapture the security of our neighborhoods. .

The manual presents initial, but continuing, efforts to address each of the eight overall recommendation areas and strategies to address drug and violent crime identified by Denver's working groups and subcommittees. The manual is divided into sections, by each of the recommendations and strategies. Each section includes program summaries and bibliographies that correspond to the specific strategies followed by a resource list for each general strategy. The program summaries are based on information collected during a 3 week period via telephone and written correspondence. Each summary contains the following: Program name and acronym Program type Target population and setting (where appropriate) Project startup date Annual budget and number of persons served Sources of funding Project description Sources for additional information In instances where information was not available or not provided, the category is marked NI A. Also some recommendations have no corresponding project summaries or bibliographies due to time constraints. In most cases, additional information about the programs, such as brochures, videotapes, and manuals, is available from the BJA Clearinghouse, a component of the National Criminal Justice Reference Service (NCJRS). Please call the BJA Clearinghouse at 800-688-4252. The bibliographies are based are literature searches of the NCJRS document data base. All bibliographic references are available from NCJRS. The list of resources provides organization names, addresses, phone numbers, and brief summaries (where available) of additional contacts. In some instances, programs not featured in the program summaries may be listed as well in the resource list because of limited infOlmation available at time of press. There is some Jverlap and duplication of strategies in one or more of the recommendations, and in these cases, related information appears in only one section. For example, strategies related to case processing and court delay reduction appear in the recommendations to accelerate and toughen responses by the court system and find additional resources for new and existing programs, both within the recommendations for prosecution/courts/corrections. --~~--~~--------------~.--- The BJA Clearinghouse will continue to collect programmatic and bibliographic infonnation to meet Denver's recommendations and strategies.

Recommendations for Law Enforcement: Coordination/Collaboration Strategies: hnprove drug-interdiction operations and reduce duplicative efforts of federal, state, and local enforcers by bringing agencies together in an interagency task force Border Alliance Group Narcotics Task Force (BAG) (Arizona) Program Type: Target Population: Project Startup Date: Annual Budget/Number of Persons Served Annually: Sources of Funding: Program Objectives/Description: Interagency task force Federal, state, and local law enforcement units that conduct narcotics operations 1987 Arizona Criminal Justice Enhancement Fund, Edward Byrne State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance Fonnula Grant Program, High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area grant program (60 percent of operating costs), asset forfeitures, federal asset-sharing, in-kind donations from agencies The Border Alliance Group Narcotics Task Force (BAG) is Cochise County's chief unit to combat drug-smuggling. Cochise, the most sparsely populated county on Arizona's border with Mexico, is the county of choice for many northern Mexican and U.S. drug traffickers to conduct cross-border smuggling operations. The BAG task force is an II-person full-time staff representing six state and local law enforcement agencies: the Arizona National Guard Joint Counternarcotics Task Force; the city police departments of Benson, Bisbee, and Sierra Vista; the Cochise County Attorney's Office; and the county sheriff's department. A sergeant from the county sheriff's office supervises the BAG. The group's eight sworn officers are stationed in Bisbee, the county seat, and Sierra Vista BAG office, providing case assistance, search warrant preparation, and legal advice. A BAG governing board, made up of the\" chief executives of the agencies, meets quarterly to review operations. A subgroup, made up of supervisory and command personnel from federal, state, and local enforcement agencies, meets monthly to review cases and to provide detailed guidance. Enforcement agencies provide in-kind support, such as vehicles, office space, and personnel. The county's Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) accounts have accumulated more than $3 million in asset forfeitures in 18 months. Since June 1990, BAG has arrested 362 drug offenders and seized almost 2,800 pounds of cocaine, 19,000 pounds of marijuana, $500,000 in cash, and $1 million in motor vehicles.

Data is provided by all law enforcement agencies in the State of Washington, and also, selectively, by Oregon, California, Idaho, Kansas, and Canada. Information is kept in seven categories: murder, sexual assault, preliminary information, Department of Corrections, gang-related crimes, Violent Criminal Apprehension Program (VICAP), and timeline. A crucial feature of HITS is its ability to tell investigators whether similar crimes have been committed to the one under investigation and what features they may have in common. The system can sort through 250 fields of information and tell investigators about similar crimes by sex, date, cause of death, location, presence or absence of clothing, and other crime aspects. HITS supplies in minutes what investigators acting alone might take days to discover. Since its inception in 1987, HITS has provided assistance in more than 850 murder and rape investigations. A 1990 survey of 495 police chiefs, sheriffs, and homicide investigators showed 86 percent of respondents had used HITS. The data base involves crimes that occurred between 1981 and the present. The data base is supplied by police who spend 30 minutes filling out a form on the relevant crime. HITS operates out of the Washington Attorney General's office with five investigator analysts, one violent crime analyst, a manager, and support staff. Besides providing infonnation on similar cases, IDTS allows investigators to identify offender characteristics, location of possible suspects, names of experts who may be of assistance to investigators, and advice on how to investigate crimes. IDTS provides help in the following areas, among others: Murder. Infonnation on more than 4,000 murder investigations. Sexual assault. Data on more than 2,000 rape investigations, including infonnation on victims, offenders, and modes of operation. Rapes are separated into serial rapes, stranger rapes, and predatory sex offenses. Preliminary information. Infonnation on crime classification, victims, offenders, methods of operation, weapons, vehicles, locations, more than 4,600 sex-offender registrations, and infonnation from teletypes, newspapers, crime bulletins, and requests from investigators. Department of Corrections. More than 189,000 records with infonnation on current and fonner inmates convicted of murder and sexual assault, updated bimonthly. Gang-related crime. More than 76,000 records on gang-related crime and drive-by shootings. VICAP. Some 350 of the state's murder cases that are part of the national serial murder tracking program run by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Timeline. Infonnation on the chronological histories of known murderers. For further information contact: Dr. Robert D.

Many agencies in the largely rural state individually had lacked the resources and capability to identify and pursue comprehensive anti-crime efforts. With the NMRLEC, the agencies are advised by experienced regional coordinators, and they tap the Department of Public Safety and two state data bases to implement crime-reduction strategies. Before the NMRLEC was organized, just four multiagency task forces operated in New Mexico. Today, with the cooperative, 7 formal regional task forces and 20 local task forces mount more sophisticated anti-crime campaigns. The regions are grouped into multicounty areas that share similar crime patterns and common offenders. Regional coordinators are retired police executives who conduct intelligence\u00ad sharing meetings, maintain regional crime data on state-supplied computers, and serve as contacts with agencies in other regions. The Department of Public Safety serves as a central fusion center for the agencies, providing data and analyses on crime and criminals. The department is scheduled to receive RISS\u00ad NET, a software program developed for the Regional Information Sharing System. A High Risk Offender Program identifies about 25 percent of criminals released from state prison as possible serious repeat offenders. Regional agencies use the data for repeat-offender programs, surveillance, and other enforcement purposes. New Mexico's Law Enforcement Information Network with Corrections program provides a data base on some 45,000 convicted offenders that helps agencies develop lists of potential suspects and their last know locations. Similar programs exist in Oregon and Iowa. For further information contact: James L. Wilson Director Office of Special Projects New Mexico Department of Public Safety 4491 Cerrillos Road P.O.

Recommendations for Law Enforcement: Improve the Operational Effectiveness of Law Enforcement Strategy: Improve use of crime analysis techniques, street sales enforcement, schoolyard violator programs, gang-related and low-income housing drug control programs The Alliance for a Safer, Greater Detroit (Detroit, Michigan) Program Type: Target Population: Project Startup Date: Annual Budget/Number of Persons Served Annually: Sources of Funding: Program Objectives/Description: Community coalition N/A 1992 N/A N/A In May 1992, leaders from Detroit's business, community, and criminal justice organizations formed the Alliance for a Safer, Greater Detroit to establish a fully comprehensive anti-crime coalition. Alliance members include representatives from: Detroit NAACP; Detroit Urban League, Warren/Conner Development Coalition; Citizens Coalition Against Crime; Detroit Association of Black Organizations; New Detroit, Inc.; Detroit Bar Association;, U.S. Attorney's Office; Drug Enforcement Agency; Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms; U.S. Marshal's Service; u.S. Secret Service; Federal Bureau Wayne Prosecutor's Office; Wayne County Sheriff's Office; Michigan State Police; Detroit Police Department; Wayne State University Center for Urban Studies; and other agencies. The alliance reviewed recommendations from executive committee members to develop a series of initiatives for its anti-crime strategy. The initiatives were grouped into topic categories ranging from criminal apprehension, dangerous buildings, and handgun safety to crime prevention and school safety. Current alliance initiatives include: Create a crack 'house registry and notification process. Prevent stripping of abandoned houses. Board up abandoned houses. Establish drug-free/gun-free school zones. Improve safety for children to and from school. Reduce auto theft by etching vehicle identification numbers (VINs) on auto glass. --------------- ~-~ Hold annual block parties with infonnation about crime prevention. Install billboards to promote caring and hannony. Promote gun safety. Maintain a fugitive task force. The Alliance for a Safer, Greater Detroit hope that their efforts will serve as a catalyst for community improvement and will encourage the Detroit community and business leaders to pursue additional initiatives in support of the Alliance's mission.

Because a majority of buyers travel from other communities to obtain drugs, the program targets casual drug users who use vehicles to facilitate a drug transaction, thereby promoting user accountability. The PUSH\u00ad OFF program is based on the following goals: To increase the appropriate use of civil remedies in lieu of the use of court time and jail space. To improve administrative techniques for civil remedies with minimal law enforcement involvement. The program's slogan, \"Behind your rock could be a cop,\" denotes that PUSH-OFF cases are often the result of reverse-buy operations. Traffic stops, search warrants, and observations of drug buys and other narcotic-related activities also result in PUSH-OFF seizures. Although law enforcement initiates the automobile seizure, its involvement in PUSH-OFF procedure is minimal. A vehicle used or intended for use to transport, deliver, or receive drugs or to facilitate the delivery of controlled substances, can be seized by the state. When an officer determines probable cause exists, a Notice of Seizure and Intent to Forfeit for the vehicle is issued to the driver. The vehicle is towed to PUSH-OFF's contracted lot, and the driver and occupants are most often ticketed and released. Police instruct drivers to contact the prosecutor's office to recover their vehicles. PUSH-OFF program planners cite three positive results of the program: it deters casual drug users and buyers; it increases awareness of the dangers and cost of casual drug use; and it alerts parents, relatives, and friends that a loved one is using controlled substances. Although PUSH-OFF does not stop drug trafficking, it drives drug markets inside and off the streets, allowing residents and businesses to reclaim their neighborhoods from the drug dealers. A process and impact evaluation, conducted after its first year of operation, concluded that \"PUSH-OFF appears to be a cost-effective method to enforce laws against retail drug purchases. \" For further information contact: Robert W.

These factors include unsafe, deteriorated, and vacant buildings; health and fire hazards, and illegal uses of land and structures. Richmond has had success in reducing these adverse factors by combining the enforcement of its regulatory codes: housing, electrical, and zoning with traditional law enforcement. To make the crime prevention effort a success, crime prevention planning was incorporated into the communities by working directly with neighborhood civic groups and with business and merchant groups to solicit support and to identify problem properties where criminal activity has been witnessed or where the potential for criminal activity exists. Residents were asked to report substandard properties or vacant buildings that were not properly secured. In September 1990, the City Manager introduced his Urban Violence Strategy Plan, which created an Enhanced Code Enforcement Team that operates under the supervision of the Police Department's Vice Unit. The team originally consisted of two police officers and one housing inspector with support, as needed, from zoning, electrical, fire, and health departments. Receipt of the current grant allowed expansion of the team to four police officers, one housing inspector, one electrical inspector, and one zoning officer with support from fire, health, and environmental departments. The Enhanced Code Enforcement Team has accomplished workplan objectives during previous grant periods, and the accomplishments of the team prove that it was successful in achieving its goals. Statistics for previous grant years (July 1, 1991 to December 1993) revealed that 986 complaints were received and 1 ,263 inspections of properties were conducted. The team observed 3,312 building code violations, 288 zoning violations, and 1,605 electrical violations. Corrections were made on 1,520 building code violations, 220 L __________________ ~ zoning violations, and 805 electrical violations. There were 371 court actions against property owners who failed to correct violations. In addition, 222 properties were boarded up and 23 houses plus 3 four-unit apartment buildings were demolished. The court system is continuing to deal harshly with violations that the Enhanced Code Enforcement Team take before it. The team continues to focus on complaints of illegal activity in the city where traditional law enforcement has been unable to alleviate the problem. In addition, the team continues to monitor the four blocks in the city where buildings were demolished to determine if there is any significant change in the number of calls for police service, reported crimes, and arrests since the buildings were removed. This grant has enabled law enforcement activities to be combined with building, zoning, and electrical inspectors which has developed into an excellent working relationship among city agencies. The end result is a team approach that no one agency could have solved alone, making it possible for the City of Richmond to take a giant step toward reducing environmental conditions that could contribute to increased criminal activity.

The program expanded countywide in August 1990 as a dedicated Narcotics Nuisance Abatement Unit (NNAU) in the state's attorney's office, operating with a staff of 13 employees. The existing statute was amended in 1991 to define a nuisance as \"any place which is resorted to for the purpose of unlawfully selling, serving, storing, keeping, giving away or using controlled substances.\" The significance of the revised law is that there must be two, separate drug-related incidents at the address to proceed with a nuisance abatement action. Narcotic nuisance abatement procedures involve the following actions: Gathering information on suspected properties by reviewing narcotics cases at intake and by responding to community tips. Determining who owns the property, who manages it, and who lives there and checking the criminal history of all those associated with the property and the history of police contacts with the address. . Documenting criminal incidents at the address and sending letters to owners warning them that the next incident will constitute a nuisance. If subsequent criminal activity occurs, sending the landlord a second letter identifying the nuisance, listing legal consequences, and recommending abatement. Meeting with owners and their counsel to develop a plan to abate the nuisance. Filing legal actions against the owner is there is no response from property owners or no effort to abate. Conducting follow up monitoring of the property whether it was abated voluntarily or court ordered. The goal of the NNAU is to eliminate narcotics nuisances from neighborhoods, not to engage in legal action. While most cases are infonnally resolved by the owner or landlord, all receive followup monitoring to some degree. Since the program began in 1989, NNAU has processed more than 3,000 cases, including all cases that have had drug activity identification, investigation, and notification. During the same period, only about 30 court cases were filed for civil abatement proceedings. NNAU attorneys handled all other cases infonnally. Building on the success of the state's attorney's NNAU, the Chicago Police Department established a Narcotics Nuisance Abatement Team in October 1991. The police department's team now coordinates enforcement activities, such as conducting undercover buys, serving search warrants, and arresting suspects. A building inspector also accompanies police on search warrant executions to document building violations. The NNAU has also utilized the resources of other Chicago agencies to enforce city codes and ordinances as part of the abatement process.

When agencies fail to share vital information, a chronic juvenile offender often \"falls through the crack\" of the juvenile justice system. Further, when decisionmaking is based on isolated information rather than on all of the available data, the extent of a youth's criminal activity is not always known, nor are decisions always made in the public's or the juvenile's best interest. This has resulted in some habitual offending remaining \"untouchable\" by the law and able to repeatedly victimize a community. The Serious Habitual Offender Comprehensive Action Program (SHOCAP) facilitates interagency response to chronic juvenile offenders. Originally developed by the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP) of the U.S. Department of Justice, SHOCAP is a cooperative information-sharing and case management program that promotes coordination among law enforcement, probation, correctional, and social service agencies; prosecutors; schools; and community aftercare services. The agencies are thus able to develop more comprehensive case histories and to make better informed decisions and recommendations regarding juvenile serious habitual offenders (SHO's). The mission of SHOCAP is to control the behavior of SHO's by reducing the number of offenses they commit and by promoting changes in their behavior through community-based programs. The program enhances the credibility of the juvenile justice system by developing a unified, consistent methodology for dealing with SHO's. The program is designed to assemble the most up-to-date information on troubled youth and their families so that the system can better match needs with services. To achieve SHOCAP objectives, an accurate and timely data base must be maintained that comes from different sources and focuses on the serious habitual offender. In addition, operational definitions and standards for the use of police officers and detention and processing personnel in dealing with juvenile serious habitual offenders. Procedures to reduce or eliminate pretrial delays, case dismissals, plea bargaining, and sentence reductions are developed and adhered to. Finally, SHOCAP needs to be supported in the communities where it is most needed, and this can be done only by promoting it through the community groups and appropriate criminal justice agencies. In 1992 the Illinois General Assembly amended the Juvenile Court Act to allow each county in Illinois to establish a multidisciplinary SHOCAP committee to adopt criteria that identify juveniles who qualify as SHO's and to adopt an interagency agreement for sharing information that enhances case management yet maintains Juvenile Court Act confidentiality provisions. Only staff members working directly with SHO's in the agencies that share information may be allowed access to SHOCAP infonnation. SHO's on probation are closely supervised while perfonning community service or restitution work through the Probation Plus Program, and all absences or violations of rules are reported to the court and SHOCAP member agencies. Delivery of intervention, social service, and aftercare services is also an equally important program. A health center furnishes individual, family, and group therapy; crisis intervention services are available 24 hours a day; and substance abuse assessments and treatment referrals are provided. Through the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services, those SHO's who are either the victim or the perpetrator in child abuse and neglect cases are identified, and information is shared with other agencies, as allowed by the department' s rules~ regulations, and related regulations. Schools also participate by sharing infonnation with other agencies and report to police all crimes that occur on school grounds by an identified SHOo For further information contact: David Olson, Director Drug Infonnation & Analysis Center Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority 120 South Riverside Plaza Chicago, IL 60606 (312) 793-8550 (312) 793-8422 (fax) Recommendations for Law Enforcement: Improve the Operational Effectiveness of Law Enforcement Strategy: Improve use of crime analysis techniques, street sales enforcement, schoolyard violator programs, gang-related and low-income housing drug control programs Stay Out of Drug Area (SODA) Orders (State of Washington) Program Type: Target Population: Project Startup Date: Annual Budget/Number of Persons Served Annually: Sources of Funding: Program Objectives/Description: Drug trafficking deterrence Known drug offenders 1989 N/A N/A In response to a growing number of felony drug cases and citizens complaints about drug suspects returning to the same neighborhoods and selling drugs, King County officials worked together to enhance the investigation and prosecution of drug offenders. The prosecuting attorney implemented a program that identifies neighborhoods with heavy drug trafficking activity and prohibits known drug traffickers from entering these neighborhoods through the use of Stay Out of Drug Areas (SODA) orders. These \"off-limits\" prohibitions increase the accountability of drug suspects on pretrial or supervised release. The program is based on Washington state's 1989 sentencing law, which established off\u00ad limits orders for drug traffickers. The legislature sought to prohibit drug dealers from frequenting areas known for continuous drug activity (l.S a means of addressing the pervasive problem of escalating drug use. The statue allows cities such as Seattle to identify problem areas in dmg-infested neighborhoods and classify them as Protected Against Drug Trafficking (PADT) areas. The statue defines PADT areas as geographic locations where drug sales, possession of drugs, pedestrian or vehicular traffic attendant to drug activity, or other activity associated with drug offenses confmns a pattern associated with drug trafficking. Once PADT areas are established, a court can then execute a SODA order prohibiting a known drug offender from entering a specific PAnT area for up to one year. The statute defines a \"known drug trafficker\" as any person who had been convicted of a drug offense in a state or federal court and who is subsequently arrested for another drug offense. While the police P ADT affidavits describe general areas of high drug trafficking, individual SODA orders provide a more detailed description of the prohibited area to assist in enforcement. Although SODA orders are most commonly used as a condition of pretrial release and sentencing, they can also be incorporated into civil abatement and eviction actions. L __ ~ In 1992, a 6-month undercover investigation resulted in the arrest of 94 crack cocaine dealers in Seattle. Virtually all of the 139 undercover narcotics purchases associate. l with the investigation occurred within court-designated SODA locations, which were given special attention by the courts, based on a history of illegal drug activity and resident complaints .. Eighty-nine of the suspects were prosecuted by the county prosecutor, and five of the cases qualified for federal prosecution because of quantities of narcotics sold, multiple purchases, or weapons involvement. The initial response from residents of P ADT areas has been positive, and the SODA orders have received strong community support and favorable media coverage for successful operations, such as the investigation cited above. Recently, the program has been expanded to include juvenile offenders and a high narcotics trafficking area under the jurisdiction of the King County Police. As a team, the King County Prosecutor's Office and local law enforcement have utilized SODA orders to respond to the needs of neighborhoods under the scourge of the drug trade.

The emphasis is on working with youthful offenders and youth at the age of transition between school and work. The institutes serve the specific needs of adjudicated adolescents, providing them with opportunities for accelerated remedial education, vocational and employability skills training, and group and family counseling. The Baton Rouge Marine Institute is afflliated with the Associated Marine Institutes, which collectively provides programs and facilities to serve delinquent youth from truants to serious offenders. Each institute program is tailored to meet the needs of the community and state in which it is located. Hard core delinquent youth, averaging 11 or more offenses each, compose a high percentage of the population at some institutes and for many it represents a \"last chance\" before being thrust into the adult criminal justice system. There are residential and nonresidential components of the program based in communities as well as in remote locations. The idea of symbiosis-\" unlikely partners existing in peaceful harmony, each benefiting the other\"-is the cornerstone of the institutes' philosophy; \"What more unlikely partners than a delinquent youth who is rash, rebellious, and uncaring, and the sea, which is harsh, demanding and unforgiving ... II The success of the program has been amply borne out by detailed statistical followup and evaluations. Eighty-two of every 100 youthful offenders who entered the training program have had no further contact with the criminal justice system. Most are now working, serving in the armed forces, or have returned to school. Approximately 50 percent of the youngsters graduating from Marine Institutes earn state high school equivalency diplomas while enrolled, even though most are below ninth grade level in basic skills when they enter the program. Many enter at third or fourth grade reading level and show remarkable improvement during their 6 months in the program. Eight of every 10 who have been involved in the institutes' environmental work programs have gone on to other, more penn anent employment. The Marine Institutes have been the recipients of seven national awards and numerous local awards for leadership, innovation, and achievement in the field of helping youth Specifically, the goal of the Baton Rouge Marine Institute, Inc., is to impart the values, skills and confidence to high-risk youth to help them make positive and productive decisions that will keep them out of the criminal justice system. It is also directed at post-high school youth having trouble adjusting to routines and demands of a job by involving them in labor intensive environmental projects, such as building artificial reefs and planting marine vegetation in areas decimated or threatened by development. Each year the cost to taxpayers compares favorably with similar programs; however, it is less expensive than many of the more widely used alternatives, while having far greater benefits and results. Each year an increasing portion of the total cost is borne by private contributions of boats, cash, equipment, real property, and other useful gifts . .

The Bethesda Day Treatment Center is a private, nonprofit corporation that was established to furnish intensive day treatment for pre-and post-adjudicated delinquents and status offenders, both male and female. The main objective of the program is to provide life skills and career opportunities as well as a variety of counseling approaches (group, family, and individual). Its aim is to intensively structure the time of youth referred by public agencies. Key to the program is providing a variety of positive opportunities that may be substituted for a client's antisocial behavior patterns. It provides a values-oriented treatment program to help facilitate reentry into the mainstream of society. A unique aspect of the treatment is work experience for all clients of working age that applies 75 percent of their paychecks to payment of fines, court costs, and restitution. The program was founded in December 1983 with seed money from the Pennsylvania Commission of Crime and Delinquency under the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act formula grant program. It now serves eleven counties in Pennsylvania including Philadelphia. Interstate replication is under way. Clients are referred from community agencies such as juvenile courts; teachers or other school personnel; by parents; or by the community at large. The program was one of 18 programs chosen by the U.S. Justice Department's Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP) for its 1992 Gould-Wysinger Award for \"exceptional achievements in advancing juvenile justice at the local level. \" The program's primary efforts are directed toward: II Stabilizing the client's behavior at home, at school, and in the community by structuring time in a way that helps block and wilJ eventually eradicate destructive actions. Determining the root causes of the client's behavior and holding him or her accountable for antisocial behavior by requiring him to take responsibility for his actions. Providing positive substitutes for the client's antisocial behavior such as employment, life j skills, and career or vocational opportunities. Assessing the causes of the client's family dysfunction and devising a plan of action to resolve conflict and restore order and stability in the home. Providing individualized educational alternatives for those clients who have failed academically or socially in mainstream educations. Bethesda's active intervention involves penetrating the home, the school, the peer group, and the community to facilitate the containment of antisocial behavior and treatment of the whole family. It also operates during nontraditional hours, including weekends and evenings. In addition to counseling, the program furnishes drug and alcohol counseling and foster care, which combine into a daily strategy to address the cause of the underlying dysfunctional patterns. The Bethesda approach centers on a fivefold menu of program systems: Day Treatment, Bethesda Prep School, Family-Systems Counseling, Short-Term Foster Care, and Drug and Alcohol counseling for clients, parents, and the community. The modalities provide the intensity of a residential center while leaving the client in his or her home or community, thus saving costs. The Bethesda Foster Care program was established so that clients, who under emergency circumstances must be removed from their homes, may still remain near enough to continue treatment. A preliminary study has revealed that recidivism rates of 10.4 percent are significantly lower than state and national norms. Positive changes in client attitudes and behaviors have been documented as clients have also improved their own self-awareness and esteem and have improved their relationships with others. Implementation and replication are made easy because of the flexibility of the Bethesda program to adapt itself to any type community. Weeldy home visits that require parental participation are a part of each phase and type of treatment. Regular contacts with school and job supervisors are maintained to ensure control and continuity. For Further Inf3nnation Contact: Dominic Herbst, Managing Director Bethesda Day Treatment Center P.O.

The program's goal is to provide the young person and family with counseling to help correct the child's behavior before he or she gets into serious delinquent trouble. Staff probation officers refer appropriate cases of youth charged with unruly or minor delinquent acts to the BYPASS Program of the Auxiliary Probation Service. Within 24 hours of receiving the case, the Auxiliary Probation Officer (APO) (a citizen volunteer) calls and sets up a personal visit with the youth and the parent or guardian. During the first visit, the APO assesses the home situation and discusses BYPASS rules. In addition, the APO contacts the participant's school for additional information about the young person. Visits and telephone calls are made periodically, and a monthly report is made to the court on each participant. The duration of the program is from a minimum of 30 days to a maximum of 90 days. The contacts continue for a period of 3 months. BYPASS participants may be released early if the rules of probation are being followed and if the APO is satisfied that the parents/guardians are doing their best to assist their child. A rearrest is filed for participants who refuse to follow BYPASS rules. Sources of Additional Information: For further information contact: John Yowl Supervisor P.O.

CISP is operated by the Juvenile Court of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. Eligible youth are on probation and would be institutionalized were it not for CISP. The youth reside in one of three Pittsburgh neighborhoods, selected because the areas have traditionally included a high number of repeat offenders. CISP participants are confined on house arrest under the direct supervision of their parents. All are electronically monitored by Track-Tech Electronic Monitoring System. This system has the ability to record all entries and exits by the youth from their homes. The in-home monitoring system provides continuous, 24-hour a day coverage. CISP participants are permitted to attend school and work and are given a predetermined amount of travel time to get to and from approved destinations. CISP staff work closely with school officials, monitoring the young person's attendance, performance and disciplinary problems, if any. Youth participate in individual, group, family, and peer counseling. Since many are substance abusers, they also participate in in-depth Drug/ Alcohol Education/Assessment Seminars and receive counseling. Youth requiring inpatient chemical dependency services are directed to local providers. Youth participate in recreational activities several days a week. Recreational centers also make arrangements for the youth to go to movies, museums, libraries, sporting events, and cultural events. All youth participating in CISP are required to perform community service as a way of paying back the community for the wrong they have done. Youth who a.re noncompliant with CISP program rules are removed temporarily from the home and placed in other more secure facilities. When the CISP program is operating at full capacity, the per diem cost is $40. Comparison of this per diem cost with the cost of institutionalization, which averages $80 to $165 a day, indicates CISP's significant cost savings.

Over a 6-month period, CEP staff try to address the problems that influence the behavior of these offenders by helping them cultivate a support structure in the community and acquire new skills. CEP provides various levels of supervision and support depending on the needs of the offender and requirements of the judge. CEP services include counseling, education, vocational training, employment placement, and substance abuse prevention and referral services. CEP staff work closely with the courts by assisting with the selection of participants and by regularly reporting to the courts on the progress (and failings) of each CEP participant. Approximately 67 percent of the offenders in the program complete the many requirements of the program. Those who successfully complete the program usually receive a sentence of 5 years probation of which they are likely to serve 3 years. For those participants who do not meet their obligations to the court, CEP works closely with probation and the police to ensure that the offenders are punished for their crimes. For each CEP graduate, the city and state save between $5,000 and $48,000 in correctional costs. CEP is operated by the Center for Alternative Sentencing and Employment Services which seeks to influence sentencing policy and practice by demonstrating the effectiveness of fair and enforceable sanctions that are more substantial than probation, but less costly and intrusive than prison.

It channels almost all nonviolent defendants arrested on drug possession charges into court\u00ad operated rehabilitation as an alternative to prosecution. Miami's \"Drug Court\" expands on the traditional concept of diversion to provide a year or more of treatment and case management. Services include counseling, acupuncture, fellowship meetings, education courses, and vocational services. Strict monitoring is provided through periodic urine tests and court appearances. Defendants who succeed in the program have their criminal cases dismissed. Program administrators acknowledge that the Diversion and Treatment Program is much more complex-and initially more costly-than prosecution. Most defendants would normally receive a few minutes of court attention and go home, but the program's aim is to provide defendants with treatment and support services that help shut the revolving door back to court. Miami's experience has now shown that communities can make long-term gains from initial detoxification through eventual job placement. In the first three years of the program, around 60 percent of defendants successfully completed the year-long regimen or remained in treatment. Recidivism is reported to be unusually low. The Drug Court, set up in the summer of 1989, places defendants in the Diversion and Treatment Program, monitors their progress, and decides whether they have recovered sufficiently to have their cases dismissed. To be eligible for the program, after booking they are screened at the Pretrial Detention Center and must be charged with possessing or purchasing drugs, and the State Attorney must agree to diversion. Defendants who have a history of violent crime, have been arrested for drug trafficking, or have more than two previous nondrug felony convictions are not eligible. The program initially accepted only first-time offenders and limited it to individuals arrested for possession of cocaine, but now defendants charged with possession of any controlled substance other than marijuana may join. Drug Court handles an average of 80 cases a day as both new arrestees and defendants already in the program appear before the judge. Except for when on vacation or ill, Judge Stanley M. Goldstein is the only Drug Court judge. His total involvement is considered a critical strength of the program. Every offender's treatment records are on the judge's computer on the bench. Thus, in addition to receiving personal attention, they are also prevented from manipulating the court system as they once might have done. Judge Goldstein addresses each defendant directly and requires each defendant to respond directly to him; the public defender may not intervene. All justice system players in Drug Court are on the same team, making the same demands on the defendant and are ready to impose the same penalties for noncompliance. The faces in Drug Court remain the same. In time, defendants realize that the courtroom is being used to help them get off and stay off drugs. Judge Goldstein believes it is important that the justice system holds defendants accountable and maintains that whether defendants are congratulated or reprimanded, \"at least they know that someone is paying attention to what's happening to them.\" The program has three phases, detoxification, stabilization, and aftercare. Phases I and IT take place at Dade County's main treatment clinic where acupuncture is offered daily as an aid in detoxification. About 85 percent of clients elect to use it, and the treatment is said to reduce cravings, mitigate withdrawal symptoms, and ease the anxiety that clients typically experience in withdrawal. Proponents say the process is more effective than methadone, for example, less expensive, and more practical to administer. Further, panel members at a 1991 National Institute on Drug Abuse technical review meeting believed there were enough positive reports to justify continuing it as a supplement treatment with continued close monitoring of results. Other options include group and individual counseling, 12-step meetings, and inpatient treatment for those who cannot control their cravings. These clients may ask to be incarcerated for two weeks for detoxification and then request return to the program. Phase IT, stabilization, begins when the judge ascertains that arrestees have shown enough progress to function successfully. They must have attended all 12 scheduled sessions with counselors and have had at least 7 consecutive clean urine results. Phase IT is scheduled to last 14 to 16 weeks, but may last over a year should the judge decree. Patients may also be recycled back into phase I if they have trouble staying off drugs. To move into phase ill, stabilization, records must show progress toward goals of individual treatment plans. Phase m shifts the focus from abstinence to academic preparation. Clients still return to court every 30 to 60 days and still must provide urine specimens. Clients are now encouraged to move ahead without help of treatment staff and to focus on education and vocational services. This phase is slated to last 36 weeks prior to the end of program participation, but again, the judge's view holds sway and adjustments in time, recycling through prior phases, or other paths are taken to helping clients stay clean.

Conference Committees provide as a community service a procedure whereby youth in trouble and their families may be helped to remedy a problem in its early stages. This is accomplished through conferences held in private with both the parents and the child in their own neighborhood. After the conference, the committee fonnulates a disposition. A voluntary contract is signed to include: counsel and release, assignment to community service work, curfew restrictions, writing essays on assigned topics, participating in tutoring sessions, school attendance, attending counseling sessions, and payment of restitution to the victim. A person from the committee is assigned to provide followup by monitoring the case and reporting the progress. After successful completion, the case is closed. Conference Committees impress on the youth and parents that the community is concerned about the child's conduct and the protection of the community. The Conference Committees' success rate is estimated to be approximately 85 percent.

The program is aimed at self\u00ad rehabilitation and short-term supervision, diversion, and prevention from further involvement in the juvenile justice system. The first offender is given the option of voluntarily entering the First Offender Program. The juvenile and his or her parents agree to participate in this four-month program in return for a continuance of the case. If the juvenile is successful in completing the program, the County Attorney dismisses the petition that has been fIled. If the juvenile is unsuccessful in completing the program and/or commits another offense, legal action continues on the original petition. The program requires that the juvenile and his or her parents attend four three-hour Saturday sessions. The parents' issues are addressed in the parents' session, while the juvenile attends sessions that address issues of drugs and alcohol, consequences of delinquent behavior, and other relevant behavior issues. Further requirements include reporting in twice a month to the probation officer, payment of restitution fees, community service work, and regular school attendance. The First Offender Program's recidivism rate is estimated to be approximately 15 percent.

The boys range in age from 8 to 18 years old, and are adjudicated delinquent. Each boy admitted undergoes extensive evaluations, which include medical, psychiatric, and educational diagnostics. The evaluation results provide the staff with a comprehensive report and recommendations from which an effective treatment plan may be developed. A program is developed for each youth using a combination of behavior modification, milieu therapy, individual and group therapy, and individualized education, along with community and social activities, which are geared toward the boy's individual problems. George Junior Republic also maintains a Family Therapy Unit program. The program mandate is to actively involve all family members in the treatment process. The Family Therapy Unit was established to address the issue that the family can be a major contributing factor in a youth's delinquency. Family therapy issues include implementation of behavior modification and parenting skills, drug and alcohol issues, and family dysfunction. A family member must be involved in family sessions at least two times per month. To ensure a more successful reunification once the boy returns to his home environment, George Junior Republic has designed and implemented a preventive aftercare program. Families continue to meet with trained staff to work through the boy's problems. Preventive aftercare is designed to provide stmcture, supervision, and treatment where it has the best impact, in the home environment. The program allows for a transition back to the home with the support necessary for success. The only requirement is that the boy cannot be involved in any further delinquent behavior. He also has to attend school or achieve passing grades. r--O--------------------------------------------I For further infonnation contact: Rick Losasso Director of Admission Box 1058 Grove City, PA 16127 (412) 458-9330 (412) 458-1559 (fax) Recommendations for Prosecution/Courts/Corrections: Implement Alternative or Innovative Facilities/Programs Strategy: Provide alt~rnatives to detention for those who pose no danger to the community Juvenile Diversion Program (Pueblo, Colorado) Program type: Target population: ProJect Startup Date: Annual Budget/Number of Persons Served Annually Source of Funding: Program Objectives/Description: Diversion from adjudication Early juvenile offenders, no prior record 1979 No separate budget/750 Mainly financed. by normal appropriation for district attorney's office; charge some program fees. The Juvenile Diversion Program in the District Attorney's Office of the 19th Judicial District, Pueblo, Colorado, provides an alternative to prosecution for youth whose criminal actions are less serious and who have no previous charges recorded. Based on the personal history of the young offender, the diversion counselor sets up an individual program in contract form. The contract requirements may include supervision of from 3 months to 1 year, monetary restitution to the victim, community service, tutoring, improved academic performance, good attendance at school, drug/alcohol evaluation and treatment, participation in support groups or educational programs, or refen'al to community agencies for counseling or other services. If the youth complies with the contract and commits no new offenses, the case is closed without prosecution. If the youth is not compliant or reoffends, the case is referred for prosecution and the child and parent must appear in court on the charges. The Juvenile Diversion Program has proved to be a successful method for teaching responsibility to young people in the early stages of criminal behavior, thus eliminating or greatly reducing future lawbreaking. In 1993, 4,200 hours of community service work was performed, and $11,185 in restitution was paid. The 613 youth handled by the diversion program in 1992 represented 45 percent of the delinquency cases in which the district attorney felt there was sufficient evidence to support prosecution. Viewed another way, this meant the juvewnile caseload was reduced by 45 percent.

Formerly the top level of house arrest provided electronic monitoring. Although that level is no longer used, house arrest continues to increase the structure and accountability in a young person's life by using daily reporting, a positive peer group, and a graduated \"level\" system. At level 2, although the youth no longer has to perform an \"electronic handshake\" between the telephone and his monitoring device, probation officers will still call him at regular times. He must also' attend school as well as daily group meetings at the probation department. At level 3, as long as the youth calls the probation department on schedule, the probation department will not telephone the youth. The youth must still not go out unaccompanied or have guests at home. The program is structured to give the youth more or less supervision and greater or fewer privileges, depending on his behavior.

The goal of the Youth Court Program is to reduce incidents of youthful criminal behavior, divert offending youth from the traditional justice system by providing an alternative to the family or criminal court process, and halt the progression of a juvenile offender into an adult criminal. The Youth Courts have recognized that early, youthful behavior patterns, such as the use of alcohol and other drugs, are linked to subsequent and more serious criminal conduct later in life. The appearance of a youngster before a Youth Court is viewed as a pretrial diversion program for an eligible youth who has committed any infraction, violation, or misdemeanor, which could be referred to a police juvenile officer as a \"person in need of supervision\" or petitioned into New York State Family Court as a juvenile delinquent. The Youth Court is designed to be used in appropriate cases selected for the highest potential for intervening on future criminal behavior. Normally, only first-time offenders are eligible for a Youth Court Diversion. The Youth Court recruits and trains community youth to become prosecutors, defense attorneys, court clerks, bailiffs, and victim advocates. The use of volunteer attorneys, Executive Board advisor, and consultants during the training period increases community awareness of juvenile problems while building skill and knowledge in the youth participants. Youth Court educates and provides a better understanding of the laws. It allows youth to examine the workings of the justice system while learning personal accountability of actions. Problem youth with minor offenses can be appropriately handled in Youth Court, benefiting the community, the police, and, most important, themselves.

Referral is by court order, and the overall goal of the program is to prevent or reduce out-of-home placements and contact with the juvenile justice system. Another, but far from secondary, objective is to improve family functioning. The program is operated by Wisconsin Correctional Service under contract with the Kenosha County Department of Social Service. It is monitored and evaluated by the Kenosha County Department of Social Services. The PACT Program gives the juvenile justice system an alternative to placement in a correctional facility or a residential treatment center. PACT is staffed by a team of professionals from the social services field. A program supervisor and three counselors provide treatment to adolescents and their families. Additionally, Kenosha County provides a liaison worker from the Department of Social Services. PACT Program services include intensive monitoring of clients' behaviors at home, in school, and in the community with a basic aim of community safety. It works with clients and their families by counseling individuals, groups, or individual families. Staff sponsor recreational activities for children and families and support groups and education for parents and maintain liaison within the schools. The Office of Treatment Improvement Coordinated Drug Treatment for Youth Project has formed a partnership with PACT to furnish intensive substance abuse services to clients who need assistance. l __________________ _ PACT attempts to provide at least 14 hours of face-to-face contact with client youth per month as well as school contacts, recreational activities, and face-to-face parent contacts. Since one of the program's goals is. to keep 85 percent of children at home, the last quarter of 1993 was exemplary in keeping 100 percent of youthful offenders in their parents' homes. In addition, there were no school dropouts during the entire year. PACT has developed an aftercare component of treatment. After a client has been serviced intensively through the program and has met all or most goals, the worker has the option of placing the client in Mtercare. By doing this, the worker is still able to monitor his or her progress within the home, the community, and at school. The worker, however, is no longer expected to have 14 hours of contact per month with clients during Aftercare, which allows new entries into the program.

The agency operates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, so that arrestees are interviewed as soon as possible after arrest. Once an arrestee is interviewed, pretrial service officers verify community ties and criminal history, and arrange for District Court arrestees to be tested for drug use. In making recommendations, the agency uses this information to assess likelihood of appearance and community safety. The basic approach is objective, with some flexibility within risk categories to tailor solutions to the individual, under the principle that release should be accomplished through the least restrictive conditions. In addition, the agency facilitates the pretrial release of some misdemeanor defendants before a hearing, advising the arresting officer whether the arrestee is eligible for release on citation. Pretrial Services Agency also monitors pretrial compliance with all conditions of release except those dealing specifically with drug testing, reminds defendants of court dates, advises defendants of the penalties of violation, investigates failure-to-appear cases, and identifies jailed defendants who may be eligible for pretrial release under close supervision. All aspects of the agency's work are computerized: Recommendations are sent to the court via computer, a case tracking system facilitates transfer of files between the agency and the court, letters reminding defendants of court dates are generated daily, and a variety of reports are generated to assist in the supervision of release conditions.

Project Focus offers juveniles an alternative to the juvenile court system. It counsels them and family members and assigns community service projects as an alternative to detention. The purpose of Project Focus is to involve people in overcoming juvenile delinquency through their own efforts in constructive community activities. It has become more evident as increasing numbers of juveniles are involved in violent crimes, substance abuse, and gang activities that local police departments need to interact more with parents, schools, the courts, and social service providers to meet the crises of the juvenile offender problem. The Tempe Police Department has traditionally been involved in many programs with juveniles and focuses on a \"proactive\" mode to encourage good citizenship and responsible behavior. The depal1ment has forged many close ties with other segments of the community such as the school districts, the Community Services Division of the City of Tempe Youth Diversion, Arizona State University, and the Boys and Girls Club, among others. Project Focus reenforces efforts by working with juvenile first-time offenders and their famHies to help preclude any further contact with the formal juvenile justice system. The program recognizes that first-time offenders need to be offered the opportunity to bypass the fonnal justice system, but also perceives a need to adopt a holistic approach involving families, current relationships with peers, schools, and individual personal and social situations. The primary goal of Project Focus is the exchange of infonnation between the Tempe Police Department, families, and social service providers. The process follows a scenario similar to the following steps: A juvenile commits an offense and is referred or has citation completed by a law enforcement officer or agency. The referral is forwarded to the Juvenile Unit sergeant and then to the respective school liaison detective. The referral is reviewed by the detective and then the Maricopa County Juvenile Court Center is contacted to determine if the juvenile has any prior referrals. Referrals are returned to the Juvenile Unit sergeant with a notation to forward the juvenile to Juvenile Court Center of youth Diversion Program if the youth is a first\u00ad time offender. After the referral goes to Youth Diversion, parents are notified and services are explained. After a juvenile and family successfully complete the program, a report and prognosis are returned to the Juvenile Unit sergeant, who reviews and forwards it to the school liaison detective for records. If a parent or family does not respond to the letter, the same procedure is followed and the school liaison detective then personally contacts the parent or family and explains the services. Names of juveniles referred into the Diversion Program because of a citation (curfew, minor in possession of alcohol) are forwarded to the Juvenile Unit sergeant and then to the Juvenile Unit detective for review and information. Juveniles cited in other jurisdictions are included. While police officers are working with any juvenile, they will contact appropriate school personnel, teachers, counselors, or administrators for help in determining how best to handle the individual. Officers may determine patterns of poor attendance, disciplinary problems, or poor grades. At least two times per year, the Juvenile Unit meets to update members on activities and procedures within the Youth Diversion program to determine how best to continue meeting the needs of the at-risk population. Social workers and school representatives are involved as appropriate. The Juvenile Unit then avails itself of the resources developed for youth by the Tempe\u00b7 Community Services Department, Social Services Division, which include counseling, the Tempe After School Enrichment Program (recreation and leisure activities), and career guidance and employment services. Other programs include \"I'm Cool\" (I'm in Control of My Own Life), which supports resistance to drugs and alcohol and fosters positive peer influence in grades 4-6; Youth Leadership Programs, which help to develop a sense of belonging; team building; and activities that build communication skills, self-esteem, organizational skills, and community awareness.

Jurisdictions that choose to participate in SDSS are expected to make a commitment to work toward increasing the use of such care for the juveniles in their jurisdiction. SDSS consists of three primary components: attendant care, the constant and direct supervision of juveniles in a non secure setting by a trained attendant; detention, the supervision of a juvenile within the secure setting of a facility certified as meeting all established jail and detention standards; and\u00b7transportation, the transport of a juvenile to either setting. . An attendant care site is typically a furnished room in a nonsecure public facility or a nonsecure area of a public facility, such as a police station, detoxification center, public or private agency, or interested private business. Currently, 5 detention and 24 attendant care sites are in operation. One detention center is part of the state industrial school; the remaining 4 are run by counties. Of the attendant care sites, 14 are operated by counties, 5 by private providers, 2 by cities, 2 by tribal agencies, and 1 by a juvenile court. Attendant care and transportation costs are generally reimbursed in full by the Division of Juvenile Services, and detention costs are reimbursed on a 50 percent .basis for juveniles meeting the entrance criteria. Detention and attendant care can be provided by one jurisdiction on behalf of adjoining jurisdictions, and authorized private agencies can provide attendant care.

Community service work, in which the offender perfonns a specific number of hours of work with nonprofit public agencies and organizations. Employment opportunities for offenders to work and pay back victims for their losses. The Tuscaloosa program offers a balanced approach to juvenile restitution. It emphasizes victims and victims' services as it stresses offender accountability and employment opportunities. Direct victim service, in which the offender works for the victim, is a type of restitution favored by program administrators, but also one which few victims readily accept. The concept of accountability underlies the program; the juvenile offender is responsible for the offense and must restore the loss. The program emphasizes that restitution is something the offender must do for the victim, not something the court does to the offender. To allay community concerns, much work is accomplished by closely supervised work crews that also serve to occupy offenders' leisure time in paid or unpaid community service work. Offenders are ordered to repay both individual victims and the community for damages and losses caused by their actions. Offenders may find their own work or may accept a job developed for pay by the program is staff. Unpaid community service work fills the requirement when a case has no individual victim and no out-of-pocket losses have resulted. Victims participate in the restitution process by being kept infonned of the status of their case and participating in detennination of the amount and type of restitutions. Victim participation helps victims see that the juvenile court system is working for them and may be more satisfied than those who remain uninvolved. Creating the program raised issues of liability among court personnel since the restitution undertaking would become part of the court program. Close supervision and admission guidelines have lessened such concerns. The program will not take offenders with a violent history, with severe emotional problems, or those who are chronic drug and alcohol abusers. Initially it was limited to first-time or minor offenders, but admission of some chronic, more serious offenders led to equally promising results. The juvenile and his or her parent or legal guardian must also be willing to sign a contractual agreement that spells out the nature of the work to be performed, the number of hours to be perfonned, and the date of completion as determined by the Tuscaloosa County Restitution Program. A unit of three-Restitution Coordinator, Job Developer, and Work Supervisor-works closely with the probation department and is responsible for overseeing details related to each case, including helping probation officers supervise restitution requirements. Youth too young to have a work permit perform community service work. Similarly, hard-to-place offenders perform community service work in a crew under close supervision of the Work Supervisor. When an offender works for an employer for pay, he or she pays two-thirds of the money received to the County Clerk, who in turn distributes it to the victim(s). Having a job component as a direct part of the program gives many offenders their first positive job experience and counters job lack as an excuse for failing to make restitution. It improves program efficiency since monitoring assures that restitution is not being made by parents or others. Community awareness campaigns are continual to keep the community informed about program efforts and results. Reaction has been largely positive from victims and among members of the business community. Unpaid community service work has proven straightforward with nonprofit agencies agreeing to help supervise offenders onsite and to submit a weekly written progress report detailing the number of hours worked and an assessment of the quality of the work. The advisory board that oversees the program comprises local attorneys, vocational educators, state employment counselors, parents, business leaders, and university personnel and helps protect both offenders' and victims' rights. The program's outlook is optimistic; it does not cure all problems of juvenile offenders, but helps teach accountability and repayment. The present view is that \"if courts are interested in punishment, then restitution can be effective; but if courts are interested in rehabilitating juvenile offenders, there does not appear to be any available data to support the claim that restitution by itself has any appreciable rehabilitative value on troubled youth.\" The program costs considerably less than probation ($500 versus $750 per case) or commitment to the State Department of Youth Services, which costs upwards of $30,000 for a year of treatment.

Many of its participants have not responded positively to traditional counseling methods; by offering perceived high risk and rewards, this program teaches them how to cope, make decisions, and experience success. Program goals are for participants to prevent community placement, prevent contact with Juvenile Court Intake, and complete program goals. Canoeing, whitewater rafting, skiing, caving, and other outdoor pursuits are used to encourage trust building, goal setting, problem solving, challenge through stress, and humor. The challenges are stressful yet fun, focusing on breaking the cycle of failure that causes a negative self-concept. As youth experience physical success, they recognize that the seemingly difficult is often attainable. As they struggle through self-imposed limits, they begin to see themselves as more capable and successful. Personal growth contacts in conjunction with individual and group goals direct youth toward developing self image, a sense of responsibility, problem solving skills, and the will to achieve. Confronting both the challenges and themselves, they learn that only the best effort is acceptable in this highly structured and supportive framework. Although the tenn \"high risk\" is used in describing experimental challenge education, personal and group safety are consistently maintained. Success rates for meeting program goals are high, with the typical referral completing the program in 4.5 months, remaining free of juvenile intake referrals during involvement and becoming better equipped to deal with the continuing challenges of being a responsible individual.

In the Houston area, however, some justices are beginning to refer such matters to local teen courts run by the YMCA. After pleading guilty (the teen courts do not rule on guilt or innocence), offenders attend a session of Teen Court where evidence is presented by a teenaged prosecutor and defense attorney to a teenage jury and alternative sentences handed down. Usually it consists of community service but may involve attending seminars on such topics as alcohol abuse, serving on the teen court as a juror, or group projects. Usually the justice of the peace will have the defendant's record for a particular offense dismissed after the teen court's penalty is satisfied. Middle schools and high schools also use the courts to empower students to maintain good discipline, attendance, and behavior. Typical cases involve tardiness, excessive absences, or disruptive behavior.

Recommendations for Prosecution/Courts/Corrections: Accelerate and Toughen Responses by the Court System Strategy: Operate boot camps for juveniles in conjunction with drug rehabilitation and schooling Camp Roulston, Cuyahoga County Juvenile Court Boot Camp Program Type: Target Population: Project Startup Date: Annual Budget/Number of Persons Served Annually: Sources df Funding: Program Objectives/Description: Boot camp Male juvenile offenders ages 14 to 17 1991 (pilot study), 1992 camp opened $1,421,434/approximately 150 to 160 served, Dec. 1991-April 1993 Department of Justice, Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention; State of Ohio, Cuyahoga County On April 1, 1992, the North American Family Institute, in partnership with the Cuyahoga County Juvenile Court, opened Camp Roulston in Hudson, Ohio, a pilot boot camp program for male juvenile offenders. The project, funded by the federal government's Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP) and by the Ohio Department of Youth Services, is an effort to find alternative interventions for adolescent offenders ages 14 to 17 at the time of commitment. All participants in the project are screened and randomly selected through a process designed by the Cuyahoga County Juvenile Court and independent project evaluators. Camp Roulston is located on the grounds of the Youth Development Center (YDC), a staff\u00ad secure residential facility for juvenile offenders committed by the Court. The YDC is operated by the County Department of Youth Services and comprises eight 20-bed cottages, a school, a gym with swimming pool, and administration buildings. Two of the cottages are dedicated to Camp Roulston, each with individual sleeping rooms, a kitchen, a large attached recreation/physical conditioning area, and a large multipurpose room. The cottages are situated to provide a separation of Camp Roulston population from the other youth committed to the YDC. The Camp Roulston model was developed within an ordered, predictable, and highly structured environment. Its framework is composed of rehabilitation, sound child care practices, and behavior management with a military overlay. The military elements incorporated include regimentation, physical conditioning, academic and vocational skm building, and character development within a supportive and rehabilitative framework. Neither the degradation nor excessive punishment often found in adult boot camps are part of the program. The focus of the Camp Roulston project lies in individuals becoming invested in their own service plan and participating in their own advancement. The programming begins with a high level of structure and supervision, which is lessened as the youth develops stronger skills and controls. The peer group is the primary treatment force that lays ground rules and determines how the youths and staff interact. As youngsters take on leadership roles, they also provide role models for newer residents. The project was created to break developing patterns of delinquency by increasing academic achievement and literacy, providing discipline through physical conditioning and teamwork, developing good work habits and accompanying skills, reducing substance abuse, and promoting pro-social values and accountability. The project provides services with decreasing levels of intensity over 12 months. The first step is a I-month screening and selection process followed by a 3-month intensive residential boot camp, and up to 8 months after leaving in a community-based aftercare project. Participation may be shortened or lengthened. The residential phase consists of three progressive 30-day phases: recruit, cadet, and commissioned. Every 30 days, 10 commissioned youth move into the City Center program as a new group of 10 enters the program. The three phases are long enough for an individual to show positive effort, and has the benefit of clear occasions for rites of passage. Without the follow up that follows after the youth moves back into the community, all could be quickly lost. The four stages of the City Center program are Intensive Mtercare, Stepdown Phase 1, Stepdown Phase 2, and a flexible tracking phase that includes support groups or mentoring as needed. The aftercare case managers initiate contact with the youngsters during their residency at the Camp to help ensure a smooth transition. They seek to provide a structure that will minimize the potential for the youth to relapse into old patterns and behaviors. Programming individualizes the requirements for each youth and includes assessment, education or vocational training, positive peer culture and group interaction guided by staff, individual counseling, family liaison and support, behavior management based on a point system, personal hygiene and health maintenance, and substance abuse education and prevention. The initial screening comprises a medical exam, a mental health screen, and personal and family history. The educational program during the 90-day residential period includes language arts, math, science, and history (American and Mrican American). Those pursuing a GED have individualized instruction, daily living skills, and preemployment skills. Job readiness and job-seeking skills are taught throughout the program, based on assessment of the youth's vocational interest inventory. Throughout the residential period, pro-social, positive peer\u00ad group interaction is enforced to help youth rely on and be responsible for each other within the context of an affirmative mission. The Camp Roulston experience promotes opportunities for youth to experience success in education, self discipline, physical conditioning, and social and community living. Aftercare reinforces lessons learned and addresses real-world family and community living concerns.

Juvenile offenders who owe restitution (both monetary and symbolic) are court-ordered to repay their victims and community through participation in the program. The Earn-It Project seeks to reduce the impact of juvenile crime and delinquency by holding youthful offenders accountable for their delinquent acts. Earn-It provides a structured way to hold juvenile offenders accountable for their illegal action. Earn-It arranges work placement, matching the offender's strengths with the needs of the worksite, and monitors each youth's placement in area businesses, nonprofit agencies, and municipalities. Youth are carefully screened to determine suitability and motivation for the program. Program rules and expectations are discussed with the youth and parents. An assessment of the youth's abilities, skills, and interests is completed. Information gained from the interview and other sources is used not only to determine if the youth is appropriate for the program but also to allow staff to make the best match between the youth and the available worksites. Once a placement is obtained, Earn-It staff monitor the youth's job performance through regular contact with his or her supervisor, the parents, and the youth. Program staff make regular reports to Juvenile Services Officers and the Keene District Court. Since its inception in 1988, Earn-It youth have returned thousands of dollars to victims and have performed hundreds of hours of community service work. The community has benefited from reduced crime and reduced costs, while the youth have profited from the experience by learning more acceptable roles within the community-volunteer service and employment skills-that remain with them for the rest of their lives.

Bar Foundation, South Bay Rotary Club, State of Califomia Office of Criminal Justice, United Way, Hollywood Park Racing Charities, the Southbay PIC/City of Inglewood Employment Development Department, and the cities of Gardena, Hawthome, and Lawndale Project Objectives/Description: MARS, a program of the Centinela Valley Juvenile Diversion Project, assists injured parties and youth offenders in working out an agreement for repayment of the victim's losses caused by the offender. MARS assists the offender in fulfilling the agreement by referral to job and/or community services placement programs and monitors the progress toward completion. Participation in the program is voluntary and limited to first-or second-time offenders whose crime lends itself to restitution (such as repayment of property loss or damage) and to those who are interested in meeting with the victim to \"set things right.\" Victims who participate understand and support the goals of restitution and reconciliation. Parents are urged to be active participants by supporting the juvenile and his/her efforts to resolve the matter. Meetings are conducted by trained, certified volunteer mediators who facilitate the process. Two neutral mediators (trained volunteers) conduct the meeting, where both the injured party and the youth tell their story. The meeting is confidential and usually lasts about 1 1/2 hours, including a 20-to 30-minute orientation to explain the procedures in detail prior to the mediation. An agreement (if reached) is then written detailing how losses will be repaid, such as through dollars, community service, or other means agreeable to both parties. Responsibility for the success or failure lies with the participants. Taking part in the mediation and reaching an agreement is voluntary. If participation is declined at any time in the process or if an agreement is not reached or fulfIlled for any reason, the case will be returned to the original agency for action. Evaluations performed at the mediations indicate that 100 percent of juveniles and victims were glad they participated; 97 percent would recommepn mediation; 95 percent of victims rated the process as \"good or excellent\"; 70 percent of lue juveniles rated it \"good or excellent\"; and 30 percent rated it \"fair.\" An agreement has been reached in all but one mediation, only one youth has been rearrested for the same crime, and three youth were referred to the agency for not completing the agreement.

This highly structured and regimented boot camp will provide a sentencing alternative for first-time and other at\u00ad risk juvenile offenders, in lieu of 45-day detention, probation, or commitment to the Division of Youth Services. Camp Falcon is located on the grounds of Lookout Mountain Youth Services Center's secure campus. The ?rogram consists of a 60-day, regimented military boot camp that includes academic education, life-skills counseling, and drug and alcohol education. Youth are supervised by highly trained staff 24 hours a day; the program structures every minute of a youth's time from 5 a.m. wake-up until 9 p.m. lights-out. Youth sentenced to Camp Falcon must meet four criteria: adjudicated delinquent male sentenced by the court to regimented juvenile training; ages 12-18; psychologically able to handle a confrontational, disciplinary milieu; and physically able to participate in an intensive training regimen. The program is designed for first-time offenders, probation violators, and youth sentenced under the new handgun legislation. In general, the youth sentenced have committed property crimes, but may have some assaultive behavior. The judge hearing the case makes the initial sentencing decision based in part on the presentencing report of the juvenile's probation officer. Postsentencing mental and phySical assessment and time spent in detention may reduce the standard 60-day length of stay. An aftercare program is provided upon a youth's completion of the Camp Falcon program.

The Consortium educates \"gatekeepers\" to identify high-risk youth and drug-using youth, make supportive interventions, and refer adolescents and family members to a prevention or treatment resource. With the Mesa County District Attorney serving as a gatekeeper, youth arrested for drug and alcohol related offenses are referred through the Consortium to the Mesa County Partners one-to-one program, or to the ARU Grand Junction for outpatient therapy. The family members are referred to the National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Abuse for 6 weeks of private and group education. The gatekeeper role has been expanded to include School District #51 and to involve high risk students who are identified as children of alcoholics or abusers.

Some are assigned to the program as a court disposition where drug or alcohol use is identified as a contributing factor, and others enter voluntarily at their own expense. The diversion process is intended to provide a cost-effective alternative for dealing with violations of alcohol and drug possession laws by emphasizing an edUcation/prevention/communication approach with parental involvement. The diversion process requires that a juvenile offender attend a 4-hour Chemical Abuse Awareness Program with at least one parent, conducted by the River Ridge Treatment Center and the Dakota County Chapter of Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD). This program will aid the juvenile in developing effective communication skills and provide the juvenile with methods of making healthy decisions regarding refusal to be involved in illegal alcohol and drug activity. When available, a victim impact panel will be included in the program. This portion of the program depicts real-life consequences when a person drives drunk and is involved in a collision or loses control of a vehicle. The Juvenile and Marijuana Diversion Program has shown promising results. Ninety-three percent of all juveniles referred for diversion have chosen diversion over the court process; 519 juveniles have completed diversion; 80 percent have completed diversion within 45 days from the date of their referral; more than 97 percent of juveniles scheduled for diversion have successfully completed it; there has been a 9 percent recidivism rate for juveniles who completed diversion.

Recognizing that drug rehabilitation will be less than effective if intervention is delayed, the FIRST program ensures that diversion is typically granted within I day of the offender's release from custody, and that orientation, supervision, and treatment engage the participant early and often. The FIRST drug court is designed to promote the rehabilitation, rather than simply the adjudication, of drug-using offenders. A hands-on approach, judicial involvement, and coordinated, comprehensive supervision are central to the program. Divertee, probation officer, and judge work closely throughout the program, with the offender held accountable for his or her conduct through the implementation of the supervision model. Strong linkages between participating agencies, vigilant monitoring, and frequent program contacts and drug tests reinforce accountability. Supervision and counseling are provided within a weekly group session, drug education classes, and community-based counseling programs. Under the tenns of the program's contingency contract, positive behavior is rewarded and negative behavior is penalized. Points accrued by the completion of rehabilitative tasks may translate into rewards (the court reduces diversion term or fee) or sanctions (the court increases intensity of supervision and/or treatment, or orders the divertee into custody). The divertee is returned to court immediately after substantial noncompliance for a modification or tennination hearing, with sanctions increasing in severity with the number and seriousness of violations.

Juvenile Court Services works with law enforcement agencies and the Madison County Juvenile Court to help youth ages 9 to 17 in trouble with the law by assessing each individual and tailoring a treatment plan to meet his or her needs. The treatment plan is to help rehabilitate young people, not to punish them. It is the belief of Juvenile Court Services that young people who come to the court's attention are salvageable. If their unruly or delinquent behavior is detected in time, youth in tr~uble can learn how to change their behavior and become productive members of society. Any young person who comes to the attention of county authorities because of delinquent or unruly behavior must first go through Intake Services to open his/her case. Referrals may be made by parents, citizens, schools, or law enforcement; most are in the form of petitions that specify illegal conduct. A Juvenile Court Services intake counselor talks with the youth, his family, and other involved parties to explore the nature of the complaint against the youth and gather infonnation. The counselor then writes a report for the Juvenile Court Judge that includes a social history and a recommendation for treatment if the youth admits guilt or is later found guilty in court. The counselor makes certain the youth is represented by an attorney if one is wanted. Every effort is made to match the specific sanctions imposed to the type of delinquent offense. The juvenile judge considers these recommendations when making disposition. Sanctions range from monitOling along a continuum that increasingly restrict freedom to the extreme of commitment to the state for placement in a youth correctional facility. ------------------------~-- No youth leaves the court system without court-ordered surveillance. Minor offenders are placed in the Monitoring/Liaison Service. For 3 months a caseworker works with the youth and family to help him or her fulfill the contract agreed upon with the judge on reaching short-and long-tenn goals. Rules always include curfew and regular school attendance. Youth who adhere have cases closed in 3 months; those who do not are returned to court. A new component is focusing on 9-to 12-year-olds who, with parents, meet weekly for 6 weeks with members from the University of Tennessee Agricultural Extension Service and a monitoring coordinator. First-time juvenile offenders ages 13 to 17, primarily shoplifters, learn the adverse effects of their behavior on themselves, businesses, and the community in a 12-week \"Street Law\" program taught by local attorneys and other experts. It focuses on the community and its laws. It teaches decisionmaking skills and individual rights and responsibilities under the legal system. Parents are required to attend. Young people in trouble on school-related problems, grades four through six, work with special caseworkers to come to grips with problems such as truancy, unruly behavior, and academic failure. Teacher Probation Officers serve as the child's liaison between the school and the court. Older juveniles in junior and senior high school are taken to juvenile court, where they are under court order to attend school and follow specific rules. Youth with alcohol or drug-related charges assessed for appropriate treatment as required. All must attend Alcohol Safety Education classes to have driver's licenses returned. Parents must also attend 6 hours of educational classes. Juveniles also perfonn 24 hours of assigned public service works, and all are monitored for a minimum of 6 months. The most frequently ordered alternative to detention is restitution or community service work. Juvenile Court Services staff supervise youth work crews at public sites, or youth are assigned to public or private nonprofit agencies that can provide supervision. Crafts (stained glass, rug weaving) are taught, and articles are sold and profits kept in a fund for youth with serious needs. Youth charged with serious offenses and are considered a danger to themselves or others are taken by law enforcement officials to the Detention Center that serves several counties. The typical stay is less than a week. The youth are usually gUilty of burglary, assault and battery, vandalism of possession of a deadly weapon. Juvenile Court probation then follows. In addition to signing an agreement with the court to abide by certain regulations, the juvenile participates in meetings where attendees discuss life skills, self-esteem, health, and anger control. Minimum probation is 6 months.

Services provided to over 2,000 victims annually include infonnation, crisis intervention, counseling, and financial assistance. The witness management system ensures that victims are kept infonned of the status of their case, educates victims and witnesses on the criminal justice process, and ensures that victims have support as their cases move through the criminal justice system. Being victimized and going through the court system can be difficult and confusing. Trained victim advocates can provide support, infonnation, and referrals. A victim advocate gives infonnation about how the court system works; provides referrals for a therapist or other resources, including financial assistance; assists in dealing with creditors, transportation, translation services, household assistance, or child care; answers or finds the answers to medical and legal questions; and talks to parents, frielllds, and other family members about the crime.

The program began when the Department of Juvenile Services, the State agency responsible for providing and coordinating court services, began victim assistance and restitution programs in each of its 10 regions. Many of the rights afforded victims of juveniles by these programs were later incorporated in the State's 1989 \"victim bill of rights.\" That law guarantees victims the right to know the identity of the accused, to be notified of and attend all hearings, and to provide an oral or written statement of the impact of the crime. One part-time victim coordinator handles the annual caseload of about 300 juveniles referred for felony offenses, sharing office space with other juvenile services staff several blocks from the court. The program identifies victims by checking the docket to find cases scheduled for trial and reviewing court intake's list of cases handled informally (misdemeanors only) to find those involving financial losses. For these target cases, the coordinator calls victims a few weeks before a scheduled hearing to explain the system, encourage their attendance, and provide assistance preparing information for restitution decisions. Assistance in preparing victim impact statements for the court is the primary service. The coordinator telephones victims to alert them to approaching hearings, to explain how to document losses, and to encourage the victim to write an impact statement. On the basis of infonnation from the victim, the coordinator prepares an impact report for the court file and is available at all juvenile hearings (once a week) to clarify the information. Unlike other programs in the juvenile system, the program does not use mailings or other written materials to reach and orient target victims. It reaches them almost entirely through telephone contacts (about 70 a month) and personal contact (40 a month).

The Consortium is vested in mobilizing research- and community-based efforts to solve these problems through collaboration and cooperation. Five workgroups-advocacy, community education, outreach, research, and university teaching-comprise an important part of Consortium activities. These autonomous groups, facilitated by participants, serve as a forum for innovative ideas and activities. Workgroup members select an issue within their area of interest, decide how best to make an impact, and take action. An Electronic Clearinghouse data base makes available previously inaccessible information about children and families to agencies and citizens across the state. An easy-to-use electronic retrieval system has been developed to allow broad community access to resources, including research studies, census summaries, and practical publications on raising children and sustaining healthy families. The Consortium also supports activities of various university and community organizations by cosponsoring and publicizing conferences, workshops, and other events focusing on children, youth, and families, as well as sponsoring its own events. Office staff work to connect people that have specific interests. With a data base of more than 8,000 university and community members, the office is able to. help link organizations to speakers; provide mailing lists for the dissemination of information related to children, youth, and families; and direct individuals looking for specific information. The Consortium also publishes a quarterly newsletter.

Pediatricians were virtually inaccessible; the closest was almost 20 miles away and there was no pubiic transportation. County residents knew little about proper prenatal, infant, and child health care. Children's disabilities often went undiagnosed, and chronic illnesses were often untreated. Some children lived in isolated homes where abuse went undetected. Parents had no support in coping with the stresses of child rearing. In 1975, a few committed health care providers led by a local physician used a modest $8,000 grant from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts' Office for Children to set up a well\u00ad child clinic at a local school. Today, that one clinic has grown into an extensive health and social service network, reaching all families in the community and providing them with first\u00ad class service. The successful CHP model has been emulated, through the Harvard University Division of Health Policy, by rural communities from Amarillo, Texas, to Winnsboro, South Carolina. The centerpiece is the well-child care program. Children are given thorough medical exams, and their parents receive comprehensive, preventive health education. Most importantly, bonds are created between staff and families that encourage parents to involve their children in many other program services. Sick-child care is just a phone call away for South Berkshire families. Nurse-practitioners are on call 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and appointments are made quickly. Also available are the Early Intervention Services for children at risk of developmental delays. Physical therapists, speech therapists, nurses, and development specialists help children with disabilities, such as cerebral palsy, stuttering, or dyslexia, and also assist their parents. Rounding out CHP's health services is the South Berkshire Women, Infants and Children (WIC) Program through which mothers receive food vouchers and nutritional advice to ensure proper prenatal care and child nutrition. To combat the isolation often experienced in rural areas, CHP operates programs that give parents a link to a wann supportive community. The Parent-Child Playgroups bring parents and children together for 2 hours each week in a secure setting supervised by a trained teacher. Also available is the Parent-to-Parent Program, which pairs young parents with trained volunteers who guide the neophyte mothers through the daily crises and concerns that arise while bringing up young children. CHP also works closely with the Massachusetts Department of Social Services and other service providers to insure comprehensive care for all clients. CHP hopes to add a social work component that will provide outreach, assessment of needs, and treatment to deal with difficult community problems such as alcoholism.

Box 30 Great Barrington, MA 01230 (413) Strategies: Develop a \"one-stop human services network\" and make it available at schools; increase levels of parental and intergenerational involvement in early childhood education Comer Zigler or COZI Project Program Type: Target Population: Project Startup Date: Annual Budget/Number of Persons Served Annually: Sources of Funding: Program Objectives/Description: Family support, parent and teacher involvement in developing a plan for improving their schools Parents, children, and school staff April 1992 $500,000/950 children (475 in preschool through grade 5) The Carnegie Corporation, state of Virginia World Class grant and school district, Chapter 1 funds The COZI Project is being watched with great interest because it unites two highly regarded models for changing schools into a single program to better meet the needs of children and families. The \"CO\" refers to James Comer's School Development Program (SOP), and the \"Z!\" is Edward Zigler's model for the School of the 21st Century. Both the Comer and the Zigler programs, independently operating in schools around the country, are grounded in a recognition of the prime importance of families in children's education. They also offer complementary strengths to a combined model. The School of the 21st Century brings together various services in a coordinated whole to support families\u00ad before-and after-school child care, preschool for 3-to 5-year-olds, and education and outreach services to parents of children from birth to age 3. The program places these services within a known, widely utilized and easily accessible institution-the public school. The heart of SOP, also known as the \"Comer Process,\" is the direct involvement of parents and teachers in making the school a good place for children's learning and development. This simple but powerful principle has transformed many troubled, low-achieving schools into orderly, lively schools where children learn. Like other schools that have used SOP, COZI began by forming a School Improvement Team of 12 to 14 members-teachers, teacher's aides, the principal, and parents-to organize and maintain the school as a setting in which development and learning can take place. Besides being active collaborators in establishing the school's tone, attitudes, and values, parents serve as teacher's aides and take part in a variety of activities to support social and academic programs. By being involved in the school, parents show that they think school is important-and children get the message. Staff development is also a major focus of SDP programs. As Dr. Comer stresses, SDP is not a set of materials or instructional techniques but a process for creating a sense of not a set of materials or instructional techniques but a process for creating a sense of community and direction for parents, school staff, and students. Selected as the demonstration site for the combined model, Bowling Park Elementary School in Norfolk, Virginia, already had a successful SDP in place under the leadership of a strong and effective principal. It was renamed the Bowling Park COZI Community School. The program reaches out to parents long before their children get to school in order to develop a fInn bond between the parents and the school. Locating the preschool program at the same site where the children will eventually go to school, a feature of Zigler's model incorporated in C02I, seeks to enhance the bonding and involve parents in the transition to school. Bowling Park also has an extended adult education program, which began in 1993, and a school-based health clinic, expected to open in September 1994. Two additional C02I model sites have opened for the 1993-1994 school year. For further information contact: Barbara M.

The program was begun in 1988 as a collaborative venture between the Tacoma Public Schools and the Tacoma/Pierce County YWCA, after a survey revealed that children living in the city's shelters were not enrolled in school. Originally, the program served students from kindergarten through grade 8; in 1991, a Head Start program was added to serve 3-and 4-year olds. The Tone School provides instruction in language arts, mathematics, art, health, and physical education. The level of instruction is based on each child's academic needs. The school screens students for vision, hearing, dental, immunization, and general health needs and conducts interviews with the child to assess social and emotional needs. The school provides support services, as needed. The school also works with the parents. Staff visit the parents at the shelters and link parents with appropriate resources. A parents group meets weekly to address issues of importance to families. When the child leaves the center, staff are available to consult with the teachers and specialists at the new school. Staff are selected on the basis of their experience and success in working with \"at risk\" children. Volunteers assist with all aspects of the program. It is not uncommon for children to enroll in The Tone School 1 day and be gone 3 days later; few students remain more than 90 consecutive days. Children may enroll or withdraw more than once during an academic year. --------- ~-~---~------~--For further information contact: Jack Paul, Principal Eugene P.

This program is the second oldest in the nation. It is totally funded by the taxpayers through the County School System, the Police Department, and state grants. Children are introduced to the program in kindergarten when they meet police officers who talk to them about stranger safety and school bus safety. In first grade, stranger safety is the topic; second graders learn pedestrian safety; third graders are taught about seat/safety belts; and in the fourth and fifth grades, the topics are alternatively safety patrols and bicycle safety. Sixth graders learn more about bus safety. In the intennediate schools, seventh graders hear about the various laws that youth in their age group (generally 12-14) commonly violate and the consequences of being arrested for these violations. A part of the discussion focuses on drug, alcohol, and tobacco violations. High school presentations focus on driver education, including the responsibilities of driving, seat belt use, driving while intoxicated, and related topics. A slide presentation showing automobile crashes and discussions center on the wrecks, the factors that caused the accident, and possible ways it could have been avoided, injuries reduced, or deaths prevented by seat belt use. Other presentations may be requested such as business law or health. There is a \"safety belt convincer\" that is taken to schools when requested, usually during health fairs or safety weeks. Other programs geared toward the student population include a Bicycle Safety team that focuses primarily on bicycle safety and helmet use in compliance with the Fairfax County helmet law for riders age 14 or younger. School programs also include displays for health and safety fairs at local schools and hospitals, and a robot often makes visits on request to present safety demonstrations.

It is designed to: Enhance family functioning by strengthening the parent-child relationship in ways that empower parents to become primary prevention agents for their own children. Prevent target children from experiencing school failure by improving their behavior and performance, helping parents become partners in the education process, and increasing the family's feeling of afftliation with schools. Reduce everyday stress experienced by parents and children by developing support groups for parents of at-risk students, linking participants to needed resources, and helping build the self-esteem of each family member. FAST is a collaborative activity between a school, a mental health agency, an alcohol and substance abuse specialist, and parents. Multifamily meetings are typically staffed by a representative from each, such as a school counselor, a mental health professional, a substance abuse expert, a parent, and a liaison worker or FAST facilitator. Volunteers from the program are recruited to help with meetings. A large room is needed and the FAST Program Workbook serves as a guide for resources needed. The FAST program employs a collaborative, whole family approach and comprises an eight\u00ad week curriculum featuring multiple-family group activities. Monthly meetings are held at the completion of the course. Activities include a meal hosted by a family, sing-alongs, structured family communication exercises and identification of family feelings, promotion of one-on-one quality time, substance abuse education, and winning-as-a-family exercises. A particular aim of the program is to reach whole families and those characterized as \"unreachable\" via the collaborative approach. FAST breaks down the barriers to trust and fear of stereotypes and works on a social-support model that builds on family strengths. It promotes development of active parent groups and advocacy councils. Participants are identified for FAST through an active recruitment process during which school personnel identify at-risk children. Home visits and recruitment training also help focus on needs. A non stigmatizing programmatic approach centers on identifying strengths, and focuses on empowennent, incentives, and removing obstacles to participation via child care and transportation. Of families that enter the program, 82 percent graduate. Scores on assessment instruments have shown that, as rated by both parents and teachers, child behavior has improved. Improvement in family cohesion has also been observed, and a decrease in the social isolation of parents is complemented by increased involvements with their children's schools. Data have been collected on over 700 elementary school children, and program effectiveness measurements are continuing. FAST became a state initiative in 1990 and now is operating in 14 states through the national dissemination efforts of Family Service America. It has been replicated across the state of Wisconsin and works well in in rural, medium-sized and urban communities. The program has also shown benefits for culturally diverse families as well: Spanish-speaking families, Native Americans, Mrican Americans, European Americans, and Asian Americans.

Through Family Resource Centers and Youth Services Centers in or near schools across the state, children and families can obtain needed services or referrals, as well as active support, both at the centers and in their own homes. Integrated services centers for children and families are being discussed around the nation, but Kentucky is the first state to implement them statewide and to define family support as a core program for children's success in the landmark 1990 Kentucky Reform Act. The 383 centers operating in 1993-1994 represent 651 Kentucky schools with more than 191,000 students. More centers will be added until they serve the approximately 1,130 schools in which 20 percent of the students are eligible to receive free school meals. Although each community is encouraged to develop its own local goals and to work with existing local resources, certain components must be included at all centers. Family Resource Centers, which are linked to elementary schools, must provide full-time child care for 2-and 3-year-olds and after-school care for children ages 4 through 12; health and education services for new and expectant parents; education to enhance parenting skills (through home visits, classes, and other vehicles); support and training for child care providers; and health services or referrals. Youth Services Centers, located in or near middle schools and high schools, must provide either services or referrals for health and social services, employment counseling, youth training and placement, summer and part-time job development for youth, substance abuse services, and family crisis and mental health counseling. Combined Family Resource and Youth Services Centers operate at some sites. The first step of service delivery is to identify and coordinate existing resources and then to link families with the services they need. When service gaps are known, the centers work to fill them. There is an overall prevention focus with the obvious need for intervention efforts as well. With funds from the Annie E. Casey Foundation, the Family Resource and Youth Services Centers are initiating an evaluation process designed to meet outcome indicators for school\u00ad based perfonnance standards and to identify successful program approaches. The plan is to open more centers each year and to serve 100 percent of eligible schools by 1997.

This constant disruption of children's education results in many migrant children falling behind their nonmigrant peers and puts them at risk of school failure. The UUMCDP Program provides a comprehensive set of services to meet the needs of migrant children from birth through age 21. UUMCDP began providing services to families in 1958. Services for migrant children were funded entirely by the state of Pennsylvania until 1967 when the first federal money for migrant education became available. Since then, many other organizations in the area have started providing services to migrant children and families. Now UUMCDP, through the Migrant Even Start Family Literacy Program coordinates the efforts of many organizations and integrates services from federal agencies and programs, such as Migrant Health Services, JOBS Services, Rural Opportunities, Inc., and Migrant Day Care. For very young children, education services include child care centers, as well as group and family child care homes. Through contract arrangements with UUMCDP, high-quality child care with a focus on academic readiness is provided. For school-age children, UUMCDP provides int(!rvention specialists, at no cost, to schools serving migrant children. For children with limited English-proficiency, Project P.I.A.G.E.T., a national Title VII program, focusing on increasing English language communication skills and improving children's self image, is incorporated into child care center curriculum and other school programs. UUMCDP also works to strengthen parents in their roles as teachers and advocates for their children. The Parents as Tutors Program teaches migrant parents how to facilitate learning and become educational advocates for their children. The federal Even Start Program helps parents become better teachers and supporters of their children, and to improve their own literacy. Due to the nature of their parents' employment, many migrant children are not aware of career opportunities outside of agriculture. To fill this gap, UUMCDP provides career training to educate migrant youth about alternative careers and give them hands-on training through a work experience program. Students between the ages of 15 and 21 who have not yet graduated from high school have the opportunity to divide their time between a job and related classroom education. Each year, LIUMCDP evaluates its staff, students, and program. Personnel evaluations are designed to improve the quality of the staff and the services they provide. Student progress is measured by a variety of educational tests. Evaluation of the program includes input from staff and parents, as well as a state team that evaluates preschool and school programs.

A coalition made up of the City of San Diego; San Diego City Schools; San Diego Housing Commission; San Diego Community School District; and San Diego County Department of Health, Social Services, and Probation, along with the University of California at San Diego, and the Children's Hospital and Health Center, are sponsoring the effort. The Coalition opened a demonstratio~ center at Hamilton Elementary School in September 1991. The school, located in a low-income area of the city, serves roughly 1,200 children from kindergarten through fifth grades and their families. At the center, families receive comprehensive case management from a team of family services advocates, repositioned staff from the participating agencies who serve families living in the same geographical area. These advocates provide ongoing counseling and service planning; help family members access services; and make referrals to education, social, and health services. Preventive health and mental services for children are provided by New Beginnings staff. The Far West Laboratory for Educational Research and Development is leading a three-year multidisciplinary evaluation of New Beginnings, but no outcome data are yet available. New Beginnings will expand to several schools as determined by the results of the feasibility studies being conducted. Steps are being taken to integrate California's Healthy Start Program, which is based on the New Beginnings model.

Casey Foundation, matching funds by local contributors, including the City of Savannah, Chatham County, United Way, and the school system In 1988, Savannah's leaders were becoming increasingly concerned about juvenile crime, school dropouts, teenage pregnancy, and drug abuse. An examination of the existing services available to children and youth in the community, revealed that they were too limited and fragmented to make a real difference in helping children succeed-a familiar story in cities around the country. The Annie E. Casey Foundation, under its New Futures Initiative, encouraged Savannah and four other cities to fonn local collaboratives to find more coherent and relevant ways for existing progmms to better serve children and families. To support these efforts, Casey committed substantial funds over a 5-year period to be matched by each city. To meet the New Futures goals of improving students' academic level, increasing school attendance and graduation rates, increasing youth employment after high school, and reducing adolescent pregnancy and parenthood, Savannah has developed several strategies. All students at four middle schools are screened, and those identified as being at high risk receive intensive services by multidisciplinary \"Stay Teams.\" The team develops an individualized service plan for each identified student, and a case manager helps in obtaining needed services. New Futures also has a Teenage Parenting Program in which pregnant teenagers may leave their home schools and attend an alternative school with special provisions for their needs. Because students behind in grade level have a markedly higher dropout rate, New Futures makes strenuous efforts to help students catch up while in middle school. In the Comprehensive Competencies Program, the grade level for each middle-school student is diagnosed by computer; students behind by at least two grades receive a personalized program designed to bring them up to grade level. For students promoted to high school, a Transition Resource Teacher at the school provides support and a link between home, school, and community agencies providing needed services. New Futures' Preschool Program serves preschool children at several sites, each of which includes a teacher, a paraprofessional, and a family advocate to help families access needed services. The Burger King Academy, funded by Burger King and other local sources, provides an alternative educational setting for students whose achievement is accelerated in a nontraditional school setting. The last two components are the Family Resource Center, which offers a wide array of family-based services and activities directed by neighborhood residents in a targeted area of the city, and the Black Male Task Force, fonned to address the special needs of African American male students.

It offers educational, health, counseling, vocational, and child care services and is an alternative school of the Albuquerque Public Schools. The mission of New Futures School is to assist and motivate school-age parents to make responsible, infonned decisions; to help them move toward completion of their secondary education; and to become more mature. It encourages them to have healthy pregnancies and families and to become responsible parents-which for some may mean making a choice to release a child for adoption-and to become well-adjusted, contributing, self-sufficient members of their communities. No teenage mothers asking for assistance are denied access to the program. The New Futures School is housed in its own facility and includes all basic services except housing. Low-cost goods are sold at a volunteer-run \"Dime Store,\" and the facility contains a library with children's toys and books as well as student books and materials. Provided are education, vocational training, child care, health services, job development and job finding assistance, counseling and social services. Health instruction is given by nurse/health educators and a weekly prenatal clinic is operated by the University of New Mexico School of Medicine's Maternity & Infant Care Project. There are four child care facilities on site for clients' children. A Jobs Training program is available to 30 to 40 students per year in which job-finding and keeping skills are emphasized. There are five Foster Grandparents who volunteer at the facility. Staff members possess varying areas of skills and expertise and many work as independent consultants or through technical assistance contracts. They also provide workshops, training and technical assistance to adolescent pregnancy programs as well as concerned organizations and agencies throughout the U. s. and Canada. --------- ----- The New Futures School has two departments. The largest and oldest, the Perinatal Program, serves the teenager who enters during pregnancy and remains until the end of the semester in which her child was born. If a child is younger than three months at semester end, the mother may remain for another semester. The services of the program are available to an individual for only one pregnancy. The second department, \"Young Parents' Center,\" is for school-age mothers and fathers who are unable to successfully participate in a regular school program following the birth of their child. Students are carefully screened, and the Young Parents' Center serves only those at highest risk from a high-risk group. It offers all of the educational and support services of the school, and clients may remain as long as need dictates provided they are showing steady progress toward attaining a GED or diploma. The New Futures School also has an outreach program to respond to requests from schools, churches, and community agencies for presentations that will help reduce pregnancies. Presentations focus on helping them understand the realities and responsibilities of parenthood and to learn to consider how a pregnancy could affect their lives. Some 1,500 to 2,000 teenagers are reached annually by the school's presentations, which sometimes involve students and often feature the school's self-produced video titled \"See What the Future Will Bring.\" New Futures, Inc. also sponsors training series for parents of pre-teens, \"Family Talks,\" to help parents educate their children about sex and to foster a sense of self-worth in their children. The school has had impressive results with high-risk pregnant teenagers and young mothers. Almost 75 percent of the students continue on to a post-secondary education. Nationally, fewer than half of teenage parents graduate from high school. The school's rate of low birth weight babies is lower than the national average for teenage mothers and repeat pregnancies are less than half that of the national rate. A drawback to replication of the New Futures school is its size and scope, which makes it extremely expensive.

Operation Schoolhouse is an afterschool tutorial program for economically and socially disadvantaged students residing in an Ocean County, New Jersey, public housing project. Upon an agreement between the tenants and the Ocean County Narcotics Strike Force, the following components were identified: a large, single complex with a major drug problem; law-abiding residents who resist drug dealers; a progressive school system; and a law enforcement presence to support the educational activities. To provide space for the program, the local housing authority leased space with the housing project to the school system for $1 a year. Before Operation Schoolhouse started, the County Department of Corrections provided inmates on work details to refurbish the space with fresh paint and furniture, which were provided from the prosecutor's asset forfeiture fund. The school district used moneys from a federal grant to pay teachers who volunteered to teach three evenings a week for 2-hour sessions. Teachers provided additional instruction and assistance to students in kindergarten through grade 6. Because of the tutorial program, the complex was designated as a Drug-Free School Zone under New Jersey's criminal code. \"Drug-Free School Zone\" signs were purchased by the prosecutor and posted throughout the complex to warn of mandatory penalties under state law for the possession or distribution of drugs. Investigators from the prosecutor's office are present at the complex during program hours to prevent drug dealers or others from interfering with the tutorial program and to ensure the safety and welfare of the teachers and students. L---, ______________________________________________________ ___ / The results of the program have been encouraging. Initial reports show that up to 40 students attend each session. Participation by the children has been consistent, and significant progress has been made in improving their interest in education and their educational perfonnance. Some teachers report that for the first time ever, participating students are turning in their homework in school. The reaction of the teachers has been so positive that the initial sign-up week provided a sufficient number of volunteer teachers for the entire school year. Children have stated that they have been able to obtain the additional help and guidance they need. Due to the program's success, Berkeley Township and Ocean County have added funding to the program through the Board of Education to provide counseling services to students and to expand the program to cover grades K-12. A local college is also providing student teachers to help at the program and to gain teaching experience.

Changes in other traditional support systems such as family, community, and faith institutions have heightened this need. In the Texas Middle School Network a strategy to provide this support ensures that each student spends time regularly with an advisor who knows him or her well and becomes a mentor. To further help reduce feelings of anonymity and create a sense of community, schools break the student body into manageable units-around 120 to 150 students, in most cases-that share a group of 4 or 5 teachers through the course of the day. Cooperative learning addresses young adolescents' needs for social interaction, encourages them to take responsibility for their own learning, and promotes higher order thinking skills. A comprehensive Student Assistance Program provides counseling and referrals for students experienc,ing health, emotional, social, or personal problems. Some schools have school\u00ad based health clinics as well. Services and specifics vary from school to school, but program goals ensure many common denominators, such as substantive parent involvement, connection with the community, a broad range of student support services, academic teaming, and flexible scheduling. Research has demonstrated these practices and services as effective in improving student performance. They are key to the Texas Middle School Network, a linked system of mentor schools and network schools. The Texas vision for restructuring middle schools was based on the Carnegie Corporation of New York's 1989 publication, Turning Points, that presented findings from an intensive study of the educational status of 10-to 15-year-olds and contained recommendations for making education developmentally appropriate for this adolescent age group rather than adapting high school practices. After a Carnegie grant to develop policy directions for middle-level education in Texas was received, a task force was appointed that developed a middle-grades policy statement for the state board of education, and the Division of Middle School Education was established. Currently, 60 \"mentor schools\" and over 800 member schools comprise the network. All middle schools in the state are invited to join, free of charge. Mentor schools, selected for their demonstrated ability to implement effective and developmentally appropriate middle- school practices, commit themselves to providing technical assistance and intensive, ongoing professional development for others serving middle-grade students. These schools serve as laboratories and demonstration sites for a comprehensive set of practices designed to make middle schools more effective in meeting the needs of early adolescents. All network schools may take advantage of staff development opportunities offered through the mentor schools as well as statewide middle school symposia at no cost. Some mentor schools pool resources with districts, education service centers, or professional organizations to sponsor conferences featuring nationally recognized experts. Texas has an extensive data base on student demographics and program results and has recently completed the data on practices and methods currently in place in the state's middle schools. The data base is expected to be completed by fall of 1994 at which time analysis will begin. Positive results were demonstrated on student perfonnance through studies of a similar middle school initiative in Maine. Future plans call for expansion of the network to ail middle schools and to achieve a ratio of one mentor school to each 20 network schools. Expansion will require 80 mentor schools, or about 20 more than currently exist.

The pUIpose of the 1HRIVE program is to keep children in school and out of criminal activity, such as burglaries and drug use. THRIVE centers serve as locations for the police to bring juveniles who are absent from school without an excuse. Parents are notified and required to pick up the child at the center. THRIVE is an interagency, collaborative project. Each participating agency of this interagency, collaborative project operates under a set of guidelines and signs a memorandum of agreement that specifies the resources each agency will devote to the project. The centers are staffed daily by an Oklahoma City police officer, who ensures security, and a school system staff person. Other staff include a social worker, two case managers, and a secretary. The district attorney's office provides rotated staffing for the center 1 day per week. The Oklahoma County Youth Services Agency has agreed to take youth at the end of the day, if a truant's parents cannot be located. Prior to the inception of the program, new legislation was needed to authorize police officers to pick up school-age children or adolescents on the street during school hours and bring them to the 1HRIVE center. The district attorney's office and the coalition worked with state legislative staff to draft the legislation. They met with each agency head to address any concerns before the bill was introduced to the state legislature in an effort to mitigate any potential opposition. During the 1991-92 school year, 446 youth were processed through the two 1HRIVE centers. The Oklahoma City Public School System reports a steady decline in the drop-out rate from 5.9 percent in 1988-89 to 4.1 percent in 1991-92. Over the last 3 years of program operation, the Oklahoma City Police Department reports a 27-percent decline in the number of daytime burglaries. The THRIVE program has received favorable support in the media, and residents of other sections of the county have requested that centers be established in their communities. The second program is 3D-Don't Do Drugs. In this program, high school students of participating schools voluntarily submit to an initial, and later random, urine drug test in exchange for consumer discounts. The students also receive a reference confirmiug their drug-free lifestyle, which can be used when they apply for employment. Before participation in the program is considered, each student must present parental authorization. Only laboratories certified by the National Institute of Drug Abuse are used, and a \"chain of custody procedure is implemented to preserve the integrity of the test. Confirmation testing is automatically conducted on all positive test results to ensure validity. The program is under the direction of the board of directors of Youth Cornerstone, Inc. Youth Cornerstone has established a 3D advisory committee, district steering committees for each school district, and chapters with a leadership panel in each participating school. It has also hired a 3D program coordinator to oversee the activities of programs throughout the county. Currently, more than 1,000 students are participating in 3D. Program feedback from parents, students, and school officials has been positive. Committees and coalitions composed of members from a variety of backgrounds worked out various concerns early in the program development stages, thus mitigating any potential problems.

Programs are specifically designed for classroom management, curriculum infusion, and overall school change. Participants examine the nature and causes of conflict and learn practical methods for dealing more effectively with conflict. BAESR's approach to conflict resolution education includes appreciation of diversity, cooperation skills, multicultural education, anger management, and violence prevention. BAESR's school workshops introduce educators to the concepts of creative conflict resolution, including resolution through children's literature, negotiation, mediation, and appreciation of diversity. At BAESR's in-depth institutes, educators devise specific classroom plans to promote a cooperative environment, learn to integrate conflict resolution into the existing curriculum, build effective strategies for dealing with student prejudices, and develop school violence prevention strategies. BAESR also creates and conducts long-tenn programs in school systems dedicated to school\u00ad wide change. The Boston Conflict Resolution Program (BCRP) , currently running in several urban elementary schools, includes conflict resolution, violence and gang prevention, and methods of dealing with multicultural conflict. BCRP was cited by the Carnegie Foundation as one of 11 state-of-the-art violen(;e prevention programs in the nation. Educators for Social Responsibility, the national organization of which BAESR is an affiliate,' seeks to make social responsibility an integral part of education in the nation's schools. It creates and disseminates new ways of teaching and learning that help young people participate in shaping a better world. Programs and products stimulate critical thinking about controversial issues, teach creative and productive ways of dealing with differences, promote cooperative problem solving, and foster infonned decisionmaking.

It operates programs that prevent the \"revolving door\" in and out of Maryland juvenile institutions and that serve as alternatives to placement of juveniles in costly out-of-state facilities and treatment centers. Program activities focus on the Chesapeake Center Alternative School and the Hollywood Diner (site of the motion picture Diner) where students receive vocational training and learn skills for employment in the food services industry. The school's curriculums and the Center's services include a middle school/secondary school curriculum (grades 7-9); pre\u00ad GED, GED, precareer and technological education. Counseling and psychiatric consultation are available, and the Center supports parent support groups. Recreational activities include sports and field trips. Vocational training focuses on woodworking and carpentry and food services. Staff include certified teachers, vocational specialists, administrative personnel, and classroom aides. A consulting psychiatrist is retained by the Center. Volunteers are supervised by staff and often include students from colleges and universities serving internships or conducting field work. The Chesapeake Foundation for Human Development was founded in Annapolis, Maryland, in 1974 and moved to Baltimore in 1978 where it established operations in a former church building that had been unused since the 1950's. In 1993, a 4,100-square-foot addition was added that contains classrooms, offices, a reception area, and multipurpose space. Renovations have added a computer lab, new kitchen facilities suitable for vocational training, and a student lunchroom/lounge. The Chesapeake Center serves teenagers from 13 to 18 years of age who need a structured academic environment, lack traditionally accepted values or have minor emotional disturbances, but who have a desire to improve their skills and to remain outside juvenile institutions. Students may be referred by families or service agencies. The Center cannot effectively serve adolescents with a.n I. Q. below 65 or those who have been recommended for substance abuse treatment but have not received it. Neither can it accept individuals who have physical handicaps that prevent them from participating in all Center programs and activities. A recently begun activity is \"Youth Opportunities,\" for which the Chesapeake Center will become an anchor site for the Baltimore City Office of Employment Development. The Center is offering additional services that will help many young people overcome barriers such as lack of education, specific job skills, and poor self-esteem that prevent them from obtaining employment. For this program, youths must be between 16 and 21 years of age and able to meet certain income eligibility requirements. For further information contact: Ivan Leshinsky, Executive Director P.O.

Activities give participants the skills to communicate more effectively, build a cooperative environment in which conflict resolution can be practiced and discussed creatively, and improve self-concept. Teachers frequently express frustration at the amount of class time spent in dealing with persistent conflicts. Many of the conflicts are student-student conflicts, such as fighting over property or a place in line, which lend themselves to mediation. The sheer volume of conflicts underscores the need for development of effective conflict resolution skills. CCRC believes that conflict is a nonnal and unavoidable part of life, that the process of resolving conflict leads to personal growth, that there is no one right answer or solution, and that everyone can learn positive conflict resolution skills through practice. CCRC materials explore the roots of conflict and violence, believing that the wider conflicts in our society and the world will continue to threaten our civilization until citizens learn to deal constructively with personal and community problems. CCRC is an experiential program. Sessions begin by inviting participants to sit in a circle to emphasize equality and encourage participation. Activities fall within the following themes: cooperation, communication, affinnation, conflict resolution, problem solving and mediation, and bias awareness. CCRC conducts workshops; teaches courses for credit; and publishes a songbook, a newsletter, and activity handbooks for facilitators.

The project is testing whether a comprehensive school-clinic-community health program can lead to more profound changes in violence-related, sex-related, and other risk behaviors and positively affect the overall health of adolescents, compared with a comprehensive health education curriculum. Headed by the associate director and senior evaluator of Educational Development Center's Center for Health Promotion and Education, the project includes psychologists, physicians, and epidemiologists, as well as subcontracts with the New York City Schools, the New York Academy of Medicine, the Brooklyn Boys and Girls Clubs, and the New York City Health Department. The experimental condition will include a school\u00ad based health clinic, provided under contract through the New York City Health Department, as well as community outreach provided through the Boys and Girls Club, which is in the treatment school neighborhood. The staff of the community organization, the school, and the school clinic will be trained as a group on the content of the intervention, and on implementation policies and procedures.

The program strives to point potential gang memb~rs in different directions, so that gangs lose their allure and following. Following the success of the Phoenix project, Glynco and other cities across the country have instituted the program, which goes into the classroom to prevent young students from joining gangs. Specially trained, uniformed police officers teach GREAT to seventh grade classes during the regular school year. In eight I-hour sessions, students learn to set goals for themselves, act in their own best interest when faced with peer pressure, and settle disputes peacefully. Officers create an atmosphere of understanding to enable all parties to better address problems and work on solutions together. Classes discuss how communities are affected by violence, drugs, and cultural differences, and the diverse responsibilities of individuals in a community. GREAT provides youth with the skills and information they need to say \"no\" to gangs and become responsible members of society. Police training for national expansion of GREAT is supported by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms and the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center. More than 200 agencies in 34 cities are currently operating GREAT programs. For further information contact: Patricia H.

The program requires all newly hired assistant district attorneys to adopt an elementary school and recruits volunteers from among existing staff, including non-attorneys, such as investigators and management information specialists. In addition to their regular responsibilities and caseloads, adopters devote a total of 10 hours per month to program activities, including teaching a class once every 2 weeks throughout the school year. During September and October, paired teachers and adopters attend training conducted by the unit chief and director of training. The law-related curriculum, which emphasizes drug and hate crime, is developed by a committee of teachers, adopters, training organizations, and Legal Lives staff, drawing upon materials from a number of sources, including the National Training and Dissemination Program (NTDP) , the Anti-Defamation League, and Boys and Girls Clubs of America. The Legal Lives staff also have developed their own curriculum, which is being field-tested in the schools and is available for any interested district attorney's office. Legal Lives differs from Project DARE in that it requires that teachers and adopters work in partnership and attend training together; the program does not focus solely on drugs; and teachers incorporate the program's curriculum into their own. There is also a conscious effort to include minority attorneys and judges in the program to serve as role models for the students.

The alliance functions as a working advisory board with major emphasis on teenage pregnancy, violence prevention, and other issues that threaten the life extension of young minority males. Currently, M.A.L.E. is the advisory board for the Wake County Department of Health's Brothers to Brother Project and Violence Prevention Project. Brothers to Brother is a school, community, and agency initiative in male involvement for the prevention of adolescent pregnancy. Brothers to Brother uses after-school health education and tutorial sessions and activities geared toward boosting young people's sdf\u00ad esteem to encourage abstinence and the delay of first-time fatherhood. High school students are employed by the Wake County Department of Health as part-time peer educators and are paid an hourly stipend. These peer educators are trained for more than 50 hours by health educators. After graduation, the peer educators are called student mentors who disseminate information to younger boys ages 9-14 on such issues as puberty, self-esteem, decisionmaking, abstinence, teenage pregnancy, and AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases. Each student mentor travels to a different destination throughout the county. Once the student mentor makes a connection and forms a bond, he or she stays with that group throughout the duration of the series. The Violence Prevention Project, which seeks to reduce the interpersonal violence among adolescents, builds on the Brothers to Brother Project. The student mentors conduct violence prevention education programs and work with the Medication Services of Wake, Inc., to conduct mediation sessions. Brothers to Brother is sponsored by the Wake County Department of Health, the Wake County Public School System's Helping Hands Project, the Raleigh Housing Authority, the Raleigh Boys Club, and the Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc.

With funding from the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education and the Danforth Foundation, four school districts, representing the state's rural, urban and suburban communities launched the program. Missouri began funding the PAT program in all 543 of its school districts in 1985. Since then, PAT has served more than a half million Missouri families and the program has been replicated in 43 other states and \\Vashington, D.C.; and in Australia, England, New Zealand, and in the West Indies. The Parents as Teachers National Center was established by the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education in 1987. It was incorporated as a not-for-profit organization in 1990. The national Center conducts institutes on parent -chilctearl y education that have been attended by educators and other professionals from all over the United States and around the world. The Center has trained and certified more than 5,000 parent educators. In addition to training and technical assistance, the Center provides curriculum development, research and promotion of public policy that supports early childhood family education. The PAT model is being adapted to serve families of varying kinds and in differing circumstances: PAT for Teen Parents offers instruction and guidance to help teen parents with raising a child. Teenage mothers are helped to graduate from high school; chances of a second early pregnancy are reduced and fewer babies are developmentally delayed. PAT for High Needs Families reaches families with multiple needs through Even Start and other Chapter 1 programs, Head Start, public housing projects, and others. PAT in The Child Care Center strengthens the relationship between parents and child care providers by helping them share an understanding of the child along with ~----------------------------------------------------.---------------------------- common goals and experiences. Centers report improved infant and toddler care and better communication between parents and caregivers. PAT for Native Americans was implemented by the Bureau of Indian Affairs on reservations to help address problems of underachievement and school dropout among Native American children. The Bureau wants to expand the program to all of its 144 school sites. PAT in the Workplace was established to meet the needs of working parents, and has been adopted by several large corporations. One company includes the PAT program in its employee benefit package. Military families and families in transition from homelessness are also served in separate programs. Recent research has shown that parents' belief in the program's effectiveness is supported by fact and figures. An independent evaluation of the pilot program demonstrated that children who participated in PAT were significantly advanced over their peers in language, social development, problem solving and other intellectual abilities. In 1989, a follow up study showed that PAT children scored significantly higher on standardized measures of reading and math achievement in first grade. A significantly higher proportion of PAT parents initiated contact with teachers and participated in the child's schooling In 1991, a Second Wave evaluation of the program's impact on 400 randomly selected families in Missouri showed that both children and parents continue to benefit from PAT. Children performed significantly higher than national norms on measures of intellectual and language abilities, despite the fact that the Second Wave sample was over-represented on all traditional characteristics of risk. Parent know ledge of child development and parenting practices significantly increased for all types of families. Awards and honors have come from the Ford Foundation and John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard Clnnovations in State and Local Government); the Council of State Governments and the Department of Education. PAT has been featured in national print and broadcast media as a program that has helped make a difference in education.

In all PAT programs, trained professionals make home visits to parents of young children. The visitors describe model parenting skills, provide developmental information so that parents can make informed choices, and introduce activities for growing children. Currently 1,045 PAT programs operate in 42 states and 3 foreign countries. In 1987 the National School District (NSD) in National City, California, decided to try PAT out of a conviction that when parents get involved in promoting their children's early development, they stay involved in the children's education. In addition, the NSD was concerned about the declining level of readiness of preschool and kindergarten students entering school for the flrst time. In the NSD program, parents of infants aged 2-1/2 years or younger can enroll in PAT and remain until the child is 3. All families are eligible, regardless of socioeconomic status, and participation is entirely voluntary. Since 78 percent of families in the NSD program are Hispanic and many speak only Spanish, services and materials are provided in Spanish or English. Each family receives one home visit a month until the child turns 3. During these visits, the visitor gives the parent specific strategies to address individual concerns, such as toilet training, discipline, and appropriate toys. Concerns are always followed up at the next home visit. In addition, children are screened periodically for vision, hearing, and nonnal growth and development, and are referred to health and other services when appropriate. An extended program for 3-to 5-year-olds is forthcoming. At PAT parent meetings, held at least three times a month, child care is provided and discussion among parents is encouraged. A special feature of the NSD program is a 6-week parenting class offered when children are close to school age. This class is for parents who have graduated from PAT in order to help bridge the gap between PAT and school. PAT is also adapted for teenage parents in the NSD program. While teenage parents are eligible to receive home visits, family circumstances often do not permit a typical home visit, and teenagers seem to prefer group meetings. For most teenage parents who are in school, participating in PAT means meeting weekly for 2 hours in a small group setting. Fathers are encouraged to come too, and all teenagers receive school credit for attending. During the first hour, each parent is given individualized information relating to her/his child; the second hour is a group lesson on a topic related to the needs of adolescents. The Stuart and Packard Foundations sponsored a comprehensive research study on the National City PAT program. Stanford Research Institute International implemented a 2-year evaluation plan to compare PAT 3-year-olds to a control group. The findings proved a consistent beneficial effect from participation in PAT on virtually all measures used in the evaluation.

The project team is headed by a sociologist with degrees in public health and social work. Team members include epidemiologists, health policy specialists, psychologists, physicians, and community-based organization staff from Durham, the University of North Carolina, Duke University and North Carolina Central University. The project is based on several complementary theoretical perspectives that target issues in adolescent development and the causes of deviance and nonconformity. The model assumes that the circumstances that promote problem behaviors range from the individual attributes of the adolescent to the family and social factors and to cultural beliefs about risky behaviors. The project team argues that when young people are moving from elementary school to middle schools is a good time to provide more positive approaches to risky behavior. The intervention addresses cognitive and problem-solving skills, as well as working with parental, peer, and social influences on adolescents' behaviors. Teachers and community leaders help students adopt appropriate behavior through activities such as participation in programs to help other young people.

Of course, the immediate goal of the program was to reduce the number of conflicts at the school; more lasting goals included increasing student self-esteem by empowering them with the ability to resolve their own conflicts in a way that would be satisfactory to them, teaching conflict resolution skills that the students could use outside of school, and sharing with students the responsibility for creating a positive school environment free of strife and violence. The program involved training students in peer mediation skills. Students who were selected for the training program had to be recognized leaders among their peers. In some cases, they were not necessarily teachers' favorite students. At the end of the training sessions, these students were given the responsibility of mediating conflicts between other students totally independent of faculty involvement. When conflicts broke out, students involved in the conflict were given the choice of going to mediation or going to the office. Students always chose mediation. Conflicts that could not be resolved were sent to the office, depending on the severity of the problem. In the second year of the program, nominal changes were made in the process of selecting student nominees and in the referral process, but the overall structure of the program remained basically the same. So far, more than 90 percent of the conflicts referred to student mediators were resolved.

The program is comprehensive, including elementary, secondary, and special education curricula; a student-led mediation program; a parent's program; and an administrators' component. For elementary and secondary students, the program uses teacher-led workshops that divide separate conflict resolution skills into units. For elementary school students, units include such skills as communication, affmnation, cooperation, and acknowledgment of feelings. In all the units, students participate in activities that reinforce that particular skill. For secondary students, the units cover much of the same material for the elementary students, but with an additional focus on ways of defusing violent situations that might lead to violent confrontation. Both the elementary and secondary school programs include a student mediation component. Student mediators work to resolve conflicts among their peers in actual conflicts that break out in the school, such as in the lunch room or on the playground. RCCP regards student mediation as a key componet of the program because it provides students with models for nonviolent conflict resolution and reinforces the students' emerging skills in working out their problems. To prepare teachers to lead the workshops, RCCP staff developers conduct training sessions. Teachers not only receive instruction in how to lead their workshops, but reexamine how they handle conflict in their own lives, particulary in how they deal with their students. A new teacher in the program is assigned to an RCCP staff developer who visits with the teacher, observes classes, and gives feedback to the teacher. As the teacher gains experience in the program, the staff developer eventually relinquishes full control to the teacher. ReCp also offers training for parents, believing that if students are to be able to use their emerging conflict resolution skills outside of the school, they must have family support. Evaluations reveal that enthusiasm for RCCP is high. Results show that students and teachers believe that RCCP has had a positive impact on their schools. RCCP students reported having fewer fights and engaging less frequently in name calling compared to those in a control group. Teachers also report a change in themselves, saying that they had an improved understanding of children's needs and concerns and were now more willing to let students take responsibility for solving their own conflicts.

S. Department of Health and Human Services This project teaches conflict resolution, anger management, and decisionmaking skills to teenagers. It provides upbeat activities once a week after school, and it sponsors family nights once per month. The youths, now ages 15 and 16, have been in the program since the seventh grade. They prefer to call the program \"Kids of Different Dream. \" After-school meetings provide speakers, cultural and athletic activities, and nutritious snacks. Dinner is served at the family night gatherings, followed by speakers discussing subjects such as cultural diversity, dealing with teenagers, how to find summer employment, and life in prison. School holiday outings are also provided. Tutoring and mentoring are offered as needed. The program's 1993-94 goals are (1) to encourage youth to be in their community through volunteer work and (2) to take the message of nonviolence to younger children through puppet shows. So far, the teenagers have served lunch in a homeless shelter, sorted food at a food bank, and provided lunch at a shelter for women and children. They have made puppets and are contributing ideas for the scripts. The puppet shows are designed for preschool and early elementary students, and they are intended to have the additional benefit of reinforcing concepts the teenagers have been learning since seventh grade. The project staff consists of a director, a social worker, and a social work intern from a local college. A licensed clinical social worker assists with family nights and after school programs and periodically works with individual participants. The social worker visits participants at school each week to learn of any academic or behavioral issues. The social worker also acts as an advocate for the student and encourage family involvement in the educational process.

It is descended from the Street Law clinic at Georgetown University Law Center which, in 1972, started sending law students into high schools, juvenile and adult correctional institutions, and community settings to teach practical law. Today 38 law schools offer such programs, most of them in urban settings. Street Law: A Course in Practical Law, the textbook for the high school version, is in its fourth edition, and other tested texts, manuals, films, and curriculums are available. A Teens, Crime, and the Community crime prevention and service learning program has expanded its outreach to Native American settings. The Washington, D.C., center trains teachers in two new curriculums-on conflict management and the jury system-and produces lessons on mediation and juries in a new court diversion program for first offenders. NICEL coordinates an LRE National Training and Dissemination Program funded by the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention and operating in 48 States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto ruco to reach more than 1,400,000 elementary and secondary students in 1992.

One set of interventions focuses on risk reduction in the classroom setting. The second set will enhance the classroom work by involving parents, the school community, and the neighborhood in a single integrated delivery system. These proposed multifaceted interventions will avoid the pitfalls of previous programs, such as programs that are \"too little, too scattered, and too infrequent\"; that are not developmentally appropriate; and that deal only with the individual, not with the setting. A comparison group will receive a health\u00ad enhancing curriculum focusing on behaviors such as nutrition and fitness but not addressing risk reduction for violence and sexually transmitted diseases. The project team will deliver interventions in the first year and will train teachers to deliver them to youth in subsequent years. The goal is to embed the interventions in the schools in an ongoing fashion. For further information contact: Dr. Brian Flay Prevention Research Center University of Illinois 850 W.

The project is the largest child mental health demonstration in the country. Over the past 4 years, the project has successfully demonstrated decreased use of inpatient hospitalization services and residential treatment center services through a comprehensive, organized system of mental health and substance abuse services. The focus of the project has been the reallocation of dollars to provide community-based services to care for children with emotional disturbance at home and in the community rather than in hospital settings. The Department of the Army funded this demonstration project in 1989 through a 61-month cost-reimbursement contract with the North Carolina Division of Mental Health, Developmental Disabilities, and Substance Abuse Services. The project strives to improve services to children by making available and linking together a wide range of community-based mental health and substance abuse treatment services into a comprehensive continuum of care. Through ongoing review of each child's treatment program, the positive features of managed care are used. Project goals are: (1) to demonstrate that, as an alternative to the traditional services covered by CHAMPUS, a full community-based continuum of mental health and substance abuse treatment services for children can be tailored to each client's needs and, thus, provide a more appropriate set of treatment services with equal or better outcomes; (2) to show that a full continuum of mental health and substance abuse services can be provided to more clients for less cost per client; and (3) to demonstrate the efficacy of a federal-state partnership to provide a locally managed continuum of mental health and substance abuse treatment services for military children. ------------- The rationale for continuum of care stems from the belief, long advocated by the mental health community, that with the development of alternative mid-range services, less restrictive and less expensive services can be available for children who would otherwise be hospitalized. It also reflects the belief that the length of a hospital stay can be shortened as well, that the step-down service helps clients receive more appropriate care, and that it can cost less. To date, this project provides the only example of implementing a comprehensive, fully integrated, community based program on such a large scale basis. With a single point of entry, a system for case monitoring and management and a single p;-,yer, the project furnishes an opportunity to test the implementation and maintenance of the approach under the \"best possible\" conditions. Clinical services are provided by Cardinal Mental Health Group, Inc., through the Rumbaugh Clinic which provides a full range of child mental health and substance abuse services except psychiatric inpatient services and hospital-based residential treatment. Many of the services offered are beyond standard CHAMPUS benefits, but are available because of the demonstration status of the project. It includes intake assessment; 24-hour crisis counseling and emergency services; case management; individual, group, and family outpatient services; day treatment; in-home crisis stabilization; foster care or therapeutic group home; larger group residential treatment; and partial and full psychiatric hospitalization. Services are individually planned for each child in the least restrictive setting possible. Families are encouraged to be part of the treatment team, and treatment may take place in the clinic, at home, at school, in therapeutic residential settings, or in hospitals and private services providers in the community. Services are modified, added, or discontinued according to the child's progress and continuing needs. Evidence is accumulating that children with serious emotional disturbances or substance abuse benefit from treatment while living at home rather than in an institution. The inadequate array of services for children with mental health or abuse problems has been compounded by increased availability of psychiatric hospital programs. Thus, children who need mid-range care are \"bumped up\" to inpatient facilities at tremendously increased costs. A CHAMPUS report in 1983 had inpatient psychiatric services for children averaging $25,563 per admission with a typical stay of 102 days (a yearly cost of $74 million), and by 1985 this cost had doubled to $156 million and by 1989 it had reached over $600 million. Cutting the length of time has been of dubious benefit in mental health care and has caused the new look at outpatient care. The number of clients in 1992 was approximately 46,000 of which most are dependents of active duty military and 13.2 are dependents of retired military or survivors of those who died in service. Of clients served 66.4 percent are Caucasian, 21.7 percent are African American, 5.4 percent are Hispanic, 0.3 percent are Native American, 0.2 percent are Asian, and the remaining six percent are other or unknown. Clients may be referred by traditional sources; however, the military hospital has been the largest referral source.

Operating in 11 counties in Arkansas, CDI provides child care services in 19 centers funded through Head Start, Department of Human Services Vouchers, the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA), State Department of Vocational Education, JOBS, and fees from high-income families. CDI is also funded as a Head Start Family Child Care Home 'demonstration project and operates two Parent-Child Centers. Sixty-five percent of the Head Start programs administered by CDI are full-day programs with the addition of a summer Head Start program in 1994. For teenage parents who need help in order to stay in school or to get their General Equivalency Diploma (GED), convenient child care and other support services are provided. Parents get help in promoting children's learning and well-being through CDI's parenting training and family literacy programs. Strong parenting components are the backbone of the Home Instruction Program for Preschool Youngsters (HIPPY), the Teen Parent Program, Head Start's home-based program, and Even Start, all under the CDI umbrella. Family literacy is supported in Even Start, Head Start, Arkansas Better Chance, and a home-based family literacy program funded by the Arkansas Department of Vocational Education. Most of the roughly 2,300 children served by CDI each year are from low-and moderate\u00ad income families. Participating teenage mothers are often from families of moderate income, and parents of children receiving child care are primarily factory workers. Based on family needs assessments, CDI staff often make referrals for needed services. CD! emphasizes utilization of broad-based linkages and community partnerships, which involve the public, private, and corporate sectors. The program is reviewed through Head Start to ensure it meets performance standards. CDI's persistence in raising the image of the child care profession in Arkansas is reflected through program excellence in management and operations, training, consulting, and staff participation. The evaluation of the family child care demonstration project began in 1993. CDI plans to keep expanding with larger, improved buildings,_ more infant and toddler care, and more child care for voucher children. The agency also plans to expand family literacy training and family support. For further information contact: JoAnn Williams Executive Director .

A child psychiatrist serves as a consultant and provides initial and followup assessments. The project is comparing the outcomes for children achieved through this approach with more traditional service delivery approaches. The project is also a catalyst for statewide reforms. Revisions in North Carolina's Medicaid program now permit services in a broad range of nonclinical as well as clinical settings. The Children's Initiative is now in its fourth year of implementation, and over 667 children and youth with severe emotional disturbance have been served. The North Carolina project is one of seven model programs, in the United States funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. The projects focus on creating system reform to provide collaborative, community-based services for children with severe emotional disturbance and their families. The model emphasizes interagency collaboration and provision of a continuum of services in the community, so that unnecessary and inappropriate hospitalizations can be avoided. The goal is to provide a system of care so that children can receive appropriate treatment in their home communities. The projects hope to demonstrate that treatment provided through such a system of care is beneficial both in terms of treatment outcomes and cost savings. In North Carolina, the objective of the program was to expand the existing system to address needs of the target population. Strategies were to expand case management and family preservation services; expand community residential programs, especially therapeutic foster homes; continue integration of diagnostic and treatment services for children and families within the mental health system, including mental health services, substance abuse, and developmental disabilities. Services to children in training schools, espedally those being treated for juvenile sexual offenses, were to continue. Principal accomplishments of the program was development of therapeutic foster homes and emergency respite services, which has helped decrease the need for hospitalizing children and youth. A group home was added in the Smoky Mountain area where two beds are designated for use by children or youth in the Children's Initiative project. The program is exploring ways to open additional treatment beds for short-term crisis stabilization. The North Carolina Mental Health Services Program for Youth (MHSPY) has been used as a planning base for other programs, and the effectiveness of the program was instrumental in obtaining a grant from the Kate B. Reynolds Health Care Trust to provide funds for 18 months of planning and startup activities for Carolina Alternatives. Two Carolina Alternatives staff positions will be added to the Child and Family Services Branch in the State office, and approximately $22 million will become available to the area program for the development and expansion of community-based services through the decreased use of inpatient treatment and out-of-community placement of children and youth with severe emotional disturbance. The Carolina Alternatives program mirrors the stated goals of the North Carolina MHSPY Program in: Increasing access to mental health and substance abuse services. Expanding services available and community-based services. Providing care in the least-restrictive setting possible. Increasing cooperation between public and private mental health and substance abuse providers and facilities. Providing case managers to coordinate care responsive to the needs of each child. Maintaining or improving the quality of care while stabilizing costs.

Program Type: Target Population: Project Startup Date: Annual Budget/Number of Persons Served Annually: Sources of Funding: Program Objectives/Description: Dropout prevention At-risk youth 1984 $6 million/86,OOO youth through networks Federal (OJJDP, others), private, corporate, foundations Cities In Schools, Inc. (CIS) is the nation's largest nonprofit dropout prevention program. Its mission is to develop public/private partnerships designed to connect appropriate human services with at-risk youth in addressing school attendance, literacy, job preparedness, teenage pregnancy, drug and alcohol abuse, self-esteem, teenage suicide, suppressed creativity, and school violence. The CIS approach accepts the concept that the dropout problem is tied to and perpetuated by the fragmentation of the health and human services intended for students and their families. Many exist but are not easy to find for those who need them. Troubled students seeking the help they need on health care, alcohol and drugs, AIDS, and career counseling must find it among the bewildering variety of disconnected agencies that exist in most communities. Communities often expect young people to locate the resources they need by themselves and then to penetrate an often faceless, intimidating bureaucracy in the hope of connecting with counselors or mentors who see them as individuals not as a collection of \"problems.\" The task becomes so overwhelming that giving up and dropping out is often the choice. Cities in Schools does not ask that public schools resolve the many problems of at-risk youth, but does believe other community sectors must be involved. It also maintains that it is the responsibility of the community to bring helping resources to its children, not the children's responsibility to \"figure out\" where the community has hidden them. By bringing this help inside the schoolhouse, through the repositioning of service providers into the schools to work alongside teachers, a team is created to help keep children in school. The cities are now in the school. CIS has found that when a teacher, a health worker, and a career counselor work together as a team with the same group of at-risk students each day, they are able to achieve positive changes in the students' behavior, academic perfonnance, and attitudes that is impossible when services are delivered in isolation, uncoordinated, and found only outside the educational setting. l __ A critical strength of the CIS model is its cost effectiveness. Relatively little new funding is required to start CIS in a new community. A typical CIS program that costs between $150,000 and $200,000 per year can leverage as much as $1 million worth of repositioned human service personnel and other in-kind assistance, including volunteers, office space, and computer capabilities. The salaries of the professionals working on CIS projects continue to be paid by their home agency. One study has concluded that for every dollar that CIS programs spend, a minimum of $5 is leveraged into the program. More importantly, the strength of CIS efforts is the dramatic differences the program makes in the lives of young people. CIS does turn ldds around, even those for whom many had despaired. Program literature documents many dramatic turnarounds, such as the story of a young Los Angeles gang member and ninth-grade dropout who was fully occupied in dealing drugs, stealing cars, robbing, and terrorizing until he saw prison or death as the only outcome for him. Through CIS he returned to school and found that the supportive family\u00ad like atmosphere gave him the encouragement he needed to eventually graduate and earn a scholarship to a southern college. Not only individuals benefit from CIS, but the entire community. A central CIS tenet is that every young person does want to give back, to be useful, and to be appreciated by others. Across the country the CIS network now comprises 93 local CIS programs that serve 183 communities in 27 states. An additional 32 programs are soon to be inaugurated. Operational CIS programs reach over 86,000 students at 612 educational sites. Public support for CIS, in addition to the many gene.rous private grants it receives, is highlighted by a lO-year \"Partnership Plan\" with the federal government. It involves the Department of Justice as the lead agency and has included the Departments of Labor, Commerce, and Health and Human Services, and the Army. The Department of Housing and Urban Development is the lead agency in the Community Development Program, whose major goals include supporting development of local programs and expansion of existing state and local programs. An agreement with VISTA will place 129 VISTA volunteers in state and local CIS programs for a yearlong term of service. In February, CIS and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention launched a 5-year cooperative agreement to develop a model for local CIS Teen Health Corps and to replicate it throughout the network. CIS students will take the lead within their locales to help curb violence, spread awareness of sexually transmitted diseases and AIDS prevention measures, substance abuse, and poor nutrition. On April 15, 1994, CIS will have completed Partnership Plan Phase Five that emphasized supplying \"agency-specific deliverables\" from its federal partners to local and :,:tate CIS programs. These included student-run entrepreneurial activities, Weed and Seed projects that bring community services into a \"safe haven\" such as a school, and joining with the Regional Alcohol and Drug Awareness Resource (RADAR) network to work as a national dropout prevention center. l~--=-----________ ~ _______________ _ For further infonnation contact: Peter Bankson, Director of Government Relations Cities In Schools, Inc. 401 Wythe Street, Suite 200 Alexandria, VA 22314-1963 (703) 519-8999 (703) 519-7213 (fax) Recommendations for Social Build bridges between agencies; redefine agencies' and institutions' missions to promote collaboration ------------------------------------------------------------~\".---Governor's Cabinet on Children and Families (State of West Virginia) Program Type: Target Population: Project Startup Date: Annual Budget/Number of Persons Served Annually: Sources of Funding: Program Objectives/Description: Family services program At-risk families and children June 1991 $1.9 million total since August 1990 Grants/ seed money, private organizations In August 1990, the state of West Virginia put together a sweeping education reform package that created the Governor's Cabinet on Children and Families. 1he primary focus of the program is to give local communities the authority and resources to develop their own family-focused service delivery system. This radical new service delivery model removes some of the most intransigent bureaucratic roadblocks to increasing system efficiency and 'cst-effectiveness. With a lean, flexible organization, the West Virginia Cabinet is moving from a categorical, fragmented system to one that responds collaboratively across agencies and clearly shifts the locus and authority for service delivery from the state to regions and localities. Under the Governor's Cabinet on Children and Families, the system has begun to focus on the family as the unit of intervention and to provide consistent support for families in order to prevent problems or resolve them before irreversible damage occurs. Finally, this system assures accountability through evaluations based on system goals and family outcomes. The; new system is remarkabl.y simple in structure. Local representatives from a community (consisting of at least one full county) develop a service delivery plan that reflects the needs of the community. If the plan meets program prescriptions-the community involves providers from the fields of health, mental health, human services, and educat~on; agrees to a single governance entity with a minority of service providers; and represents the philosophy discussed above-then the Cabinet can waive state rules and regulations and transfer the appropriate state funds in order to give the community complete control over the newly created family resource network. The only state role thereafter is to provide technical assistance and evaluations. There is no service delivery blueprint for communities to follow. Each community, as long as it meets minimum requirements, may provide the services that are needed in the specific\u00b7 area. Some examples of services include a prenatal home visitor program, adult literacy and transportation, and construction of a comprehensive health clinic (the only one in the county) inside a new middle-high school. To assist communities, cabinet staff provide training programs as well as technical assistance in early childhood education, program finance, and other relevant areas; however, the local community has authority over their own operations. The Cabinet will evaluate each individual community program. Results are not yet available from any of these evaluations. Results of a large-scale study of the status of children and families in West Virginia conducted by Price-Waterhouse will be used to shape priorities for Cabinet programs. Eventually, the Cabinet intends to establish community programs in all counties.

The project is headed by a sociologist, who is associate professor of social work and depUty director of the Social Research Development Group at the University of Washington. Team members include sociologists, psychologists, social workers, physicians, nurses, epidemiologists, and participants from a wide range of community groups including, but not limited to Seattle's Minority Health Task Force. The neighborhood advisory groups will also be trained to present companion workshops to parents and caregivers, thus providing local experts or natural helpers to the community. Such community involvement promotes community ownership and therefore, participation in the interventions, enhancing the probabilities of successful behavioral change in the target audience of African-American, Asian, Native American, and Pacific Island young people. Delivery sites for the youth-targeted programs may be schools, public park recreation centers, or other community agencies, depending on the advisory councils' suggestions and the willingness of such groups to actually participate. Initial responses have been uniformly positive. For further infonnation contact: Dr. Richard Catalano School of Social Work University of Washington 146 N.

Without support services and assistance in getting control over their lives, the families are likely to return to the streets. Yet, providing services to those who still lack pennanent housing has been found ineffective in maintaining changes in lifestyles and behaviors. A strategy that has proven effective in the Oakland Homeless Families Program (OHFP) is linking pennanent housing with support services. OHFP is one of nine pilot projects initiated by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and HUD in 1990. While homeless families usually are able only to scramble from one stIelter to another, OHFP provides a stable housing arrangement coupled with supportive services and case management to take stock of their situation and make future plans. With the availability of Section 8 Certificates to guarantee payment of rent, OHFP has successfully recruited landlords receptive to renting to homeless families, many of whom have difficulty communicating or mling out rental applications and may have a poor credit rating or none at all. The OHFP Housing Coordinator (an employee of the local housing authority) assists families in the housing search and is available for tenantllandlord dispute mediation, move-in assistance referral, advocacy, and general housing assistance. OHFP has developed a collaborative network with public and private agencies providing services needed by homeless families. Key to OHFP success is the consistent, long-tenn relationship that develops as case managers work with family members in setting realistic goals and helping them access services needed to achieve these goals. At the outset of the program, before families were placed in stable housing, a homeless family's needs were addressed through multiservice centers providing a broad range of support services including substance abuse recovery, adult education, health care (primary, prenatal, and pediatric), employment training, child care, and transportation. With the transition to stable housing in distinct geographical clusters throughout Oakland, the method of providing support services has shifted toward the new communities in which the families are living. Through a combination of a mobile specialist team, neighborhood services development, and the newly funded Healthy Start family life resource centers, support services will be provided closer to the families' newly established homes.

The Partners Project utiliz-fts a Managed Care Model of service delivery and authorization in which each child/family is assigned a Project Managed Care Coordinator who work with families and agencies to develop an individualized family service plan. The Managed Care Model requires coordination, preauthorization authority, and individualized services. To be eligible for services, a child must meet the following criteria: be involved with a least two partner agencies, be a county resident, have a psychiatric diagnosis of DSM m-R, experience limitations in life activities because of these difficulties, and be likely to require increasing levels of care. Services may include: evaluation, crisis treatment services, day treatment, respite care, intensive family-based treatment services, therapeutic foster care, psychophannacology, outpatient treatment, after school daily structure and support, transportation, individualized mental health services through agencies serving the child and community support services.

It was decided to develop both an urban and a ruralprogram; WCCP, the urban program, began operating in 1989 in an elementary school in a high-risk neighborhood in North St. Louis. WCCP seeks to ensure that all children succeed in school, remain out of the juvenile justice system, and do not require any other placements outside the home. One of WCCP's primary intervention programs is Families First, in which families at risk of having their children removed from home participate in 20 hours a week of home-school therapy for 6 to 10 weeks. For high-risk families not having as many problems as the Families First clients, a case manager serves as a strong link between -the school and the home and monitors the needs of the child and family, which may include after-school tutoring, parenting education, and referral to services outside of WCCP. A Parents as Teachers program, not funded by WCCP, collaborates to strengthen parenting skills for families with preschoolers. All children receive school health services, including screenings for height, weight, vision, and levels of cholesterol and lead. Other services include Latchkey, a before-and after\u00ad school child care program, and a Drug Free Recreation program provided on Friday nights for elementary, middle, and high school students. An evaluation conducted by Philliber Research Associates in New York indicated that intensive services have a positive impact on children's academic achievement, school ~----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- behavior, and study habits. The Caring Communities Program is hoping to expand into four more elementary schools and two middle schools in the area.

Headed by an educational psychologist, the program incorporates existing curricula and progra/'ls respected by the tribes with new resources to strengthen the cultural framework within which the young people live. The team works in the schools and in the health clinics that serve the population. A \"Peacemakers' Program,\" a \"Trails\" program, and a series of programs that involve respected tribal elders are components of the interventions. One goal of the interventions is to increase adolescents' commitment to and belief in their educational and career options as an important way of preventing health-damaging behavior. The interventions will target alcohol abuse and suicide, which are prevalent among Native American youth, as well as other types of violence, sexually transmitted diseases, and unintended pregnancy. Because the target audiences are spread out over a wide geographic area, innovative video and computer programs are used to enhance and ext~nd the reach of the interventions.

With the exception of the boxing component, all activities are carried out with youth sports funding; boxing continues as matching funds are available. The Cultural Enrichment component introduces students to art media and teaches a variety of techniques. It operates at two public housing sites and at the Boys and Girls Club for approximately 30 hours per week. It features oils, watercolors, textiles, silkscreen, handpainting, and mural painting. Ceramics are also featured and photographic techniques are being introduced. There are approximately 98 participants per month and students have submitted work to national contests. Members completed a mural at a local McDonald's restaurant in 1993. Basketball participants number about 24 per month at each of 3 locations. The groups are divided into 12-and 13-year-olds and 14-to 16-year-olds. Members have gone to New York City for a tournament and to Utica to watch a game. The Track program has instructed participants in physical conditioning, mental preparation, rules and regulations for various types of track events-relays, running, hurdles, etc. Approximately 50 members participated in the Colgate Women's Games preliminaries in 1993 where several athletes qualified for finals at Madison Square Garden. At the MAC Youth Fest held at Fordham University, the track club had 5 medalists and placed fifth against 12 college and open teams at the Union Open in Schenectady. Members also traveled to the Greater Boston Invitational at Harvard. Training clinics are held in conjunction with track activities that include sportsmanship discussions. Intramural sports are broken into a variety of seasonal sports. Of greatest interest to youth to date are \"double-dutch\" rope jumping and softball. Kickball and soccer are 1-gaining in popularity, and indoor volleyball is highly popular in bad weather. About 90 youth per month participate in one or another of the intramural sports. Boxing began in 1993 with 18 participants, and the number has grown. Members train with heavy and light bags, learn sparring techniques, equipment upkeep, and physical conditioning; they participate in several tournaments per year. Several members participated in the Golden Gloves match in April from which winners went on to the Empire State Games. Cornell Cooperative Extension Services of Albany County administers the Fishing and Environmental Education component which began in August 1992. Lack of safe ice for ice fishing in 1993 provided time for participant training in equipment upkeep and cooking techniques. The Department of Environmental conservation donated 30 fishing rods and reels, and parents were enlisted to help raise funds for the program. The environmental aspect of the component takes participants to mountain areas and teaches environmental testing techniques. The IS-Love Tennis component conducts tennis clinics for residents and nonresidents of public housing in several locations. Around 77 public housing youth participate in IS-Love Tennis activities each month out of the total membership of around 250. Off\u00ad court topics include setting and achieving goals, manners, attitudes, peer counseling, perseverance, staying in school, decisionmaking, mental toughness, and health and nutrition. Tennis staff also work with the Public Housing Drug Elimination grant activities and the Eastern Tennis Association. With the addition of a bubble court, activities continue through winter months.

Concerned about the lack of structured activities for young people, the authority took responsibility for providing young residents with a comprehensive academic, cultural, and sports enhancement program to promote social development during their fonnative years. AFAS sponsors two basketball teams, two cheerleader squads, a soccer team, and a girls' softball team. Camps are held for each of these activities to teach the fundamentals of the sport and the concept of sportsmamhip on and off the playing field. Participants in AFAS sports must maintain a C average in school or attend the AFAS study.hall daily. School perfonnance records are checked regularly to ensure that this requirement is met. The AFAS high-tech study hall and tutorial program provides students with a quiet, supervised place to complete their homework assignments or to seek help with a particular subject. Students also spend time individually with a mental health therapist who detennines the emotional needs of each child and works with parents to strengthen the family. During the summer the tutorial program continues through a 9-weekday camp. Field trips broaden students' social development, and instruction in Taekwondo, an ancient fonn of martial arts, fosters self-discipline and self-control-traits that will help young people make appropriate choices for their future. A supplemental feeding program ensures that youngsters receive a nutritionally balanced meal during summer break. ~--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- For further information contact: Gline Price Grants Special Programs Coordinator Alternatives For All Seasons Auburn Housing Authority 931 Booker Street Auburn, AL 36830 (205) 821-2262 (205) 821-2264 (fax) Recommendations for Social Services/Public Housing/Health: Support for New and Existing Programs Strategy: Increase the availability of recreational and leisure activities for youth Comprehensive Youth Sporls Program (Miami, Florida) Program Type: Target Population: f.;-oject Startup Date: Annual Budget/Number of Persons Served Annually: Sources of Funding: Program Objectives/Description: Recreational and athletic program Youth, ages 5-15 from public housing September 1992 $125,000/400-500 youth Federal grants and matching funds The Youth Sports Program, operated by Dade County Housing and Urban Development, targets at-risk youth ages 5 to 17 in housing developments selected for the severity of their drug problems. The goal of the program is to offer these youth the opportunity to participate in organized, structured, supervised sports programs that provide a productive alternative to drug use and related illegal activities. The program is designed to involve and leverage community resources in order to maximize its impact on these problems. The program has four components: youth sports league, cultural enrichment program, participant contract, and community service. The first component, youth sports league, offers competitive team sports such as softball, tennis, martial arts, and volleyball. Mid-season and end-of-season tournaments are conducted, and a banquet/awards dinner is held to recognize individuals and teams, as well as businesses, agencies, and organizations that support the program. The cultural enrichment program provides opportunities for active participation by residents of all ages in music, drama, arts and crafts, and public speaking. The program is a vehicle allowing resident talents, skills, and achievements to be showcased to the larger community through tournaments, art shows, and performances by the drama groups. In addition, the cultural enrichment program allows for resident input and participation through the opportunities offered in teaching and various aspects of activities such as team management and coaching, stage hand, and set design. The third component of the Youth Sports Program, participant contract, requires that all participants abide by a set of rules. These rules include being drug free, staying iri school, attending school regularly, and volunteering time and talents to the community. The community service component requires all participants to volunteer a certain number of hours per month to a community cause, such as community cleanup and beautification campaigns, crime patrol, and tutoring. ------ ---------For further information contact: Hobbit Forrest Community Resource Specialist Dade County Housing and Urban Development 1401 Northwest Seventh Street Miami, FL 33125 (305) 644-5293 (305) 649-3776 (fax) Recommendations for Social Services/Public Housing/Health: Support for New and Existing Programs Strategy: Support community violence prevention intervention and demonstration projects Domestic Abuse Intervention Project (Duluth, Minnesota) Program Type: Target Population Project Startup Date: Annual Budget/Number of Persons Served Annually: Sources of Funding: Program Objectives/Descriptions: Domestic abuse intervention Abusive men 1981 750-800 individuals in Duluth alone State, city, foundations The Domestic Abuse Intervention Program (DIAP) originated and still functions in Duluth but its influence has spread far beyond the North Woods and the Iron Range. The National Training Project, an offshoot of DIAP, has provided over 600 trainings and seminars in the United States and five other countries. The nine agencies that came together in 1981 to adopt what has come to be known as \"the Duluth model\" focused on combining legal sanctions, rehabilitation programs and, when necessary, incarceration to end violence in the home. When a clear aggressor is present in a domestic confrontation, Minnesota law makes his arrest mandatory. This fact, and any subsequent conviction, are used to compel compliance with an educational or combined education-and-counseling program. The program is adaptable to the enforcement of protection orders by the court; the training can incorporate ethnic considerations (such as African American, Native American, or Latino) or other special cultural considerations (such as service in the Vietnam conflict or questions of sexual orientation) .

The primary goal of the project is to develop specific strategies to address the severe isolation of these youth and to establish a well-organized network to expand their educational, recreational, and cultural activities. Several neighborhood-based youth clubs and organizations have worked collaboratively with Project Kid Power to develop the program, with these groups agreeing to provide certain activities for young participants. Another strategy of Project Kid Power to address the isolation of youth in public housing is to provide fees for memberships to organizations such as the YMCA.

Local, state, and federal government agencies work with each other and with local residents of drug-ravaged inner\u00ad city areas to help them take back their communities. Community policing is the bridge that connects the two parts of the program. Pennanently assigned to their beats, community police officers know the residents they serve and are part of the neighborhoods they patrol. In addition to their law enforcement functions, community police officers are also problem solvers. Officers take residents' complaints about housing and other municipal services and file them with the appropriate city agency. The Trenton Weed and Seed Program operates four Safe Haven schools that provide after\u00ad school and summer activities for children and adults. These community meeting centers are specially insulated from the fear of violence or intimidation by drug dealers. The four Safe Haven sites offer children positive alternative activities such as academic tutoring, swimming, dance and theater, arts and crafts, music lessons, karate, gymnastics, aerobics, rollerskating, basketball, and ping pong. The program offers adults educational workshops in financial management, tax preparation, parenting skills, and stress management. Designed for the long tenn, Trenton's Weed and Seed program is also identifying job opportunities for community members. Career nights and other fonns of job counseling are being planned. Each Safe Haven school is managed by a full-time site coordinator who is responsible for planning programs. The coordinator is assisted by two recreational aides and community volunteers. Advisory boards for each Safe Haven are composed of parents, civic association representatives, and leaders from the religious and business communities who assist in program development and in assessing community needs. During the school year, a high\u00ad school-age youth advisory board meets weekly to discuss Safe Haven programs and activities. Before each Safe Haven opened its doors, it invited area residents to make suggestions at community forums. Safe Haven programs have been tailored to many of those requests. Thousands of flyers, posted and hand-delivered, alerted residents to the opening dates of the Safe Havens. A breakfast for community leaders was also held to introduce the program and solicit support for it. The after-school Safe Haven program starts with a study/homework period during which tutoring is offered and the school library is available. After the homework period, students take part in varied activities. Not all sites offer all programs, but after-school Safe Haven youngsters are enjoying swimming, arts and crafts, music lessons, dance and theater, computer literacy, drill team, karate, cosmetology, gymnastics, roller skating, aerobics, and Boys and Girls Clubs. The Safe Haven youngsters eat snacks that are provided by the U.S. Department of Agriculture ant' Trenton's Department of Health and Human Services. In addition to federal and state funding, Safe Havens are supported, in part, by funds provided by the Success For Life Foundation; the Brother Officers Law Enforcement Society; the Mercer County Prosecutor; City at Peace; and the New Jersey Health Department's Division of Alcohol, Substance Abuse and Addictive Services.

The project assigns victim witness coordinators to various units throughout the office. These coordinators deliver services as needed for each unit or for the particular client population they serve. Specific programs and units within the Trial Division served by coordinators include: The witness security program, where coordinators provide direct services to victims or witnesses of crimes who have been intimidated or may be intimidated as a result of their testimony. The Special Assault Unit and Court School Program, where coordinators handle child abuse cases. The Juvenile Court Victim Services Unit, where coordinators provide direct services to crime victims in juvenile court, such as case status information; transportation; assistance with handling situations of threats, intimidation, and harassment; and employer and creditor intervention. The Southeast Asian Project, where coordinators provide direct services to crime victims in the Vietnamese and Cambodian communities. The Victim Witness Unit also prepares and distributes a brochure that explains the criminal justice process and the available services. In addition, it operates the City Hall Victim Witness Waiting Room for use by crime victims and witnesses who are subpoenaed to appear in court. The waiting room consists of a large waiting\u00b7 area, a small conference room, and a children's playroom. The Victim Witness Waiting Room provides a safe, comfortable environment in which crime victims and witnesses can wait before being called to testify.

The Housing Authority Youth have continued to meet each Wednesday to plan activities for housing development youth. For the past 2 years, Club members have attended P.R.I.D.E. conferences where they gained knowledge of drug prevention and intervention tactics and crime prevention to bring back to their peers in the developments. The Club's basketball team won 18 out of its 20 games last year, and many members are involved in a recent, well-received new martial arts program. Receipt of a drug elimination grant allowed the housing authority to hire two community center clerks who have helped move program activities along, including the \"Friday Night Movies\" which they coordinate with the help of development parents. \"Drug-Free Lock-Ins,\" a recent addition to the program, are supported by the Club, community agencies, and housing authority staff. A group of development youth go to the local YMCA to spend the night, and while there, discuss drugs, teenage crime, and teenage pregnancy. Videos are shown and participants organize skits. The clerks and a coordinator are also expanding the sports function of the program with the purchase of new equipment for volleyball, table tennis, tennis, and racquetball as well as baseball, basketball, and football. Efforts are under way with city agencies to establish counseling services and a cultural component for the program called \"Rights [sic] of Passage\" for both boys and girls. During Black History Month, a Chicago-based ballet troupe performed for the Club at the YMCA. The performance was not only culturally aware but included an anti-drug message. A Summer Food Service Program sponsored by the State Board of Education feeds children daily and serves as an activity venue where area agencies come to sites between the meal services to provide informational activities, from AIDS Awareness to Self Defense for Women and Girls. During the summer, camping and fishing trips take place, as well as Operation Beautification, in which youth clean up development areas each day and at summer's end are taken to the Great America theme park. Youth talent contests and after-school tutoring and other programs also take place with the assistance of the youth themselves and their parents.

Because people have difficulty getting to services, WCFSP takes many critical services to people in their homes. The program also makes referrals and offers group activities-another strategy for reducing the isolation many families experience. WCFSP's commitment to each family is relatively long-tenn-up to 5 years. Building relationships and fonning collaborations are key to WCFSP's success. The relationship between the home visitor and the family is built through weekly home visits, focusing on such areas as child development activities, early education services, parenting education, preventive health care, nutrition, safety, housing, and income support. The home visitor also provides referrals to other community agencies, including making sure the family can get to the service, accompanying the client if necessary, and following up with the family and service provider. The home visitors also frequently join forces with a local agency to provide more comprehensive assistance. For example, the health educator and health department representative may team up to visit a home, work with a support group, or plan a workshop. Beyond helping to draw together community resources, WCFSP has created a few programs on its own to fill gaps in the community. The program helped to establish a child care program for teenage parents who want to complete high school. Located at a high school, the program gives teenage parents access to quality, affordable child care, as well as parenting classes. To encourage the participation of fathers in parenting responsibilities, the coordinator of the men's program builds relationships with fathers through outdoor activities and works with them on issues such as employment. Finally, WCFSP is the only program in the county that provides child development and parenting education in the home. The CCDP evaluation procedure currently has three components: an impact/outcome evaluation, an extensive process evaluation, and an ethnographic study. Preliminary data will soon be available and will be used to refine program implementation.

It provides low-income youth with a positive alternative to drugs and an incentive to perform well in school. Based on the precept that drug abuse is the primary source of crime, poverty, and family deterioration, all of which are rampant in the public housing community, YSCP seeks to offset the attraction of crime and drugs by providing a range of recreational, educational, and cultural activities within a highly structured setting. YSCP sponsors sports instruction; classes in drama, arts and crafts, and computers; AIDS education; and tutorial programs. By promoting a sense of belonging, YSCP inculcates self-esteem, self-confidence, and self-discipline-concepts and attitudes that will prepare young people to resist the temptation to experiment with illegal substances. Youth learn to communicate their feelings and to foresee the consequences of behavior. They are respected for who they are, not where they live, and are recognized for goodness, worthiness, and potential. Managed by a fonner football player with the Detroit Lions, the program attracts other professional athletes who grew up in Tampa public housing. Such adult role models are especially important to the community's 3,500 young residents, the vast majority of whom are growing up in single\u00ad parent households. The program receives significant inkind contributions from other local organizations, including the Hillsborough County School Board, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Tampa YMCA, University of South Florida, and Urban League of Tampa.

The program currently serves 12 counties in Washington state. Referrals come from workers who have the authority to remove children from their homes. Caseworkers indicate upon referral that, without the program's intervention, immediate out-of-home placement is the most likely course of action for one or more children in the family. HOMEBUILDERS intervenes directly and immediately at the clients' convenience in areas beyond the scope of many intervention programs. It is designed for high-crisis situations and for families at immediate risk of dissolution. Participating families are referred by public agency workers who have authority to place children and youth in foster, residential, or institutional care. Its practitioners/therapists are master's level or higher social workers or are psychologists trained in intervention and socialleaming. They work to help improve parenting skills, help clients work with anger and manage depression, and help them achieve environmental improvements such as clean surroundings, food, and clothing. The program is expensive-$2,600 per family for 4 to. 8 weeks of services-but is preferable to highly costly outplacement. Therapists are able to handle only about 18 to 20 families per year and are on call 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, when engaged in an intervention. Twelve months after entering the program, 88 percent of the children originally targeted for out-of-home placement remain out of state-funded foster, group, or institutional care. In a Utah comparison group without the service, only 14.8 percent of the children remained at home. In post-service surveys of primary caretakers, survey takers found improvement in 26 out of 28 critical items. Aversive relations for both fathers and mothers were also found to be significantly reduced. Between 1987 and 1991, Behavioral Sciences Institute also carried out a demonstration project in The Bronx, which has been expanded throughout New York City through the Child Welfare Administration.

Observing other parents at the hospital, he realized that all were dealing with the stigma of being the parent of a child with special needs who were also probably suffering work problems caused by frequent absences related to their childrens' disorders. He asked the hospital staff for a room where parents could get together, and the immediately successful family support network began. Within a short time, the network became involved with advocacy and with the help of the Virginia Department of Mental Health, Mental Retardation, and Substance Abuse Services PACCT's first grant got the program started and an office was opened. As more parents were contacted, the network grew statewide and parents appeared at state budget hearings and participated in committees and advocacy boards. The PACCT network is designed to provide support, infonnation, and education to families of children who are emotionally disturbed and to advocate for services that are community\u00ad based and family-centered. PACCT operates on the belief that long-tenn, out-of-home care should be considered only when all other community services and supports have been exhausted. There is no discrimination on the basis of parental status; birth, foster, or adoptive parents all are eligible. The program's mission statement is \"Parents and Children Coping Together is founded on the belief that children and adolescents who have serious emotional disabilities or serious behavioral problems and their families can help each other through mutual support. We strive to provide support and infonnation to families with respect for cultural diversity and individual needs. We will establish places in the communities where parents can go for support without stigma. We believe that by educating and empowering families, our full society benefits.\" PAceT maintains affiliations with other child advocacy groups and promotes state and local collaborative efforts. It keeps members infonned through a newsletter of legislative and other issues and supports a resource library. It helps support the groups in existence and works to develop new PACCT groups. It has an 800 telephone number to allow parents and others throughout the state of Virginia to contact the program as a parent of a disturbed child or as an individual volunteering to work with the parents and children.

The Center for Family Life in Sunset Park began operation in 1978 when waves of immigrants moved into the area from Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, Mexico, Central and South America, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East. The families faced cultural, economic, and language barriers that prevente;d them from accessing the services they needed so that their children could succeed in school. In such a diverse neighborhood, people badly needed a sense of community that bridged their differences. In Sunset Park the nucleus of this sense of community was the Center for Family Life, which is open to any family with at least one child under 18. The program's centerpiece is intensive individual, family, and group counseling conducted in a nurturing, supportive atmosphere either in the clients' homes or at the center. Family counselors are trained social workers who help clients with personal problems or conflicts to improve their life situation and relieve stress. Counseling is augmented by a number of other family supports, such as a program for parents of infants and toddlers and a foster grandparent program that models parenting skills. After-school centers at two Sunset Park elementary schools and one junior high school are open 3 hours a day, 5 days a week. They become full-time day camps during the summer months. These centers provide a variety of enriching activities such as music, drama, and art. At 6:00 p.m. the after-school program becomes a teen center, offering additional services such as tutoring and peer discussion groups until 10:00 p.m. Many other services are provided at the Family Center and the nearby storefront. Job placement is a high priority for adults and for youth in the summer. The storefront center provides emergency services, such as crisis intervention, food, clothing, and shelter. The Family Center, in association with family counseling, provides parent workshops to foster community relationships and parenting training. Any services not provided by the Family Center at any of its sites are obtained through networking with the Hum:m Services Cabinet of Sunset Park. The Family Center's networking, which extends to the police, churches, and elected officials, displays the strong commitment to families in a community context. By strengthening the community through better coordination of services and improved communication, the Center strengthens families and their children. Such a broad, communitywide intervention is especially difficult to evaluate; however, a recent report by the Surdna Foundation and the Foundation for Child Development indicates that the Center is well respected and supported in the community and has played a pivotal role in increasing the social cohesion of Sunset Park. As funds become available, the Sunset Park program will expand the school-based child care component to meet the growing needs of the community.

HART's approach to the drug problem includes education, early intervention, enforcement, housing, after-school activities, and treatment. Fifteen buildings of subsidized hou.sing are targeted for rehabilitation in one neighborhood. Other elements in its drug strategy include drug-free school zones, parent groups, youth and adult employment training, rehabilitation centers for abusers whether adolescent or adult, communitywide rallies, closing of drug-infested houses, identification of \"hot spots,\" and home ownership initiatives. In a law-enforcement partnership with HART, City Hall and the Statehouse accepted responsibility for reducing drug sales and youth gangs. With local-State-Federal collaboration, a dozen major gang leaders were arrested and incarcerated and dozens of drughouses shut down. A campaign called \"Organized Parents Make a Difference\" raised more than $250,000 from private sources during the group's first year and created activities for 4,000 young people. Later the group successfully lobbied the Governor's office for more than $1 million to expand youth alternatives in Hartford and other Connecticut cities, and HART successfully pushed for a State law allowing local law enforcement to seize cars used by would-be customers to solicit prostitution.

This multiethnic and economically diverse community of 85,000 residents has at least 18 major gangs operating on its streets. LSNA takes a culturally sensitive approach to drug-related issues, with activities focused on developing a prevention program that includes a strong education component appropriate to youth and adult residents; and working to build a coalition representative of the community. Strategies include safe school zones, rallies, drug prevention curriculum in schools, after\u00ad school programs for youth, and block clubs. LSNA has found that a key strategy is to involve as many people and groups (schools, churches, social service agencies, law enforcement, and youth organizations) as possible, getting them together to begin discussion of the initiative. Of crucial importance to the coalition are the police. Signs of LSNA's success are the following: well-attended community meetings and rallies on drugs and crime; increased police action, visibility, and responsiveness; instaHation of school-based programs on drug abuse education and treatment; an after-school arts/culture/community project for youth in cooperation with local organizations; creation of a prevention project in cooperation with local professionals and organizations; the ouster of a street gang from a former stronghold area for drug traffic; and various other anti-drug, community-building activities.

First, health promotion efforts targeted toward inner city neighborhoods often have been unsuccessful because they failed to address the special needs and circumstances of residents, which may not mesh with those of the service providers. Second, a sense of community can be built by empowering residents to take control of their lives and surroundings, working on issues of primary importance to them. Third, a community, once empowered, is better able to address other issues, including health issues. This project in three housing developments in Huntsville Alabama addresses the problems of youth violence and the hannful consequences of adolescent sexual activity by working with communities in the three-step process outlined above. The target audience is young people aged 10 to 18 in the housing projects, but their community empowennent model will work with parents and community leaders as well. The project team consists of a political scientist, counselors, physicians, and staff from community organizations, including a food bank and a county health department.

The population is predominatly African American (95 percent); the remainder white. The average household income is roughly $25,000, and 29 percent of the population receives public assistance. UMDC takes a broad-based approach to solving community problems exacerbated by the drug issue. Their activities have centered on fonning a coalition of local ministers to collaborate on finding an answer to the drug problem, working to impvove community safety, and reaching out to all neighborhood residents, including senior citizens. Major strategies employed have been establishing drug-free school zones; staging rallies, marches, and vigils; and developing alternative activities for young people~ including after\u00ad school programs. Drug houses have been closed through a combination of new laws and enforcement of building codes. Conference on drug prevention have been held. Signs that the program is working have included cessation of visible drug activity along a corridor where drugs had been sold openly. Local legislation enabled posting of drug-free school zone signs, and there has been increased resident involvement in meetings with public safety officials. Potential funders of drug prevention programs have been found among local funders and participation has grown in planning a pilot project that will introduce community-oriented policing. . Working with the organization have been local religious leaders; law enforcement and public safety officials; YMCA and other youth organizations; members of the city council, the State Attorney General's office, and the mayor's office. The program is governed by a board of community residents . ~~ -~-------For Further Infonnation Contact: Paul Herdeg Union Miles Corporation 9119 Miles Avenue Cleveland, OR 44127 (216) 341-0757 (216) 341-0226 (fax) ------------------------------~--~~-'--~~====~ Recommendations for Community Groups: Help Neighborhoods Help Themselves Strategy: Create an umbrella organization for volunteerism Volunteer Services of Clark County Superior Coult No.1 Probation Deparlment Program Type: Target Population: Project Startup Annual Budget/Number of Persons Served Annually: Sources of Funding: Program Objectives/Description: Mediation (low-risk offenders) Youth ages 16-17 September 1983 $38,000 serves at least 300 youth County, state Upon becoming Judge of Clark Superior Court No.1 of Clark County, Indiana, in 1983, Clementine B. Barthold had a dream of providing programs for young people who needed help from the court and from the Probation Department. Volunteer court programs began in 1983 and grew rapidly, becoming the Volunteer Services Department in 1985. Its purpose is to provide diversionary programs for adolescents who are involved with the court of the Probation Department. Like elsewhere in the country, Clark County is increasingly using probation more and incarceration less. During the probation period, youth programs structure the lives of the young people into constructive channels through a number of programs. Volunteers keep records and write reports for all young people in their charge. The Systematic Training for Effective Parenting (STEP) program began in 1992 to help the parents or guardians of young people involved with probation or the court in developing or improving parenting skills. While the child is the identified problem, parenting affects the entire family. In 1983, the STEP Family Focus Program began to include the children in the learning process in which therapists work with the family members. Parents are taught to recognize problems in beginning stages and how to resolve them before they become destructive to the family. They learn how to meet the needs of their children while keeping sight of their own needs. The juveniles learn how to be \"effectively parented. 11 They get an understanding of the parental perspective and how their choices and actions as children play a big role in family structure. Responsibility, accountability, and communication are the foundations of this component. Volunteer tutors help build youths' self-esteem and confidence while helping them strengthen skills in math, reading, and spelling. The tutor also teaches basic library skills and advises on how to improve study habits. The tutor meets with the young person for 1 to 2 hours a week at the local library for the duration of the young person's probation. When the court decides, performing community service for local agencies and organizations becomes part of the young person's probation. The volunteer worksite supervisor may be involved, or supervisors may be provided by the work program. There are also Saturday work programs for young people who remain in school, but who must perfonn community service as part of the disposition of their case. Home detention officers telephone young people who are on home detention as part of their probation as decided by the court. The officer makes random telephone calls to assure that the youth is at home and is complying with the home detention order. The volunteer keeps a detailed log of calls, which becomes part of the youth's file. The identity of the home detention officer is not revealed to the offender or his or her family. Camp Kite (Kids-in-Touch Event) is a well-structured camp for young girls ages 12 to 17 who have been referred to the program by their probation officer. The camp was developed in 1983 to offer campers the opportunity to get away from immediate problems and to participate in a program where they are cared for and nurtured and where their self-esteem is given a boost. Girls are taught problem-solving skills to help them throughout life and learn how to set and achieve goals. The camp is a week long. The Juvenile One-On-One program seeks to establish a positive one-to one role model relationship between an adult volunteer probation officer and a young person placed on probation or infonnal adjustment by their probation officer. The volunteer meets once a week with the young person and informally supervises him or her acting as an extension of the Probation Department. School liaison volunteers are assigned to middle and high schools for an academic year and serves as student counselors to those in danger of being expelled for truancy. The school liaison monitors the grades, attendance, and behavior of students on probation to the court. The volunteer is in constant communication with school administrators, school counselors, and the Probation Department. The Volunteer Neighborhood Complaint Hearing Officer is a paraprofessional position that requires experience in mediation, dispute resolution, and group counseling. The volunteers mediate complaints filed by community members against young people, but that do not require the immediate attention of a probation officer. A minimum of two hearing officers conduct informal hearings with all involved parties. They do not attempt to solve the problem but encourage communication and guide, direct, and mediate participants into reaching an amicable solution on their own. For further information contact: P.

Grassroots and nonprofit, CCI helps community residents-particularly low-income residents-work together to resolve their community problems. CCl's agenda is that agenda developed by those who live in the neighborhood. Particularly in low-income neighborhoods, residents feel powerless, isolated, and doubtful of their skills. Bringing people together to achieve common goals, CCI has been encouraging positive social, economic, and environmental change. CCI works by making residents aware of alternatives and provides information through research and contact with other grassroots organizations around the country. It helps develop leadership abilities in neighborhoods, and helps build bridges from one community to another as well as from the neighborhoods to the agencies, businesses, and others who can help improve conditions. In 1987, there were 384 drug-related complaints and 93 arrests. By 1993, complaints numbered over 3,800, and 491 arrests were made. The city has developed a community\u00ad based drug prevention program that relies on forming a local drug task force composed of neighborhood residents, law enforcement officials, and drug treatment and education agencies. It provides a forum for neighborhood groups to discuss problems and seek potential solutions to drug-related areas. It also promotes neighborhood revitalization in lower income areas and develops resources that will assist in continuing drug prevention efforts. The major strategies of the program are drug-free school zones, \"National Night Out\" activities for youth and adults to empower them to reclaim their neighborhoods from crime ---- ~-~----- - ~ and drugs, anti-graffiti laws, concentrated housing code enforcement, and a vehicle activity report data base. The vehicle reporting facet was introduced when it was noted that the same license plate data was reported in different neighborhoods with heavy drug activity. A focus of the anti-drug program is active organization of neighborhood groups. Successes have included the closing of drug houses and an agreement with the Public Housing Authority to terminate leases of tenants involved in drug trafficking and alcohol bootlegging. The program has received a grant from the Iowa Department of Public Health to address substance abuse in neighborhoods, and severa] local lending institutions have committed to promote neighborhood revitalization. Working with the neighborhoods are law enforcement officials, religious institutions, city departments, the Coalition Against Substance Abuse and the National Council on Alcoholism, the Public Housing Authority, and local chapters of service clubs and community centers. CCI helps communities undertake other projects that involve neighborhood appearance, deteriorating housing stock, and lack of housing investment. Residents in low-and moderate-income neighborhoods logged some 14,577 complaints about their neighborhood's appearance with the zoning department. Deteriorated housing fosters more crime. Statistics have demonstrated that when home ownership dips below 40 percent within a census tract, crime rises significantly. At the same time, while the average home in Model Cities was approximately $29,000, few who can afford the price of a home can access financing. eCl has been addressing these problems by endeavoring to provide immediate relief-most notably from crime and drugs. A significant step was changing push-button phones to rotary dials so drug dealers could not access their beepers and by copying numbers of dealers and users. Housing activities are related and now moving near the top of neighborhood agendas. In March 1994, CCl organized a meeting with U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno to allow neighborhood residents to tell her of the creative strategies they had developed to improve their neighborhoods.

Local control was a central organizing principle of the Washington Department of Community Development's (DCD's) 1985 plan for the first ECEAP sites authorized by the State Legislature. Dcn also understood that interactive components are necessary to succeed in preparing children for kindergarten and elementary school. Thus, all ECEAP sites, like the Head Start program with which they work, have four essential components:' education, health, parent involvement, and social services. The 36 providers of the services throughout the state comprise school districts, local governments, nonprofit organizations, child care providers, community colleges, and Native American tribal organizations. In the education component, local ECEAP providers have latitude to design a curriculum appropriate for the community. At a minimum, each curriculum is designed to promote intellectual development, language skills, motor skills, social-emotional and self-concept development, and age-appropriate knowledge of health, nutrition, and personal safety. Local programs may also emphasize ethnic and cultural diversity, second-language development, and related topics. For health services, ECEAP children are screened within their first 90 days of enrollment when dental, mental health, and nutritional needs are determined. When problems are discovered, children are referred to an appropriate community agency. Local communities are encouraged to tailor the health component to their particular circumstances. For instance, in areas with unfluoridated drinking water, local ECEAP sites provide fluoride treatments. ECEAP recognizes that parental involvement is the primary source of educational development for children from birth throughout their school years. Therefore, direct involvement of parents is required at all sites. Parents are encouraged to join the program's parent-run policy council to solve local problems. ECEAP's family service staff conducts a needs assessment for each family enrolled in the program to guide them in referring families to appropriate community social service agencies and in planning parenting education and awareness training. Local sites that implement the ECEAP model may use either a center-based or a home-based model. The center-based program, used by 75 percent of the local sites, requires an early childhood program that operates at least 10 hours a day over at least 3 days; requires a minimum of 90 minutes of parent contact time each month; and conducts at least two home visits a year. The home-based program requires a weekly 90-minute home visit and weekly peer group experiences for children. The locally designed models typically draw elements from the two standard models and occasionally have originated entirely new practices. Local control and influence also inspired state administrators to work closely with local contractors in restructuring funding and service delivery to operate on principles of collaboration rather than competition. Rather than competing for state funding and service delivery, local contractors work with community agencies to meet the range of needs in all communities and eliminate duplication of services. This structure has helped fill the gaps in families' service needs and has also proven to be cost-effective. Since 1988, Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory has been conducting a longitudinal comparison of program participants and a control group. Preliminary results indicate that children's language skills, concept skills, and receptive vocabulary skills improved dramatically. The largest gains were realized by children with parents who participated actively in ECEAP. Children also improved in maturity, motivation, and achievement. Health problems were quickly identified. Intellectual and physical development surpassed that of children in the control group. Children who participate in ECEAP in elementary school surpass the development of a comparison group in many areas, including language, reading, and math. Higher percentages of ECEAP children were referred to gifted and talented programs. For further information contact: Mary Frost, Unit Manager ECEAP 906 Columbia Street SW., P.O.

Recommendations for Advocacy: Intervention Strategies: Identify children at their first point of vulnerability and act early to intervene AVANCE Family Supp011 and Education Program (San Antonio, Texas) Program Type: Target Population: Project Startup Date: Annual Budget/Number of Persons Served Annually: Sources of Funding: Program Objectives/Description: Parenting skills, family management Children and parents 1975 $3.5 million/4,000 children and 1,500 parents Federal, state, local, foundation The main purpose of A V ANCE is to strengthen and support hard-to-reach, low-income families. Through an intervention program that focuses on Hispanic families, A VANCE offers comprehensive, community-based, preventive services to parents and children. AV ANCE operates in several Texas cities and in Puerto Rico. Parent-child education forms the core of the AV ANCE model. In a 9-month parent education program serving families and their children age 3 and younger, parents learn about child development and discipline, community awareness and services, nutrition, and toymaking-an activity that encourages loving interaction and developmental learning between parent and child. Monthly home visits are made to each participant. Evaluation of this program shows affirmative results, including mothers who are more nurturing and positive with their children and more likely to continue their own education. Fatherhood services offer parenting and family strengthening activities to low-income minority males, helping fathers to grow personally, educationally, and economically and thus helping to preserve the family unit. Additional options for education include EvenStart, a demonstration model of a family-centered program focusing on family literacy and parenting education based in neighborhood elementary schools. Simultaneously involving parents and children, it enables parents to gain knowledge of and participate in the early learning of their children and to further their own education through A V ANCE Adult Literacy Programs. A V ANCE graduates are provided appropriate opportunities for becoming employed outside the home or self-employed, an initiative that is contracted through collaboration with existing job training and placement services. Comprehensive intervention and nontraditional counsrling services are provided in the home in cases of child abuse and neglect, with the purpose of working with parents to prevent reoccurrence of infractions. Families are identified and referred through the state/county Child Welfare Agency. The Comprehensive Child Development Program, also a national demonstration project, provides a foundation of child development skills to families with children or a pregnant mother.

All Birth '1'0 Three programs assume that parents want the best for their children; there is no perfect way to parent; and that parents want infOImation, tools, and support as their child's first and perhaps most important teachers and role models. Therefore, the program's goal is to introduce a parent education/peer support program for parents as early as possible in family life that will positively affect parenting and support healthy development of children. A parent who becomes a member of a Birth To Three group receives support materials including a newsletter containing information on concerns of young parents, on community activities available for children and parents, and book reviews; a community \"wannline\" that provides a peer counselor service for referrals, crisis intervention and listening; and admission to educational events. A local newspaper carries a weekly Birth To Three column written by staff and professionals. Translated into Spanish, some are reprinted monthly in the statewide El Hispanic newspaper. Information on Birth To Three is disseminate<l through obstetricians, hospitals and birthing centers, pediatricians, teachers and school counselors, social workers, and others. The programs are voluntary and most families remain for about a year within one or another of the five Birth To Three programs, each of which addresses needs of differing groups or responds to individua1 situations. They are: Infant/Toddler: This program supports groups made up of single parents, parents of multiples, working parents, and parents whose children have special needs. A parent educator facilitates a five-month, lO-session curriculum that covers birth experience, stress/anger management, early childhood development, adult relationships, health and safety, parenting strategies, play and learning, and child care issues. Groups are encouraged to continue to meet after completing the initial five-month curriculum. New facilitators are drawn from group volunteers who attend a training workshop, have bimonthly training sessions, and work with Birth To Three staff members who provide supervision, training, mediation, and support. The second year brings membership in the IO-week Toddler Series which include discipline as teaching, communication, relationship issues, seeing the world through a toddler'S eyes, and participation in age-appropriate play for the children while parents attend class. Teenaged Parents: Begun in 1983 in response to the needs of adolescent parents, this program brings services to pregnant and parenting adolescents from 12 to 21 years of age. It is a weekly education/support group program facilitated by a staff parent educator. The program also includes services that include home visits, referral to community resources and help in meeting basic needs, crisis intervention, and working with other agencies. Peer group discussions focus on personal growth and development, parenting, and such topics as legal aid and welfare. A Teen Parent Panel service takes teenaged parents and their children to talk with middle and high school students about the realities of teenage pregnancy and parenting. Make Parenting a Pleasure: Developed in 1983 in collaboration with the YMCA, the program comprises a lO-week parenting class followed by a lO-week peer support group and is designed for low-income parents living under high levels of stress. A parent educator teaches the 12-week class series, and a trained mentor facilitates the peer support group, which in tum becomes a parent-led Birth To Three group. Participants learn about controlling anger and stress, communication, and normal child development issues. Participation in followon 12-week support groups is encouraged. We're a Family: This program was established for pregnant and parenting women jll recovery from substance abuse' and is conducted in collaboration with Sacred Heart Hospital's NEW START program. It combines the hospital's existing services with the Birth To Three support group settings and services. It has been desjgnated as a state demonstration model program. ill Immediate Response Drop In: This group was created in 1991 to respond to needs of the increasing numbers of families on waiting lists for all other Birth To Three programs. It is funded by the Eugene Kiwanis Club and meets weekly at Birth To Three offices to provide a group setting for basic parenting education. l For further information contact!

(Chicago, Rlinois) Program Type: Target Population: Project Startup Date: Annual Budget/Number of Persons Served Annually: Sources of Funding: Program Objectives/Description: Family support Parents and children 1976 $2.9 million/4,OOO families State and federal agencies; private foundations; individual contributions Family Focus is a private nonprofit organization that provides leadership in promoting optimal development of children, especially during the years from birth to three, by supporting and strengthening families. The program is based on the belief that boosting parents' sense of confidence and competence will increase their capacity to raise physically and emotionally healthy children. The comprehensive, community-based program emphasizes prevention rather than remediation. Working in satellite centers located throughout the Chicago metropolitan area, staff are sensitive to the diverse cultural values in each of the six communities in which they serve. Core services include developmentally appropriate activities for children; support and discussion groups, classes, and workshops for parents; \"come as you are\" drop-in times, home visits, and play groups; and special events for the whole family. Family Focus centers teach parents about the emotional, intellectual, and physical development of their children and discuss ways to improve parent-child interaction. A structured after-school and summer program for at-risk youth in grades 4 through 12 seeks to prevent too-early sexual activity, pregnancy, gang involvement, delinquent behavior, and school dropouts. An alternative school for pregnant teenagers, job training, and a well-baby clinic are also offered. In addition to direct services, an important part of Family Focus's program is linking families with the community, and helping the community become more responsive to the needs of families. Advocacy and linkage to community resources not only increase the participants' access to needed services, but also provides Family Focus with opportunities to infonn other agencies about the critical importance of supporting and strengthening families. Because Family Focus believes that community agencies and others concerned with human services and community bettennent work best when working together, the program collaborates with a wide range of organizations, churches, and other interested groups. Staff share their expertise with other child care providers through private consultations, conferences, workshops, and other training initiatives across the country.

A statewide network of perinatal health care services includes outreach to enroll unserved pregnant women in prenatal care and provides community-based health education and counseling for pregnant women and mothers of infants. Healthy Start, another key component of Hawaii's Early Intervention System, was developed in response to an alarming increase in confirmed child abuse and neglect cases from the mid- 1970's to the mid-1980's. The program begins by screening farnilies at the time of birth for factors associated with child abuse or neglect, such as poverty, single-parent status, substance abuse, inadequate housing, and inability to cope with parenting problems. Once a family is identified as needing support, paraprofessional staff may begin visiting regularly in the home. These visits are more frequent and for a longer period than in most other programs. The support includes weekly visits for about a year, then monthly visits, and, finally, four visits a year until the child is 5. Staff work with families to obtain adequate food, clothing, and shelter and to teach young parents about infant care and development. Most important, the home visitors become friends, advocates and partners with families to improve their lives. Participating in parenting classes and support groups bolsters parents' morale and helps them learn effective parenting skills. Case management services ensure that the multiple needs of each family are met. In addition to Healthy Start and the perinatal services program, Hawaii's Early Intervention System includes: Baby SAFE (Substance Abuse Free Environment): Outreach and treatment services are available on each island targeting the problems of substance-using pregnant and post-partum women and their infants. Physician Involvement Project: A physician awareness-building and training effort that seeks to ensure every child a medical home that provides continuity of accessible, affordable, and comprehensive primary medical care. Lead Poisoning Prevention Program: A new program providing community outreach, screening, and appropriate management for lead-poisoned children. Zero to Three: A program that provides for developmental services to children who are at risk environmentally, biologically, or developmentally and uses a tracking system to enhance care coordination.

Parents are brought into the service as early as the last trimester of pregnancy. It generally addresses the five subject areas of child development, child guidance, health, family management and parent development. MELD programs include MELD for New Parents (first-time parents); MELD for Young Moms (MYM) for teen mothers of children ages birth to two; MELD for Young Dads to help them participate in their child's life; La Familia MELD for Hispanic parents with children age birth to three; MELD for Hearing Impaired Parents (also for very young children); MELD Special for parents with handicapped or chronically ill children ages birth to three; MELD Nueva Familia for very low-income Mexican and Mexican-American parents who have low reading vocabularies and whose family is at high risk of dysfunction; and MELD for Hmong Parents to serve Hmong parents in cultural transition in the Twin Cities. MELD for Growing Families is an extension of the MYM program for single mothers of children three to five. MELD began delivering services in 1973 with a grant from the Lilly Endowment in a self\u00ad help group pilot fonnat. It was designed to begin during the last trimester of pregnancy before dysfunction could manifest itself. It has grown to include programs for teens as well as adults and has been replicated in more than 100 agencies in the United States and Canada alone, and in Gennany and Australia. MELD meetings are held in churches, neighborhood centers, and homes. Infonnal discussion ~~--~- ------------------- ------ -----is combined with cuniculum models and materials called \"Parent Parts,\" each of which is concerned with a particular topic. In addition to providing psychological support, MELD focuses on child development, child guidance, health, parent development, and family management. Parent participants may be self-referred or may have been referred by professionals, home visitors, or others in the community in contact with the program. Professionals intending to implement the program within a community must have a good deal of experience in community development, child development, parent training, and volunteer management. Group leaders are also drawn from a team of volunteer parent facilitators who represent two families. Volunteer facilitators are carefully selected, trained, and supported by professionals. Their experiences parallel those of the families with whom they work in therapy. For example, MYM meetings are led by women who were once teen mothers but who have achieved a degree of self-sufficiency and have raised healthy, happy children. Training for facilitators consists of 16 hours of basic orientation training, 12 hours of in-service training, and frequent telephone interaction with MELD professionals. MELD materials are provided for group participants, the facilitator, the professional MELD site coordinator, the agency incorporating the program into its services and any cosponsor that might be hosting a group at its locations. There are public relations materials. Curriculum manuals help facilitators organize and prepare for a parent group meeting in as little time as 20 minutes. A MELD program curriculum is sold to agencies or individuals who agree to receive the entire training contract to replicate the program. When a contract is signed, materials sufficient to start four eight-parent groups are provided. Evaluation materials are also provided for groups in process. Preliminary findings from the Child Welfare League of America indicate that 80 percent of MELD's tf?,en participants continue in high school, have a lower repeat pregnancy rate, have improved health, and gain knowledge of family planning. It has been helpful to include men as leaders to make it easier to encourage fathers to participate.

Programs include Parents Too Soon (PTS), focusing on reducing the risk of teenage pregnancy; Head Start, focusing on early childhood education and school readiness; Toward Teen Health, bringing comprehensive health care services to teenagers in Chicago secondary schools; and the Center for Successful Child Development (CSCD), a comprehensive early childhood development and family support program for residents of Chicago's Robert Taylor Homes public housing development. PTS served approximately 4,000 teen parents in 36 communities in 1993. Programs offer pregnant and parenting teenagers home visits, health education, peer support groups, and assistance in finding child care, so that they can finish school or receive job training. Programs also focus on adolescents and pre-adolescents considered at risk for pregnancy. Primary prevention programs promote life skills, staying in school, avoiding risky behaviors, and planning for the future. The Ounce also sponsors eight Head Start programs. At some sites, the Ounce has been able to provide full-day \"wrap-around\" programming for children whose parents work, are in school, or receive job training. A new family learning program is being tested at two centers. Toward Teen Health includes a primary prevention program for fifth to eighth graders in seven Chicago elementary schools and in adolescent health centers in three high schools. The high school health centers offer students comprehensive health care and education. Students must have parental permission. CSCD, otherwise known as the Beethoven Project, provides a wide range of health, child care, and family support services to young mothers and their children in the Robert Taylor Homes public housing development. CSCD focuses on the child's social, emotional, physical, and cognitive development from the prenatal period through the first year of a child's life. The Ounce of Prevention Fund evaluates its programs. The Ounce recently conducted a retrospective analysis of the CSCD to assess the gains of mothers and children who have been in the program for 1 to 4 years. For the Parents Too Soon program, a participant tracking system shows gains for participants during the program year. According to a recent evaluation of the Ounce's Head Start program, parental participation increased the amount of time parents spent reading to their children. Evaluation results are used to refine existing programs, design and implement innovative program strategies, and advocate for public policies responsive to the needs of children and families.

PSP's underlying philosophy is that preventing mental, physical, and emotional stress on parents and children is the most humane and cost-effective way to build strong families today and healthy, productive citizens tomorrow. One of the best ways to ensure the health and well\u00ad being of children is to ensure the health and well-being of their parents. Social support networks are a crucial element in the happiness, healthiness, and productivity of people. The goals of the program are to diminish parents' feelings of isolation, improve parenting skills, and increase parents' feelings of importance and sense of control over their lives. As parents gain confidence, competence, and self-esteem, their relationship with their children improves, and stronger, more mentally healthy families result. Researchers predict that such programs can prevent child abuse and break the cycle of violence. Services provided by PSP include parent respite, sick-child care, stress-reduction and mental health workshops, community service referrals, counseling, training in parenting skills, peer support groups, family outings and social gatherings, and leadership training. Participants live in urban, suburban, and rural environments and represent a wide variety of ethnic backgrounds. PSP's program has been replicated at more than 175 day care centers throughout California, Delaware, Florida, and Georgia. PSP offers training workshops, private consultations, and follow up sessions to other interested centers. j For further information contact: Ethel Seidennan Director Parent Services Project, Inc. 199 Porteous Avenue Fairfax, CA 94930 (415) 454-1811 (415) 454-1752 (fax) .------------------------ ----------------- Recommendations for Advocacy: Intervention Strategies: Identify children at their first point of vulnerability and act early to intervene Parenting Center at Children's Hospital (New Orleans, Louisiana) Program Type: Target PopUlation: Project Startup Date: Annual Budget/Number of Persons Served Annually: Sources of Funding: Program Objectives/Description: Education and support to parents around nonnal development issues and concerns; resource and referral center Parents of children from birth through adolescence 1980 $180, 000/4, 000 parents, students, and professionals Children's Hospital; local foundations; membership fees The Parenting Center at Children's Hospital is a multifaceted community resource that provides education and support to parents of children from birth through adolescence.

Recommendations for Advocacy: Intervention Strategy: Identify children at their first point of vulnerability and act early to intervene SMART Moves (sponsored by Boys and Girls Clubs of America) Program Type: Target Population: Project Startup Date: Annual Budget/Number of Persons Served Annually: Sources of Funding: Program Objectives/Description: Works with children at early ages to deter them from alcohol abuse, drug abuse, and teen pregnancy At-risk youth, 6-15 years old, who are not yet involved in drug use, alcohol use, or sexual activity 1988 N/A Private foundations and corporations SMART Moves is a program designed to protect Boys and Girls Club members from the three major threats in their lives: drug use, alcohol use, and sexual activity. It draws a line between its philosophy and other drug-and sex-deterrence programs: SMART Moves will not teach \"responsible\" drug use or encourage use of contraceptives. It teaches total abstinence from drugs and sexual activity as the healthy way to keep young developing bodies on a normal growth course. SMART Moves is a fully drawn program, complete with detailed lesson plans, for teaching the dangers of indulgence to three young age groups and to adults as well. Most Boys and Girls Club members grow up in communities with few positive role models. Drugs, drinking, and sexual activity are seen as rites of passage to adulthood. The program's goal is to teach youth what's wrong with indulgence, and then to teach them how to say \"no\" to these activities through a variety of thought-provoking, and sometimes amusing, group activities. For example, Start Smart, the program for ages 10 to 12, is a course of 10 I-hour sessions of discussion, games, role-playing, and songs devoted to teaching skills to resist peer group and media pressures. The adolescents learn what to expect from puberty and the consequences of various behaviors. The classes and teaching techniques include: A session on the \"gateway\" drugs, cigarettes, alcohol, and marijuana. Facts on the biological impact of the substances are taught. The youth discuss good and bad drugs. They learn to understand what dependence on a drug means. Prevention baseball. Youth score points for their teams by answering questions about drugs that qualify as singles, doubles, triples, or home runs, in increasing magnitude of difficulty. Rap sessions. Youth recite rap lyrics and write lyrics to describe how they feel about drugs. They also compose anti-drug rap songs. A session on puberty, teaching similarities and differences between boys and girls. Adolescents are guided through discussions of this phase of development, learn what is normal, and what emotional challenges they might face. A session on friendship and positive and negative influences friends might have. Youth discuss what might be right and wrong activities to ask of a friend, and how to say \"no\" to risky behavior. A session on how to say \"no\" assertively to risky behavior. A session in which youth write commercials discouraging drug use and sexual activity. A session devoted to the influence of radio, television, music, and movies. Youth learn to analyze the intent of the ads and how to counteract these influences. SMART Moves has similar courses geared to 6-to 9-year-olds and 13-to 15-year-olds. In addition, there is a course for parents to teach what phases and challenges their children experience, such as identity crises and the desire for youth to be independent of their parents. The parents' course aims to show how they can playa role in keeping their children away from drugs, alcohol, and premature sexual activity. For further information contact: Gale V.

Initiative to develop and coordinate resources for serving children to ensure quality early childhood Young children 1988 United Way of Minneapolis, the Honeywell Corporation, and community groups Success By 6 seeks to promote healthy development of all children by mobilizing community awareness, resources, and cooperation in the five-county metropolitan Minneapolis area. In 1987, Minneapolis area community, business, and government leaders were involved in local and national groups who were seeking to overcome intractable problems such as juvenile delinquency, teenage pregnancy, and increased school dropout rates. In their work, professionals were hearing the same message-what happens to children between conception and age 6 is critical to success in life, yet thousands of children were not getting the early development support needed. Based on this conclusion, the United Way of Minneapolis Area in 1988 created Success By 6, an initiative to develop and coordinate resources for serving children facing obstacles to school success and their families. Success By 6 does not provide direct services; rather, it is an umbrella organization that coordinates the efforts of business, government, labor, education, health, and human service providers to address three objectives: First, it seeks to build community awareness about the needs of young children. Second, Success By 6 works to improve access to social services for all families with young children. Third, it expands collaboration between the public and private sectors to develop an integrated system of services. During its first 2 years of operation, the program conducted a public awareness campaign to address urgent needs of today's children and has successfully lobbied along with other organizations for a comprehensive state legislative agenda on children that resulted in an increase of over $35 million being allocated for expenditure on children and child care. Success By 6 efforts have also resulted in improved prenatal care, a school for pregnant teens, and a growing public education campaign directed to parents and providers of child care. Other products include 10 culturally diverse child development tools for parents with low reading skills that were developed and distributed to more than 30,000 families by I children's service organizations, and the \"Readmobile,\" which brings library materials to family child care homes. Way to Grow, an outreach and services integration model, was developed under the auspices of Success By 6 in order to bring the principles of the program to individual communities. Jointly operated by Success By 6 and the Minneapolis Youth Coordinating Board, Way to Grow has been replicated in five Minnesota communities. In addition, the United Way of the Minneapolis Area has made this model available through the United Way of America, offering technical assistance to communities wishing to adopt the Success By 6 concept. Currently, nearly 80 communities, mostly led by United Way chapters, arc developing, implementing, or exploring early childhood initiatives modeled on Success By 6.

It has been a forerunner in the movement to create alternative services separate from the courts and criminal justice system. Bridge was founded by a group of educators and health care professionals to assist the growing number of youth living on the streets of Boston. Since 1970, Bridge has reached and served thousands of troubled young people and helped them to avoid long-term homelessness and to overcome substance abuse, emotional issues, and lack of skills which have been barriers to independence. Bridge's Street Outreach Program visits areas where street youth gather each day, intervenes in the lives of runaways and homeless youth, and offers alternatives to street life and substance abuse. The program's runaway services attempt to reconcile families of runaways by facilitating stronger family relationships or arranging stable alternative living situations when family reunification is not an option. The family life center promotes successful parenting skills to pregnant and parenting teenagers, offers counseling to parents on educational, employment, and child care needs, and helps mothers to earn their GED by providing child care. The residential component provides homeless youth and single parents with affordable; supportive housing, counseling, stress and time management skills, support for completing a high school education, and experience in daily housekeeping as well as working at a paying job. Additional services include a free medical van, a medical/dental program, an education/ preemployment program, an AIDS program, and a program on coping with violence.

At Lafayette Courts, an 816-unit highrise development in Baltimore, about 85 percent of the families are on welfare, almost half of the adults did not complete high school, and 90 percent of the households have only one parent. However, Lafayette Courts is not a place of despair and hopelessness; it is the site of an unusual program called the Family Development Center that is helping families bring about changes in their own lives. Among the specialized programs offered through the Center are child care for infants, preschoolers, and school-aged children; programs for teenagers who have dropped out of school or are at risk of doing so; and programs for those who are doing well in school. Job training, educational remediation, counseling, and support services are provided for adults who need to overcome the barriers to self-sufficiency. The Center was opened in 1987 when city officials recognized that service networks were poorly coordinated and inaccessible to families in public housing. Officials decided to try providing on-site services in one housing project-Lafayette Courts. Most Center services are located either within the project (in space created from converting several units) or in a school directly across the street. Since city agencies outstation staff for most of the programs, the Center can offer a wide array of services on a relatively small budget. The availability of onsite child care has brought many of the project's single parents into the Center. Case managers at Lafayette Courts work with families to develop short-term and long-range goals and help connect families with the wide range of available services and resources inside and outside the Family Development Center. Having developed relationships with other agencies through networking, case managers coach clients on how to interact with a public agency, and they contact agencies to alert them to a client's arrival.

Similar to the establishment of the original CASA founded in 1977 by a Seattle judge, CASA of Baltimore was founded by Juvenile Court Judge David B. Mitchell. In February 1992, CASA of Baltimore joined forces with Advocates for Children and Youth, Incorporated, a statewide public policy organization dedicated to improving the quality of life for all of Mary land's children . CASA's mission is to provide comprehensive advocacy to abused and neglected children involved in the social service, court, medical, and school system. CASA accomplished its comprehensive advocacy goal by recruiting, training, and supervising community volunteers who advocate on behalf of abused and neglected children to individually enhance their service delivery, and to ultimately facilitate systematic changes. Its goal is to recommend services that are in the child's best interests. Appointed by a judge, a volunteer advocate consistently interacts with the victimized child, parents, relatives and caretakers, attorney, social worker, therapist, physician, teachers, and other relevant parties to assure that a coordinated permanency plan is achieved and needed services are provided. Six years after its founding, CASA of Baltimore is locally and nationally recognized as a community-based, volunteer-driven child advocacy program that works. It uses the philosophical premise of the African proverb, \"It takes a whole village to raise one child.\" CASA of Baltimore has trained more than 350 community volunteers who have advocated for over 500 abused and neglected children, one child at a time. CASA's diverse volunteer pool is representative of the children served and Baltimore's geographic and cultural compositions. Fifty-two percent of the volunteers are persons of color. Approximately 85 percent of children CASA serves have been removed from their homes by the court system to protect them from further abuse or neglect. A volunteer advocate is court appointed to persistently work with one case for 12 to 18 months to assure that comprehensive permanency services are provided. The volunteers testify at court hearings; attend educational assessments, health team reviews, and social service meetings; and submit written court reports outlining their case activities and recommendations. CASA volunteers' holistic advocacy services extend beyond traditional mentoring; CAS A services impact children at home, in school, and in their community. In 1993, CAS A of Baltimore formally established a partnership with the Child In Need of Assistance (CINA) Mediation Project to assist children and families in resoling pre-petition conflicts. CAS A volunteers and CINA mediation volunteers work together with families, social services, the court, counselors, and attorneys to help resolve any conflict disagreements or communication problems prior to the actual court hearing. During this mediation process, CASA volunteers encourage those involved to make decisions that result in the child's best interest. Also in partnership with the Baltimore City State's Attorney Office Child Advocacy Network, the program co-administers a one-of-a-kind monthly Court School Program to help child victims involved in criminal court proceedings. The program's criminal court component specially trains CASA volunteers to work with child victims and witnesses scheduled to testify in criminal court. CASA of Baltimore's criminal court advocacy efforts are designed to educate child victims and their families about the criminal court process and provide one-on-one support to the child throughout and after the criminal court proceedings. Regardless of the criminal court verdict, all child victims who testify in court receive a certificate of bravery. CASA's board of advisers meets quarterly and assists in developing program guidelines, budgets, and funding. The program staff consists of a full-time director responsible for program development, overall supervision of volunteer and staff management, and interactions with the public. A full-time assistant director helps with recruiting, screening, and supervising volunteers, volunteer supervisors, and interns and monitors volunteers and program relations. A full time case supervisor organizes support groups and supervises volunteers. A part-time contract case supervisor supervises volunteers, and a full-time office manager coordinates staff meetings, handles clerical correspondence, maintains office records, and is responsible for volunteer management for over 200 volunteers. CASA of Baltimore contracts with a training consultant to conduct orientation of volunteers. All volunteers are carefully screened through an extensive background clearance system. The screening process is designed to prevent children from being reabused and to maintain the program's integrity. In addition, volunteers complete a 4-week orientation training and attend in-service seminars and quarterly support groups. Caseload supervision ratio is 30 to 35 cases per case supervisor.

Recommendations for Legislative Action: Juvenile System Reform Strategy: Enact and enforce state and local ordinances to prevent graffiti, loitering, and gang activity The San Antonio, Texas Curfew Program Program Type: Target Population: Project Startup Date: Annual Budget/Number of Persons Served Annually: Sources of Funding: Program Objectives/Description: Interagency juvenile curfew enforcement Youth, ages 10-16 August 1991 N/A N/A During August 1991, the San Antonio City Council adopted a youth curfew ordinance to regulate the activities of youth under 17 years of age in public places between 12 a. m. and 6 a.m. The ordinance was passed to address juvenile-related problems in the community, primarily criminal youth activity and victimization. The curfew was initially to span 6 months, after which a report was to be made to the Council. On February 13, 1992, staff presented statistical data on the significant effects of the curfew and recommended that it be continued. Another report in August 1992, disclosed data on enforcement, intervention, adjudication and victimization that caused the Council to vote to continue and called for a 2-year report in August 1993. The assessment was based on both quantitative and subjective evaluation data. Juvenile victimization for all crimes decreased more in the second year of the program-a decrease of some 16 percent. Figures also reflect that the Police Department's enforcement was ethnically balanced and that citywide crime was also declining. Following a 7-percent decrease in 1992, the first 7 months of 1993 showed a lO-percent decrease. The San Antonio City Council believes the curfew has played a significant role in reducing citywide crime and juvenile victimization. It is important, however, that the curfew is viewed as but one strategy in a comprehensive communitywide effort focusing on youth issues and crime reduction. Other strategies that have contributed to reduction in crime and juvenile victimization are increased parental responsibility, youth activity initiatives, improved coordination between law enforcement and schools, and gang intervention and education programs.

Other Recommendations: Coordination/Collaboration/Replication Strategies: Develop public/private full employment initiative Cleveland Works, Inc.: Beat the Streets; Cleveland, Ohio Program Type: Target Population: Project Startup Date: Annual Budget/Number of Persons Served Annually: Sources of Funding: Program Objectives/Description: Job readiness/life skills Young men and women on Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) Cleveland Works-1986/Beat the Streets-1991 Approximately $300,000/ approximatel y 700 served annually City and county Job Training Partnership Act (JTP A) and federal food stamp employment training, foundation grants Beat the Streets is a job readiness/life skills develop program operating under Cleveland Works, Inc. that prepares young parents, both men and women, receiving Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) to enter the work force with full-time jobs with health benefits. To date, Cleveland Works has placed well over 2,000 people with more than 500 employers, allowing them to get off public assistance rolls. In 1991, Cleveland Works began offering services to young men, particularly fathers 16 to 25 years of age, in the City of Cleveland. In late 1992, the program expanded to serve young parents anywhere in Cuyahoga County. This pilot program, \"Beat the Streets,\" had graduated 379 young men and women by the end of 1993. The proportion of women in the Beat the Streets program is nearing 50 percent. Beat the Streets prepares young parents for joining the work force through 320 hours of intensive training for job opportunities with Cleveland area employers. Employers must offer full-time wages and health benefits to hire the program's graduates. The training centers on job readiness that focuses on education, health, legal services, employment, and life management. Seventy-five percent of those who have entered the program have dropped out of high school and are so alienated from school they have no wish to complete their education in a traditional setting. Through Beat the Streets, they are offered the opportunity to gain their General Equivalency Diploma (GED) through an 8-hour per day regimen in which they are taught mathematics, English, and life.management skills. Sixty-nine graduates received their GED certificates in 1993, and of that number, several opted to finish high school, some enrolled at Cuyahoga Community College, and others are attending Cleveland State University. Referrals to Beat the Streets are made by Juvenile Court, Adult Common Pleas, and Municipal Court Adult Probation, as well as by other social service and drug/mental health agencies. Legal services have become an important part of the program because many participants need help in removing barriers to participation in the program and successful employment. The Cleveland Works Legal Department comprises a staff of five full-time attorneys, two part-time attorneys, and two paralegals who have helped 50 percent of the graduates and have worked with 80 percent of the young fathers with legal problems that range from paternity, through custody, criminal law, traffic, and credit. First-time offender diversion projects are being developed by the legal staff working with the Court of Common Pleas and Juvenile Court with the aim of reducing recidivism and probation caseloads. They work to prevent incarceration of first-time minor offenders as well since judges and prosecutors increasingly realize that warehousing in the prison system is a futile answer to burgeoning dockets. Both parents and their children are served by the Cleveland Works/MetroHealth Medical Clinic, which strongly emphasizes education and prevention in addition to complete health care. The Family Development Project runs a full-day all-year Head Start program to serve children ages 3 to 5, while Family Education courses stress child development, parenting skills, working parent issues, nutrition, and child safety. Employment that graduates receive is designed to allow them to pay child support and help them raise their children. The average wage for all young men and women is $6.39 per hour with family health benefits. Counselors follow up with students after their placement to ensure that both employer and employee are satisfied with job performance. The probationary period usually lasts 6 months, but counselors continue to monitor graduates' employment. Thirty-and 90-day retention rates are averaging 95 and 86 percent, comparing favorably with the figures for Cleveland Works' adult programs. In 1991, Cleveland Works was chosen by Public-Private Ventures as one of six sites to participate in a national pilot project to serve noncustodial fathers. Its aim is to explore the impact of providing job training and other supportive services to young men to strengthen their ability and willingness to pay child support and support their children emotionally.

The key is for disputants to talk out instead of act out problems and to realize the importance of getting along. Nearly 300 volunteer mediators, trained by CBP, help resolve conflicts referred from communities, police, juvenile probation, small claims court, and other San Francisco organizations. One-third of the mediators are people of color, and a growing number are teenagers. In San Francisco schools, CBP's Conflict Manager program trains student mediators to help their peers settle disputes without adult intervention or, in many cases, punishment. Mediators encourage disputants to talk instead of fight and to see the situation from the other person's perspective. The program has found that most conflicts dissipate if solved immediately, avoiding retaliation and fights. As a result, school staff spent less time on discipline and problem-solving, and the overall school climate can improve. Conflict Manager Institute trains educators to coordinate these student peer mediation programs. In the community, CBP mediator panels meet with disputants in parent-child conflicts, neighbor disagreements, and juvenile cases. Nearly 20 percent of cases are youth-related, and the inclusion of teenage mediators on the panels assures young disputants that their views will be heard. Increasingly, mediators assist in disputes involving gangs and in cases where prejudice triggers hostility among youth. Publications include the twice-yearly Dispute Resolution Access: A Guide to Current Research & Information, and The Conciliation Handbook.

Training materials and training provided by Relevant Educational Corporation, Inc. The Black Parenting Education Program has the mission of strengthening and empowering African American families and to teach parents that they have the power to raise children who are competent, confident individuals able to know, able to do, and above all, able to think. The program's goal is to prepare children for a successful school experience by age six. It is a comprehensive, competency based, culturally relevant parenting program designed to meet the ever increasing needs of young, at-risk Mrican American parents. \"Success By 6\" is an underlying foundation of the program. Topics addressed during the 19 sessions comprising over 60 hours of training include reducing child abuse and infant mortality, administering discipline, combating substance abuse, recognizing developmental deficiencies, child health needs and nutrition, building self\u00ad esteem, and overcoming stress. The program employs a two-step delivery method of which the first step is \"training the trainer,\" who is a teacher or other individual involved with parents and who teaches the course to groups of parents. Teaching methods involve a mix of lecture, reading materials (third-grade level), discussion, and visual and other aids such as videos, charts, toys and manipulative objects. The I-day train-the-trainer workshops are conducted by Relevant Education Corporation of Arlington, Virginia throughout the country and internationally. The course was originally taught in and with the cooperation of African American church congregations, but is now taught in a variety of locations. A recent group of trainees were Alexandria and Arlington, Virginia jail officials who will take the program to inmates, both men and women, to encourage them to spend more time helping raise their children after release and equipping them with the tools to do so. Talmadge T. Williams, president of the training company, Relevant Educational Corporation, says the program targets \"a new kind of family, one made up of an infant, a single parent and often a grandmother younger than 35 trying to work to take care of both the child and the grandchild.\" The program understands that many young parents have never had an opportunity to learn the basics of child rearing because they grew up in poor households surrounded by crime and drug use, and often suffered abuse. The problem is exacerbated as the age of crime-prone children continues to drop, say program developers. The program was developed by an African American woman for African American parents and children and addresses issues unique to that population. The importance of teaching standard English to children is emphasized, but parents are also advised not to criticize children's use of so-called black English at home-a vital cultural component. The course may be taught by persons with or without a background in training or child development, but trainers must love children and understand the stresses and problems young parents face. A trainer must be motivated to improve the conditions of development for young African American children and should be able to function as a group process facilitator who can encourage parents to discuss their ideas and concerns.

CEDEN conducts home visits before and after birth, assesses infant development, and recommends individualized family service plans. New parents are taught about prenatal and postnatal care, child development, infant stimulation, health, nutrition, home safety, and substance abuse prevention. They are also taught positive discipline methods, coping skills, and stress management. Special attention is given to high-risk and developmentally delayed children. Services for parents include support groups, counseling, and parenting skill classes. Teenage parents are taught how to set and achieve goals to enhance their education, careers, and families. A Family Learning Resource Center offers courses in literacy, numeracy, and English to help family members become self-sufficient participants in the community. CEDEN seeks to improve child development and prevent abuse and neglect in the community by dealing with biological factors (such as prematurity, low birth weight, and malnutrition), socioeconomic factors (such as poverty and homelessness), and familial factors (such as age of mother, level of education, and social isolation). Family advocacy and case management are provided. Materials and services are multicultural and bilingual.

S. Department of Agriculture Breakfast and Lunch Program, United Way, fundraising efforts CIDNS UP (Children in Need of Services) offers comprehensive services for troubled youth and their families. When abuse or neglect has occurred, the family receives intensive \"family preservation\" services from a specialist who works with them 15 to 20 hours per week for 4 weeks to keep the family together. Other CillNS UP services include an expanded 37-bed residential unit therapeutic foster care and a state-certified special education program. For youth in the overcrowded state-operated detention center, CillNS UP provides case management and, when appropriate, recommends a placement option in which the young person is not incarcerated. Through these measures, CillNS UP removes obstacles to the learning readiness of youth who are often given up for lost. CHINS UP administers the EI Paso County Partners Program, started in 1993, which matches adult mentors with at-risk children ages 8 to 18 for I-year partnerships where the adult partner commits to spending 2 to 3 hours per week for a year with the child. CillNS UP also administers a Runaway and Homeless Youth Program (also started in 1993), which attempts to reunite runaway youth with their families. Most of the mountain, rural, and urban youth served by CillNS UP are from low-income homes; child abuse cases come from all income levels. The residential program, demographically typical of all the service programs, serves children ages 10 to 18; about two-thirds are Caucasian, the rest are mostly Latino or African American. Specific outcome measures are used to assess the effectiveness of the different services. The indicator of success for family therapy is whether the child is still living at home (or with a relative) and either attending school full time or attending part time along with part-time work. By this criterion, family therapy had a 76 percent success rate. The success rate of family preservation services, as measured by the child remaining at home with the family after tennination of services, was 90 percent. Among the program's plans for this year are adding a year-round alternative education program for 7th to 9th graders who are at risk of dropping out of the regular school system.

It also aids community efforts to combat child abuse, substance abuse, juvenile delinquency, gang violence, learning disorders, behavior problems, and emotional disturbances. Effective African-American parenting involves prosocial achievement orientation, but recognizes that special \"street pressures\" in inner city African-American communities make it difficult for parents to maintain such an orientation. This program presents two major parenting strategies: The Family Approach for Developing Respectful Behaviors (focusing on family rules and family rule guidelines) and the Thinking Parent's Approach to Disrespectful Child Behaviors (utilizing systematic decisionmaking processes). Rule development, family meeting and problem assessment skills, and child development information help parents make rules appropriate to the age of the child. Basic child management skills are also stressed: effective praise, mild social disapproval, systematic ignoring, time out, and special incentives. The program consists of 14 three-hour training sessions and a graduation ceremony. Each training session includes an extensive review and role playing of ideas and skills that were taught in previous sessions. Optimal group size is 15 to 20 parents, with a I-day seminar version available for 50 to 500 parents. Unique to this program are discussions of traditional African-American discipline contrasted with modem African-American discipline strategies in teaching parents new skills. Issues relevant to African-American pride and ways of coping with racism are also discussed. Child abuse information is included in a discussion of the disadvantages of using corporal punishment as a disciplinary technique. Field tests have indicated that the program has direct and positive effects on many of the family and child risk factors that research has found puts children at risk for drug abuse, delinquency, and other social and health problems. It reduces negative family communication, enhances parental involvement with children, reduces child behavior problems, enhances limit-setting, and improves the general psychological well-being of parents. Classes have been replicated in 35 states with similar positive results.

Addressing drug and alcohol abuse prevention for high-risk youth, the program emphasizes family health, personal motivation, and self-control. FIF families meet with facilitators to set goals and select the functions they need to strengthen: family fun, decisions, pride, values, feelings, communication, and confidence . Then they begin assignments from FIF's Home Learning Guide to improve those areas. Progress is evaluated and new goals set at meetings scheduled 2 weeks apart during approximately 1 year. In the process, family members learn to support and influence one another in substance abuse prevention and other areas. Each family learns to rate its own risks for alcohol and drug problems and how attitudes, beliefs, and expectations concerning drugs and alcohol can alter that risk. Because many participants have a family history of substance abuse, they are eager to address the effects of abuse on the family and the relationship between family history and increased risk. Families enjoy a membership type of association with FIF and can contact program staff toll free from anywhere in the country. New family issues are disseminated regularly to member families, and volunteer and replication training models are offered. Program evaluation indicates gains in family functioning and satisfaction, reduction in incidence of alcohol abuse, and expectancy scores predicting fewer substance abuse problems for FIF families .

Adapted by the National Center for Family Literacy and High Scope, the FACE program also reflects the cultural traditions and values of the Sioux tribe. FACE is a federal program installed at 11 sites around the U.S. It comprises four components: early childhood education, parenting skills, parent and child interactive time (PACTime), and adult education. Developed for families with children from birth to five years of age, the program is designed to address America 2000 educational goals and Indian America 2000 educational goals that focus on school readiness; high school completion, student achievement and citizenship, adult literacy, and lifelong learning; safe, disciplined and drug-free schools; and tribal government, language, and culture. The program offers two settings: home-based and center-based. The home-based program serves children from birth to three years and their parents, disseminates child development information, and presents an opportunity to practice parenting skills. At monthly meetings, families share successes and common concerns. Adult education opportunities are also available to parents served in the home-based setting. The center-based setting serves children three to five years of age and their parents at a school site. Parents and children arrive together on a school bus, have breakfast in the cafeteria, and then parents and children separate to attend classes. Adult classes address such issues as child development, life skills, skills development (writing or math), GED preparation, study skills, and self-esteem building. Needs of each adult are assessed to focus on individual concerns. Before PACTime at midday, adults each choose an activity to share with their child or children, such as reading a book or playing with toys, to practice their parenting skills. After lunch, adults return to the classroom and continue working toward goals until the last half- hour of class. This time is reserved for reflecting aloud on what has happened during the day. For example, parents may discuss something they observed with their children during PACTime. While parents are in class, children are in an active, developmental environment that is based on the High/Scope curriculum. A benefit of the FACE approach is that it acquaints parents with the school and reduces their discomfort with the school setting. Key to the success of the Takini school is close coordination among all involved with the program. Teachers and assistants coordinate program plans with activities; for example, to ensure that a parenting topic covered in the adult class is followed by opportunities to practice related parenting skills during PACTime. Coordination with the school's principal is also critical because while FACE coordination takes a great deal of work, it has proven extremely beneficial to the program. A process evaluation is being conducted by an outside evaluator, who is examining a number of program characteristics such as student and parent enrollment, the education of parents when they come into the program, program implementation, service delivery, and integration with other services. Results are not yet available for the 1991-92 school year. Since FACE criteria are set nationally, the Takini School has no plans to change the program in any major way. It does, however, hope to expand the program to serve more children and families. For further information contact: Linda Hunter FACE Coordinator Takini School P.O.

The centers offer a variety of program activities and services, including social services, referrals, followup with prenatal and pediatric medical care, parenting guidance sessions, parent support groups, prenatal and parenting education classes, nutritious meals, skill building classes that include family literacy and English as a Second Language, and parent\u00ad child recreational activities such as field trips. Though families receive a host of services from staff, the heart of the Family Place is the support they give to one another. In addition to passing on the word about the Family Place (80 percent of new families are referred by participants), families rent apartments together, take care of each other's children, pass down baby clothes, and are available in times of crisis or loneliness. To foster this network of peer support and help build it into community cohesiveness, the Family Place involves participants actively in the planning, development, implementation, and evaluation of all services and activities. The program serves an average of 200 families a month, most of whom are Hispanic or Mrican American. A computer-based tracking system to monitor client demographics, needs, services, and outcomes has yielded encouraging findings, such as fewer low birthweight infants for Family Place families (4 percent) than for the District of Columbia as a whole (14 percent) or for Hispanics in the District (6 to 7 percent). Participant satisfaction, as reflected in referrals and focus groups, is quite high. -----~~~~--~~~~--' For further information contact: Ann Barnet, M.D. President The Family Place 3309 16th Street, NW Washington, DC 20010 (202) 265-0149 (202) 483-0650 (fax) Other Recommendations: Parenting Skills/Family Management Strategy: Implement parenting/family management skills to help keep families together Family Ties (New York, New York) Program Type: Target Population: Annual Budget/Number of Persons Served Annually Project Startup Date: Sources of Funding: IProgram Objectives/Description: Alternative to Incarceration Youth ages 12-17 N/A 1989 Federal, state, and local Family Ties seeks to avert placement of a juvenile in an institution and reinvolvement in the jlr.ltmile justice system. The program identifies the needs of each delinquent child and works to strengthen family function so the youngster many remain at home. Family court judges refer adolescents to the program who are at imminent risk of out-of-home placement. A counselor, who works with the family for a four-to eight-week period, is on call seven days a week and 24 hours a day to assist the family during the program. Together the counselor, youth, and parent establish goals and agreements in fonning a plan to address the problems that contribute to the youth's delinquency. The program, which is skills-based and goal focused, incorporates behavior modification and cognitive learning techniques to bring about changes in behavior, attitudes, and way of thinking. Counseling techniques for juveniles vary depending on the individual case; however, typically they include teaching decisionmaking skills to help juveniles make fewer self-defeating decisions and to resist negative peer influences; behavior modification to help juveniles comply with parental curfews; and anger management exercises. Substance abuse treatment and other therapeutic needs are provided directly by a trained counselor and by referral agencies. Parents engage in counseling centered on alternative ways to better supervise and support the child. The counselor monitors the participant's school attendance and performance and involves school teachers in the helping process. A case management system is used to document, monitor, and evaluate the family's progress and the youth's status. After the four-to eight-week period ends, the counselor prepares a termination report for the court that evaluates the youth's progress in reaching the service goals and the family support system. The report also recommends whether the youth be granted probation and remain in the community at home or whether further consideration be given to placement of the youth. The judge either accepts of rejects the counselor's recommendation. If accepted, the youth is then transferred to the Probation Department for a term set by the court.

First Stop, wh~ch provides the initial intake, assessment, and intervention for youth andlor families, is aimed at families not currently involved in the social services system. Clients for centralized intake are identified primarily through referrals from local schools, police departments,: and social services agencies. Once referred, clients are screened to determine their eligibility for the program. Runaway, ungovernable, or truant clients are the focus. Clients who are not involved with social services either in dependence (under investigation, under supervision, or adjudicated) or in delinquency are referred to social services. Outreach and community presentations are provided to these referral sources in order to publicize the availability of the program. First Stop for Families services include screening of all referrals; comprehensive assessments of problems and service needs; development of plans to meet the identified needs; crisis intervention; home-based individual and family counseling; referrals to appropriate services; case management to ensure access to prevention, mediation, and treatment services; and follow up contacts 180 days after termination of services. Services are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Appropriate client data is maintained in the computerized client information systems of Miami Bridge, Inc., the parent organization of First Step for Families.

The conclusion of child abuse and foster care placement agencies was that the family-the nurturing unit of parents and children-was in crisis. A small group of family service professionals fonned a partnership with the State of Maryland and with the Straus and Goldseker Foundations in 1986 with the ambitious mission of saving Maryland's children. Their chosen solution was to develop a support system for families to help them raise healthy children and build product~ve futures. Friends of the Family was established as an intermediary to develop community-based family support programs in collaboration with public and private funders. In turn, Friends of the Family supports a statewide network of Family Support Centers that serve differing needs of urban and rural communities. The program was originally modeled upon a Chicago program called \"An Ounce of Prevention,\" and adapted to the Maryland situation. The idea was that state departments would pool their resources and fund a nonprofit organization that would be an intermediary between private and public efforts. It is an early intervention program of such state departments as Human Resources, Education, Social Services, and others. In Baltimore, there are 6 funded centers, and plans are to expand the number of centers statewide to 30. Besides coordinating Family Support Centers, Friends of the Family also trains hundreds of participants from numerous agencies, including Parents Anonymous, Associated Catholic Charities, Family and Children's services of Maryland, and the Baltimore City Department of Social Services. The organization also offers seminars and workshops periodically that feature experts in different aspects of family or infant development. In addition, it administers Family Start, 1 of 24 model Comprehensive Child Development Programs funded by the Department of Health and Human Services, and in Anne Arundel County, it administers 1 of 6 national models to encourage unwed fathers to participate in and accept parental responsibility by developing their educational and economic independence. The Family Support Centers are community-based programs that provide services to help families with young children, particularly those in high-risk communities, raise healthy children and build productive futures. The Centers are located in neighborhoods that have high concentrations of adolescent pregnancy, poverty, low birthweight babies, high school dropouts, child abuse and neglect, unemployment, and children who are not ready for school. The programs are completely voluntary. In its role as trainer and technical assistant, Friends of the Family furnishes staff expertise in infant and toddler development, sOi~,al work, mental health counseling, education, grant writing, and public administration. It functions on behalf of funders of the program and brings ideas from other programs, organizes meetings and trainlllg, and serves as liaison among centers, Services delivered at the centers include structured classes and groups in addition to drop-in services. The set of core services are parenting education; child care services for infants and toddlers up to 3 years of age while parents are onsite; health education and referral for a full range of health care services; educational and employability services provided on site and through referral; recreation for parents and children; service coordination with other agencies; developmental assessments for children and remediation of developmental problems either onsite or by referral; advocacy and community building; short-tenn counseling and referral for more intensive counseling services; adolescent pregnancy prevention services to delay both first and subsequent pregnancies; and in-home services for \"hard-to-reach\" families. Some centers have been able to provide such additional services as The Nurturing Program, a child abuse prevention parenting service; support groups for interracial couples; children of alcoholics; grandparents who are parenting; parents whose children are in foster care; new p3;rents; foster care parents; new workers; and fathers. Preteen and teen clubs feature theater, dance, and job clubs; tutoring; and summer camps. Center programs have been designed to IJse a neighborhood and family empowennent model in which participants are treated as equal partners in the effort, not as \"clients\" or \"cases.\" They share in policy decisions and in program development implementation. All programs are voluntary and no-fee and most support single mothers~ but more programs are in process to attract young fathers as well. Nothing is mandated; no one must come a number of times in so many days or so many times per week. Studies have revealed that 94 percent of all teenaged participants do continue education or have received a GED or high school diploma working with the family support centers. Believing that \"the best contraceptive is a real future,\" in 1992 the program saw only 5 repeat pregnancies out of 400 parenting teenagers under age 17. Awards have come to the program for its forward-thinking private/public/c\"mmunity partnership, which represents a new direction in preventive social services to higll-risk families.

Since its inception, the agency has provided non\u00ad traditional counseling, education, and intervention services to more than 2,000 men at no cost to participants. Fathers are taught leadership skills, public speaking, and entrepreneurial thinking and are provided with educational and employment opportunities. The curriculum is designed to encourage men to take responsiblilty for their lives, particularly in relation to their families, and to move toward economic self-sufficiency. Counseling services are available from paraprofessional outreach specialists 24 hours a day, 7 days a week in the fathers' homes. The Institute also serves mothers with male children and incarcerated fathers and their familiel'. There is also a Leadership and Empowennent Program for Mrican American males. Conclusions from a fonner client outcomes survey show that: A total of 70 percent of program graduates have completed 12 years of education, and 11.5 percent have completed at least 1 year of college. Sixty-two percent are employed full time and 112 percent, part-time. More than 90 percent of males have established paternity. ,------------------------------------------- --- More than 75 percent of males reported fathering no additional children out of wedlock. Almost 100 percent now provide financial support for their children.

In all PAT programs, trained professionals make home visits to parents of young children. The visitors model parenting skills, provide developmental information so that parents can make informed choices, and introduct activities for growing children. Currently there are 1,045 PAT programs in 42 states and in three foreign countries. In 1987 the National School District (NSD) in National City, California, decided to try PAT out of a conviction that when parents get involved in promoting their children's early development, they stay involved in the children's education. In addition, the NSD was concerned about the declining level of readiness of preschool and kindergarten students entering school for the first time. In the NSD program, parents of infants two and one-half years or younger can enroll in PAT and remain in it until the child is three. All families are eligible, regardless of socioeconomic status, and participation is entirely voluntary. Since 78 percent of families in the NSD program are Hispanic and many speak only Spanish, services and materials are provided in Spanish or English. Each family receives one home visit a month until the child turns three. During these visits, the visitor gives the parent specific strategies to address individual concerns, such as toilet training, discipline, and appropriate toys, and these concerns are always followed up at the next home visit. In addition, children are periodically screened for vision, hearing, and nomlal growth and development and referred to health and other services when appropriate. An extended program for three-to five-year-olds is forthcoming. At PAT parent meetings, held at least three times a month, child care is provided and discussion among parents is encouraged. A special feature of the NSD program is a six-week parenting class offered when children are close to school age for parents who have graduated from PAT in order to help bridge the gap between PAT and school. PAT is also adapted for teen parents in the NSD program. While teen parents are eligible to receive home visits, family circumstances often do not permit a typical home visit, and teens seem to prefer group meetings. For most teen parents who are in school, participating in PAT means meeting weekly for two hours in a small group setting. Fathers are welcome too, and all teens receive schoo] credit for attending. During the first hour, each teen is given individualized information relating to her/his child; the second hour is a group lesson on a topic related to the needs of adolescents. The Stuart and Packard Foundations sponsored a compJ\\~hensive research study on the National City PAT program. Stanford Research Institute International implemented a two\u00ad year evaluation plan to compare PAT three-year-olds to a control group. The findings proved a consistent beneficial effect from participation in PAT on virtually all measures used in the evaluation.

Its mission is to facilitate the healthy family functioning of minority, at-risk children (focusing on newborn through age 5) and their parents. This is accomplished by providing innovative, family\u00ad focused, child developmental, educational, and family support programs, which are delivered in a humanistic, culturally relevant, community-based environment. The five Institute programs are as follows. PACT provides intensive family management and personal skills development and support to low-income working parents who are under extreme stress and their preschool children who are at risk for out-of-home placement. Children are provided with therapeutic developmental activities in a licensed child care setting. Parents are helped through family support groups and individual counseling to help them maintain, improve, and strengthen family functioning. FREEDOM makes available a wide variety of services and support to preschool children and their parents. Infants, toddlers, and preschoolers are provided with therapeutic nursery/preschool activities. Parents receive support and services through parenting, family management, and independent living skills classes. The primary goal is to prevent developmental delays in high-risk young children through promoting positive family interaction skills. NEST is a parent education and training program for parents of kindergartners who are experiencing problems in basic skill development. Children leam actively \"by doing;\" these activities reinforce the public school curriculum. SAFE-P provides a series of culturally relevant, structured learning experiences designed to encourage postponement of sexual involvement and/or responsibility in their sexual encounters for early adolescents. This is accomplished by building and strengthening self\u00ad esteem and increasing know ledge of human sexuality and teen pregnancy. FAMIUES is a joint medical/social services project designed to improve the health of pregnant women, and infants exposed to alcohol or other controlled substances during pregnancy, as well as to reduce the need for out-of-home placement of the infants. This is accomplished through medical, social-emotional, chemical health, child birth, and parenting education services, as well as intensive networking with appropriate community organizations.

Many of these young people are ill\u00ad pr~pared to be parents themselves. The twofold mission of Teen Parent Services is, first, to enable teenaged parents to stay in or return to school to get a diploma or GED; and, second, to help them develop parenting and other life skills. Teen Parent Services began in 1986 at one site. Now, in addition to that original site, there are 11 other educational sites for pregnant or parenting students. Program services include on-site and off-site child care, transportation, a life skills class, career and vocational assessments, and cooperative work experience. In 1992-93 a total of 785 teens were enrolled in Teen Parent Services. In a summer program jointly sponsored by the schools and the Private Industry Council (PIC), students attend classes in the morning and work at a job site in the afternoon. Besides the academic curriculum, students participate in parenting skills classes, support groups, and gang intervention activities. For instance, students in recent years have created award\u00ad winning videos emphasizing parenting responsibilities and giving strong messages against becoming a teen parent or getting involved with gangs. Community involvement in the program is strong, and family members serve as part of each teenager's support team. Another component within Teen Parent Services targets teenage parents wishing to return to school as a result of the Family Support Act mandate. A \"school liaison\" provides front-end counseling and educational and vocational assessment services to help orient and reintegrate the young parent into an appropriate school placement,. and a case manager works to address housing, child care, or other service needs that may impact school participation. The Service has not been fonnally evaluated for several years. PIVOT, which targets older teens returning to school to complete their education or acquire job skills, had 22 students complete the course in 1991-1992 of which over half became employed at an average wage of $7.25 per hour; others have continued on to college or additional training. In the 1992- 1993 school year, the district graduated 129 pregnant or parenting students. The Service continues to seek new sites to expand the undertaking.

The Center offers specialized programs and services for both parents and children to keep families strong. The parent programs first help parents to learn to value themselves. As they gain self\u00ad confidence and competence, they become better parents and pass their feelings of wOlth along to their children. The programs also aim to ease the isolation parents often feel and to teach them new ways of meeting their children's needs for nuturing and intellectual stimulation. Social, recreational, and educational activities for parents of infants and toddlers include parenting education, guest speakers, and trips to cultural and recreational sites. Child care services by trained child care workers are available during scheduled Center activities. Programs for children from birth to age 4 provide developmentally appropriate activities, screening for developmental delays, and informal parenting education. A social worker will meet parents' needs in their home. Center staff work with parents to increase access to available programs, increase agency responsiveness, and help advocate for their children. More than half of the residents in the community over age 25 did not graduate from high school. Through its education and employment enhancement programs, the Center provides access to adult remedial education and job readiness skills. Although Waverly Family Center was originally developed to provide support for parents of young children, it soon added a comprehensive youth program to help school-age children develop self-esteem and realistic plans for their lives. This program incorporates enrichment activities, counseling, help with academic problems, and early intervention to prevent teen pregnancy. The after-school program provides a supervised, structured, and happy environment where children can do their homework and participate in a variety of educational activities. Volunteer tutors are available for children with academic problems. The Center's summer day camp, with extensive community support, enriches the lives of children in the community. Special programs like outdoor experiential education build self-confidence and help teens learn problem solving through cooperation and teamwork.

It can be unlearned.\" Tum Off the Violence originated in Minnesota in the summer of 1991. A tragic series of highly publicized violent crimes throughout the state in the first 6 months of the year had many Minnesotans feeling frightened and powerless to change the situation. Amid the public outcry for tougher criminal penalties, two police crime prevention specialists found themselves asking, \"If we could just tum off the violence ... ! If we could even just get people to tum off violent entertainment, wouldn't that be something!\" They realized that even as Americans are horrified and baffled by rising rates of real-life violence, many are fascinated by violent TV, movies, and music. Not long before, the Minneapolis Star Tribune had asked children to write to the paper to express their feellings about the violence they saw on TV and in movies. While many argued against it, the most common refrain from the almost 10,000 children who wrote letters, \"I love violence. Violence is cool!\" The two crime prevention specialists soon launched their plan by calling other organizations to\u00b7 invite representatives to meet and discuss a public awareness campaign that would culminate in a \"Tum Off the Violence Day, \" the first of which was October 3, 1991. This year's Tum Off the Violence Day will be October 27, 1994. Since that first effort of the Twin Cities pilot project, word-of-mouth and project literature spread, and the coalition has grown to include organizations across three states. Continued communication and networking among agencies that had no previous relationships has resulted as membership in the coalition continues to grow. The campaign I s two goals are (1) to make people aware of nonviolent ways to deal with anger and conflict, and (2) to help people realize that violent entertainment influences our attitudes about the acceptability of violence ... and that among all influences on violent behavior, that is one influence we can choose to tum off. The Tum Off the Violence Coalition has developed seven guiding principles to define its mission that are to govern the actions of any individual or organization who chooses to use the logo, name, or materials of the coalition. 1. The campaign is to be kept simple. Problems to be addressed are (a) the negative influence of the media on attitudes about the acceptability of violence; and (b) the lack of information available, especially to young people, about legal, safe, and positive ways of resolving conflict. 2. Tum Off the Violence is a coalition of over 85 organizations and hundreds of individuals who have joined the campaign and work together to address the problem. 3. Tum Off the Violence addresses all forms of violence and asks people to tum off violence in all its ugly forms: physical violence, sexual violence, verbal violence, violence in entertainment, family violence, gang violence, hate crimes, and playground violence. 4. The program includes as many groups and popUlations as it can because no fragment of society has been left untouched by violence 5. It is a grassroots campaign operated on a very limited budget that invites active participation in all phases of planning and implementation. 6. It is not a censorship project. As an organization, Tum Off the Violence does not sponsor boycotts or compile lists of music, movies, or TV shows considered violent. It believes that' if enough people express their preferences for nonviolent media, the market will shrink, and those in the industries will get the message. 7. It is not the cure-all. Myriad influences shape violent attitudes and behavior in addition to electronic media, but the increasingly violent images portrayed on television, in movies, and in music portray violence as an ordinary, and often appropriate, way of resolving conflict, demonstrating power, releasing emotions, and responding to everything from sexual desire to boredom to social injustice. Once parents learn to tum it off they can begin to teach children appropriate ways of dealing with the challenges.

The program brings together high schools, businesses, and local colleges in working partnerships that provide college and career preparation, summer and school-year work experience, special academic tutoring, and counseling and support services. Career Beginnings enrolls students for 18 months, from the beginning of their junior year through graduation. Participants include students who have average grades. Most students live in rural/small communities or in cities with populations larger than 100,000, and most participants are minorities and considered disadvantaged economically, socially, and educationally. The program matches each student with a mentor from the local business or professional community. The mentors, who are carefully selected, trained, and supported, help their students with planning their careers, applying to college, and understanding the professional work environment. In addition, students attend workshops on career planning; basic academic skills, such as reading, writing, and mathematics; skills such as money management, time management, and family planning; college financial aid; and resume writing and work-related issues. The program, which operates in more than 35 communities, has had successful results, with 95 percent of the students graduating from high school and more than 80 percent entering college or postsecondary training in 1993. ---------------------------- For further information contact: James Coats Corporate Initiatives Manager 750 Washington Street NEMCH 328 Boston, MA 02111 (617) 956-9151 (617) 956-9158 (fax) _________ ______ __ ~ _~_ Other Recommendations: Jobs for Youth Strategy: Provide young people with options and opportunities The Detroit Compact (Detroit, Michigan) Program Type: Target Population: Project Startup Date: Annual Budget/Number of Persons Served Annually: Sources of Funding: Program Objectives/Description: Training, employment, college scholarship Middle and high school students 1989 N/A/2,100 persons served State, city, local, and private funds The Detroit Compact is a partnership involving students, educators, area businesses, and government agencies to guarantee jobs or higher education to Detroit Public Schools students. Training, jobs, volunteers, and/or financial support come from schools, universities, community organizations, and businesses. Some 750 active volunteers from these organizations provide tutoring, mentoring, job training, career awareness, and other resources for participating students. To be eligible for the guarantees, students in the Compact must strive toward high standards of behavior, attendance, and academic achievement, demonstrate teamwork and leadership skills, and remain drug free. Those who achieve the standards receive employment opportunities, college financial aid, or financial incentives (for middle school and special education students). Students meeting job-ready standards are guaranteed summer employment and, for graduating seniors, the opportunity to compete for entry level employment. Seniors meeting college\u00ad ready standards receive a comprehensive financial package covering, at a minimum, tuition and fees at participating colleges and universities, while students choosing a nonparticipating college receive $1, 000. A Compact council in each school is responsible for budgets, use of volunteers, jobs, standards, incentives, and new strategies to increase student achievement. Representatives of each partner group (school, community, and business) serve on the council. Compact membership is voluntary for Detroit schools; some of those participating have a waiting list of students desiring to transfer in. The program receives strong support from Detroit businesses and community groups, and evaluation data show encouraging responses from students, parents, and employers.

The pioneering group includes three districts: Grants, New Mexico; Portland, Maine; and Junction City, Kansas. FUTURES 2000 is a long-term strategy for school improvement to foster: Innovative classroom instruction that provides career awareness and experimental learning. Family involvement in recognizing future career and educational options. Interaction with mentors from the business and professional community. Multiple occasions to create future goals and the plans to achieve them during and after high school. FUTURES 2000 goals include: Foster a productive learning environment for all students in middle school. Execute systemic institutional change in districts. Help students gain enough knowledge about careers, education, and their own interests to develop a realistic plan for pursuing future goals. Because FUTURES 2000 is classroom-based, the focus of the program is on teachers and counselors. Teachers have the major responsibility for testing the program as a national model and identifying expected outcomes and the necessary resources to achieve success. A FUTURES 2000 coordinator is the onsite resource for staff. The coordinator recruits outside resources, shares ideas with teachers, runs planning meetings, keeps the staff focused on objectives, provides classroom support, and negotiates for FUTURES 2000 within the district. Administered by the Center for Corporate and Education Initiatives (CCEI) in Massachusetts, FUTURES 2000 has formed a national network of educational, business, and community leaders committed to helping young people and their families prepare for their future. The program builds on CCEI's Career Beginnings and Higher Ground initiatives, which have provided career and educational support systems for more than 12,000 low- income, underachieving high school and college students.

Higher Ground, managed by the Center for Corporate and Education Initiatives (CCEI) , has grown out of the experience gained through CCEI's Career Beginnings program, a high school transition initiative. Higher Ground provides incoming Career Beginnings graduates and other low-income or minority youth at seven colleges with up to 4 years of academic assistance, career planning, social support, summer and school-year internships, and mentors from the academic and professional communities. The project has two primary goals. First, by focusing initially on colleges currently involved in Career Beginnings, Higher Ground seeks to extend and protect the successful 2-year investment that Career Beginnings makes in nurturing the skills and ambitions of minority high-school juniors and seniors. Second, Higher Ground is designed to build the capacity of colleges and universities well beyond the Career Beginnings network to reduce the attrition rates of at-risk students. Seven demonstration sites, each serving a minimum of 130 participants over a 4-year period, were selected from among the communities where Career Beginnings currently operates. At each site, the resources of a variety of institutional factors, such as college faculty, staff, and students; local businesses; professional associations; and community organizations, are drawn upon to provide graduating Career Beginnings participants and other at-risk minority students with a multifaceted 4-year sequence of activities (2 years at community colleges). Activities include: An intensive summer component. Social support and academic skill development. Family outreach and involvement. Career exploration and goal setting. Career-focused work experience that cultivates skill development, affiliations, and contacts. Assistance in facilitating the transfer of 2-year students to 4-year colleges and universities. Ongoing relationships with college, community, and career-based adult mentors. Structured sequential internships in the public and private sector. Higher Ground is in its fourth year in seven colleges and universities. Seven hundred students have begun their college experience involved in Higher Ground. The first-year retention rate is 91 percent, and the second-year rate is 69 percent. The third year retention rate is 66 percent, a striking outcome compared to a 23 percent third-year retention rate for a comparable group of students (High School and Beyond Study). Even more encouraging, many Higher Ground students are now campus leaders.

The Diner's founder, the Chesapeake Foundation, views food service as an occupation that provides pervasive, reliable work in our society and shows promise as an area of productive employment for these young trainees. The program's goal is to get young ryeople past minimum wage jobs and into positions where they can find job satisfaction and real potential for advancement. Youth are referred to the Diner as a condition of probation; criteria for exclusion are drug use, a recent violent offense, instability at home or in placement, and inability to understand or accept work responsibility. The 6-month program provides training and work experience in dishwashing, cooking, food preparation, food serving, delivery, and on-and off-site catering. Participants must earn raises and promotions by demonstrating responsibility and discipline and must try to get their GED. Employability and job readiness skills (finding a job, interviewing techniques, expectations of employment) are emphasized as well, to acclimate trainees to the professional world. The program provides job placement assistance and after-care support services to help graduates maintain their jobs. The Diner caters private parties and serves breakfast and lunch; it is close to breaking even financially.

Volunteer mentors can help these vulnerable youth to develop self-esteem and self-confidence-and, often for the first time, to see themselves as having happy, successful futures. The matches, made by BB/BSA's more than 500 affiliates, are based on common interests, compatibility, and the child's specific needs. Each screened volunteer commits to spend several hours weekly with the child. Professional caseworkers supervise and support the matches, working with the volunteer, child, and parent to set goals, help with problems, and ensure that regular contacts are maintained among these parties. Children who can benefit from these mentor relationships are from all ethnic and economic backgrounds, with more than half of current youth participants coming from families living below the poverty level. Increasing numbers of parents have confidence in BB/BSA mentors not as substitute parents, but as allies to help children through the challenges of childhood and adolescence. Some single parents, busy with work, maintaining a household, and raising several children, may not have the time and energy to meet every child's needs. A Big Brother or Big Sister can provide important friendship and support for children in these families. In addition to One-to-One matches, BB/BSA offers programs for foster care children, the disabled, school dropouts, and others with special needs. Special intervention programs at many agencies address the problems of drug abuse, teen pregnancy, and juvenile delinquency . For more information contact: Lynda A.

They provide positive role models for extremely at-risk youth and try to help these teenagers cope with such issues as adverse home environments, peer pressure, school problems, self\u00ad esteem development, options for the future, and decisions regarding drugs, alcohol, and sexual activity. Officers are matched with teenagers for at least 1 year, during which they share group activities and one-on-one meetings that might include riding in a squad car, visiting the police station, and even training a police dog. Police volunteers are recruited through orientation sessions and agency presentations for law enforcement organizations and are carefully screened and trained in the Big Brothers/Big Sisters system. The program identifies youth participants through recommendations from juvenile court, schools, a community-based Case Assessment Resource Team, and the New Jersey Division of Youth and Family Services. These youth exhibit problem behaviors or characteristics such as truancy, legal trouble, dysfunctional families, physical or sexual abuse, out-of-home placement, and school concerns that have caused them to be classified as neurologically/perceptually impaired or emotionally disturbed. Among the most seriously challenged of at-risk youth, these teenagers would not be matchable in the regular Big Brothers/Big Sisters program. Evaluations completed by parents, volunteers, and youth-and anecdotal information from caseworkers-indicate reductions in delinquency and court involvement and improvement in school attendance, behavior, and grades.

Before being matched, students participate in a 10-week peer support group activity that focuses on improving self-esteem and self-awareness as participants work to identify future choices. The project is currently based within two Catholic high schools in New York City, but students who do not attend the two target high schools are accepted on a limited case-by-case basis. In order to be considered for the program, students must exhibit motivation for program participation, the ability to form a committed relationship with an adult mentor, and a sense of vision for the future. A degree of independence is helpful, because students are encouraged to travel to meet with their mentors. Mentors must be at least 18 years of age, must have completed high school, and must either be working full time, attending school, or working and attending school. Both mentors and students and their families are interviewed and screened by agency social workers to determine their suitability for program participation.

Student peer support groups are also facilitated by CBB social work staff.

New Entrepreneurs (Camden, New Jersey) Program Type: Target Population: Project Startup Date: Annual Budget: Sources of Funding: Job training; technical assistance Urban youth ages 14-21 1985 $500,000-$1 ,000,000 Fee for service (contract funding) Program Objectives/Description: \"If you can't fmd a job, then MAKE a job!\" This is the motto of EDTEC's New Entrepreneurs Program, which helps urban teenagers to become business owners. EDTEC disseminates this successful program to communities nationwide through training seminars and conferences. The New Entrepreneurs curriculum involves skills training, mentorships, and business start\u00ad up. The program teaches 14-and 15-year-olds to identify economic opportunities in their own neighborhoods and start a business. These microenterprises provide home repair, babysitting, car cleaning, and other services that enable young entrepreneurs to make money by identifying and fIlling a need in their own community. In a two-week classroom program in summer, teenagers are assisted by local attorneys, accountants, and other professionals in selecting a business. Mter a week of intensive training in their chosen fields, participants receive $50 to $100 of startup capital to launch their businesses. As they work and learn, participants use workbooks which take them through the steps of creating a small business. Along the way, they gain exposure to economic values, alternative employment options, constructive hustling, responsibility without preaching, and legal ways of making money. The New Entrepreneurs Program is one of several programs developed by EDTEC, a for\u00ad profit organization. With a I5-year track record of innovative economic development, EDTEC provides technical assistance and training infonnation to numerous entrepreneurship programs and community groups across the country.

In 11 sites across the United States, mentors 55 and older are helping vulnerable youth become productive members of society. With time, skills, and a lifetime of experience to share, elder mentors are viewed by Linking Lifetimes as a valuable resource for youth in need. Elder mentors can help young people learn important life skills, set and achieve specific goals, gain a broader life perspective, and improve self-esteem. Reciprocally, young people can give elders a chance to share their knowledge and experience, remain productive, expand their social networks, and have fun. Linking Lifetimes grew out of a recognition that changes in family structure, neighborhoods, work, and public institutions have made it difficult for young people to count on caring and consistent adult relationships that are critical for healthy growth and development. As neither parents nor professionals, elders have the flexibility to provide ongoing support and establish genuine, mutually beneficial relationships with young persons. Elder mentors receive both preservice and inservice training in effective strategies for helping young people develop social competency and life-coping skills. They spend a minimum of 2 hours a week in face-to-face contact with their partners for at least 1 year and participate in monthly support group meetings. They receive stipends or are reimbursed for expenses. Evaluation has shown that students in the mentoring program improVed on some measures of happiness or well-being, attitudes toward elders, and attitudes toward school.
