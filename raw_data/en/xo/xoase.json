The SOP aims to educate readers (medical professionals) on how to best use medical oxygen when caring for patients with medical emergencies and elective case management as well as to encourage best practice in the use of oxygen . The document holistically aims to raise the awareness level of healthcare workers for adherence to rational use of O xygen and for adopting fire safety measures in health facilities . Most living things need oxygen to survive and oxygen's importance in the field of healthcare cannot be underestimated. Oxygen was known to be the only element that supports respiration as early as 1800 and was first used in the medical fie ld in 1810. However, it took about 150 years for the gas to be used throughout medicine. In the early to mid -20th century , oxygen therapy became rational and scientific, and today modern medicine c annot be practiced without the support of oxygen [2, 7]. Oxygen is an essential medicine that is used to treat hypoxaemia at all levels of the health care system. With applications from resuscitation to inhalation therapy , it is required for surgery, acute respiratory illnesses such as severe pneumonia, chronic pulmonary diseases, emergencies and cardiovascular diseases, among others. Many patients require oxygen ; however, it is not available, especially in low -resource settings. Reliable access to quality assured medical oxygen can mean the di fference between life and death for patients. Therefore, an enabling environment is required to streamline efforts to ensure that patients receive oxygen therapy when needed . These efforts would include safeguard ing the quality of oxygen from manufacturer to patient, ensur ing its appropriate administration to patient, and drastically improv ing the screening of hypoxemic patients [2,7]. Through a strategic collaboration to increase access to and utilization of oxygen therapy systems, CHAI and GoMP , with sup port from the B MGF - PATH , developed the present guid elines , which includes overview of the oxygen supply & delivery systems, pulse oximetry and medical oxygen therapy. It also includes guideline s to address the vulnerability of hospitals to fires. This document is in adherence with WHO -UNICEF 's Technical Specification and Guidance for Oxygen Therapy Devices and WHO -Pan American Health Organization's Hospital Fire Prevention and Evacuation Guide . The purpose of this document is to increase awareness about rational use of medical oxygen and hospital fire -safety measures , especially in low - and middle -income countries . This document is intended to be used by clinical staff, administrators, planners, managers, procurement officers, and biomedical engineers and technicians. Through information that is disseminated, the goal is to support hospitals in Madhya Pradesh to raise awareness o n oxygen therapy and hospital fire safety measures , as well as the im portance of appropriate selection, procurement, maintenance of oxygen therapy and hospital fire safety - related equipment and consumables. The present publication has eight chapters. The first chapter describes the need for oxygen in respiratory care . The second chapter gives the overview of medical oxygen supply systems required across different health facilities. The third chapter describes the oxygen delivery systems which includes different oxygen sources (cylinders, concentrators, PSA plants, and LM O tanks), oxygen regulation, conditioning and monitoring devices (flowmeters, humidifiers, and analysers), and oxygen delivery devices (nasal cannula, nasal catheter, and venturi masks). The fourth ___________________________________________________________________________ 18 chapter discusses pulse oximetry and illustrates the compa rison of different types of pulse oximeters (fingertip, handheld and tabletop). The fifth chapter talks about medical oxygen therapy including commencement, monitoring, weaning and discontinuation. The sixth chapter provides the summary of the oxygen thera py. The seventh & the eight chapter discuss the principles of electrical safety and fire-safety such as prevention, suppression, evacuation, training and evacuation drills. This document provides the foundational principles for engaging stakeholders in medical oxygen (supply, distribution, administration, and equipment maintenance ) and hospital fire -safety . Moreover, it reinforces the commitment of the Government of Madhya Pradesh (GoMP) towards providing systematic and coordinated improvement s in supply of life-saving commodities, in this case, medical oxygen, to patients. Finally, t he successful implementation of the guideline s on medical oxygen use and hospital fire -safety will require sustained involvement of and input s from all stakeholders. Henceforth, all the stakeholders are urged to study the guideline s carefully and identify how they can contribute to achieving its aims and objectives. ___________________________________________________________________________ 19 ___________________________________ __ PART A: Medical O xygen Use Guideline s ___________________________________________________________________________ 20 ___________________________________________________________________________ 21 1. Introduction 1.1 Background Oxygen is a life -saving therapeutic medical gas used for the management of hypoxaemia - an abnormally low level of oxygen in the blood that is caused by disease, trauma or other health conditions. In June 2017, the World Health Organization (WHO) included oxygen on the WHO Model list of essential medicines (EML) beyond use during anaesthesia, due to its proven life- saving properties, safety and cost -effectiveness. Oxygen is an essential element of basic emergency care and is required for anaesthesia, surge ry and the treatment of several respiratory diseases, both chronic and acute. For adults and children alike, oxygen is an essential and cross - cutting resource for health delivery systems. Apart from oxygen, there are other medical gases that are used in he althcare settings (Table 1.1). Table 1.1: Various types of medical gases and their uses [1] Medical gas Use Oxygen In treatment or prevention of hypoxemia or hypoxia Nitrogen For h ypoxic challenge testing Nitrous oxide For analgesia and anaesthesia Carbon dioxide In laparoscopy, cryotherapy, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy or respiratory stimulation Helium In treatment of upper airway obstruction or increased airway resistance Medical air To reduce the risk of hyperoxia during anaesthesia Of the respiratory diseases treated with oxygen, lower respiratory tract infections, defined as pneumonia or bronchiolitis, are a leading cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide, causing an estimated 2.38 million deaths in people of all ages in 2016. In children under 5 years, pneumonia is the single largest infectious cause of death worldwide, killing around 880 ,000 children in 2016. About 13% of children hospitalized for pneumonia have hypoxaemia, which increases the risk of death by up to five times. It is estimated that every year about 1.5 million children admitted with severe pneumonia need oxygen treatment. Childhood deaths from pneumonia are largely preventable, making pneumonia -related deaths a profound ine quity affecting the poorest populations around the globe [2]. In 2015 alone, there were a total of 1,29,643 under -5 child deaths in Madhya Pradesh and pneumonia was the leading cau se in 14.2% of the deaths [ 27]. In 2019, Government of India launched SAAN S campaign and the National guidelines for comprehensive management of childhood pneumonia. The same guidelines were launched in Madhya Pradesh in February 2021. Pulse oximetry is recommended in each case for early detection of hypoxemia (S pO 2 is less than 90%) and for promoting evidence -based treatment. Oxygen therapy is recommended in cases of low S pO 2 reading or clinical symptoms of hypoxemia such as wheezing, slow heart rate, stridor etc. Having the ability to properly detect and diagnose hypoxaemia and having a reliable supply of oxygen to treat hypoxaemia are crucial elements of ending preventable deaths among adults and children globally. Achieving this requires a holistic and integrated system of technologies and measures in place that include everything from the oxygen source (either produced locally at a health facility or delivered and stored) , devices (for flow regulation and conditioning ), consumables (for oxygen delivery to the pat ient), to clinical guidance (related to oxygen therapy systems ). ___________________________________________________________________________ 22 Moreover, o n 11th March 2020, WHO declared Coronavirus Disease (COVID -19) outbreak as a pandemic and reiterated the call for countries to take immediate actions and scale up response to tre at, detect and reduce transmission to save people's lives. COVID -19 is an acute respiratory tract disease caused by infection with SARS -CoV-2 virus that results primarily in single organ dysfunction including hypoxic respiratory failure and, in the most se vere form, Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Published reports on COVID spread suggest that approximately 20% of confirmed cases require hospitalization, including 15% with severe disease (RR>30, SpO 2 <93%) and 5% with critical illness (requiring ICU admission), almost all of whom require oxygen therapy [ 26]. In the absence of a proven treatment protocol, the combination of therapeutic medical oxygen and supportive respiratory care is a critical lifesaving intervention. In addition, several studie s have shown that improving oxygen systems can improve clinical outcomes for children suffering from severe pneumonia and other respiratory diseases. Because of this broad applicability and requirement of Oxygen across different wards and specialties in ho spitals, CHAI has partner ed with Directorate of Health Services , GoMP to help strengthen the oxygen delivery systems across healthcare providers in Madhya Pradesh. This publication is one element of this collaborative effort. 1.2 Purpose of the SOP This manual provides the foundational principles for engaging stakeholders in oxygen supply, distribution, administration, equipment maintenance and rational use of oxygen . Moreover, it reinforces the commitment of the Government of Madhya Pradesh (GoMP) towards providing systematic and coordinated improvements in supply of life -saving commodities, in this case, medical oxygen, to patients. Furthermore, this manual provides guideline s SOP on prevention, suppression and evacuation during fire outbreaks in hospitals while throwing light on the trainings that may be necessary to best handle the dire situation. 1.3 Target Audience The SOP is intended to support health facility administrators, clinical decision -makers, procurement officers, planning officers, biomedical engineers, infrastructure engineers and policymakers in the State to select, procure, use and maintain appropriate oxygen therapy system equipment . This document may also be of interest to health care workers, academics/researchers, development agencies, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), device manufacturers, regulators and others involved in planning oxygen systems in L MIC s. 1.4 Implementation of the SOP Copies of the SOP will be sent to all the Chief Medical and Health Officers (CMHOs), Civil Surgeons (CSs), Block Medical Officers (BMOs), Medical Officers (MOs), and nursing heads at all the District Hospitals (DHs), C ivil hospitals (CHs), Community Health Centres (CHCs) and Primary Health Centres (PHCs) , as well as to leads in Directorate of Medical E ducation (DME) medical and nursing colleges in the State of MP . The SOP shall also be disseminated to all registered Pri vate Hospitals and Nursing Homes. Local oxygen and fire -safety champions will be identified to review local oxygen and fire safety practices and arrange staff educatio n. Lectures, teaching material and example documentation will be made available through the DHS website. Local oxygen champions shall ensure monitoring of oxygen prescription and use as well as be instrumental in the initial implementation of this SOP . ___________________________________________________________________________ 23 2. Overview of Medical Oxygen Supply System Medical oxygen is requir ed across many levels of the health system for various medical units and services ranging from primary health care, general wards , trauma management and emergency transport, to delivery rooms, operating theatres, intensive care units (ICUs) and specialized hospital and outpatient units (Table. 2.1). The oxygen systems required to meet needs at these different levels of the health system are varied [2]. Table 2.1: Medical units at various levels of the health system where oxygen & pulse oximetry is needed [2] Primary level Secondary level Tertiary level Home, Sub Centres, Primary Healthcare Centres (PHCs), Community Health Centres (CHCs) Civil Hospitals (CHs) District Hospitals (DHs), Medical Colleges General ward Labour unit Neonatal resuscitation corner Emergency triage Referral t ransport Emergency triage Labour and delivery room Neonatal care Paediatric and/or adult ward ICU Operating theatre Emergency triage Labour and delivery room ICU (neonatal, paediatric, adult) Paediatric and adult wards Surgery and recovery wards Cardiopulmonary ward Emergency ward First and foremost, oxygen systems must consist of an oxygen source, i.e. , equipment for oxygen production or oxygen storage. Common sources of oxygen are compressed gas cylinders, oxygen concentrators, PSA plants and liquid oxygen in bulk storage tanks. The appropriate choice of oxygen source is multifactorial; it is importan t to take into consideration the amount of oxygen needed at the health facility, available infrastructure, cost, capacity and supply chain for local production of medicinal gases, reliability of electricity, access to maintenance services and spare parts, etc. In addition to the oxygen source, many other oxygen system components are required to deliver oxygen to patients who need it ( Table 2.2). This includes mechanisms for oxygen distribution, apparatuses to control pressure, flow, humidity and concentra tion, and devices for delivering oxygen to patients. Pulse oximetry is also required for measuring a patient's oxygen saturation level (SpO 2) to detect hypoxaemia, and for monitoring their oxygen status while receiving oxygen therapy. For those devices tha t are electrically powered, devices are needed to protect equipment from poor -quality mains electricity or provide continuity of power during mains power interruptions. Underpinning all of this is the need for maintenance, which, in addition to available expertise, requires tools to test the functionality of the oxygen therapy equipment as well as spare parts to keep it functioning (Table. 2.2) [2]. A complete oxygen system consists of elements from all categories shown in Table 2.2; however, not all produ cts in each category are always necessary or appropriate in different contexts. As depicted in Table 2.3, the selection of many of these products depends on both the oxygen source used and the level of the health system where they are to be used. Table 2 .3 is a general guide to demonstrate how the components of oxygen systems can vary according to oxygen source and health system level. Depending on local capacity, this may not be representative of all settings. ___________________________________________________________________________ 24 Table 2.3: Devices required as part of a complete oxygen system, according to type of oxygen source (vertical) and level of the health system (horizontal) [2] Oxygen sources Concentrators Cylinders (stand alone or with manifold) LMO tank and PSA plant Devices for distribution Primary level Tubing Tubing (May not be suitable as primary level oxygen source) * Secondary level and above (includes all primary level devices, plus...)

Oxygen Delivery Systems 3.1 Overview of Different Oxygen Sources Oxygen therapy, or supplemental oxygen, is the use of medical oxygen as a medicine in health care. Medical oxygen is oxygen that is (as a minimum) 82% pure oxygen and free from any contamination, generated by an oil -free compressor. The four most common sources of medical oxygen in health care facilities are: compressed gas cyli nders, oxygen concentrators , bulk-stored liquid oxygen ) (Figure 3.1) .

These cylinders are filled at a gas manufacturing plant, either via a cryogenic distillation /ASUs or a process known as pressure swing adsorption (PSA) or by a LMO -based refiller and transported to health facilities to be connected to manifold systems (groups of cylinders linked in parallel) that are piped to areas of the health facility; or cylinders can be used directly within pat ient areas. The use of cylinders typically involves transport to and from the bulk supply depot for regular A B D ___________________________________________________________________________ 28 refilling, which could have logistical challenges and ongoing cost implications, often leading to unreliable supply in many settings. While less com mon, cylinders can also be filled by a PSA oxygen plant that is co -located with a health facility and that has a high -pressure compressor for cylinder filling purposes.

No. Colour code Medical gas 1 White shoulder and black body Medical oxygen (O 2) 2 Blue shoulder and blue body Nitrous oxide (N 2O) 5 Black shoulder and grey body Nitrogen (N 2) Only cylinders dedicated to medical grade oxygen are to be used. Figure 3.3: Colour codes of medical gas cylinders Cylinders (see Table 3.1) do not require electricity, but they do require several accessories and fittings to deliver oxygen, such as pressure gauges, regulators, flowmeters, and, in some cases, humidifiers. Cylinders also r equire periodic maintenance, commonly provided by gas suppliers at the point of refilling [2, 5]. Please see the colour codes of medical gas cylinders in Table 3.2. Moreover, user care and preventative maintenanc e and troubleshooting recommendations for oxygen cylinders can be found in Table 3. 3 and 3. 4, respectively. When installing an oxygen cylinder: Ensure the quality of the oxygen is assured, either by supplier quality certificate, PSA plant logbook or onsite analyser testing. Oxygen cylinders should be prepared for use and set up in a secure position; vigilance by the operator during preparation is of critical importance. Tighten all the connections (between the cylinder and the regulator and between the regulator and the flowmeter), so that oxygen does not leak out. Before assembling regulators and fittings, it is extremely important to ensure th ere are no particles of dirt in the cylinder outlet. Use clean compressed air or nitrogen to blow out any loose particles of dirt from the valve sockets. Where clean compressed air or nitrogen is not available, particles of dirt and residual moisture can be removed by quickly opening and immediately closing the valve (otherwise known as \"snifting\"). No one should attempt to connect a regulator and/or acces sory equipment using improvised hook -ups or adapters. Neither should plastic tape be used on a regulator. When using an oxygen cylinder : All gas cylinders should be equipped with a functioning gas regulator while in use and a valve opening key should be kept nearby for timely opening/closing of the valve. ___________________________________________________________________________ 29 Check the contents gauge on the cylinder before starting to be sure there is enough gas available. Open the regulator and check the amount of oxygen in the cylinder on the pressure gauge. If the needle is in the red zone, the cylinder is nearly empty and s hould not be used. Valve protection caps are required on all cylinders that are threaded to accommodate a cap unless the cylinder valve is connected for use to a regulator or manifold. When personnel have finished using a compressed gas cylinder, the cyl inder valve should be closed and the pressure in the regulator and associated equipment released. Safety considerations during general handling of a cylinder: Personal protective equipment, such as eye and hand protection, should be worn when handling ox ygen cylinders. All compressed medical oxygen gas cylinders (regardless of size) should be secured to racks, walls, work benches or hand trolleys by a strong chain or strap, capable of preventing the cylinder from falling or being knocked over. Cylinder should be s ecure ly placed in a cylinder trolley in an upright position by the patient bedside to prevent it from accidental falling . Note that small cylinders, when used for patient transport, may be laid flat, but still need to be firmly secured. Do not drop cylinders or allow sharp impacts on cylinders. Cover the top of the oxygen cylinder with the cap when it is not in use or when being transported for delivery. Set up the cylinder for patient use a safe distance from the patient. After connecting th e appropriate equipment, turn the flow control off; carefully open the main valve, then turn up the flow slowly to the desired rate. Do not place the cylinder on a patient's bed. Before moving cylinders, they must be disconnected from any regulators or m anifolds, applying any protective valve caps before the cylinders are released. Cylinders should be moved only on a hand truck or other cart designed for handling gas cylinders. No more than one cylinder should be handled at a time except on carts design ed to transport more than one cylinder. All medical gas cylinders should be clearly labelled to identify the contents. A cylinder without a readable product label should not be used and should be returned to the supplier. All defective gas cylinders or e quipment should be reported immediately to the supplier for correction or replacement. Storage of a cylinder: Always physically separate full and empty medical gas cylinders. Ambulatory organizations can do this by using separate racks, physical barriers or by colour coding the storage rack. Label the cylinders clearly (open/empty or full/unopened), to avoid conf usion and delay selecting between full, partial, and empty cylinders. Store in well -ventilated, clean, dry conditions, not exposed to extremes of heat or cold. Protect cylinder and all other fittings from contamination by oil and grease. Never use a sin gle-use and/or re -use an industrial gas cylinder for refilling medical oxygen. ___________________________________________________________________________ 30 Fire safety considerations during cylinder use: Ensure appropriate fire extinguishers are kept nearby and are regularly inspected. Keep oxygen cylinders at least several metr es from a heat source, open flames, electrical devices, or other possible sources of ignition. Put a \"no smoking\" sign near oxygen sources in the hospital. Check that all nearby electrical circuit breakers and devices are in safe working condition and fr ee from sparking to prevent a serious fire occurrence. When and how to change a cylinder: When to change a cylinder Check your pressure gauge on the regulator unit (Figure 3. 4) (or control panel in case of jumbo cylinder s connected to manifold) often to make sure you do not run out of oxygen. Please be aware that some manifold systems may have a sound based -alarm system to alert low supply of oxygen in the cylinder. Always check the gauge (or control panel) when the valve is turned on. When the needle gets closer to 0 on the gauge (or the pressure reading is low on control panel) , it is time to change the cylinder. Be sure to change the cylinder before the needle gets below 56 psi (4 bar ). If the pressure gauge is broken, please note the weight of an empty and a full cylinder. Regularly note the weight of a cylinder to ensure it is empty before changing it. How to change a cylinder Turn off the oxygen flow. o Using the cylinder wrench (spanner/key), turn the cylinder on/off valve clockwise to close it. o Bleed off the pressure in the valve by opening the flow regulator knob. o When the gauge reads zero on the regulator , turn the flow regulator knob to zero. Change the cylinder. o Remov e the regulator unit (including pressure gauge and flowmeter) from the empty cylinder and a ttach it to a filled cylinder. Turn on the oxygen flow. o Place the cylinder wrench on the cylinder's on/off valve, located at the top of the cylinder. o Open the valve by turning it anti clockwise one full turn. As the valve opens, the gauge on the regulator will show the amount of pressure in the cylinder. Pressure in a full cylinder will read about 1680 -2100 psi (120-150 bar). o Adjust the flow knob on the regulator until the gauge reaches the flow rate your doctor prescribed. Oxygen cylinders should have a labelling tag stating its status - Full or Empty or In -use. Moreover, the \"date of service\" should also be mentioned on the cylinder. Ideally, the cylin ders should be periodically checked once every 5 years and the \"date of test\" should be stamped on the cylinders. ___________________________________________________________________________ 31 Figure 3.4: Regulator unit for oxygen cylinder comprising of pressure gauge, regulator knob and flowmeter Table 3. 3: User care and preventive maintenance recommendations for oxygen cylinders (and associated accessories) [2] Scheduled period Activities Check Daily Cleaning Ensure delivery tubes and masks are decontaminated.

Utilizing PSA technology, an oxygen concentrator draws in air from the environment, extracts the nitrogen, and can produce a continuous s ource of 9 5% concentrated oxygen. It processes the air through an internal filtration system (e.g. a molecular sieve [zeolite granules or membranes]), which has a large total surface area to separate N 2 from the air. It typically consists of an air compres sor, filters, dual chambers, a reservoir, and controls. The oxygen concentration is variable depending on the flow rate utilized. Oxygen concentrators are portable and can be moved between clinical areas, but they are also often set up to be stationary f ixtures in patient areas. Concentrators designed for home care or bedside use are available in models that can deliver maximum flow rates between 5 and 10 L PM. When used with a flowmeter stand for splitting flow, concentrators can provide a continuous supp ly of oxygen to two patients at the same time. The filter of a concentrator should be cleaned once every 7 days and the membrane should be replaced once every 3 years. The estimated life span of concentrators are about 7 years, and this can vary between br ands. Concentrators can provide a safe and cost -efficient source of oxygen, but they do require a source of continuous and reliable electricity and regular preventive maintenance to ensure proper functioning. They should be kept in well ventilated rooms a nd about a yard (3 feet) from the wall. It is best practice to also have cylinders as a backup supply [2, 6] . User care, preventive maintenance, and troubleshooting recommendations and technical specifications for oxygen concentrators can be found in Table 3.5, 3.6 and 3.7, respectively. Table 3. 5: User care and preventive maintenance recommendations for oxygen concentrators [2] Scheduled period Activities Check Daily Cleaning Remove any dust/dirt with damp cloth and dry it off. Ensure delivery tubes and masks are decontaminated. If humidifier bottle is used, disinfect and refill with clean water.

PSA plant (central oxygen supply system): A PSA plant is a large, onsite, central source of oxygen that is piped directly to terminal units within patient areas. Plants can generate oxygen using PSA technology ( like concentrators) . They should have an automated system to activate alarm when the pressur e is low, and the plant should be always attended by a trained and dedicated staff . The plant should be in a no smoking zone and should have the signage and smoke detector s. Plants can also be set up to refill cylinders for oxygen distribution or backup ox ygen supply; these cylinders can be connected to sub -central manifold systems at the health facility or transported to neighbouring health facilities. Manifold room should be preferably located on the ground floor and it should have easy access to delivery vehicles. Note that oxygen plants require a reliable source of power. It is best practice to also have cylinders as a backup supply.

US, United States; psi , pounds per square inch; HTM , Health Technical Memorandum; ISO , International Organization for Standardization Medical gas pipeline system (MGPS) (Figure 3. 5) is installed to provide a safe, convenient, and cost-effective system for the provision of medical gases to the clinical and nursing staff at the point -of-use. It reduces the problems associated with the use of gas cylinders such as safety, porterage, storage, and noise. Patient safety is paramount in the design, installatio n, commissioning, and operation of medical gas pipeline systems. The basic principles of safety are achieved by ensuring quantity of supply, identity of supply, continuity of supply and quality of supply. Pipeline systems supply oxygen at high pressure to equipment such as anaesthetic machines and ventilators. A key advantage of pipeline systems is that they obviate the need for handling and transporting heavy cylinders between hospital wards. The high cost of installing centralized oxygen sources with copp er pipelines and the high level of specialized maintenance required currently may make these systems of oxygen delivery unsuitable for many hospitals [2]. ___________________________________________________________________________ 36 For different central gas pipeline outlets and pipeline colour codes, and medical gas points per bed, please see Table 3. 8 and 3. 9, respectively. Please note that due to auto settings on the MGPS or manifold systems, cylinders on reaching 25% of their total oxygen capacity switch to the other cylinders that are 100% full. To avoid wastage of Oxygen, thes e cylinders that are 25% full should be disconnected from the manifold and should be used at patient bedside until empty (< 5% full). Fire detection system such as smoke or heat detector heads should be installed in the plantrooms, medical gases manifold rooms and (when internal) medical gases cylinder stores in any hospital . An automatic shutdown system, linked to local smoke detectors, can be installed. If such a system is planned, it is essential that an automatic emergency supply manifold system is sited well away from the fire -risk area and is arranged to come on -line automatically in the event of plant shutdown [29].

Liquid oxygen (LMO tanks) : Oxygen liquefies at -183\u00b0C . Facilities can be equipped with large bulk liquid oxygen tanks that are refilled periodically by a LMO tanker from a supplier. The liquid oxygen tank supplies a centrally piped system throughout the health facility by self - vaporization, meaning that a powe r supply is not required. Although currently an economical option in some locations, liquid oxygen requires high technical knowledge and large, well - ___________________________________________________________________________ 37 ventilated spaces, and can introduce risks in settings with extreme temperature and humidity. It is best pr actice to also have cylinders as a backup supply [2]. Please find below the comparison of different oxygen sources in Table 3. 10. Micro cylinders: In addition to the above l isted sources of oxygen, micro cylinders are portable cryogenic liquid cylinders w ith a capacity of 150 - 450 L. They have ergonomically placed valves for ease of access, operation, and maintenance, and can be conveniently handled by trolleys. They are ideal for \"temporary user point\" applications with built in vaporiser coils with opti on of external vaporiser (Figure 3.6). Figure 3. 6: Micro cylinders [28] 3.2 Oxygen Regulation, Conditioning, and Monitoring Devices Flowmeters: In oxygen therapy systems, flowmeters are needed to measure and control the rate of oxygen flow to a patient (see Table 3. 11 for typical flow ranges) , either from a concentrator, a high-pressure cylinder, or a terminal unit of a piped system. Concentrators have built -in flowmeters so there is no need to purchase them separately.

When using oxygen sources with varying pressures (e.g. , oxygen cylinders or terminal units), it is important that flowmeters are placed on the low -pressure side, downstream of a pressure - reducing valve. Thorpe tube flowmete r (please see Figure 3. 7), also known as a rotameter, is a ___________________________________________________________________________ 39 variable orifice flowmeter that consists of a connection to a gas source, a distal valve to control gas flow rate, an upright clear tube containing a float (which rises and falls in relation to gas flow) and an outlet port. The valve is opened and closed by turning an attached dial. This type of flowmeter must be used in a vertical position. The two other types of flowmeters are Bourdon gauge and dial/click flowmeter [2]. Table 3. 11: Typical flow ranges available and their clinical applications [2] Flow ranges Graduations Clinical application 0 - 200 mL/min or 0 - 1 L/min 20 mL/min or less 0.1 L/min or less Ultra -low flow applications; appropriate for neonatal care. 0 - 3 L/min 0.25 L/min or less Low-flow applications; appropriate for neonatal and paediatric care. 0 - 5 L/min 0.5 L/min or less Low to medium flow; appropriate for paediatric oxygen therapy. 0 - 15 L/min 1 L/min or less Versatile, for low - to high -flow applications. Flow -splitting devices: A flow -splitting device can provide an effective and efficient means of economically administering medical oxygen to multiple patients from a single source, when supply permits. Flow -splitting devices may be used with concentrators, cylinders and centraliz ed systems for both paediatric and adult patients. The two main devices for splitting oxygen flow are the flowmeter stand and the dual flowmeter. Figure 3. 7: Different regulation, conditioning & monitoring devices Oxygen humidifiers: These are medical devices that can be integrated into oxygen delivery systems to humidify supplemental oxygen. Humidification is generally not necessary when oxygen is delivered at relatively low flow rates through nasal prongs or nasal catheters. When oxygen is delivered at higher -than-standard flow rates, or when methods of oxygen delivery bypass the nose, such as when nasopharyngeal catheters are used, humidification is needed - especially when cold oxygen is delivered from a cylinder . They are mainly of two types: n on- ___________________________________________________________________________ 40 heated bubble humidifiers and heated humidifiers (Figure 3. 7). Water in the humidifiers should be replaced daily. Oxygen analysers: Oxygen analysers, also referred to as oxygen monitors, are devices that measure and dis play the concentration of oxygen in patient breathing circuits, medical gas supply lines, compressed gas cylinders and oxygen concentrators (Figure 3. 7). They are also used to check and adjust devices used to administer oxygen to patients [2]. 3.3 Oxygen Delivery Devices Devices for oxygen delivery differ in cost, efficiency of oxygen use, and ability to provide the requisite fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO 2) (i.e., the percentage or concentration of oxygen that a patient inhales). The choice of appropriate delivery device will thus depend on clinical needs and device capabilities (Figure 3.8) Nasal cannula: Nasal cannulae, also called nasal prongs, are the preferr ed method for delivering oxygen to infants and children under 5 years of age with hypoxaemia, according to the WHO. Nasal cannulae consist of plastic tubes that end in two short, tapered prongs that are placed in the nostrils. When delivering standard flow rates with this delivery method, the flow of oxygen typically does not meet the patient's full inspiratory demand so ambient air mixes with the delivered oxygen . Nasal catheter: This is a thin, flexible tube that is passed into the nose and ends with it s tip in the nasal cavity. Nasal catheters are less costly than nasal cannulae and are recommended as an alternative where nasal cannulae are not available. Nasal catheters are usually well tolerated, and they are unlikely to be dislodged. Both nasal cann ulae and nasal catheters provide an optimal balance between safety, efficacy, and efficiency. Figure 3. 8: Different delivery devices Non-invasive methods: Non-invasive methods of oxygen delivery include head boxes, face masks (simple, partial rebreathing and non -rebreathing), incubators and tents. With these methods, the FiO 2 can be determined more precisely by an oxygen analyser placed near the patient's mouth. For neonates, infants, and children, however, the use of head boxes, face masks, incubators, and tents to deliver oxygen is generally discouraged, as they are wasteful of oxygen and potentially harmful due to the risk of carbon dioxide accumulation [2]. Please see Table 3. 12 for various flow rates that are delivered by different masks. Please ensure proper decontamination of face masks and head box after use. Single -use items should be disposed as per biomedical waste management rules of 2016 [33]. ___________________________________________________________________________ 41 3.4 Primary vs S econdary vs Reserve Oxygen Supply Primary supply Shall be permanently ava ilable and shall be the main source of supply As a minimum, the primary supply should have usable quantity of product to meet expected usage between scheduled product deliveries Can be from LMO tanks, oxygen cylinders, PSA plants, concentrators (Figure 3.9) Figure 3.9: Primary vs secondary vs reserve supply Secondary supply Shall also be permanently available and shall be the source of supply in the event of primary supply failure As a minimum, the secondary supply should have usable quantity of product to meet expected usage between a request for product delivery and the delivery of the product Can be from gaseous oxygen cylinders Reserve supply It is the final source of supply and is capable of meeting the required demand in the event of failure of the primary and secondary supply As a minimum, the reserve supply should have usable quantity of product to meet critical patient care between a request for product delivery and the delivery of the product Can be from gaseous oxygen cylinders [8] Table 3.12: Types of masks and their oxygen delivery flow rates [7] S.

Keep oxygen cylinders at least several metres from a heat source, open flames, electrical devices, or oth er possible sources of ignition. Put a \"no smoking\" sign near oxygen sources in the hospital. Check that all nearby electrical circuit breakers and devices are in safe working condition and free from sparking to prevent a serious fire occurrence. In case of fire: If it is safe to move the cylinders, o close cylinder valve to stop the flow of product o move cylinders away from source of heat o if it is not safe to move the cylinders, o cool with water from a protected position. All types of fire extinguishers may be used when dealing with a fire involving medical oxygen cylinders. If the fire and rescue service attend it is vital, they are informed that medical oxygen cylinders are inside the building and where they will be located [8, 10] .

Pulse O ximetry Pulse oximetry is a simple and non -invasive method to indirectly measure the blood oxygen saturation (SpO 2) which is a measurement of the amount of oxygen attached to haemoglobin (Hb) in the blood . Pulse oximeters (see Table 4.1) are the accepted global st andard for detecting and monitoring hypoxaemia, which is an abnormally low level of oxygen in the blood. Hypoxaemia can occur with conditions primarily affecting the lungs, such as pneumonia, bronchiolitis, asthma and neonatal respiratory distress, but als o systemic illnesses such as sepsis and trauma. Pulse oximetry is also used during anaesthesia in surgery and for monitoring patient response to oxygen therapy. Together with an appropriate oxygen supply, pulse oximetry is necessary for the efficient and s afe use of oxygen. Pulse oximeters use the principle of differential light absorption to determine SpO 2. A sensor (also called a probe) is applied to an area of the body (e.g. , a finger, toe , earlobe or forehead ) and transmits different wavelengths of light from light -emitting diodes (LEDs) through the skin and into the tissue. These wavelengths are differentially absorbed by the blood's oxyhaemoglobin (HbO 2), which is red, and deoxyhaemoglobin, which is blue. A photodetector in the senso r (opposite to the LED) converts the transmitted light into electrical signals proportional to the absorbance. The pulse oximeter's microprocessor processes these signals and derives a SpO 2 reading. Although pulse oximetry is an important medical technol ogy that has existed for over 30 years, it is often not available or functional in many LICs . Challenges related to the availability of pulse oximetry include low prioritization by countries and governments regarding its utility due to competing needs and limited health care spending. Where it is available, lack of functionality is common due to inadequate procurement and maintenance systems for the replacement of probes and batteries, and for repairs. Adoption into routine clinical practice may also be a challenge for widespread use. Moreover, due to lack of pulse oximetry, the recognised evidence - based diagnosis, many go undiagnosed and untreated for hypoxemia, leading to complications and mortality. On the other hand, t he Tools for Integrated Managemen t of Childhood Illness (TIMCI) project is a global effort led by PATH to accelerate the availability, adoption, and scale -up of tools to identify severe illness and decrease mortality in children in LMICs . Among several objectives, TIMCI aims to improve ac cess to pulse oximeters as well as to accelerate the development and market entry of non -invasive multimodal devices - specifically a handheld device that expands the features of standard pulse oximeters with respiratory rate (RR) measurement - to manage severe illness at the primary care level in low resource settings [36]. A pulse oximeter can serve as either a spot -checking device or can be used for continuous monitoring: A spot check is a single SpO 2 reading that is taken in order to detect if a patient is hypoxemic and therefore qualifies for oxygen therapy. For continuous monitoring (required during surgery and intensive care ), the probe remains fixed to the patient and a continuous reading of SpO 2 is provided by the device. Continuous monitoring is required during surgery as the condition of the patient could shift rapidly, particularly under anaesthesia. When oxygen therapy is given, particularly during intensive or emergency care, a pulse oxime ter is beneficial for measuring the ongoing success of ___________________________________________________________________________ 46 the therapy and can be used as a screening or warning to predict arterial haemoglobin oxygen desaturation. In premature neonates, continuous monitoring helps avoid hyperoxaemia, which is a risk factor for retinopathy of prematurity, a developmental disorder of the retina that may result in blindness. Pulse oximetry is also essential during attempts to wean oxygen therapy to determine whether a patient can maintain SpO 2 within the target range. Because p ulse oximeters detect pulsatile blood flow, most devices will also display pulse rate. Since pulse oximeters provide a non -invasive and continuous means of monitoring SpO 2, they reduce the need for arterial puncture and laboratory blood gas analysis [2, 6]. 4.1 Types of P ulse Oximeters Please see the description and comparison of different types of pulse oximeters in Table 4.1.

Measurement and/or ongoing monitoring of pulse rate and SpO 2 to detect hypoxaemia, supporting the diagnosis of respiratory disorders. Most, but not all, will display a saturation index plethysmography waveform.

Moreover, following ongoing costs throughout the life of the device must also be considered: reusable probes (require replacement every 6 -12 months) versus singl e-use probes some reusable probes will require replacement sensor wraps or adhesives rechargeable versus single use batterie s expected life of device and replacement costs shipping and local distribution costs training costs maintenance (parts and labour) costs energy costs Pulse oximeter probes represent a significant ongoing cost. Their cables and connectors are fragile and susceptible to wear and tear, requiring frequent replacement. Both disposable (single patient) and reusable probes are available; however, the annual cost of disposable probes is likely to far exceed the cost of the instrument itself . On the other hand, disposable probes may be essential for proper fit with small involving life -threatening pathogens. Thus, when purchasing a consider the types and ongoing life cycle costs of appropriate cables and probes, and other supplies such as sensor wraps and adhesives for non -clip-on probes. There are two categories of probe sensor design: reflection sensors and transmission sensors . With reflection sensors, both the emitter and detector are on the same side. This can result in limited signal strength. With transmission sensors, the emitter and detector are on opposite sides. This is the more common design used in almost all pulse oximetry [2]. 4.3 Pulse O ximetry for Neonates Pulse oximeter probes may be attached to the finger, nose, earlobe or forehead; the skin in these areas has a much higher vascular density than other areas (e.g. chest wall). Some models may also have multisite probes (f or ear, finger or toe). If important for the desired application, make sure probes are available in adult, child, infant and/or neonatal sizes (Fig ure 4.1). Neonatal probes are often flexible bands designed for use on the forefoot, palm or wrist. Sizes for paediatrics are often based on weight ranges and are not standardized across. manufacturers. Probes should be specified and procured according to clinical needs. It is important that the probe is a good fit for the patient and well positioned, so that it is not too tight (constricting circulation) or too loose (letting in too much light or falling off altogether). Please find considerations for neonates below: Continuous monitoring of neonates on oxygen and/or receiving respiratory therapies (e. g. CPAP) is essential (when possible), particularly for premature neonates. In premature neonates, continuous monitoring helps avoid hyperoxaemia, which is a risk factor for retinopathy of prematurity. Neonatal probes are often flexible bands, or sen sors held on by a small wrap, designed for use preferably on the palm or outer fleshy aspect of the foot. Disposable probes may offer better fit with small preterm infants, but they incur high recurring costs and introduce the risk of infection if reuse d. The probe site should be repositioned every four hours, to check skin and avoid skin trauma and/ or burns [2]. ___________________________________________________________________________ 49 Figure 4.1: Different t ypes of pulse oximeter probes [2] 4.4 Technical Specifications, Maintenance and Trouble - Shooting of Pulse Oximeters Please see the technical specifications , maintenance and troubleshooting for different types of pulse oximeters in Table 4.2.

Medical Oxygen Therapy 5.1 Aims of Medical Oxygen Therapy The aim of th e guideline s is also to describe the indications and procedure for the use of oxygen therapy, and its modes of delivery. The goal of oxygen delivery is to maintain targeted SpO 2 levels in patients through the provision of supplemental oxygen in a safe and effective way which is tolerated by the patients to (Figure 5.1): Relieve hypoxaemia and maintain adequate oxygenation of tissues and vital organs, as assessed by SpO 2/SaO 2 monitoring and clinical signs Give oxygen therapy in a way which prevents excessive CO 2 accumulation - i.e., selection of the appropriate flow rate and delivery device Reduce the work of breathing Ensure adequate clearance of secretions and limit the adverse events of hypothermia and insensible water loss by use of optimal humidification (de pendent on mode of oxygen delivery) Maintain efficient and economical use of oxygen [11] Figure 5.1: Aims of medical oxygen therapy Please see Table 5.1 for the physiological effects of acute hypoxia and hyperoxia. 5.2 Basic D efinitions FiO 2: Fraction of inspired oxygen (%). PaCO 2: The partial pressure of CO 2 in arterial blood. It is used to assess the adequacy of ventilation. PaO 2: The partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood. It is used to assess the adequacy of oxygenation. SaO 2: Arteria l oxygen saturation measured from blood specimen. SpO 2: Arterial oxygen saturation measured via pulse oximetry. Heat Moisture Exchange Filter (HMEF ): They are devices that retain heat and moisture minimizing moisture loss to the patient airway. High flow: High flow systems are specific devices that deliver the patient 's entire ventilatory demand, meeting, or exceeding the patients Peak Inspiratory Flow Rate ___________________________________________________________________________ 54 (PIFR), thereby providing an accurate FiO 2. Where the total flow delivered to the patient meets or exceeds their Peak Inspiratory Flow Rate, the FiO 2 delivered to the patient will be accurate. High flow to be used in approved cases only such as when more consumption of oxygen is required. Humidification is the addition of heat and moisture to a gas. The amount of water vapour that a gas can carry increases with temperature. Hypercapnia : Increased amounts of carbon dioxide in the blood. Hypoxaemia : Low arterial oxygen tension (in the blood.) Hypoxia : Low oxygen level at the tissues. Low flow : Low flow systems are specific devices that do not provide the patient's entire ventilatory requirements, room air is entrained with the oxygen, diluting the FiO 2. Minute ventilation : The total amount of gas moving into and out of the lungs per minute. The minute ventilation (volume) is calculated by multiplying the tidal volume by the respiration rate, measured in litres per minute (LPM). Arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis: An arterial -blood gas test measures the amounts of arterial gases, such as oxygen and carbon dioxide. Peak inspiratory flow rate (PIFR): The fastest flow rate of air during inspiration, measured in litres per second. Tidal volume : The amount of gas that moves in, and out, of the lungs with each breath, measured in millilitres (6 -10 ml/kg). Ventilation - perfusion (VQ) mismatch : An imbalance between alveolar ventilation and pulmonary capillary blood flow [12].

Transient, self -correcting desaturations that have no other physiological correlates (e.g., Tachycardia, cyanosis) may not routinely require oxygen therapy in most cases. The threshold for oxygen therapy can vary with the patie nt's general state and point in the illness. There is no physiological basis for the application of low flow oxygen therapy to a patient with normal SpO 2 and increase work of breathing. The treatment of documented hypoxia/hypoxaemia as determined by SpO 2 or inadequate blood oxygen tensions (PaO 2). Achieving targeted percentage of oxygen saturation (as per normal values unless a different target range is specified on the observation chart). The treatment of an acute or emergency situation where hypoxaemia or hypoxia is suspected, and if the patient is in respiratory distress manifested by: ___________________________________________________________________________ 56 o dyspnoea, tachypnoea, bradypnoea, apnoea o pallor, lethargy use of accessory muscles: nasal flaring, intercostal or sternal recession, tracheal tug Short term therapy e.g., post anaesthetic or surgical procedure Palliative care - for comfort [6, 12] Any patient who develops or has an increase in their oxygen requirement should be medically reviewed within 30 minutes after star t of the oxygen therapy . 5.5 Initiation of O xygen Therapy 5.5.1 Commenc ing Oxygen Therapy SpO 2 is less than 92% (PaO 2 less than 80mmHg ) in patients without cyanotic heart disease SpO 2 is less than 70% (PaO 2 less than 37mmHg) in patients with cyanotic heart disease who have had cardiac surgery SpO 2 is less than 60% (PaO 2 less than 32mmHg) in patients with cyanotic heart disease who are waiting for cardiac surgery <91% in premature and new -born neonates Persistently < 90% for infants with bronchiolitis Table 5.2: Illnesses requiring oxygen therapy [7, 13] Illness type Conditions Comments Critical Cardiac arrest or resuscitation Shock, sepsis, major trauma, drowning, anaphylaxis, major pulmonary haemorrhage, status epilepticus Major head injury Carbon monoxide poisoning The initial oxygen therapy is a reservoir mask at 15 l/min pending the availability of reliable oximetry readings. For patients with spontaneous circulation and a reliable oximetry reading, it may quickly become possible to reduce the oxygen dose whilst maintaining a target saturation range of 94 -98%. If oximetry is unavailable, continue to use a reservoir mask until definitive treatment is available. Patients with COPD and other risk factors for hypercapnia who develop critical illness should have the same initial target saturations as other critically ill patients pending the results of blood gas results after which these patients may need controlled oxygen therapy with target range 88 -92% or supported non- invasive ventilation if there is severe hypoxaemia and/or hypercapnia with respiratory acidosis. Serious Acute hypoxaemia (cause not yet diag nosed) Acute asthma Pneumonia Lung cancer Deterioration of lung fibrosis or other interstitial lung disease s Pneumothorax Pleural effusions Pulmonary embolism The oxygen therapy is nasal cannulae at 2 -6 L/min (preferably) or simple face mask at 5 -10 L/min unless stated otherwise. For patients not at risk of hypercapnic respiratory failure who have saturation below 85%, tre atment should be started with a reservoir mask at 15 L/min and the recommended initial oxygen saturation target range is 94 -98%. If oximetry is not available, give oxygen as above until oximetry or blood gas results are available. Change to reservoir mask if the desired saturation range cannot be maintained with nasal ___________________________________________________________________________ 57 Acute heart failure Severe anaemia Postoperative breathlessness cannulae or simple face mask (and ensure that the patient is assessed by senior medical staff). If these patients have coexisting COPD or other risk factors for hypercapnic respiratory failure , aim at a saturation of 88 -92% pending blood gas results but adjust to 94 -98% if the PCO 2 is normal (unless there is a history of previous hypercapnic respiratory failure requiring NIV or IMV) and recheck blood gases after 30-60 min.

The recommended initial target saturation range, unless stated otherwise, is 94 -98%. If oximetry is not available, give oxygen as above until oximetry or blood gas results are available. If patients have COPD or other risk factors for hypercapnic respiratory failure, aim at a saturation of 88-92% pending blood gas results but adjust to 94 - 98% if the PCO 2 is normal (unless there is a history of respiratory failure requiring NIV or IMV) and re - check blood gases after 30 -60 min . COPD and other conditions requiring controlled or low -dose O 2 therapy COPD and other conditions causing fixed air flow obstruction (eg bronchiectasis) Exacerbation of cystic fibrosis Neuromuscular disease, neurological condition and chest wall deformity Morbid obesity Prior to availability of blood gases, use a 24% Venturi mask at 2 -3 L/min or 28% Venturi mask at 4 L/min or nasal cannulae at 1 -2 L/min and aim for an oxygen saturation of 88 -92% for patients with risk factors for hypercapnia but no prior history of respir atory acidosis. Adjust target range to 94 -98% if the PCO 2 is normal (unless there is a history of previous NIV or IMV) and recheck blood gases after 30 -60 min. COPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; IMV , invasive mechanical non -invasive 2, arterial or arteriolised carbon dioxide tension 5.5.2 Monitoring D uring the First Hour of Oxygen Therapy All patients should have their oxygen saturation observed for at least five minutes after starting oxygen therapy. If the oxygen saturation should fall below the target saturation and the patient is unstable, medical advice should be sought. If the oxygen saturation is above the target saturation range and the patient is stable, t he delivery system and oxygen flow rate should be reduced accordingly. Patients who have a target saturation of 88 -92% should have their blood gases measured within 30 - 60 min. This is to ensure that the carbon dioxide level is not rising. This recommendat ion also applies to those who are at risk of developing hypercapnic respiratory failure but who have a normal PaCO 2 on the initial blood gas measurement. Stable patients whose oxygen saturation is within their target saturation range of 94 -98% do not need repeat blood gas measurements within 30 - 60 min if there is no risk of hypercapnia and acidosis and may not need any further blood gas measurements (Figure 5.2) [7]. ___________________________________________________________________________ 58 5.5.3 Increasing Oxygen Therapy If a patient's oxygen saturation is lower than the prescribed target range, first check all aspects of the oxygen delivery system for faults or errors. If a patient's oxygen saturation is consistently lower than the prescribed target range, there should u sually be a medical review and the oxygen therapy should be increased according to an agreed written protocol. The patient should be observed for 5 min after oxygen therapy has been increased. If the oxygen saturation fails to rise following 5 - 10 min of increased oxygen therapy or if there is clinical concern following medical review, then blood gas measurements should be repeated. If the target saturation is in the 88 -92% range, blood gas measurements should be repeated at 30 - 60 min after any increase in oxygen therapy to ensure that the carbon dioxide level is not rising. Figure 5.2: Commencing and monitoring oxygen therapy 5.5.4 Lowering Oxygen Therapy Lower the oxygen dose if the target saturation is higher than the prescribed range. Lower the oxygen dose if the patient is clinically stable and the oxygen saturation has been in the upper zone of the target range for some time (usually 4 -8 h). Saturati ons should be observed for 5 min following a change of oxygen therapy or rechecked after 5 min on the lower dose of oxygen. If the target saturation is maintained, the new delivery system and flow should be continued. Repeat blood gas measurements are not required. If the patient is stable the process can be repeated, and the patient can eventually be weaned off oxygen (Figure 5.3). ___________________________________________________________________________ 59 Please see Figure 5.4 for guidance for o xygen prescription guidance for acutely hypoxaemic patients in hospital . Oxygen treatment is usually not necessary unless the SpO 2 is less than 92%. That is, do not give oxygen if the SpO 2 is 92%. Figure 5.3: Increasing and lowering oxygen therapy 5.6 Patient Assessment and Documentation Assess the airway and optimise airway position (e.g., head tilt, chin lift) as necessary Conduct and document clinical assessment including but not limited to of cardiovascular, respiratory and neurological systems at the commencement of each shift and with any change in patie nt condition Check and document oxygen equipment set up at the commencement of each shift and with any change in patient condition Hourly checks should be made for the following: o Oxygen flow rate o Patency of tubing o Humidifier settings (if being used) Hourly checks should be made and recorded on the patient observation chart for the following (unless otherwise directed by the treating medical team): o heart rate o respiratory rate o respiratory distress (descriptive assessment - i.e., use of accesso ry muscles/nasal flaring) o oxygen saturation continuous pulse oximetry is recommended for the patients who are severely unwell, and who are likely to have rapid and clinically significant drop in oxygen saturations when the oxygen therapy is disconnected. continuous pulse oximetry may not be necessary in the stable patient receiving oxygen therapy. ___________________________________________________________________________ 60 Any increase in FiO 2 must be followed by repeat blood gases in 1 hour (or sooner if conscious level deteriorates) * If pH is < 7.35 ([H+] > 45 nmol/L) with normal or low PCO 2, investigate and treat for metabolic acidosis and keep SpO 2 94- 98% Figure 5. 4: Oxygen prescription guidance for acutely hypoxaemic patients in hospital. COPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; ICU, intensive car e unit; NIV, non -invasive ventilation; oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry [7]. ___________________________________________________________________________ 61 Ensure the individual MET criteria are observed regardless of oxygen requirements. One metabolic eq uivalent (MET) is defined as the amount of oxygen consumed while sitting at rest and is equal to 3.5 ml O 2 per kg body weight x min [12]. 5.7 Weaning and D iscontinuation of Oxygen Therapy Unless clinically contraindicated, an attempt to wean oxygen therapy should be attempted at least once per shift. How to discontinue oxygen therapy for stable patients Most stable convalescent patients will eventually be stepped down to 2 l/min via nasal cannulae prior to cessation of oxygen therapy. Patients at risk of hypercapnic respiratory failure may be stepped down to 1 l/min via nasal cannulae or a 24% Venturi mask at 2 l/min as the lowest oxygen dose prior to cessation of oxygen therapy. Oxygen therapy should be stopped once a patient is clinic ally stable on low -dose oxygen and the oxygen saturation is within the desired range on two consecutive observations. Oxygen should also be stopped if the patient is on a written protocol of timed oxygen (eg, postoperatively). Oxygen saturation on room ai r should be monitored for 5 min after stopping oxygen therapy. If it remains in the desired range it should be rechecked at 1 h. If the oxygen saturation and physiological tracking is satisfactory at 1 h, the patient has safely discontinued oxygen therapy , but saturation and physiology should continue to be monitored on a regular basis according to the patient's underlying clinical condition. If the saturation falls on stopping oxygen therapy, recommence the lowest dose that maintained the patient in the t arget range and monitor for 5 min. If this restores the saturation into the target range, continue oxygen therapy at this level and attempt discontinuation of oxygen therapy again at a later date provided the patient remains clinically stable. If a patien t requires oxygen therapy to be restarted at a higher dose than before to maintain the same target saturation range, the patient should have a clinical review to establish the cause for this deterioration. Some patients may have episodic hyoxaemia (eg, aft er minor exertion) after they have safely discontinued continuous oxygen therapy. If these patients require intermittent oxygen therapy, they should have a prescription for oxygen as required (PRN) but PRN oxygen should not be routinely prescribed for thos e who have stopped continuous oxygen therapy . Cross oxygen off the drug chart when oxygen discontinued (and sign to confirm discontinuation) (Figure 5.5) [7]. 5.8 Selecting the D elivery Method A range of flow meters are available such as 0 -1 LPM, 0 -2.5 LPM, 0 -15 LPM. Also 0 -50 LPM in paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) only. Oxygen delivery method selected depends on: o age of the patient o oxygen requirements/therapeutic goals o patient tolerance to selected interface o humidification needs ___________________________________________________________________________ 62 Figure 5.5 : Weaning and discontinuation of oxygen 5.8.1 Low F low Delivery Method Low-flow systems include: Simple face mask Non re -breather face mask (mask with oxygen reservoir bag and one -way valves which aims to prevent/reduce room air entrainment) Nasal prongs (low flow) Tracheostomy mask Tracheostomy HME connector Isolette - neonates (usually for use in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit only) In most low flow systems, the flow is usually titrated (on the oxygen flow meter) and recorded in litres per minute (LPM). Some flow meters may deliver greater than the maximum flow indicated on the flow meter if the ball is set above the highest amount. Use caution when adjusting the flow meter. 5.8.2 High Flow Delivery Method High flow syste ms include (Figure 5.6) : Ventilators BiPAP /CPAP High Flow Nasal Prong (HFNP) therapy Oxygen therapy should not be delayed in the treatment of life -threatening hypoxia. ___________________________________________________________________________ 63 Figure 5.6: High flow delivery devices (a) Mechani cal ventilator. (b) BiPAP. (c) CPAP. (d) HFNC system 5.9 Humidification Oxygen therapy can be delivered using a low flow or high flow system. All high flow systems require humidification. The type of humidification device selected will depend on the oxygen delivery system in us e, and the patient's requirements. The humidifier should always be placed at a level below the patient's head. Rationale: o Cold, dry air increases heat and fluid loss o Medical gases, including air and oxygen, have a drying effect on mucous membranes resulting in airway damage. o Secretions can become thick & difficult to clear or cause airway obstruction o In some conditions e.g. , asthma, the hyperventilation of dry gases can compound bronchoconstriction. Indications: o Patients with thick co pious secretions o Non-invasive and invasive ventilation o Nasal prong flow rates of greater than 2 LPM (under 2 years of age) or 4 LPM (over 2 years of age) o Nasal prong flow rates of greater than 1 LPM in neonates o Facial mask flow rates of greater than 5 LPM o Patients with tracheostomy 5.10 Delivery M ode Simple Nasal Prongs o Nasal prongs without humidification For nasal prong oxygen without humidification a maximum flow of: 2 LPM in infants/children under 2 years of age 4 LPM for children over 2 years of age. 1 LPM for neonates Care and considerations of child with simple nasal prongs: ___________________________________________________________________________ 64 Position the nasal prongs along the patient's cheek and secure the nasal prongs on the patient's face with adhesive tape. Position the tubing over the ears and secure behind the patient's head. Ensure straps and tubing are away from the patient's neck to prevent risk of airway obstruction. Check nasal prong and tubing for patency, kinks or twists at any point in the tubing and clear or change prongs if necessary. Check nares for patency - clear with suction as required. Change the adhesive tape weekly or more frequently as required o Nasal prongs with humidification system For nasal prong oxygen with humidification a maximum flow of: 4 LPM in infants/children u nder 2 years of age 6 LPM for children over 2 years of age 10 LPM for adolescents 30kg High flow (in approved cases only) o Flow of 2 L/kg/min up to 12kg, plus 0.5 L/kg/min for each kg above 12kg (to a maximum of 50 LPM) o FiO 2 21-50% (blender must be used) o FiO 2 above 50% requires PICU review (except if patient is in NICU) Face Mask o Simple face mask o Nebuliser mask / Tracheostomy mask / Tracheostomy direct connection o Non-rebreathing face mask Considerations when using a non -rebreathing face mask: To ensure the highest concentration of oxygen is delivered to the patient the reservoir bag needs to be inflated prior to placing on the patients face. Ensure the flow rate from the wall to the mask is adequate to maintain a fully inflated reservoir bag during the whole respiratory cycle (i.e., inspiration and expiration). Non-rebreathing face mask are not designed to allow added humidification. Not routinely used outside of ED and PICU and should only be used in consultation with the medical team. Tracheostomy (Figure 5.7) Figure 5.7: Tracheostomy [32] ___________________________________________________________________________ 65 Incubator (Figure 5.8) Figure 5.8: Oxygen incubator 5.11 Important Considerations f or Oxygen Therapy Supplemental oxygen relieves hypoxaemia but does not improve ventilation or treat the underlying cause of the hypoxaemia. Monitoring of SpO 2 indicates oxygenation not ventilation. Therefore, beware the use of high FiO 2 in the presence of reduced minute ventilation. Many children in the recovery phase of acute respiratory illnesses are chara cterised by ventilation/perfusion mismatch (e.g., asthma, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia) and can be managed with SpO 2 in the low 90's as long as they are clinically improving, feeding well and don't have obvious respiratory distress. Normal SpO 2 values may be found despite rising blood carbon dioxide levels (hypercapnia). High oxygen concentrations have the potential to mask signs and symptoms of hypercapnia. Oxygen therapy should be closely monitored & assessed at regular intervals. Therapeutic procedures & handling may increase the child's oxygen consumption & lead to worsening hypoxaemia. Children with cyanotic congenital heart disease normally have SpO 2 between 60% - 90% in room air. Increasing SpO 2 > 90% with supplemental oxygen is not recommended due to risk of over circulation to the pulmonary system while adversely decreasing systemic circulation. However, in emergency situations with increasing cyanosis supplemental oxygen should be administered to maintain their normal level of SpO 2. 5.12 Potential Com plications of Oxygen Use CO 2 Narcosis - This occurs in patients who have chronic respiratory obstruction or respiratory insufficiency which results in hypercapnia (i.e., raised PaCO 2). In these patients the respiratory centre relies on hypoxaemia to maintain adequate ventilation. If these patients are given oxygen this can reduce their respiratory drive, causing respiratory depression and a further rise in PaCO 2. Pulmonary Atelectasis - Complete or partial collapse of the entire lung or area (lobe) of the lung ___________________________________________________________________________ 66 Pulmonary oxygen toxicity - High concentrations of oxygen (>60%) may damage the alveolar membrane when inhaled for more than 48 hours resulting in pathological lung changes. Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) - An alteration of the no rmal retinal vascular development, mainly affecting premature neonates (<32 -week gestation or 1250g birthweight), which can lead to visual impairment and blindness. Substernal pain -due - characterised by difficulty in breathing and pain within the chest, occurring when breathing elevated pressures of oxygen for extended periods. Monitoring of SpO 2 or SaO 2 informs of oxygenation only. Therefore, beware of the use of high FiO 2 in the presence of reduced minute ventilation. 5.13 Oxygen Safety Oxygen is not a flammable gas, but it does support combustion (rapid burning). Due to this the following rules should be followed: Do not smoke in the vicinity of oxygen equipment. Do not use aerosol sprays in the same room as the oxygen equipment. Turn off oxygen imm ediately when not in use. Oxygen is heavier than air and will pool in fabric making the material more flammable. Therefore, never leave the nasal prongs or mask under or on bed coverings or cushions whilst the oxygen is being supplied. Oxygen cylinders sh ould be secured safely to avoid injury. Do not store oxygen cylinders in hot places. Keep the oxygen equipment out of reach of children. Do not use any petroleum products or petroleum by -products e.g., petroleum jelly/Vaseline whilst using oxygen [12]. Please find below additional requirements for warnings and safety notices: \"WARNING: There is a risk of fire associated with oxygen enrichment during oxygen therapy. Do not use the oxygen concentrator or accessories near sparks or open flames.\" \"WARNING: Use only water -based lotions or salves that are oxygen -compatible before and during oxygen therapy. Never use petroleum or oil -based lotions or salves to avoid the risk of fire and burns\". \"WARNING: Do not lubricate fittings, connections, tubing, or other accessories of the oxygen concentrator to avoid the risk of fire and burns .\" \"WARNING: Use only spare parts recommended by the manufacturer to ensure proper function and to avoid the risk of fire and burns.\" \"WARNING: Oxygen makes it easier for a fire to start and spread. Do not leave the nasal cannula or mask on bed coverings or chair cushions, if the oxygen concentrator is turned on, but not in use; the oxygen will make the materials flammable. Turn the oxygen concentrator off when not in use to prevent oxygen enrichment.\" \"WARNING: Smoking during oxygen therapy is dangerous and is likely to result in facial burns or death. Do not allow smoking within the same room where the oxygen concentrator or any oxygen carrying accessories are located. If you intend to smoke, you must always turn the oxygen concentrator off, remove the cannula and leave the room where either the cannula or mask or the oxygen concentrator ___________________________________________________________________________ 67 is located. If unable to leave the room, you must wait 10 minutes after you have turned the oxygen concentrator off and thoroughly ventilate the room before smoking.\" \"No smoking\" signs wherever oxygen is used and not to allow an open flame or a cigarette anywhere within 3 m of an oxygen source. 5.14 Further Reading s More information on u se of oxygen in acute COPD , acute asthma , pneumonia heart failure , myocardial infarction and unstable coronary artery syndrome can be found in the UK BTS guideline for oxygen use in adults in healthcare and emergency settings [7]. Moreover, the use of oxygen in COVID -19 can be fo und at National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) guidelines on clinical management of severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) in suspect/confirmed novel coronavirus (nCoV) cases [ 30]. ___________________________________________________________________________ 68 ___________________________________________________________________________ 69 6. Summary of Oxygen Therapy Oxygen is a drug and hence should be prescribed, administered (rational use) and monitored by trained staff . fIn life -threatening situations, high -flow oxygen via a reservoir (non -rebreathe) bag should be given immediately, without a prescription, but subs equent documentation should take place. In all other situations, oxygen should be prescribed by a doctor, on a designated document (usually the drug chart) and signed for at each drug round by trained staff. Guidelines advocate that oxygen is prescribed with a target saturation range, initial delivery device and flow rate and is regularly reviewed by oximetry. Increasing oxygen requirement, decreasing saturation or increasing respiratory rate may herald patient deterioration and should prompt rapid medica l assessment. As oxygen requirements decrease, supplemental oxygen can be titrated downwards and eventually discontinued, but the prescription for an oxygen target range should remain active in case the patient deteriorates again. In conditions where there is risk of T2RF, Venturi masks are the delivery device of choice as constant or known oxygen concentrations are administered, regardless of flow [11,12]. Evidence and guidelines exist for case management but are not always followed by health care workers . Electronic clinical decision support algorithms (CDSAs) can help organize patient information and symptoms through digital applications and connect that information to the relevant Integrated Management of Childhood Illness guidelines. CDSAs can promote adherence to guidelines, strengthen their implementation, and help enhance health care workers' ability to accurately manage sick children. PATH, with support from Unitaid, and in partnership with the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute, is implementing a new initiative to improve accurate screening and diagnosis of illness in children under five LMICs [36]. Please find the summary points below: Oxygen therapy does not relieve breathlessness in the absence of hypoxaemia. For example, there is no clinical benefit with short burst oxygen therapy in COPD patients with breathlessness, or with the use of oxygen over room air via nasal cannulae for patients with COPD who do not have severe resting hypoxaemia. Similarly, there is no additional symptomatic benefit in the use of daily oxygen over room air via nasal cannulae for refractory breathlessness in the palliative setting. In the absence of hypoxaemia, oxygen therapy is not indicated in the treatment of acute coronary syndrome or stroke, cond itions associated with reversible ischaemia. In myocardial infarction, high concentration oxygen therapy is associated with greater infarct size, when compared with room air or titrated oxygen therapy if required to avoid hypoxaemia. In stroke, routine adm inistration of continuous or nocturnal oxygen therapy does not improve outcomes. Hypoxaemia is both a marker of risk of a poor outcome due to the severity of the underlying disease(s) that has caused hypoxaemia, and an independent risk factor of poor outcome. The clinical impact depends on the underlying cause(s), the speed of onset and severity of hypoxaemia, the age of the patient, and associated comorbidities. It has been proposed that a PaO 2 of 50mmHg (6.6 kPa) can be considered as the safe lower limit of hypoxaemia in patients with COPD, and that oxygen therapy which achieves a PaO 2 of at least 50 mmHg would prevent immediate death from hypoxaemia. ___________________________________________________________________________ 70 The potential risks due to hyperoxaemia with high concentration oxygen therapy include respiratory (incr eased PaCO 2, absorption atelectasis and direct pulmonary toxicity), cardiovascular (increased systemic vascular resistance and blood pressure, reduced coronary artery blood flow, reduced cardiac output), cerebrovascular (reduced cerebral blood flow) effect s, and increased reperfusion injury due to increased reactive oxygen species. The physiological response of an increase in PaCO 2 due to high concentration oxygen therapy has been demonstrated not only in stable and acute exacerbations of COPD, but also in severe asthma, community -acquired pneumonia and obesity hypoventilation syndrome. Proposed mechanisms for oxygen induced hypercapnia include increased ventilation perfusion mismatch due to reduced hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, reduced ventilatory dr ive, atelectasis and the Haldane effect, with the contribution of each likely to depend on the clinical situation. There is variable accuracy of pulse oximetry to predict SaO 2 in acutely ill patients, with SpO 2 measurements both over and under estimating SaO 2, with wide limits of agreement. Clinicians need to be aware of the variable accuracy of SpO 2 in the utilisation of pulse oximetry in clinical practice. Factors that might affect the accuracy of pulse oximetry include severe hypoxaemia, carboxyhaemoglo bin and methaemoglobin levels, anaemia, dark skin, low perfusion, excessive ambient light and nail polish. The use of high flow oxygen in an attempt to protect against subsequent hypoxaemia in the event of deterioration has the potential to delay the recognition of such a deterioration. This may provide a false reassurance that the patient is stable. There is likely to be no major change in vital signs or a marked decrease in SpO 2 as assessed by pulse oximetry until a potentially life -threatening situa tion has developed. At this stage there is limited opportunity to further increase the oxygen therapy while medical review and an intervention such as transfer to an HDU or ICU is undertaken. Similarly, if a patient who requires a high FiO 2 to maintain a dequate SpO 2 deteriorates there is limited capacity to increase FiO 2 to avoid life threatening hypoxaemia. For this reason, it is recommended that patients who need an FiO 2 >0.40, such as > 6 LPM via a simple face mask, to maintain an adequate SpO 2, should receive senior clinician review and may require transfer to a ward area, such as an HDU. Likewise, patients who need an FiO 2 >0.50, such as >8 LPM via a simple face mask, to maintain an adequate SpO 2, should receive ICU review as most will require ICU tra nsfer. Peripheral venous blood gas analysis is a less invasive test than an ABG, however it does not provide an accurate estimate of PaCO 2 or PaO 2. It does, however, provide rapid clinically important information to assess acutely unwell patients, includ ing pH, lactate, glucose, haemoglobin, sodium and potassium. In addition, it provides a PCO 2 which, if less than <40mmHg, essentially rules out hypercapnia. A target SpO 2 range of 88 -92% is recommended in the treatment of COPD and other conditions associ ated with chronic respiratory failure due to demonstration of: o A greater than two -fold reduction in mortality with pre -hospital oxygen therapy titrated to this target, compared with high concentration oxygen therapy in patients with an acute exacerbation of COPD. ___________________________________________________________________________ 71 o An increase in PaCO 2 with 100% oxygen therapy in patients with chronic respiratory failure due to obesity hypoventilation syndrome. A general target SpO 2 range of 92 -96% in acute medical conditions has been recommended, incorporating a lower ran ge than that recommended in the BTS guidelines (94 -98%). This lower target recognises that: o An SpO 2 of >92% is a practical lower threshold to rule out hypoxaemia, defined as an SaO 2 <90% or a PaO 2 <60mmHg (8 kPa). o There is no known risk of hypoxic tissue i njury at an SaO 2 of 90%. o Older healthy subjects have SaO 2 levels to this lower level of 90%. o Healthy subjects have a mean nadir SpO 2 of around 90% during sleep. o Subjects with sleep disordered breathing commonly tolerate SpO 2 levels between 80 and 90% fo r prolonged periods. o Adults with comorbidities tolerate SpO 2 levels between 80 and 90% during long distance travel. o Guidelines for acute coronary syndrome and heart failure recommend administration of oxygen if the SpO 2 is <93% and <90%, respectively. o In adults with coronary artery disease, anaerobic metabolism indicative of myocardial ischaemia is observed in some patients with SaO 2 between 70 and 85%, suggesting a 'safe' lower limit of oxygen saturation of 90%. o There is an evidence -base for titration of oxygen therapy to a target SpO 2 range of 93 to 95% in acute severe asthma and community -acquired pneumonia. o There is an evidence -base for the safety of oxygen therapy to a target SpO 2 range of 88 to 92% in acute exacer bations of COPD. o This recommendation is likely to reduce excessive use of high concentration oxygen therapy. o An upper level of 96% avoids the potential risks of hyperoxia and allows for patient improvement to be recognised earlier during monitoring, so t hat oxygen can be down titrated. A target SpO 2 range of 85% is recommended in patients with prior exposure to bleomycin or in paraquat poisoning is due to the demonstration of: o Potentiation of lung injury by oxygen o Lack of harm from hypoxaemia with satu rations around 85% in these clinical situations The potential advantages of nasal cannulae as an initial method of delivering oxygen therapy are: o Ability to give nebulised bronchodilator at the same time as oxygen is administered. o Oxygen can be prescrib ed by variable flows to achieve a target saturation range rather than a fixed FiO 2, although oxygenation may be maintained better with Venturi mask. o Comfort, ease of use and low cost. o Less likely to be taken off to eat or speak, and less likely to fall of f. o No risk of rebreathing of carbon dioxide. Humidified High Flow Nasal Cannulae are an alternative to standard low flow nasal cannulae or high flow masks for oxygen delivery. There are no established evidence - based recommendations to guide appropriate clinical use in adults, however currently ___________________________________________________________________________ 72 some centres recommend HFNC only in the ED, HDU or ICU. The potential benefits, demonstrated mostly from observational studies, of this delivery system include: o Greater comfort and tolerance via delivery of warmed and humidified nasal oxygen, compared with delivery via a face mask o Better titration of FiO 2 across a wider range of FiO 2s o Preservation of upper airways function, such as speech, swallowing and cough Potential disadvantages of HFNC include: o Risk of complacency if a high FiO 2 requirement is not recognised to represent life-threatening illness requiring more than correction of hypoxaemia o Role in severe exacerbations of COPD and asthma not ___________________________________________________________________________ 74 ___________________________________________________________________________ 75 7. Basics of Electrical Safety Electrical equipment if misused or poorly maintained, can be the cause of injury, death, or fire. If they are well maintained, electrical equipment can save lives, improve the quality of lives, and reduce capital expenditure. Electrical equipment and the electrical connections t hat supply power to it should always therefore be treated with care. Careful consideration should always be given to the placing of equipment. Damp conditions should be avoided, and equipment should be positioned in a dry, clean, well ventilated area on a solid, level base. Equipment should be as near as possible to the electrical supply and the use of extension leads should be discouraged. Since most fires occur with the plugs, sockets and cables supplying electrical power, this chapter mainly focuses on safe use and maintenance of these [34]. 7.1 Socket Outlets a nd Plugs A convenient and safe socket outlet should be available (Figure 7.1) . Socket outlets should be at least 2 m from a sink or wash basin. The socket outlet should be adequate for the electrical capacity for the equipment. There should be proper grounding in the sockets. Plugs should match the socket outlets [34]. Figure 7.1: Socket outlets and plugs [34] 7.2 Wiring of S ockets and Plugs The wiring of a plug is colour coded to help guard against electrical accidents. The colour codes in India as per Indian Electricity Rules are as follows : Phase (or Live) Red, Blue or Yellow This carries the electrical drive current from the supplier to the equipment. It is the most dangerous line. Only qualified staff should work with this. Neutral - Black This returns the current to the supplier. It should not be connected to Earth. Earth (or Ground) - Green OR Green with Yellow lines This is used for safety and protection. If equipment is housed in a metal case, the earth line will generally be connected to the case. The earth line in a socket is connected to a pipe or plate burie d in the ground. ___________________________________________________________________________ 76 Notes on earthing: The earthing will depend upon the type of equipment being used: o If there are only two wires in the power cable, no earth connection is required . o If the cable fitted has three conductors then equipment needs to be earth ed properly . Always make sure that the earth wire is longer than the other two so that if the cable is accidentally pulled out of the plug, the earth wire is the last wire to become disconnected [34]. 7.3 Sizes and Types of Sockets and Plugs The current rating (i.e. the amount and size of equipment they can supply) is measured in Amperes, written 'A'. The rating and size of normally found plugs and sockets are: For low power operations - 5 Amperes - small size For large power applications - 15 Amperes - large size Mains electricity comes at a specified voltage and is measured in Volts, written 'V'. The voltage in India is 220 - 240 V for single phase and 440 V for three phase operations. It also is delivered at a specific frequency, measured in Hertz, written 'Hz'. Mains electricity in India is at 50 Hz. A variety of electrical plugs are found throughout India, so an adaptor plug set is recommended. Type D is most common (Figure 7.2) , which is also known as th e Old British Plug. It has three large round pins in a triangular configuration. Figure 7.2: Type D plug and socket (left) and Type C plug and socket (right) [34] The type C European 2 -pin plug and electrical outlet is also very popular connector for common medical equipment which does not require earthing. Popularly known as the Europlug, it is used throughout continental Europe, parts of the Middle East, much of Africa, South America, central Asia, and the former Soviet republics [34]. 7.4 Mains Cables Electricity is carried to the equipment through the mains cable. Points to be aware of are: No bare metal or internal coloured wire should be visible - the plastic insulation is there for safety . Cable should not be repaired with insulating tape - water can still get inside . Long flexible leads are dangerous - leads should be as short as possible . ___________________________________________________________________________ 77 The cable, plug and socket should never be allowed to get wet water can conduct electricity [34]. 7.5 Fuses Fuses are used as protection. If the current through them is greater than their specified rating, they blow. This breaks the circuit and stops the current, making the equipment safe. Points of safety regarding fuses are: Always use the correct rating of fuse voltage V (volts) and current A (amperes) . Always use the correct size of fuse - keep the old one to check against . NEVER replace the fuse with bare wire - it will not be safe . Circuit breakers are fuses that have buttons or switches for reset - they do not normally need replacing [34]. Table 7.1: Trouble Shooting - Electrical Safety [34] Fault Possible Cause Solution Equipment is not running No power from mains socket Electrical cable fault Internal problem Check power switch is on. Replace fuse with correct voltage and current rating if blown. Check mains power is present at socket using equipment known to be working. Contact electrician for rewiring if power not present. Try cable on another piece of equipment. Contac t electrician for repair if required. Refer to biomedical technician Fuse or circuit breaker blows a second time after replacement Internal equipment fault Refer to electrician or biomedical technician Coloured or metal wire visible in cable, socket or plug Insulation damaged Remove item and refer to electrician for repair.

Fire Safety in Hospitals This section aims to address the vulnerability of hospitals to fires. All possible steps should be taken to minimize the hazard of fires in hospitals and to stress the need for evacuation. This chapter is divided into four main sections (Figure 8.1): Figure 8.1: Key c omponents of fire safety The primary aim of a hospital facility should not be to evacuate patients unless absolutely necessary. Hence, special attention should be focused on proper prevention and suppression techniques to avoid this worst -case scenario. That being said, evacuation training and preparedness is of paramount importance to avoid and/or minimize loss of life. Please see the main causes of hospital fires in Figure 8.2. One of the most critical considerations in fire safety is the prevention of fire . However, i n the event of either accidental or malicious fires, suppression e quipment needs to be readily accessible to combat these fires. Staff members of the health facility need to have working knowledge of how to use the equipment and to avoid panic. The last resort, failing the ability to completely suppress the fire, is to evacuate the facility. Moving all patients, visitors, and staff out of dangerous and/or damaged facilities as safely as possible is always the goal of an evacuation . It is important to recognize that people's attention to detail and processes will not be optimal in an evacuation scenario. To that end, understanding key principles will help staff members make good decisions during a chaotic event. Figure 8.2: Main causes of hospital fires [ 16] Fire Safety Key Components1. Prevention 2. Suppression 3. Evacuation 4. Evacuation training drills ___________________________________________________________________________ 80 In Case of Fire, Call 101 (it is toll free )! The initial steps to protect hospitals against fires are prevention and suppression. Complete evacuation of patients should be avoided unless absolutely necessary. 8.1 Prevention Fire can be prevented by using materials that are resistant to combustion or burning and avoiding materials that are highly flammable which require special care if they are to be used in a hospital . Using the right materials can limit the occurrence and magnitude of fires and also delay their spread in medical facilities. The three main ingredients that constitute a fire: heat, fuel, and oxygen (Figure 8.3). Fires can be classified into 5 types: Class A: Fires that involve ordinary combustible materials such as wood, cloth, paper, rubber, and many plastics. Class B: Fires that involve flammable liquids, combustible liquids, petroleum greases, tars, oils, oil -based paints, solvents, lacquers, alcohols, and flammable gases. Class C: Fires that involve energized electrical equipment, such as power tools, wiring, fuse boxes, appliances, TVs, computers, and electrical motors. Class D: Fires that involve combustible metals such as magnesium, potassium, titanium, zirconium, lith ium, and sodium. Class K: Fires that involve combustible cooking oils and fats used in commercial cooking equipment [16, 19, 20]. Figure 8.3: Ingredients of a fire [16] 8.2 Suppression Fire suppression is critical to circumvent/minimize damage or the loss of property and life. The ability to quickly detect and extinguish fires is a key factor in avoiding the worst -case scenario, which is evacuation of the hospital. 8.2.1 Fire Alarms Systems There are several ways in whic h fires can be detected. The traditional and obvious method of detection is a person seeing the fire and/or smelling smoke, at which point a fire alarm should be activated or a notification issued. In some cases, a designated \"runner\" relays the notificati on to others through word of mouth. In other instances, manual fire alarm pulls or manually ___________________________________________________________________________ 81 activated alarm -initiating devices are used to sound the fire alarm. Manual pull boxes should be located so that they are conspicuous, unobstructed, and accessible. A variety of smoke and heat sensors can be installed as part of a fire alarm system to detect fires that begin in low -traffic areas away from personnel/staff. These sensors should ideally trigger an automatic alert system with visible (flashing lights/s trobe lights) and audible bells or voice alerts to indicate that a fire was detected . Smoke detectors will generally detect a fire faster than heat detectors . There are three types of smoke detectors: ionized, photoelectric, and combined ionized/photoelect ric. Ionized smoke detectors are relatively inexpensive, while photoelectric detectors tend to cost more [16, 20, 21 , 22]. A fire alarm system is established to (i) enhance the safety of building occupants and (ii) to minimise damage to the property. 8.2.2 Fire Extinguishers Fire extinguishers are labelled with standard symbols and letters representing the classes of fires that they are equipped to fight. Please find the type s of fire extinguishers in Table 8.1. Adequate number of fire extinguishers should be available at key areas. They should be placed at appropriate height (4 -5 feet) from floor level for easy access. Moreover, a list of fire extinguishers with location should be displayed in prominent places. They should also be labelled with the filling date and the next due date of re -filling. How t o use fire extinguishers: The following are important considerations before you attempt to fight a fire: Make sure that everyone else is leaving the area, someone has sounded the alarm, and someone has called the fire department. Ensure that you have an unobstructed escape route at your back. Verify that the fire is small, confined, and not spreading. Table 8.1: Types of fire extinguishers [16, 23] Image Type of fire extinguisher Type of fire ABC Dry Chemical - monoammonium phosphate as an extinguishing agent Class A, B, and C fires Carbon Dioxide (CO 2) Fires caused by flammable liquid or electrical fires ___________________________________________________________________________ 82 Halon - uses a bromochlorodifluoromethane (halon 1211) as their extinguishing agent Class B and C fires but are also effective in fighting Class A fires Dry Powder - a copper -based or sodium chloride -based powder. Class D (metal) fires Class K Extinguisher - uses a wet- potassium -acetate -based, low -pH agent Class K (grease) fires Make sure that you know what is burning and that you have the appropriate type of extinguisher to fight the fire. You are knowledgeable regarding the use o f the extinguisher. Make sure that you keep your back to a clear exit and stand 2 to 3 meters (6 to 8 feet) away from the fire. Your safety is paramount; if the fire is out of control, leave the area immediately. Fire wardens (or health and safety officers) and hospital staff should be trained on how to use fire suppression devices. Regular training sessions should be undertaken as part of the medical facility's scheduled safety and evacuation simulations. The four steps in using a fire extinguisher can be remembered through a simple acronym: PASS (see Figure 8.4). 1. P - Pull the pin. 2. A - Aim the extinguisher at the base of the fire. 3. S - Squeeze the handle of the fire extinguisher. 4. S - Sweep from side -to-side at the base of the flame. ___________________________________________________________________________ 83 Figure 8.4: Using fire extinguishers - PASS [16, 23] The minimum requirement, and the least expensive option, for a firefighting system is a fire alarm system with smoke detectors and a fire suppression system with fire extinguishers. There are other fire suppression devices that can be installed in a hospit al to improve the facility's resilience to fire hazards. These include water sprinkler and mist sprinkler systems, water hose reels, and smoke extractors. However, all these systems need to resist earthquakes [16, 20, 22, 23, 24 ]. 8.3 Evacuation This is a crucial component of the aim to save lives in emergency situations in hospitals. A comprehensive evacuation plan needs to be in place that all staff members are aware of and are experienced in carrying out. This section presents the basic steps involved in the evacuation of a medical facility. It is important to note that there is no fixed methodology for evacuations; the procedure will vary for each individual health care facility. Code red alert system in hospital : Code red is an emergency code which is used to alert employee and fire -fighting team in case a fire or possibility of fire is detected within the hospital premise. Unexpected fire is considered as an emergency and code red system is used to urgently activate a set of action intended to control the fire and prevent any major mishap. The system may slightly vary from hospital to hospital, depending upon how the hospital is structured and organized. All employees are expected to know the 'Code Red' system and must adhere to the action plan and g uidelines to be followed under this system. Employees are also expected to know the location of the nearby fire -extinguisher and emergency exit route to be used for the area where they work. A new employee in the hospital must be oriented to the code red s ystem on first day of the work. Following system shall be used for Code Red. a. Code red alert activation: Code red shall be activated by any employee of the hospital who detects or is informed about unexpected fire flames, smoke, smell of smoke, unusual heat, or any other indication of fire. The fire or fire like situation could be observed in any part of the hospital, including hospital's exteriors and terrace. Code red should be activated even if it is uncertain if the situation is caused because of fir e or not. For activating code red , the designated intercom number should be called from the nearest intercom device and 'Code Red' followed by the location details shall be spoken. For example, if the fire is observed in the hospital's main kitchen, the employee should call the intercom ___________________________________________________________________________ 84 number and say, ' Code Red alert - Hospital's main kitchen'. This should be repeated thrice in clear voice so that the receiver at the other end understand s the code and location. The intercom line should be manned by a telephone operator round the clock, who has access to public announcement system. As soon as code red alert call is received, he/she immediately should use public announcement system to announce 'May I have your attention please. Code Red at ..... area'. This activates code red system in hospital. The announcem ent shall be repeated 3 times initially in clear voice and then shall be repeated intermittently after that. In-charge of central oxygen supply shall wait for instruction on whether Oxygen supply shall be closed to the area where fire is detected and do a ccording to the instruction. He/she shall be available for any further instruction . b. Code red - All clear: The fire -fighting team in -charge has the authority to declare if the situation has been tackled and is safe from fire. For this the in -charge shou ld call back intercom number and say, 'Code Red - All Clear'. On getting this information, the operator then should announce the same on public announcement system. Employee on listening 'Code Red - All Clear' can assume that the fire emergency has been ta ken care of and they can resume back to their normal work. The employees, patient, and visitors of the area where fire occurred shall be instructed, if the area can be used or not. Also, any patient or employee if injured during the incident shall immedia tely be taken to hospital's emergency for treatment. Fire exit routes: A facility should have a minimum of two fire exit/exit routes on every floor. Each of the exit routes should be clearly marked and should be located as far away from each other as possible so that if one exit route is blocked with smoke or fire, the alternate route can be used. The fire exit routes signage should illuminate (radium coated) and be clearly visible at night and during power cuts . Moreover, e vacuation maps should be posted at the hospital's main access points to clearly identify fire exit/exit routes. It is important to note that the evacuation may not necessarily involve patients and personnel exiting the building; they may be required to mov e to an upper floor [16]. Recall that evacuation procedures are undertaken only as a final resort action for the hospital. In the case of a fire, evacuation is performed once the preventative and suppression measures described earlier have failed to conta in the fire and lives are under immediate threat. Evacuation of a health care facility may be required in a range of disasters, not only in the event of fires. Some of these disasters are natural (earthquakes, floods, fires, tsunamis), manmade (explosions, biological threats, chemical threats, radiological dispersions) and technological (oil spills, gas leaks) [16, 22, 25]. Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) : A self -contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) is a device worn to provide breathable air in e nvironments with oxygen deficiency, smoke, dangerous gases, and other airborne contaminants that may be otherwise dangerous to breathe. Workers handling hazardous materials or operating in contaminated zones are typically required to wear a self -contained breathing apparatus. Only positive -pressure SCBAs are recommended for entry into atmospheres that are immediately dangerous to life and health. It is essential for modern firefighting and today's complex fire grounds . An SCBA typically consists of a facemask with a hose that connects to an air source worn by the user. The air source can be a tank of compressed air, compressed oxygen, or an oxygen -generating chemical (Figure 8.5). ___________________________________________________________________________ 85 They are of two types: Air Breathing Apparatus (Open -circuit) : It supplies the compressed air from the air cylinder to the wearer through cylinder valve, pressure reducer, pressure demand valve or demand valve. Exhaled air goes to the atmosphere through exhalation valve. Oxygen Breathing Apparatus (Closed-circuit) : It supplies the compressed oxygen from the oxygen cylinder to the wearer through cylinder valve, pressure reducer, demand valve, etc. Carbon dioxide in exhale d air is absorbed by the absorbing canister, and oxygen is re-supplied through breat hing bag. This mechanism enables for long time use. Figure 8.5: Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) 8.3.1 At the Sound of the Fire Alarm Once the fire alarm is triggered, Designated personnel to investigate the reason for the alarm and to identify the level of the threat (suppression or evacuation) Designated personnel to communicate with other hospital staff (through the hospital telephone operator or using any other means) and inform the sequence of events ( if necessary) If there is a fir e threat and the decision to evacuate is made, the designated personnel should notify the entire facility of the evacuation order using appropriate systems such as text messages, emails, loudspeakers, etc. Designated personnel should also notify external a gencies such as the fire department, police department, etc . [16, 20]. 8.3.2 Types of Evacuation Time frames for evacuation may differ depending on the nature of the threat and the amount of time that can be taken to prepare for moving patients. Specific types of evacuations can be found in Figure 8.6. The following actions may be needed when the \" prepare only \" instruction is issued: Ensure that fire exit doors are clear to allow movement of patients and equipment. Locate and secure patients' medical records and medical supplies. Ready evacuation transport equipment such as wheelchairs, blankets, and gurneys Set in motion a system to move people to designated assembly points. Await further instructions; do not evacuate unless given the authorization to do so. ___________________________________________________________________________ 86 Figure 8.6: Types of evacuations and movement during evacuation [16] Based on reports from the persons who detected and/or reported the fire situation, what type of evacuation is required should be determined : Horizontal , Vertical or Shelter in Place . See Figure 8.6 for more details. The type of movement is dependent on the type of hazard; for instance, the fire may be on the floor below or the threat may be a tsunami, in which case the evacuation sequence will be to move upward. Moreover, the e vacuation routes should be clearly establ ished, and a ll hospital staff should have working knowledge of the evacuation routes and which one to take, based on the type of evacuation and as instructed by the designated personnel [16, 20]. 8.3.3 Level of Evacuation The level of evacuation can be one of the following: Complete evacuation Partial evacuation In most emergencies, a full evacuation will not be required. Due to the complex needs and unstable condition of many hospital patients, evacuation is generally considered as a last resort. Evacuation should be ordered only when absolutely necessary and when there is an imminent or potential unmitigated threat to patient/staff safety. 8.3.4 Special Needs of Patient s It is important to identify the special needs of patients, some of whom may require additional attention: Needs of Patients with Disabilities : Patients who cannot hear or see or are under anaes thetics (unconscious) at the time of the evacuation may require special accommodations. Medical Care and Equipment Needs: Patients may require specific life support equipment (e.g., ventilators) that should accompany them when they evacuate. Specific ___________________________________________________________________________ 87 medi cations that patients need for treatment should also accompany them when they evacuate. Emotional Support Need s: Patients may require psychological support as a result of the stress of the disaster situation. 8.3.5 Patient P rioritization During Evacuation Prioritizing patients with respect to the limited physical resources available for evacuation (e.g., personnel, elevators, stairwells, transport sleds) is among the most logistically and ethically challenging tasks involved in the evacuation of a hospita l [16] . Evacuation of patients on ventilator support or critical care patients Formation of Hospital and Transport agreements o Mutual -aid agreements should be established with other appropriately staffed and resourced hospitals to transport and redistribute critically ill and injured patients from an evacuating hospital(s), and these agreements should be integrated within the framework of disaster preparedness plans. Prepare for and S imulate Critical Care Evacuation o Staffing requirement s and existing resources should be taken into both safely move patients and to provide continuous care for patients remaining in the ICU. o A detailed vertical evacuation plan using stair should be develop ed for critically ill and injured patients. o Regular simulat ion of mass critical care event which should include vertical evacuation that evaluates (1) patient movement using specialized evacuation equipment and (2) the ability to maintain e ffective respira tory and hemodynamic support while moving downstairs . Prepare for and Simulate Critical Care Transport o Pre-identify unique transport resources that are required for movement of specific populations, such as critically ill neonates, children, and technology - dependent patients, at a regional level. This information can then be used in real time to match allocated resources to patients. o Conduct detailed and realistic exercises that require ICU evacuation with local and regional ground and transport agencies. Designate a Critical Care Team Leader o A designated Critical Care Team Leader (CCTL) during an impending evacuation will provide close coordination and support of ICU evacuation preparations. Table 8.2: Patient prioritisation (from high (top) to low (bottom)) [16] 1.Patients in immediate danger 2.Ambulatory patients 3.Patients in general care units requiring transport assistance 4.Patients in ICUs 5.Patients in the operating room (It is important to note that surgical procedures that have been initiated should be completed to a point of safety before the patient is moved. In the case of immediate danger, evacuate horizontally to a safe area to compl ete the surgery to a point of safety. Operating beds are movable). 1 2 3 4 5___________________________________________________________________________ 88 o When preparing for and during an ICU evacuation, a primary role of the CCTL should be to categorize each candidate ICU patient evacuee by (1) ICU resources required and (2) skill set of transport staff required. o CCTLs and staff should receive special training, education, and practice on patie nt categorization and transport requirements. Initiate Pre -Event ICU Evacuation Plan o If pre -event hospital evacuation of critically ill patients might be required, then we suggest planning for patient evacuation or shelter in place using an Incident Comman d System should begin as early as possible . Requesting Assistance for Evacuation o CCTL should be aware of the process for requesting evacuation assistance and the resources available at a regional and national level. Ensure Adequate Power and Transport Vent ilation Equipment o Surge ventilators with flexible electrical power and oxygen requirements should be available to support patients with respiratory failure that can maintain function while either (1) sheltering in place or (2) evacuating to an outside faci lity. These ventilators should be portable, run on alternating current power with battery backup, and with the ability to run on low -flow oxygen without a high -pressure gas source. They should be safe (disconnect alarm) and relatively easy for staff to operate. Prioritizing Critical Care Patients for Evacuation o In a time -limited evacuation, less critical patients can be evacuated faster and with fewer resources per patient and, thus, may be moved first to evacuate the most patients in the fastest time. o When there is adequate time for evacuation, then more critically ill patients may be moved first and in parallel with less ill patients. o The most critically ill patients dependent on mechanical devices for life support may, in some conditions, be safely cared for with a shelter -in-place strategy if it is deemed the risk of evacuation is too high. Critical Care Patient Distribution o During ICU evacuations, CCTLs should coordinate with Hospital Incident Command and identify receiving hospitals for patient evacuati on via the usual practice of provider -to-provider communication. Preparing the Critical Care Patient for Evacuation o Standardized preparation of critically ill patients should be performed prior to hospital -to-hospital transfer, including initial stabilizat ion, diagnostic procedures, damage control procedures, and medical interventions, to address anticipated physiologic changes during transport. Sending Critical Care Patient Information with Patient o A paper (or electronic) medical record should be required to travel with the patient and should include basic patient identification, problem lists, and medications . Transporting Critical Care Patients to Receiving Hospitals o Transportation methods shoul d prioritize moving the greatest number of patients as rapidly and safely as possible to locations with adequate capacity and expertise where definitive care can be provided. o Alteration in the usual standards for modes of transport may be required . Tracking Critical Care Patients and Equipment o Both evacuating and receiving hospitals should track patients and equipment [31]. ___________________________________________________________________________ 89 8.3.6 Special hazards or concerns during fire outbreak Several types of hazards may contribute to risks to the lives of staff and patients, as well as to property risks, in a hospital fire. A health care facility's evacuation procedure will be incomplete without due care and consideration given to these impedi ments. Table 8.3: Special hazards and concerns associated with hospital fires [16] Special hazards/concerns Description Oxygen Procedures must be in place for turning off oxygen and other medical gases and equipment, which may contribute as fuel to the fire. Each operating room has a manifold to turn off medical gases. Staff should be aware of the location of this manifold and sho uld turn it off once an evacuation is ordered. Smoke/fumes Fumes and smoke pose a high risk to life safety, and the evacuation procedure should incorporate a strategy to move people away from areas where these hazards are present. Electrical equipment Unplug electrical equipment. Lighting Ensure that there is adequate emergency lighting to perform the evacuation, as the electricity is normally switched off in a fire. Emergency lighting systems with capacitors that are activated when the power is switched off are commonly used. Water Medic al equipment should be protected from water, which may damage essential machine s. Also, exposed patients will become wet and cold and possibly quite sick; consider having plastic sheetin g available to cover patients during an evacuation. 8.3.7 Evacuation transport equipment In the event of an evacuation, it is essential to have enough transportation equipment available for patients which is easily accessible at all times . This equipment may include the following: Blankets Wheelchairs Beds Stretchers 8.3.8 Evacuation o rders Often, the decision of whether to evacuate is not immediately obvious and may require input from a variety of individuals. Therefore, a facility should have a team or an individual who can quickly weigh the risks of evacuation against the risks of sheltering in place. The authority to order a partial or full evacuation of the facility generally rests with the hospital's top ad ministrator such as Civil Surgeons, BMOs, CMHOs, MOs or the designated incident commander. Please find below some of the key decisions that must be quickly made and communicated: Level of evacuation: partial, complete Type of evacuation: immediate, rap id, gradual, prepare only Elevator or stairwell use Patient prioritization Activation of pre -planned evacuation components/personnel: o Assembly point and discharge site Locations o Evacuation/operations coordinator o Staff assignments ___________________________________________________________________________ 90 o Patient destination team(s) It is imperative that the incident commander continuously assess the situation, as plans and activities may need to adapt to changes in the circumstances surrounding the evacuatio n [16]. 8.3.9 Hospital incident command system struc ture Please find below an example of the structure of incident command system in a hospital in Figure 8.7. 8.3.10 Patient tracking and medical records There should be designated \"patient tracking\" staff who are responsible for tracking and reporting on the location of patients throughout the evacuation process to provide continuous accountability. These staff members (and their roles) include the followi ng: Figure 8.7: Structure of incident command system in a hospital [16] To perform head counts at the assembly points. To check rooms and floors to ensure that they have been vacated. To addres s special hazards or concerns (e.g., turning off medical gases ). If possible, e nsure that medical records accompany patients when they evacuate the facility. Medical records are usually located on the wards with the patients. Medications and critical equip ment for patients should be taken as well. ___________________________________________________________________________ 91 Designated personnel should also a ttempt to notify family members and other responsible parties about the patient's transfer destination. They should also a nswer calls and respond to questions from family member s about the patient's welfare and location [16]. 8.3.11 Assembl y points and discharge site locations The hospital should identify several locations surrounding the building that could be used as assembly points, holding areas, and/or discharge sites. Assembly Point/ Holding Area : A place or set of places where patient care units gather (outside the main clinical buildings of the hospital) to receive basic care and await transfer or re -entry back into the hospital. Assembly points are not intended to be compreh ensive field hospitals; rather, they should be designed as holding areas where only essential care resources are available. Discharge Site : The place where patients who are being discharged home wait for family or friends to pick them up. Discharge site s should be located some distance away from assembly points to minimize traffic congestion and competition for roadways. 8.4 Evacuation T raining Drills Upon the sound of the fire alarm, it is expected that hospital staff will activate a practiced system or sequence of activities in response. Each health facility should have a unique system that has been tailored to meet its needs. An evacuation/response plan should be discussed and developed by the hospital administration and the engineering and medical teams. The plan should include regularly scheduled training for all staff [16]. 8.4.1 Training of staff General training of all staff should include, but not be limited to, the following: Training on how to lift and move patients. Training on how to use fire extinguishers. Training on what to do if they see a fire. For example, the RACE (see Figure 8.8) acronym specifies actions to be taken in a fire : o R - remove anyone endangered by the fire to a safe area o A - activate the alarm o C - close all windows and doors; contain the fire o E - evacuate Training on what to do if they hear the alarm and see the flashing lights. Specific training defines the roles and responsibilities of each staff member. For example, in the case of a fire alarm, who notifies the fire service and the rest of the hospital? [16, 23] . 8.4.2 Fire drills Fire drills are designed to ensure that, through re gular training and simulations, staff members will: Have knowledge and understanding of the fire safety plan so that they can act swiftly, safely, and in an orderly manner. ___________________________________________________________________________ 92 Be knowledgeable regarding fire protection. Frightened individuals cannot act sens ibly and intelligently, and they may do things to harm themselves or those around them. Have increased self -confidence and power to fulfil their responsibilities in the event of a fire [16, 19, 21, 24, 25]. It is important to note that all training simulations and fire drills need to be scheduled and performed regularly, and performance evaluations need to be completed and used to improve subsequent training drills. Figure 8.8: Steps to be taken in case of a fire - RACE [16] 8.5 Important Considerations f or Fire Safety Statutory Compliance - Fire NOC should be obtained. Steps on how to operate fire extinguishers (section 7.2.2.) should be translated in local language and pasted close to the fire extinguishers in bold and easily r eadable text. Fire safety officer 's designation at the facility level should be made mandatory . Periodic trainings and drills should be conducted on fire safety at least once a year and their record should be maintained. Any old electrical wirings and any loose hanging wirings should be replaced. Regular and timely audits should be conducted by fire safety officers and other experts in the field. Full evacuation of a hospital should generally be considered as a last resort when mitigation or other emerg ency response efforts are not expected to maintain a safe care environment. Safety is always the primary concern. Simplicity is key; the staff will need a simple plan to follow in an emergency. Flexibility is vital because the procedures must be adaptab le to a variety of situations. Self-sufficiency at the unit level is important because timely communication from hospital leaders may be difficult or even impossible; employees at every level must know immediately what to do in their area. It may be nece ssary to evacuate patients to holding sites before transportation resources and/or receiving destinations are available. If the medical facility cannot accommodate a horizontal safe site (a location on the same floor safe from danger), then assembly points located away from the main clinical areas should be identified and designated. Individual patient care units should stay together at the assembly points whenever possible (instead of the patients in these units being divided into separate groups ___________________________________________________________________________ 93 accordin g to their ambulatory status). This is because the unit teams familiar with their patients will be better able to manage them in a chaotic situation away from the care unit. External patient transporters should generally not be asked to come into the hosp ital to evacuate patients because of the risks, time delays, and inefficiency associated with this process when large numbers of patients are involved. Fire detection system such as smoke or heat detector heads should be installed in the plantrooms, medic al gases manifold rooms and (when internal) medical gases cylinder stores in any hospital. An automatic shutdown system, linked to local smoke detectors, can be installed. If such a system is planned, it is essential that an automatic emergency supply mani fold system is sited well away from the fire -risk area and is arranged to come on-line automatically in the event of plant shutdown. When difficult choices must be made, leaders and staff must focus on the \"greatest good for the greatest number\" [16, 17, 18]. 8.6 Potential High Fire Risk Departments Table 8.4: Potential high fire risk department S.

To convert Oxygen (gaseous) from m3 to Metric Ton (MT) Oxygen's density in gaseous form has to be taken into consideration 1 m3 of Oxygen = 1.429 kg = 1.429/1000 MT = 0.001429 MT Therefore, t o obtain the value in MT, multiply the m3 value with 0.001429 2. To convert kL (Liquid Oxygen) to MT a. Directly from Liquid Oxygen to MT 1 Litre of Liquid Oxygen = 1. 1417 kg 1 kilo Litre (kL)= 1 141.7 kg Therefore, 1 kilo Litre (kL) = 1. 1417 MT b. Liquid Oxygen to Gaseous Oxygen to MT 1 Litre of Liquid Oxygen = 875 litres (gas) 1 kL = 875 x 1000 = 8,75,000 L 1 litre 0.001 875 m3 = 875 x 1.429 = 1250.375 kg = 1.25 MT Therefore, 1 kL of liquid oxygen = 1.25 MT 3. Gas oxygen LPM to MT/day 1 LPM to 0.00 MT/day 4. 1 cu ft of Oxygen = 0.03756 kg = 0.02628 m3 5.

This calculation methodology is in-line with the prevalent government of India guidelines on clinical treatment of hypoxemia cases in COVID -19. Treatment guidelines are evolved depending upon the clinical evidence. Hence, the oxygen flowrates sh ould be updated based on the latest directives from MoHFW, India. Mild patients (No. of Oxygen supported beds occupied x 10 LPM x 60 x 24)/7000 = jumbo cylinders per day Severe patients (No. of ICU supported beds occupied x 24 LPM x 60 x 24)/7000 = jumbo cylinders per day Please note that the % of beds may vary. For instance, to calculate oxygen consumption, only 50% of oxygen supported beds may be taken into account. Please note that the flow rates that were used for mild a nd severe patients in the past were 7.14 LPM and 11.9 LPM, respectively. ___________________________________________________________________________ 99 Appendix C: Checklist for monitoring of oxygen supply system in health care facilities To ensure safe and reliable MGPSs and their efficient operation and use as per standards, responsible operational management and maintenance of following systems must be considered: Medical Oxygen System - Liquid oxygen system, manifold, and control panels Nitrous Oxide System - Manifold and control panel Medical and Surgical Air System - Compressor systems, control panel, dryers, reservoirs , filters , etc. Medical Vacuum System - Vacuum pumps, control panel, reservoir, filters , etc. Waste Anaesthetic Gas Scavenging Systems (AGSS) Carbon dioxide Manifold System Nitrogen Manifold System Copper pipelines Area Valve Service Units Isolation Valves Area Alarm panels and Master alarm panels Gas Outlets Bed Head Panels Pendants Staff responsible for plant operation should be aware of the activities necessary to ensure the continued safe operat ion of the system and what action should be taken in an emergency. The authorised person should take a lead in explaining to users the function of the system and will have to be adequately trained and informed about the system. Operator will be responsible for safe cylinder handling, storage, and transportation. Any work involving alterations, extensions or maintenance work on the system should be subject to the permit -to-work procedure as per standards. Operation of Medical Gas Manpower should be provided to operate the oxygen system 365 days in a year. The duty of the worker should be limited to 8 hours per day.

There should be safe barricading for oxygen storage plants as prescribed by the SMPV (U) rules [Static and Mobile Pressure Vessels (Unfired) rules]. There should be no unauthorized entries into the plant premises and smoking should be prohibited in its vicinity. The necessary hydro -testing to be done as pre scribed legally and certificates to be available at site. Use of Pressure Vessels of a capacity beyond one kilolitre should be with appropriate license issued by the authority competent (PESO). Hazards Associated with Liquid Oxygen: Exposure to cold tempe rature of the cryogenic liquid that can cause severe burns. Oxygen enrichment of the surrounding atmosphere; and the possibility of a combustion reaction if the oxygen is permitted to contact a non -compatible material. It can c ause many materials of constr uction to lose their strength and become brittle enough to shatter. It is important to note that fire chemistry starts to change when the concentration of oxygen increases. Materials easily ignited in air not only become more susceptible to ignition but al so burn with added violence / strength / vigour in the presence of Oxygen. Elevated oxygen levels can be reached very quickly, and all personnel must be aware of the hazard. Any clothing that has been splashed or soaked with liquid oxygen or exposed to hig h oxygen concentrations should be removed immediately and aired for at least an hour. Personnel should stay in a well -ventilated area and avoid any source of ignition until their clothing is completely free of any excess oxygen. Clothing saturated with oxy gen is readily ignitable and will burn vigorously. Do not permit smoking or open flames in any areas where liquid oxygen is stored or handled. Do not permit liquid oxygen or oxygen -enriched air to come in contact with organic materials or flammable or comb ustible substances of any kind. Some of the organic materials that can react violently with oxygen when ignited by a spark or even a mechanical shock are oil, grease, asphalt, kerosene, cloth, tar, and dirt that may contain oil or grease. Sanitizers (espec ially alcohol based), surgical spirit, etc. can also add fuel to fire in a hospital setting where the atmosphere is Oxygen rich. If liquid oxygen spills on asphalt or other surfaces contaminated with combustibles, do not walk on or roll equipment over the area of the spill. Keep sources of ignition away for 30 minutes after all frost or fog has disappeared. Systems used in oxygen service must meet stringent cleaning requirements to eliminate any incompatible contaminants . Storage of Liquid Oxygen: Store and use liquid containers with adequate ventilation. Do not store containers in a confined area or in an area unprotected from the extremes of weather. ___________________________________________________________________________ 102 Cryogenic containers are equipped with pressure relief devices designed to control the internal pr essure. Under normal conditions these containers will periodically vent product. Do not plug, remove or tamper with any pressure relief device. Oxygen must be separated from flammables and combustibles by at least 20 feet or a half-hour fire wall. Post \"No Smoking\" and \"No Open Flames\" signs . Handling of Liquid Oxygen: Cryogenic containers must be stored, handled and transported in the upright position. When moving, never tip, slide or roll containers on their side. Use a suitable hand truck for moving smaller containers. Move larger containers by pushing, not pulling. Avoid mechanical and thermal shocks. Never allow any unprotected part of the body to come in contact with uninsulated pipes or equipment containing cryogenic product. The extreme co ld will cause flesh to stick fast and potentially tear on withdrawal. Use only oxygen -compatible materials and lubricants. If there is any difficulty in operating the container valve or container connections, discontinue use and contact the vendor. Do not remove or interchange connections. Use only the properly assigned connections . Use only transfer lines and equipment designed for use with cryogenic liquids. Some elastomers and metals, such as carbon steel, may become brittle at extremely low temperatures and may easily fracture. These materials must be avoided in cryogenic service. It is recommended that all vents be piped to the exterior of the building. When liquid oxygen is held in any closed vessel or space, there must be an appropriate pressure relie f device because of the very large pressure increase that can occur as the liquid oxygen vaporizes. Liquid oxygen must also be handled with all the precautions required for safety with any cryogenic fluids. Keep out of reach of children. Personal Protecti ve Equipment (PPE) : Medical Oxygen handling personnel must be thoroughly familiar with properties and safety considerations before being allowed to handle liquid oxygen and its associated equipment. The eyes are the most susceptible to the extreme cold of the liquid and vapours of liquid oxygen. The recommended PPE is a full -face shield over safety goggles; clean, loose -fitting thermal -insulated or leather gloves; long -sleeved shirts; and pants without cuffs. Wear this PPE when handling or using liquid oxyg en, or whenever the possibility of exposure due to a spill exists. In addition, safety shoes are recommended for those involved with the handling of containers. In emergency situations, self -contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) must be used. Clothing that is fire resistant in air may be readily ignitable in oxygen -enriched atmospheres. Only trained and certified emergency responders should respond to emergency situations. ___________________________________________________________________________ 103 Figure D.1: PPE equipment First Aid : For skin contact with liquid oxygen, remove any clothing that may restrict circulation to the frozen area. Do not rub frozen parts, as tissue damage may result. As soon as practical, place the affected area in a warm water bath with a temperature not exceeding 105\u00b0F (40\u00b0C). Never use dry heat . Call a physician as soon as possible. Frozen tissue is painless and appears waxy with a possible yellow colour. It will become swollen, painful, and prone to infection when thawed. If the frozen part of the body has been thawed, cover the area with a dry sterile dressing with a large bulky protective covering, pending medical care. In case of massive exposure, remove clothing while showering the victim with warm water. Call a physician immediately. If the eyes are exposed to the extreme cold of the liquid or vapours, immediately warm the frostbite area with warm water not exceeding 105\u00b0F (40\u00b0C) and seek medical attention. Fire Fighting : Since oxygen is non -flammable but supports combustion, fire -fighting actions require shutting off the source of oxygen, if possible, then fighting the fire according to the material involved. Do not direct water streams toward venting oxygen. The water will freeze and plug the pressure -relief vent, which may result in container failure. Oxygen vigorously accelerates combustion. Materials that would not normally burn in air could combust vigorously in atmospheres having high concentrations of oxygen. Emergency Actions: If possible, shut off source of escaping oxygen. Evacuate area. Prevent liquid oxygen from entering sewer, basements and work -pits. Do not absorb in sawdust or any other combustible material. Keep the bulk tank, PCC (Portable Cryogenic Container) or tanker cool by spraying with water if exposed to a fire. If tanker has overturned, do not attempt to upri ght or move it. Accidental Release Measures: Personal Precautions -Clothing saturated by cold gas should be removed immediately. Clothes and other materials will burn fiercely in presence of high concentrations of oxygen. Environmental Precautions - Oxygen itself does not pose a hazard to the environment. However, because of extreme cold of the liquid, damage to ecology can occur in the immediate environs of the spill. Beware of oxygen -enriched atmospheres coming into contact with readily combustible materia ls. Small Spills - Shut off the source of escaping oxygen. Ventilate the area . ___________________________________________________________________________ 104 Large Spills - Evacuate the area. Shut off the source of the spill if this can be done without risk. Restrict access to the area until completion of the clean -up procedure. Vent ilate the area using forced draught if necessary. Exposure Controls/Personal Protection : Occupational Exposure Hazards - Avoid exposure to oxygen -enriched atmospheres, as this could result in clothing becoming saturated by oxygen. On ignition the clothing could burn fiercely resulting in serious burns. Engineering Control Measures - Engineering control measures are preferred to reduce exposure to oxygen -enriched atmospheres. General methods include forced draught ventilation, separate from other exhaust ve ntilation systems. Personal Protection - Safety goggles or glasses, plus face shield, loose -fitting insulated gloves and safety shoes, or boots. Skin Wear loose -fitting overalls preferably without pockets . Conditions to avoid - Oxygen -enriched atmospheres will react with all of the elements, excepting the rare gases, especially at elevated temperatures. These reactions could sometimes be violent, as those when high concentrations of oxygen come into contact with highly combustible materials such as oil and grease. Incompatible Materials - At the temperature of liquid oxygen, ordinary carbon steels and most alloy steels, lose their ductility and are therefore considered to be unsatisfactory. Metals and alloys that have satisfactory ductility include austenitic stainless steel (i.e. types 204 and 216), and nickel chromium alloys, nickel, Monel 400, copper, brasses, bronze and aluminium alloys. Disposal Methods : Small amounts may be allowed to evaporate into the atmosphere. In case of large spills consult an expert and allow evaporation. Large amounts should only be handled by gas supplier. Disposal of Packaging: The disposal of containers must only be handled by the gas supplier. Response Strategy: The moment liquid oxygen leaks into open air it vaporizes or becomes a dense mist. So, it cannot be contained effectively in case of a leak and the only solution is to eliminate the risk of fire and to arrest the leak by finding its source. In case of an accident which results in oxygen leak, the follow ing information is critical: The primary objective is to stop the leak at the source. For attempting to close the leak, firefighters need to approach the container. The following Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) must be used: 1. Pyro protected full body coverall/fire suits. 2. Self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) 3. Cryogenic gloves 4. Safety shoes 5. In addition, a tools box with spark proof tools, to arrest the leak Protection equipment are essential because when there is an accident, the atmosphere around the container becomes oxygen -rich due to leakage. To stop it, the valve through which leakage is occurring needs to be isolated. The atmosphere around the valve will have almost 75% oxygen, and firefighters can't stay in such environment for a long time. ___________________________________________________________________________ 105 The container should be cooled and it should not be allowed to heat up. This is because of the fact that majority of the liquid oxygen will still be inside the container. All sources of ignition from the surrounding area should be eliminated. Due to the huge amount of oxygen leak, a fire can easily lead to an explosion. There should be adequate ventilation around the container so that the leaked oxygen doesn't get accumulated anywhere (such as in drainages) because this might cause an explosion later. Firefighters must stay up -wind from the container when working on it so that the leaked oxygen poses comparatively less threat to them. In case of fire, water spray or water fog should be used to extinguish the fire and cool down the container. Water jets should not be used under any circumstances. Water spray and water fog helps in reducing the excess oxygen level in the atmosphere and thus, decrease the risk of explosion. If there is only leakage of oxygen and no fire, water spray and water fog must be u sed only to decrease the oxygen level in the atmosphere. It should not be sprayed directly on the container. If the gas leak cannot be arrested, the area in danger must be evacuated. All traffic moment in the area must be stopped to decrease the risk of a fire and explosion. Electricity to the area must be disconnected to reduce the risk of a spark and thus, an explosion. Leakage Arrester Kits are used in case of breakage of main valves. ___________________________________________________________________________ 106 Appendix E: Handling of Oxygen Cylinders [35] They are usually found in hospitals and must be handled with care. It is observed that oxygen cylinders are transported by rolling them on the ground. This procedure is wrong and compressed gas cylinders should always stay upright. Oxygen cylinders should be chained to prevent it from falling in storage areas. All gas cylinders must have caps over their valves. The valves should be capped (even if the cylinder is empty) when the cylinders are not in use to protec t it from damage which might cause leakage. The valve is the most fragile part of a cylinder. Empty cylinders should be kept separated from filled ones. Cylinders must always be kept away from combustible materials. Cylinders should be stored in well venti lated areas. Smoking should be strictly prohibited near cylinder storage areas and 'No -Smoking' signs should be clearly placed. Cylinders should be transported with care as a broken valve will result in the cylinder shooting away like a rocket, which might cause injuries or even death. Trolley should be used for manoeuvring. Proper Handling of Compressed Gas Cylinders must be known to all hospital personnel. Regular trainings are to be imparted to hospital staff. ___________________________________________________________________________ 107 Appendix F: Medical Oxygen - Basic Do's and Don'ts for rational use of Oxygen [35] Do's* (*Indicative only; Medical advice to be followed) Don'ts Target SpO 2: 92-94% Don't use HFNC with high Oxygen flow Target PaO 2: Around 60 mm Hg Don't allow leak ages from NIV mask Never exceed oxygen flow (litres per minute - LPM ) of - 14 LPM on NRBM 8 LPM on simple mask 6 LPM on nasal prongs Don't keep central oxygen pipeline connected when ventilator is not in use Titrate use of IPAP to achieve Tidal Volume of 6 -7 ml/kg only Don't keep flow meter connected when not in use Use only EPAP/CPAP for better oxygenation Don't keep ventilator SWITCHED ON when not in use Encourage awake proning for all.

By Medical Superintendent ___________________________________________________________________________ 109 Appendix H: Hazards from Oxygen enrichment [35] Fire Hazards from Oxygen Enrichment : Oxygen reacts with most elements. The initiation, speed, vigour and extent of these reactions depend in particular upon: The concentration, temperature and pressure of the reactants Ignition energy and mode of ignition. Reaction Mechanism: The mechanism of these reactions is complicated and depends, among other things, upon the nature of the substances concerned, their physical state, geometric configuration, concentration, and manner of ignition. This, too, influences the speed of reaction, which can vary from slow combustion to an explosion. Combustibility of Materials : Oxygen enrichment of the atmosphere, even by a f ew percent, considerably increases the risk of fire. Materials, which do not burn in air, including fireproofing materials, may burn vigorously or even spontaneously in enriched air. Hydrocarbon Oils and Grease : Oil and grease are particularly hazardous i n the presence of oxygen as they ignite spontaneously and burn with explosive violence. They should NEVER be used to lubricate oxygen or enriched air equipment. Special lubricants, with which oxygen can be used under certain conditions, are available. Smoking: Burning accidents, which occur, are normally triggered by the lighting of a cigarette. Therefore, it is impossible to over -emphasize the danger of smoking in oxygen -enriched atmospheres or where oxygen enrichment can occur. In such areas smoking shal l be forbidden. ___________________________________________________________________________ 110 Appendix I: Hospital fire safety inspection report [16] Hospital Fire Safety Inspection Report Hospital name, address & contact number : 1 Means of escape Yes/No Are there any fire exits?
