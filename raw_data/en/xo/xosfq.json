This meeting is the Academy's largest event of the year, and we are excited to be hosting it here at Campbell University. Please take time to listen, learn, and enjoy the wonderful research performed by our CANCAS and NCAS members. The presentations at this meeting represent the culmination of many semesters of education and research. For many, this will be their first time presenting at a state-wide meeting. As you attend the keynote and panels, consider how making connections and communicating with others furthers scientific research. Enjoy visiting the new Oscar N. Harris Student Union, and be sure to check out the convenient virtual presentation platform. This meeting contains both in-person and virtual events to allow greater flexibility for attendees. In-person attendees only need to go to assigned rooms in the program schedule and https:// ncas2022.virtualpostersession.org/ for the virtual platform to experience all the events during the meeting. Virtual attendees can experience most of the meeting by using the Zoom links in the program schedule below and the virtual platform link. All presenters can be contacted by using the \"Join the Discussion\" button on the virtual platform. The meeting's theme, Multidisciplinary Research: Focusing on the Big Questions, pays tribute to the recent achievements of scientists during the pandemic while looking forward to future research. Since the beginning of the recent global pandemic, scientists have been collaborating across disciplines to minimize its impact. Research necessarily shifted to focusing on a big question related to the pandemic: \"How can science minimize the impact of COVID-19?\" What followed were impressive examples of vaccines, tests, and exposure controls that have saved the lives of countless individuals. These approaches necessitated a multidisciplinary approach to research and problem solving. This meeting explores the multidisciplinary approach through presentations, a keynote, and panels. We hope you enjoy your time here and walk away with new connections and fresh insight for your big questions. The 2022 NCAS Local Arrangements Committee Lin Coker and Jordan Womick (Co-chairs); Michael Gallagher, Stephanie Mathews, Evan Reynolds, Timothy Shenk, Michelle Thomas, and Taek YouDear Friends: On behalf of our entire academic community, welcome to Campbell University! We are honored to host the 118th annual meeting of the North Carolina Academy of Sciences. I hope that you will find the program engaging and the accommodations comfortable while here at Campbell University. The purpose of the North Carolina Academy of Sciences annual meeting is to showcase the talents of the next generation of researchers and promote education in the sciences. Participants this year will focus on multidisciplinary research and the \"Big Questions. \" A university campus is an ideal setting for exploring new ideas and delving deeper into scientific research, so we trust that your time and involvement during the meeting will enrich your learning and encourage you in reaching your own educational and vocational goals. Campbell University has a long and well-documented commitment to the natural sciences. Since the opening of the School of Pharmacy in 1986, Biology and Chemistry have become two of the most popular undergraduate majors on campus. In our various science programs are many Pre- Medicine, Pre-Pharmacy, and other Pre-Health Sciences students. In recent years, Campbell has added a new Physician Assistant program, Physical Therapy program, Nursing program, School of Engineering, and launched a new School of Osteopathic Medicine. While you are on campus, we hope you will take the opportunity to learn more about our science majors, professional programs, and Campbell University. Thank you again for your participation at this year's North Carolina Academy of Science's annual meeting. It is an honor for Campbell University to host this important event. Sincerely, J.Bradley Creed President, Campbell University I am honored and delighted to welcome you to the 118th Annual Meeting of the North Carolina Academy of Science hosted by Campbell University. This annual event is one of North Carolina's premier scientific events dedicated to the promotion of scientific research and the fostering of education in the sciences. The annual meeting has been successfully held in different places across the State since 1902. While it's been around three years since we last convened in person, I hope you are as excited as I am to return. Building on the success of previous meetings, the theme for this year is \"Multidisciplinary Research: Focusing on the Big Questions,\" which highlights the importance of Multidisciplinary Research in helping to focus on the Big Questions. This annual conference brings together researchers, STEM faculty members and students from institutions across the state. With a brand-new Engineering session, the Conference program will be both exciting and ground-breaking in its wide ranging and multidisciplinary content. In addition to traditional and online oral/poster presentations, keynote lectures by renowned invited speakers, workshops, and exhibitors, the conference also certainly creates excellent opportunities for exchange of ideas, opinions, and the initiation or continuation of collaborative research partnerships. Thus, I encourage all of you to take advantage of every opportunity to expand your knowledge by attending a variety of sessions, networking with your fellow students, colleagues, researchers, and professionals. I would like to thank Dr. J. Bradley Creed, President of Campbell University, for allowing us the opportunity to share your beautiful campus and great facilities, and for all supporters especially local annual meeting arrangement committee who are making the 118th Annual NCAS meeting a success.
