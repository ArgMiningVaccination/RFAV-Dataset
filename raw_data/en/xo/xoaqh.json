Studies have shown that preoperative anesthesia evaluation has benefits for the patient, the anesthesiologist, the surgeons, and the hospital.1 1. For the patient : - reduce anxiety by offering personalized care/comfort - data has shown that preoperative eval uation by an anesthes iologist decreases the incidence of anxiety more effec tively than pharmacologic anxiolysis2,3 - here is where they can tell you about the TV show they saw on \"awareness under anesthesia\" and you can reassure them - answer questions - education regarding different types of anesthesia, options for post-op analgesia - discuss medications and which ones they should continue /discontinue preoperatively - data indicates that preoperative optimization of care can reduce post-op morbidity4 2. For the anesthesiologist : - learn of patient's medical conditions which might influence anesthetic management - devise an anesthetic plan prior to day of surgery - allow time to discuss medical conditions with consultants and/or order further testing 3. For the surgeons and hospital : - decrease the cost of perioperative care - improve the efficiency on day of surgery - decrease the number of cancella tions and delays for surgery Decrease in surgical cancellations for patients evaluated in the anesthesia preoperative evaluation clinic Investigator Decrease in Surgical Cancellations Fischer588% Pollard et al6 20% Boothe760% Macarthur et al8 5 times lower 4 WHAT SHOULD YOU ACCOMPLISH DURING THE PRE-OP VISIT? History Physical exam Labs ECG Cardiac risk assessment and possi ble referral for further testing Discussion of types of anesthesia applicable to surgical procedure Discussion of risks/benefits/alternatives Discussion of any invasive monitors likely to be placed on day of surgery Instructions regard ing medications Discussion of options for post-op analgesia Fasting and other instructions to patient Answer questions Follow-up any labs or further testing after patient visit After seeing the patient, you should document an anesthetic plan on the pre-op form: 1. Consider the implications of patient co-morbidities - Implications associated with cardiac disease, DM, HTN, asthma, and COPD are reviewed in this syllabus. If you are unfamiliar with the anesth etic implications of a certain disease or disorder, you should look them up! Miller9 and Barash10 are the \"gold standards\" for anesthesia reference. A great source for information about uncommon diseases is Benumof's Anesthesia and Uncommon Diseases.11 Jaffe's Anesthesiologist's Manual of Surgical Procedures12 is an excellent reference about the surgical procedure, types of anesthesia applicable to the procedure, and associated anesthetic implications. And don't fo rget that you can always consult with colleagues. 2. Document all instructions given to patient. 3. Consider the need for premedication and/or prophylaxis for post-op N/V. 4. Consider the need for invasive monitoring. 5. Document the types of anesthesia di scussed with the patient and patient preference. 6. Consider the options for post-op analgesia. We will now elaborate on each of the com ponents of the anesthesia preoperative evaluation......... 5 HISTORY As in other fields of medicine, it is impor tant to obtain a thor ough medical history from the patient, including past medi cal history, medications, allerg ies, social history, family history, and review of systems. In additi on, history that is especially pertinent to perioperative care includes exercise tolerance, past experience with anesthesia, family history of problems with anesthes ia, history of difficult intubation. Use the pre-op anesthesia forms to guide your history, but in general the following points should be covered: 1. Type of surgical procedure and why (diagnosis) 2. HPI - symptoms a/w the surgical diagnos is that may impact anesthetic care - for example, in a patient undergoing cervi cal spine surgery, it is important to ask about range of motion of the neck and any positions that exacerbate pain (helps determine if an awake fiberoptic intubation may be necessary) - in a patient having hiatal hernia repair, it is important to ask about symptoms of GERD and severity (helps dete rmine if RSI may be necessary) 3. PMH - other illnesses or medical conditions - exercise tolerance - important in later determining cardiac risk 4. PSH - include type of anesthetic and a ny problems/complications relating to the anesthetic or surgery, any known history of difficult airway, any eye surgeries (see note on \"bubble in eye\")* - specific complications related to anesthesia co uld include allergic reactions, prolonged skeletal muscle paralysis, delayed awakening, nausea/vomiting, hoarseness, sore throat, myal gia, post-spinal headache 4. Complete list of medicatio ns, including OTC and herbals 5. Complete list of allergies, including the type of reaction 6. Social history - toba cco, alcohol, drug use 7. Family history - focus on family history of problems with anesthesia, in particular MH or pseudocholinesterase deficiency *Note on \"Bubble in Eye\" : The UCSD pre-op form include s a box to check if the patient has a gas bubble in the eye. It is very important to ask patients (especially elderly) if they have had any eye surgeries and if yes, then do they have a BUBBLE IN THE EYE - most likely if they have had a vitrectomy or surger y for retinal detachment. If so, you must document this and also write in large, legible print the words \"DO NOT USE NITROUS OXIDE!\" Nitrous oxide can expand an ocular gas bubble causing increased intraocular pressure and possible central retinal arte ry occlusion, which results in sudden blindness.13 Note on trauma patients : It is important to note all injuries and results of diagnostic studies (i.e. head CT, C-spine films, CXR, FAST, CT abd/pelvis) as these may anesthetic management. 6 PREOPERATIVE RECORD AT UCSD 7 PREOPERATIVE RECORD AT VA HOSPITAL, LA JOLLA 8 PHYSICAL EXAM The most important parts of the pr e-anesthetic physical exam are: 1. Airway (see section on airway evaluation). 2. Cardiovascular - listen to the patient's heart, documen t any signs of CHF (edema, increased JVP, S3 gallop, etc.). 3. Pulmonary - observe the patient's work of breathing, listen fo r decreased breath sounds, wheezing, rales. *These 3 systems should always be examined during the preoperative visit (and often are re-examined just before surgery). Other areas of physical exam that may be im portant depending on the type of procedure or the patient's medi cal history include: Neuro - at the very least, any focal deficits should be documented. Vascular access - especially if invasive monitors will be necessary. Regional site - note any sites of in fection or distortion of anatomy. 9 AIRWAY EVALUATION As you will learn from Dr. Benumof, there ar e 11 criteria for evaluating the patient's airway. The purpose of this evaluation is to predict and prepare for possible difficulty in managing the airway. Criteria associated with possible difficult airway14: 1. Large protuberant incisors 2. Strong overbite (buck teeth) 3. Inability to prognath 4. Small inter-incisor distance (< 6cm) 5. Large tongue (Oropharyngeal or Mallampati classification) 6. Narrow or high-arched palate 7. Short thyromental distance (< 6cm) - including retrognathia or micrognathia 8. Excessive mandibular soft tissue 9. Short neck 10. Thick neck 11. Decreased range of motion of neck Inform the patient of the rare , but possible risk of dental injury during intubation. Ask about dentures/removable appliances and tell th em they will have to remove them prior to induction. Always document any loose, chipped, or missing teeth in pre-op note so that the anesthesiologist does not get blamed! Mallampati Classification of Airway Tonsillar pillars, base of uvula, soft palate, hard palate, tongue visualized Part of uvula, soft palate, hard palate, and tongue visualized Only tongue, soft palate, and hard palate visualized Only tongue and hard palate visualized 10 A history of a previous surgery perfor med w/o complications under GA reduces the probability of a major airway problem, but certainly does not eliminate it. In addition to the 11 criteria, patien ts should also be questioned about a history of sleep apnea . Obstructive sleep apnea suggests pe riods of intermittent airway obstruction, which can be associated with difficult mask ventilation and/or difficult intubation.9 If you are concerned that the patient may have a difficult airway, you should discuss the possibility of an awak e fiberoptic intubation.15 Explain why this procedure may be necessary, emphasizing the importa nce of safely securing the airway before the patient stops breathing. Be sure to explain that we will use local anesthe tic to topicalize the airway and likely provide some sedation before attempting to place the bronchoscope. Aside from obvious indications, it will ultimately be the decision of the anesthesiologist present on the day of surgery as to whether an awake fiberoptic intubation is necessary, based on his/her airw ay evaluation. There are many congenital syndromes that invol ve the airway and can lead to difficult mask ventilation and intubation. Examples include Down syndrome, Pierre Robin, Klippel-Feil, Treacher Collins, and Turner syndrome.9 If you encounter a patient with one of these congenital syndromes, you should read about the specific airway implications and be prepared. In addition, patients may present with other disorders that affect airway management, including traumatic, inflammatory, infectious , or neoplastic diseases. The table on the next page is adopted from Miller9 and lists some examples along with their specific airway implications. 11 Selected pathologic states t hat may influence airway management9 Pathologic State Concerns Infectious epiglottitis Laryngoscopy may worsen obstruction Abscess (submandibular, retropharyngeal) Distortion of airway makes mask ventilation (MV) or intubation difficult Croup, bronchitis, pneumonia Airway ir ritability Papillomatosis Airway obstruction Tetanus Trismus makes oral intubation impossible Traumatic foreign body Airway obstruction Cervical spine injury Neck manipulation may traumatize cord Basilar skull fracture Nasal intubation may result in intracranial tube placement Maxillary/Mandibular injury Airway obstruction, difficult MV Laryngeal fracture Partial obstruction may become complete with blind instrumentation; ETT may be misplaced outside larynx Laryngeal edema Irritable airway, narrowed inlet Soft tissue injury (edema, bleeding) Distortion of airway, obstruction Neoplastic upper airway tumor (pharynx, larynx) Inspiratory obstruction with spontaneous ventilation Lower airway tumor (trachea, bronchi, mediastinum) Lower airway distortion; airway obstruction may not be relieved by intubation Radiation therapy Fibrosis may distort airway Inflammatory rheumatoid arthritis Mandibular hypoplasia, immobile cervical rotation Ankylosing spondylitis Fusion of cer vical spine may make direct laryngoscopy impossible Temporomandibular joint syndrome Seve re impairment of mouth opening Scleroderma Tight skin and TMJ involvement make mouth opening difficult Angioedema Obstructive swelling makes MV difficult Sarcoidosis Airway obstruction (lymphoid tissue) Endocrine/Metabolic acromegaly Large tongue, bony Diabetes have reduced mobility of altanto- occipital joint Hypothyroidism Large tongue, abnormal soft tissue can make MV and intubation difficult Thyromegaly Goiter may cause extrinsic compression or deviation Obesity Upper airway obstruction due to excess soft tissue makes MV difficult 12 LABS AND TESTING Studies have shown that, in general, there is not much benefit from routine laboratory testing unless specifically indicated for a patient's medical condition .16 Testing should be reserved for patients in whom the results ma y actually lead to improved care, change in management, or avoidance of a problem. That being said, the invasiveness of the surg ical procedure does influence the need for routine testing. Low-risk procedures genera lly require minimal or no routine testing. Low-risk surgical procedures [Cardiac risk < 1%] Endoscopic procedures Arthroscopic procedures Superficial procedures Cataract surgery Breast surgery Intermediate-risk surgery [Cardiac risk < 5%] Carotid endarterectomy Intraperitoneal Intrathoracic Orthopedic Prostate High-risk surgery [Cardiac risk can be > 5%] Emergent major operations, particularly in the elderly Aortic and other major vascular Peripheral vascular Anticipated prolonged surgical procedures w/large fluid shifts and/or bld loss (e.g., major spine surgery, liver transplant) From Eagle .17 In 2002 the ASA developed a pr eoperative testing advisory1, which outlines the available studies and provides details regarding the value of different diagnostic tests. Based on ASA advisory: 1. Healthy patients of any age undergoing a mini mally invasive (low-risk) surgery do NOT require any routine labs. 2. Exception may be to obtain baseline Cr in any patient undergoing a procedure which will use IV contrast dye. 3. For intermediate-risk surgery, young healthy patients (age<65) again do NOT require routine labs. 13 4. For intermediate-risk surgery, testing is indicated for patients age>64 or with medical co-morbidities, i.e. chemistry pa nel in patients with DM or renal dz. 5. For high-risk surgery, all patients should have CBC and chemistry panel in addition to Type/Screen or Type/Cross. Other tests such as LFT's, coags are based on co-morbidities. However, at UCSD, most surgeons will go ahead and order LFT's and coags for these patients . Any patient on anticoagulant therapy will require coagulation st udies after stopping therapy. 6. Routine pregnancy testing is NOT re quired for premenopausal women, BUT careful history regarding possible pregnancy is required and pregnancy test performed if indicated by history. 7. In general, the results of any test performed within the past 6 months are acceptable as long as the patient's medical condition has not changed significantly. 8. Preoperative CXR is usually only indi cated for patients with a major known respiratory condition (i.e. COPD), symptoms of a respiratory condition or CHF, malignancy, or history of acute respiratory illness within the past 6 months. In addition, patients undergoing cardiot horacic surgery should have a CXR. 9. PFT's are rarely necessary - usually onl y if patient has severe COPD, SOB, orthopnea and will be undergoing a long surgery or intrathoracic surgery. 10. Urinalysis is usually only done for patie nts with symptoms of UTI or undergoing genito-urologic procedures.

Data from Roizen ,18 Kaplan et al ,19 and Biery et al .20 16 ECG Any male over the age of 40 and any female over the age of 50 must have an ECG performed before receiving anesthesia. In addition, any patient younger th an these guidelines who has any clinical symptoms or signs of heart disease should have an ECG or any patient having cardiothoracic surgery. You are not expected to be a cardiologist when evaluati ng the ECG, but you should be able to evaluate the following basic aspects: 1. Rate 2. Rhythm 3. Axis 4. Intervals 5. Conduction abnormalities 6. Hypertrophy 7. Evidence of ischemia/infarction If you are not sure, consult an ECG text or ask a colleague for help. The appendix in Barash10 includes some of the basics for reading an ECG. 17 CARDIAC RISK ASSESSMENT17,21,22 Why is cardiac risk assessment such a big deal? Correct risk stratification is important so that appropriate measures can be taken to reduce the risk of perioperative MI. The perioperative peri od is associated with state and stre ss-induced release of catechol amines, factors which can exacerbate stress on the heart, leading to MI in patients with underlying CAD. According to some authors, the mortality rate is over 50% for patients who have a perioperative MI.9 Guidelines on perioperative cardiovascular evaluation for noncardiac surgery have been published by the ACC/AHA.17 Using clinical risk factors, surgical risk factors, and exercise tolerance, it can be determined whether a patient will need further diagnostic cardiac testing prior to surgery. In general, invasive cardiac intervention prior to noncardiac surgery is reserved only for those patients who would have needed it anyway (independent of the noncardiac surgery). However, many patients can benefit from cardiac risk reduction using perioperative beta-blocker th erapy. Studies have shown that the use of BB therapy in high-risk patients, particularly those with documented heart muscle at risk undergoing major vascular su rgery, reduces perioperative risk and may eliminate the need for more invasive procedures. Use the ACC/AHA flow chart to go through the stepwise process of assessing a patient's cardiac risk and the need for further testi ng prior to noncardiac surgery. The ACC/AHA guidelines use 5 factors to determine whet her a patient should have further cardiac testing: (1) history and recency of coronary revascularizati on; (2) how long ago was the last favorable cardiac evaluation; (3) patient co-m orbidities, classified as major, intermediate, or minor clinical predictors; (4 ) patient's functional status; and (5) low-, intermediate-, or high-risk surgery. A couple of other important points: 1. Any patient with acute coronary synd rome (i.e. unstable angina or CHF exacerbation) is at high risk of devel oping further decompensation, ischemia, and possibly death during the pe rioperative period. Thes e patients should undergo noncardiac surgery prior to cardiac intervention only in emergent circumstances. 2. According the ACC/AHA Task Force, of pa tients who have had an MI in the past, those within 6 weeks of the MI are at the highest risk of re-infarction during the perioperative period. Therefore, elec tive surgery should be postponed at least 6 weeks after an MI. 3. Most patients with known or suspec ted stable CAD can undergo noncardiac surgery with relative safety if they are treated with perioperative BB therapy. 4. Exercise tolerance is one of the strongest factors in determining cardiac risk. Patients with >4 METS functional capacity will NOT require any further cardiac testing. Patients who become symptomatic (i.e. chest pain, SOB) at <4 METS are 18 considered to have poor functional status and may need further cardiac testing. [The flow chart on p.19 lists examples of activities consistent with 1 MET, 4 METS, and >10 METS.] 5. Further cardiac testing should not be ordered unless the results will impact perioperative management. How do beta-blockers and/or coronary revascularization prior to noncardiac surgery reduce perioperative risk? The theory is that beta-blockers reduce demand on the heart, while revascularization improves supply in patients with critical stenoses.23 A few notes about aortic ste nosis and valvular disease : According to Fleisher21, \"the presence of critical aortic stenosis has been associated with a prohibitive risk of undergoing elec tive noncardiac surgery. The presence of any of the classic triad of angina, syncope, and heart failure in a patient with aortic stenosis should alert the clinician to the need for further evaluation and potential interventions\". According to Park22, \"patients who have severe AS can undergo indicated noncardiac surgery safely provided that the presence of severe AS is recognized and they receive intensive intraoperative and perioperative care wi th full knowledge of the implications of AS\". According to John and Seiber24, \"because the elderly are at increased risk for significant valvular disease, the presen ce of a murmur on physical exam should prompt an echocardiographic evaluation to assess valvular pathology and cardiac function\". Note about conduction abnormalities : According to Jin and Cheung25, \"conduction abnormalities such as Mobitz 2-second degree heart block or complete third degr ee heart block should be treated with a pacemaker before elective procedures\". Note about patients with pacemakers : Try to get as much information as po ssible about the pacemaker because it will probably be necessary to contact the pacemak er representative on the day of surgery for reprogramming or interrogation. Information to obtain includes: [some pa tients will have an information card] - manufacturer (e.g., St. Jude, Medtroni cs, etc.), model and serial number - name of patient's cardiologist (may need to get all this information from MD) - mode of pacemaker (e.g., DDDR, VVI, etc.) - WHY the patient has a pacemaker (e.g., sick sinus syndrome, AV block, etc.) - What is the patient's underlying rhythm? 19 20 21 OTHER COMMON DISEASES Diabetes Mellitus (DM) Diabetes mellitus is classified as insulin-dependent (IDDM) or non-insulin-dependent (NIDDM). Most of our patients fall into the NIDDM category, which is almost always associated with obesity as well. The most serious acute complication of DM is ketoacidosis, but what we will see more commonly are manifestations of chronic DM related to macroangiopathies, microangiopathies, and neuropathies. These ma nifestations can have significant impact on patient management during the perioperative period. Common problems associated with DM9: Hyperglycemia or and peripheral vascular disease) Renal disease Retinopathy Stiff joints Peripheral neuropathy Things to assess during the preoperative evaluation: 1. Cardiac risk assessment and whether this patient should be on a beta-blocker - DM is an intermediate clinical predictor. 2. Evidence of other vascular dise ase (h/o claudication or CVA). 3. Renal dysfunction. 4. What is the usual range of patient's blood sugar measur ements? If patient does not check, consider checking glycohemoglobin. 5. Limited joint mobility (including TMJ and cervical) - may affect airway management. 6. Peripheral neuropathy - incr eases risk of also havi ng autonomic neuropathy and may affect regional anesthesia site. 7. Blood glucose and electrolytes should be checked preoperatively in any patient who will be having general anesthesia. 8. Discuss which medications the patient should discontinue pr eoperatively (see section on \"Patient Medications\"). A few key points about operative ma nagement of the diabetic patient : 22 1. Finger stick glucose should be checked on the morning of surgery in the pre-op area. Measurement of intraoperative glucose and electrolytes is indicated based on duration and magnitude of the surgery (definitely for long cases or surgeries associated with major fluid shifts). 2. The best way to avoid perioperative exacer bation of problems related to DM is to maintain proper glucose control a nd avoid dehydration and electrolyte disturbances. Frequent m onitoring of glucose, volume status, acid/base status, and electrolytes guides therapy. 3. If the patient has peripheral sensory neur opathy, he/she is at higher risk of also having autonomic neuropathy. 4. Signs of cardiac autonomic neuropathy hypotension, resting tachycardia, and absent vari ation in heart rate with d eep breathing. These patients have an increased risk of sudden death.9 Sudden bradycardia and hypotension can occur during anesthesia may be resistant to Atr opine and Ephedrine and may require treatment with Epine phrine (10 mcg IV at a time).26 5. Another manifestation of autonomic neur opathy is gastroparesis which causes delayed emptying of solids and may increas e the risk of aspiration on induction or emergence from anesthesia. Consider methods for decreasing aspiration risk. 6. Peripheral nerves in diabetics are more susceptible to compression injury so extra care should be taken in pa dding all pressure points. Hypertension (HTN) Essential hypertension is a risk factor for the development of CAD, CHF, renal dysfunction, and stroke. Medical therapy ai med at controlling hypertension reduces these risks. Long-standing uncontrolled hyperten sion leads to left ve ntricular hypertrophy (LVH), which causes diastolic ventricular dysfunction and also increases the heart's demand for oxygen. Patients who remain hyperten sive before the induction of anesthesia are at increased risk for intraoperati ve hypotension and myocardial ischemia.27 Things to assess during the preoperative evaluation: 1. What range of blood pressures is normal for this patient? What is this patient's baseline BP? BP should be checked in the pre-op clinic and it may also be helpful to review the patient's chart to get an idea of baseline blood pressures. This will be important in determining the goal MAP to maintain intraoperatively. 2. If the patient's blood pressure is exce ssively high (i.e., >180/110), it may be necessary to refer the patient to prim ary care MD for medication management. 3. Evidence of end-organ dysfunction - history of CHF, CVA, renal dysfunction. 4. Cardiac risk assessment and whether this patient should be on a beta-blocker. 5. Discuss medications - in general, patien ts should continue anti-hypertensive medications throughout th e perioperative period. 6. Discuss possibility of invasive monitoring (i.e., arterial line). 23 A few key points about operative management of the patient with hypertension : 1. It is common for patients with HTN to ha ve exaggerated blood pressure responses intraoperatively. For exam ple, the patient who is initially hypertensive may become hypotensive during induction of an esthesia. \"unmask\" intravascular volume depletion due to ch ronic hypertension. Alternatively, the patient may become dramatically hypert ensive during laryngoscopy or surgical stimulation. Be prepared for wide fluc tuations and be ready to treat these responses. 2. Use 5-lead ECG for patients with HTN b ecause there is a good chance they also have CAD. 3. The autoregulation curve for cerebral blood fl ow is shifted to the right in patients with chronic HTN; therefore, they are at increased risk of cerebral ischemia if perfusion pressure decreases. Keep MAP within 20-25% of baseline MAP. 4. During long or extensive surgeries or for patients with poorly controlled HTN, an arterial line is indicated and you should also consider the need for central venous monitoring +/- PAC. Asthma More common in pediatric patients, but estimated to affect up to 10% of patients older than 55.28 Chronic inflammatory changes in airway mucosa. Reversible obstruction to expiratory airflow. Airway hyperactivity and development of bronchospasm in response to stimuli. Clinical symptoms include wheezing and dyspnea. Things to assess during preoperative evaluation: 1. How severe and frequent is the patient's asthma? Hospitalized recently? Required intubation? Require d treatment with steroids? 2. How often does asthma occur and what triggers it? 3. What medications (inhalers) doe s patient use and how often? 4. Auscultate for wheezing. 5. Pre-op PFTs or ABG may be indicated in pa tient scheduled for thoracic or major abdominal operation. 6. Has the patient been on steroids recently and for how long? - may need stress dose steroids during surgery. 7. Instruct patient to bring inhalers on day of surgery. A few key points about operative mana gement of the patient with asthma : 1. Pre-op bronchodilator treat ment may be helpful. 24 2. If possible, regional anesthesia may be better option for patient with severe asthma. 3. Goal during general anesthesia is to de press airway reflexes and avoid hyper- reactive bronchospasm in response to s timulation. Make sure the patient is \"deep\" enough before attempting intuba tion. Propofol and Ketamine are good induction agents. Can start volatile agent while still mask ventilating - Sevo and Iso are bronchodilators. 4. Treat intraoperative bronchospasm w ith beta-2 agonist and deepening of anesthesia with volatile agent. However, it is important to rule out other causes of increased pulmonary pressures such as mechanical obstruction, endobronchial intubation, and pulmonary aspiration. 5. If patient has recently been on steroids, consider stress-dose steroid administration during surgery, especially if pa tient has refractory hypotension. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) Regional differences in airway resistance lead to areas of V/Q mismatch, which can lead to arterial hypoxemia. May retain carbon dioxide and develop respiratory acidosis. Clinical symptoms include dyspnea, wheezing, productive cough, increased work of breathing. Usually associated with hi story of cigarette smoking. Irreversible airway obstruction characte rized by increased total lung capacity (TLC) and residual volume (RV), but decreased forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1). Increased risk of postopera tive respiratory failure. Things to assess during preoperative evaluation: 1. Severity of disease - Use of inhalers and how often? Recent hospitalizations? Recent steroid use? Use of home oxygen? 2. Chest x-ray for evidence of pneumonia or bullae. 3. PFTs or ABG may be indicated depending on type of surgery and severity of disease. 4. Auscultate lungs. 5. Has the patient been on steroids recently - may need intraoperative stress-dose steroids. 6. Instruct patient to bring inhalers on day of surgery. A few key points about operative ma nagement of the patient with COPD : 1. Preoperative bronchodilators. 2. Regional anesthesia may be better option. 25 3. Caution with nitrous oxide - can cause enlargement of bullae and lead to pneumothorax. 4. Important to humidify inspired gase s to prevent drying of secretions. 5. Use smaller tidal volumes and longer time for exhalation (slow breathing rates, decreased I:E ratio). 6. If recent steroid use, consider intraope rative stress-dose steroid administration. 26 TYPES OF ANESTHESIA When discussing the potentia l types of anesthesia that a patient may undergo, it is important to keep in mind the following: 1. Some surgical procedures may only be performed under general anesthesia while other procedures may be possible with a variety of anesthetic techniques. 2. The patient's medical history may strongly influence the type of anesthesia that should be offered. 3. The risks and benefits of various anesth etic techniques should be discussed with the patient. 4. Often it is possible to tailor anesthet ic technique based on patient (or even surgeon) preference. 5. However, for safety reasons, the patien t should understand that the ultimate decision regarding anesthetic technique will be made by the anesthesiologist present for the patient's surgery. 6. Many patients will not KNOW what kind of anesthesia they prefer (even after discussing it with you). What should you tell patients a bout the different types of an esthesia performed at UCSD? I. General anesthesia Most patients think of general as \" going to sleep\" or being \"completely under\". Patient should understand that under GA, they will have a breathing device (most likely an ETT or LMA) a nd they should be aware of the risk of dental injury. GA can be given via inhalational gase s or IV meds - we often use a combination. Advantages: will not hear anything or remember anything, will be completely \"under\". Disadvantages: post-op nausea/vomiting, feeling \"groggy\" in PACU, requires control of airway, may have minor post-op sore throat, will require IV/PO meds for post-op analgesia. GA can be used for almost any type of surgical procedure; however, if the patient has a significant medical histor y (i.e. poor lung function), it may be prudent to go with an alternate form of anesthesia. II. MAC = Monitored Anesthesia Care Minimally invasive procedures can be performed under MAC. 27 MAC is usually combined with LOCAL anesthesia given by the surgeon or REGIONAL anesthesia given by you. Patients often think of MAC as \"twili ght sleep\" or \"conscious sedation\". Explain to the patient that they will not be completely awake. They may even sleep throughout the surgical procedure, but it may be possible for them to hear or remember things from the surgery. They may feel the initial in jection of LOCAL anesthesia. The major advantage over GA is that patient can spontaneously breathe and usually only requires a green O2 mask or nasal cannula. Another advantage is they ma y feel less \"groggy\" in PACU. Disadvantages: not good for long proce dures because patient may become uncomfortable on OR table, not good when you need a secure airway. Examples of procedures which can be performed under MAC/LOCAL o Variety of eye procedures - i.e. cataract surgery o Cath lab procedures o Breast biopsy o Endoscopic procedures o Arthroscopic procedures III. Regional anesthesia Regional anesthesia uses local anesthetics to \"numb\" an ar ea of the body. Three types of regional anesthesia are SPINAL, EPIDURAL, and PERIPHERAL NERVE BLOCKS. Regional anesthesia is usually combined with MAC so that patients do not have to be completely awake during the surgery. On the other hand, the rare patient will want to be completely awake and therefore regional an esthesia takes care of pain control. Spinal anesthesia : Local anesthetics and/or opi oids are given as a single shot into the subarachnoid space. Takes effect quickly and bloc ks sensation in the lower body. Often used for rectal, bladder, pros tate, gynecologic, and lower extremity procedures. Must know duration of surgery and make sure spinal will last longer than procedure. Advantages: patient can spontaneously ventilate, avoids PACU \"grogginess\", less post-op nausea/vomiting (but may have intra-op N/V if BP drops too much), avoids other complications associated with GA (oral trauma, aspiration), attenuates stress response; some studi es have shown less blood loss, fewer thromboembolic complications, and improved LE graft patency. 28 Disadvantages: not good for long procedures (>3 hrs unless an intrathecal catheter is placed), patient may hear or remember things from OR, sometimes technically difficult or impossible to perform, can get significant hypotension, possible pruritis if intrathecal opio ids are used, possible urinar y retention, small risk of high spinal may lead to bradycardia a nd/or respiratory difficulty necessitating conversion to GA. Epidural anesthesia : Catheter is placed in the epidural space and is used for bolus or continuous dosing of local anesthetics and/or opioids. Can provide anesthesia for surgery on th e lower body or analgesia in combination with GA Can be re-dosed if surgery lasts longer than expected. Main advantage is able to provide superior post-op analgesia. Advantages: patient can spontaneously ve ntilate (unless in combination w/ GA), less GA may be used, can re-bolus or use continuous infusion, less hypotension than spinal anesthesia. Disadvantages: risk of post-dural puncture headache, can be technically difficult in elderly patients or those with misali gnment of back, sometimes doesn't work even if placed with proper technique due to patchy spread of local anesthetic. Peripheral nerve blocks (PNBs) : Local anesthetic injected in proximity to nerve(s) to provide numbness over surgical area. Upper extremity blocks often used for hand/wrist/shoulder procedures. Lower extremity blocks often used for foot/ankle/knee procedures. Usually used with MAC or GA but can be combined with a spinal or epidural. Can provide excellent post-op analgesia for up to 24 hours. Advantages: post-op analgesia, avoids or lessens amount of GA, patient can spontaneously ventilate (unless GA), reduces post-op nausea/vomiting. Disadvantages: requires experience, requires evaluation and supplementation which can take extra time, not good if patient cannot cooperate. Examples of PNBs: brachial plexus plexus block, sciatic nerve block, ankle block. Before meeting with the patient, you shoul d look up the surgical procedure in Jaffe12 - that way you will know which kind of anesthet ic techniques are appropriate to discuss with the patient. CONSULT WITH REGIONAL ANEST HESIA FACULTY IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE APPROPRIATENESS OF REGIONAL FOR PARTICULAR PATIENTS OR SURGICAL PROCEDURES. 29 DISCUSSION OF ANESTHETIC RISKS Patients will often ask the question \"What are the risks of anesthesia?\" The answer to this question is complex becau se the risks are different for each patient based on co-morbidities, type of surgery, and of course, expe rience and vigilance of the anesthesiologist. The following informati on should give you an overall sense of what factors determine the risks of anesthesia and allow you to give patients a reasonable answer to the question. One thing is clear: Data has demonstrated that risk directly attributable to anesthesia has declined over time and is rare.9 Multiple studies have examined the factors associated with increased perioperative mortality and morbidity and have tried to pi npoint which factors may be attributable to anesthesia. Unfortunately it would be difficu lt to perform a randomized controlled trial on what anesthetic properties directly cont ribute to increased morbidity and mortality; therefore, the data that does exis t is from retrospective studies. A recurring factor in many of these studies is ASA Physical Status Classification: ASA Status Description 1 Normal healthy patient (indepe ndent of the planned surgery) 2 Mild systemic disease, but no functional limitations 3 Severe systemic disease that results in functional limitations 4 Severe systemic disease that is a constant threat to life 5 Critically ill patient not expected to survive without the surgery 6 Brain-dead patient whose organs are being harvested for donation E Any patient who needs an emergent operation Many studies have supported the fact that ma jor complications occur more frequently in patients with extensive co-morbidities (as characterized by ASA status). In addition, major complications tend to occur more fre quently in elderly patients (possibly because they are more likely to have higher ASA stat us) and also in patie nts undergoing emergent procedures. One study (Dripps et al.29) found that no deaths were attributable to anesthesia among 16,000 patients with ASA I physical status. Other examples of retrospective study results on anesthesia-related mortality: Study investigators Anesthesia-related mortality Tikkanen and Hovi-Viander300.15 per 10,000 procedures French survey311 in 185,000 procedures Lagasse321 in 13,000 procedures 30 In these studies, the most common causes of death attributable to anesthesia included: 1. Equipment failure 2. Intubation complication 3. Pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents 4. Postoperative respiratory depression 5. Anaphylactic shock 6. Cardiac arrest 7. Medication error Other common causes of death not necessarily attributable to anesthesia included: 1. Bronchopneumonia 2. CHF 3. MI 4. PE 5. Respiratory failure The surgical procedure itself also significantly influences perioperative risk. Almost all of the studies have shown that emergency su rgery is associated with additional risk. Next, cardiovascular surgery is associated with the highest risk, then major vascular surgery. Intrathoracic and abdomin al procedures are associated with an intermediate risk. Elderly patients are more likely to have co-morbidities and a decreased level of functioning. According to John and Seiber24, \"the best predictor of postoperative level of functioning is preoperative leve l of functioning.\" Studies ha ve shown that inability to perform Activities of Daily Life (ADLs) independently and also weight loss > 10% within 6 months are risk fact ors for postoperative pneumonia in the elderly. In fact, these 2 risk factors may be more im portant than smoking and COPD.24 Postoperative pneumonia carries a high 30-day mortality..... >20% in a study by Arozullah et al.33 Help patients to understand that the goal of the anesthesiologist is to reduce the risks related to their co-morbidities. \"Anesthesiologists must view perioperative or gan protection as part of their goals to provide the highest quality of car e and reduce perioperative risk.\"21 Ok, aside from mortality, what most patients really want to know are the common complications or \"side e ffects\" from anesthesia: Common: - Post-operative nausea and vomiting - Waking up in pain 31 - Post-operative sore throat - Confusion/grogginess upon awakening Less common: - Stress on the heart, including ischemia - Heart arrhythmia - Post-dural puncture headache associated with epidural/spinal anesthesia - Bleeding or infection at site of regional anesthesia - Nerve injury - Dental injury - Myalgias - Allergy to anesthetic medication - Postoperative respiratory distress - Prolonged intubation and/or pulmonary complications (esp. if pt has underlying pulm dz), pulmonary aspiration Rare: - Awareness under anesthesia - Anaphylactic reaction - Local anesthetic toxicity - Epidural hematoma or abscess - CVA - Organ failure - Death 32 DISCUSSION OF ANY INVASIVE MONITORS All patients will have at least 1 peripheral IV prior to induction of anesthesia (with the exception of pediatric patients undergoing inhalational induction). Other invasive monitors and modes of access will be based on the patient's medical condition and the type of surgical procedure. Jaffe12 provides a good guideline about which pr ocedures typically require invasive monitors. Also, patients with significant medical co-morbidities may require invasive monitors for induction of anesthesia, even if the surgical procedure is low-risk. On the day of surgery, the anesthesiologist will ultimately decide and inform the patient if invasive monitors are nece ssary, but it is always a good idea to \"forewarn\" the patient during the preop visit if you susp ect that invasive monitors will be necessary. Explaining why certain monitors may be necessary can expedite the process on the day of surgery. Arterial line : allows beat-to-beat monitoring of blood pressure and provides access to obtain blood samples for analyses of ABG's a nd electrolytes. In general, A-lines offer low risk with high benefit in patients with co-morbidities such as cardiac disease or HTN. They are also helpful for surgical procedures with extensive fluid shifts, blood loss, or situations where frequent labs are required. The risk of arteri al thrombosis is low if the catheter is continuously flushe d with heparinized saline. Other complications include hematoma, bleeding, air damage, infection, unintentional intra-arterial drug injection.34 Central venous catheter : allows continuous monitoring of volume status by central venous pressure (which parallels right hear t pressures) and provides venous access for rapid infusion of fluids or infusion of drugs which may be toxic to peripheral veins. Complications associated with placement of a central line include carotid artery puncture/cannulation, pneumothorax, infecti on, air brachial plexus, and thoracic duct damage.35 PA catheter : allows continuous monitoring of pul monary pressures, intermittent monitoring of pulmonary capillary wedge pressu re (which parallels left heart pressures), thermodilution for estimation of cardiac out put and calculation of other hemodynamic measures. Indications for the use of a PAC are controversial because complications can be severe or even fatal. Common indications incl ude poor left ventricular function (EF < 40%), need for assessment of intravascular fluid volume or response to vasopressors, valvular heart disease, ARDS, massive shoc k or hemorrhage, and surgical procedures with an increased risk of complications fr om hemodynamic changes (i.e. cardiac or major vascular surgery). Risks include those associ ated with central line placement as well as cardiac dysrhythmias, heart block, pulmonary ischemia or infarction, pulmonary artery perforation, hemorrhage, bacteremia/endocarditi s. The risk of complications increases with the duration of catheterization which should not exceed 72 hours. 36 33 Examples of possible indications for PAC : CAD w/ LV dysfunctio n or recent MI Valvular heart dz, es pecially severe AS Heart failure Acute resp failure (i.e. ARDS) Pulmonary HTN Severe COPD Complex fluid management - s hock, trauma, ARF, acute burns , hemorrhagic pancreatitis Specific surgical procedures - clamping si shunts High-risk obstetrics - severe toxemia, placental abruption 34 PATIENT MEDICATIONS All medications should be reviewed and th e patient should be instructed regarding continuing or discontinuing any meds during th e perioperative period, including what to take on the morning of surgery. Although patients are NPO on the morning of surgery, they make take any necessary medications 2 hours before surgery with a small sip of water. Some controversy exists about which medications should be discontinued perioperatively and for how long prior to surgery. In additi on, there are few controlled trials regarding perioperative medication management, so decisions are often made based on past experience or manufacturer's recommendations. Mercado and Petty37 offer a nice review of the lite rature and provide recommendations based on available data (through 2003). Th e following are recommendations based on their review: Cardiac drugs - in general, should be conti nued through the morning of surgery. 1. Beta-blockers should always be continued periop eratively. Observational studies have shown increased risk of perioperati ve MI and death in vascular patients whose BB's were discontinued. 2. Antiarrhythmics should be continued. 3. Digoxin should be continued and serum level should be checked preoperatively. 4. Antihypertensives should, in general, be continued. The exception to this is large doses of diuretics which can exacerb ate hypovolemia and may be stopped on the morning of surgery (assuming the patient can tolerate stopping). Some authors argue that ACE inhibitors and ARBs may contribute to intraoperative hypotension, but the clinical significance of this is c ontroversial. Clonidine should NOT be stopped because sudden cessation can lead to rebound hypertension. Pulmonary drugs - in general, should be continued through the morning of surgery. 1. Inhaled agents , including beta agonists , anticholinergic agents , and steroids should be continued and the patient should bring inhalers so they may be used immediately prior to surgery. 2. Leukotriene inhibitors (Zafirlukast, Montelukast) and lipoxygenase inhibitors (Zileuton) should be continued. 3. Steroids should be continued and the patie nt may require a \"stress\" dose of Hydrocortisone intraoperatively. 4. Theophylline may be continued, but serum level should be checked preoperatively. 35 Diabetic agents 1. Insulin patients should take their usual PM dos e the night prior to surgery, then only take one-third to one-half their usual AM dose on the morning of surgery. patients with an insulin pu mp should continue their basal rate only. Finger-stick blood glucose should always be checked when the patient arrives and before induction of anesthesia. 2. Metformin - should be STOPPED 2 days prior to surgery (becau se of the rare associated lactic acidosis). 3. Other oral antiglycemics - should be STOPPED on the morning of surgery (because may lead to intraoperative hypoglycemia). Antiplatelet agents and Anticoagulants 1. Aspirin - should be STOPPED 7 days preope ratively, especially in alcoholics (because they often have underlying platelet dysfunction). *There is one exception: occasionally, a cardiac patient will be told by the cardiologist to conti nue Aspirin perioperatively, in which case the patient should listen to the cardiologist. 2. Aggrenox - contains Aspirin, so should be STOPPED 7 days preoperatively unless told to continue by cardiologist. 3. Clopidogrel (Plavix) and Ticlopidine (Ticlid) - should be STOPPED 7 days preoperatively (both drugs irreversibly inhibit platelets). 4. Cilostazol (Pletal) - should be STOPPED 3 days prior to surgery (has a shorter half-life and causes reversible platelet inhibition). 5. NSAIDs (COX-1 and COX-2 inhibitors) - should be STOPPED 3 days prior to surgery (COX-1 because of reversible i nhibition of platelet cyclooxygenase and COX-2 because of potential renal issues). 6. Warfarin - should be STOPPED 4-5 days pre operatively and the patient's INR should be checked prior to surgery. Note: To avoid confusing our patients, we of ten just tell them to stop all of the above drugs 1 week prior to surgery. 7. Unfractionated heparin Therapeutic doses of heparin should be HELD 12 hours prior to surgery. Prophylactic doses (for DVT prophylaxis) can be continued unless the patient will be having regi onal (neuraxial) anesthesia. 36 8. Lovenox (enoxaparin) and Fragmin (dalteparin) In general, should be held 12-24 hours prior to surgery, but check with the primary team before instructing the patient. Important note : Due to the risk of spinal hematoma, there are special guidelines for epidural catheter placement (and removal) in relation to anticoagulants, including the use of prophylactic doses of hepari n and LMWH. See the next se ction of this syllabus. Osteoporosis drugs 1. Raloxifene (Evista) - should be STOPPED at least 7 days prior to surgery (has been shown to increase the ri sk of perioperative DVT). 2. Estrogen (as used for Hormone Replacement Ther apy) - also increases the risk of DVT; no data regarding how long it should be discontinued preoperatively (some authors have suggested 4 weeks); recomme nd telling patients to STOP at least 7 days preoperatively. Note: if used for contraception, see p.37 under \"Endocrine agents\". 3. Alendronate (Fosamax) - no guidelines, but is associated with GI side effects, so recommend stopping in the week prior to surgery. Neurologic drugs 1. Anti-Parkinsonian agents - should be continued through the morning of surgery, but you should be aware of the possible interactions with anesthetic agents. Return of Parkinsonian symptoms can develop even within hours of stopping carbidopa/levodopa (this is w hy we tell patients to continue through morning of surgery). Prolonged cessation can cause \"levodopa withdrawal syndrome\" which is associated with symptoms similar to neuroleptic malignant syndrome. You should be aware that carbidopa/levodopa can interact with anesthetic agents leading to the possibility of intraoperative arrhythmias. You should also be aware th at some anti-emetic agents (i.e., droperidol, metoclopramide) can cause adverse e ffects in patients with Parkinson's disease. Selegiline is an MAOI occasionally used to treat Parkinson's disease and has been reported to cause a potentia lly fatal interaction with meperidine . If a patient is on selegiline, then me peridine should be strictly avoided perioperatively and other narcotics should be given with caution and close monitoring. 2. Antiseizure medications - should be continued thr ough the morning of surgery. 37 Be aware that many anti-epileptics have central depressant properties and may reduce the required doses of anesthetic agents (decrease MAC). Serum levels of phenytoin, carbamazepine, valproic should be checked preoperatively. Psychiatric meds 1. Tricyclic antidepressants - may be continued. Be aw are of anticholinergic side effects. 2. MAO inhibitors - should be STOPPED 2 weeks prio r to surgery. In the case of urgent surgery, be extremely cautious with sympathomimetics , anticholinergics , and avoid meperidine (can develop life-threaten ing hypertensive crisis). 3. SSRIs - should be continued through the mo rning of surgery (discontinuation can lead to withdrawal symptoms). 4. Other antidepressants (venlafaxi ne, bupropion, mirtazapime, nefazodone) - may be continued (no known withdrawal syndrom e or interaction w ith anesthetics). 5. Antipsychotics (phenothi azines and butyrophenones) - should be continued preoperatively (due to risk of withdr awal akinesia or rebound agitation). Be aware that they may enhance the e ffects of narcotics and barbiturates . Also may cause ECG abnormalities, including QT prolongation. Phenothiazines can decrease seizure threshold in susceptible patients. 6. Anxiolytics - benzodiazepines may be continued. 7. Lithium - may be continued preoperatively. Serum levels should be checked preoperatively. Be aware that Lithium can prolong the action of muscle relaxants . Endocrine agents 1. Thyroid medications - should be continued thro ugh the morning of surgery. Thyroid studies should be performed preoperatively. 2. Steroids - may be continued. Any patient who has received steroids for more than 1 week in the several months prio r to surgery should be considered for perioperative \"stress\" dose steroids to avoid adrenal insufficiency and hypotension. 3. Estrogen (oral contraceptives) - studies have shown that Estrogen increases the risk of thromboembolism perioperatively. That being said, the risks/benefits of perioperative DVT vs. perioperative pregnancy should be discussed with the patient. If the patient is willing to use alternative contraception, it may be wise to have her discontinue OCPs up to 1 month prior to surgery. 38 Rheumatologic drugs 1. Methotrexate - controversial. There have b een concerns regarding wound healing and infectious complications, although no st udies have supported these concerns. One study showed no problems and that it did not need to be discontinued perioperatively. 2. Leflunomide (immune modulator used to tr eat RA) - no known perioperative adverse effects, but no controlled trials . Can cause pancytopenia and hepatic dysfunction so labs should be checked preoperatively. HIV drugs - antiretroviral drugs should be continued (because resistance can develop rapidly if doses are missed). Viagra, Levitra, Cialis - should be STOPPED 3 days prior to surgery. Herbal medications Several commonly used herbal agents have been associated with perioperative complications. Herbal medications are not regulate d by the FDA and therefore may vary among different manufacturers. For these reasons, patients should be instructed to STOP all herbal medications at least 7 days prior to surgery. Vitamins Multivitamins may be continued, but are not necessary. Vitamin E should be STOPPED a few days prior to surgery. Antibiotics Be aware that aminoglycosides can potentiate neuromuscular blockers be a catas trophic consequence of neuraxial anesthesia and can lead to permanent neurological impair ment including paralysis. In order to reduce the risk of spinal hematoma, the fo llowing recommendations have been published by the American Society of Regional Anesthesia (ASRA).38 *Note - the following recommendations assume that the patient is being treated with only one particular anticoagulant. Patients being treated with more than one agent concurrently may have increased risk of spinal hematoma. Unfractionated IV Heparin 1. Discontinue IV Heparin at least 4 hours before and check aPTT to confirm normalization before perform ing neuraxial anesthesia. 2. After placement of neuraxial catheter, wait at least 1 hour before starting or re- dosing IV Heparin. This includes intra- operative IV Hepari n (i.e. vascular procedures), which also should not be given until at least 1 hour after the neuraxial anesthesia was placed. 3. Wait at least 2-4 hours and check aPTT for normalization prior to removing a neuraxial catheter. Again, wait at least 1 hour before re-starting IV Heparin. The patient should have q 2hr neuro checks for at least 12 hours following catheter removal. Prophylactic SQ Heparin 1. According the American Society of Regional Anesthesia, there is no contraindication to neuraxial anesthesia in a patient receiving SQ Heparin. They do recommend delaying the next dose of SQ Heparin until after the block is placed. 2. The German Society of Anesthesiology a nd Intensive Care Medicine recommends waiting 4 hours before neuraxial anesthesia a nd not re-dosing SQ Heparin for 1 hour after placement or removal of the catheter. 3. Patients who have been receiving SQ Heparin for more than 4 days should have their platelet count checked prior to neuraxial block or catheter removal (due to the risk of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia). Recommendations regarding in tra-operative IV Heparin 1. Avoid neuraxial anesthesia in any patient known to have any type of coagulopathy. 2. Wait at least 1 hour after the placement of neuraxial anesthesia before administering IV Heparin. [Some authors even advocate placing epidural catheter the day before the surgery for patients who will receive systemic IV Heparin for cardiopulmonary bypass]. 40 3. Use the smallest amount of Heparin for th e shortest duration possible to achieve therapeutic goals. 4. If a traumatic tap occurs, individual ri sk-benefit assessment should be discussed with the surgeon as to whether to proceed with surgery or delay the case 24 hours. In the case of surgery involving cardi opulmonary bypass where the patient will be receiving high-dose systemic IV Heparin, the case should be delayed 24 hours . 5. Do not remove neuraxial catheters until normal coagulation is restored as evidenced by normalization of aPTT. Do not re-heparinize for at least 1 hour after catheter removal. 6. The patient's neurological function shoul d be closely monitored post-operatively. Low Molecular Weight Heparin (LMWH) 1. For patients being treated with therapeutic doses of LMWH, it should be discontinued at least 24 hours prior to neuraxial anesthesia. 2. For patients being treated with thromboprophylactic doses of LMWH, it should be discontinued at least 12 hours prior to neuraxial anesthesia. 3. If a patient will be receiving twice daily dosing of LMWH for thromboprophylaxis postoperatively, the first dose should not o ccur until at least 24 hours postoperatively. Any indwelling ne uraxial catheter should be removed at least 2 hours before this first dose. 4. If a patient will be receiving once daily dosing of LMWH for thromboprophylaxis postoperatively, the first dose shoul d not occur until at least 8 hours postoperatively. The second dose should not occur for 24 hours after the first dose. If a neuraxial catheter is not re moved before the initiation of LMWH, wait at least 12 hours after the last dose before remo ving it. Wait at least 2 hours after catheter removal before administ ering the next dose of LMWH. Oral Warfarin 1. Coumadin should be stopped ideally 4-5 days before and PT/INR should be checked prior to neuraxial anesthesia. The \u00bd life of Coumadin varies from 48-72 hours. 2. Neuraxial catheters should not be removed until INR < 1.5. *Note: even if INR < 1.5, hemostasis may not be normal. Normal hemostasis may not be present until IN R is within normal limits. Antiplatelet agents 1. NSAIDs alone do not significantly increase the risk of spinal hematoma, but in combination with other anticoagulant agents there have been reports of increased bleeding complications, incl uding spinal hematoma. 2. Ticlopidine should be discontinued 14 days prior to neuraxial anesthesia. 3. Clopidogrel should be discontinued 7 days prior to neuraxial anesthesia. 41 4. GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors should be discontinued at least 48 hours prior to neuraxial anesthesia. Thrombolytic therapy - there are no published studies re garding neuraxial anesthesia in patients receiving thrombolytic therapy, but there are a few case reports of spinal hematomas, from which recommendations are suggested.39 1. Thrombolytic therapy should not be started in a patient with a history of lumbar puncture, spinal or epidural anesthesia, or epidural steroid inje ction in the last 10 days. [Unfortunately, this may be out of our hands since we would not be the ones starting thrombolytic tx]. 2. During a pre-op evaluation, ask the patient if he/she has received any fibrinolytic or thrombolytic drugs recently (i.e. for hist ory of MI or CVA). If yes, then the patient should probably not receive neuraxial anesthesia. Data is not available on the length of time to wait for neurax ial anesthesia afte r discontinuation of thrombolytics. 3. In the situation where a patient recei ves neuraxial anesthesia and then unexpectedly gets started on thrombolytics, neuro checks should be performed every 2 hours until the throm bolytics are discontinued. 4. If a neuraxial catheter is in place when a patient is star ted on fibrinolytics, it is recommended to follow fibrinogen levels and wait until normal levels are achieved before removing the catheter (aga in, no data for this recommendation). 5. Bottom line - due to the risk of serious hemo rrhagic events in patients who are known to have received or be receiving thro mbolytic therapy, it is prudent to avoid neuraxial anesthesia. 42 PREMEDICATION During the preoperative evaluation, you can ge t a sense of whether the patient may benefit from premedication. If you think a preoperative medication is indicated, you should document it as part of your anesthetic pl an so that whoever actually does the case can consider your suggestion. In genera l, premedication will be given by the anesthesiologist on the day of surgery in the pre-op holding area. If you feel that premedication will be important prior to the anesthesiologist seeing the patient on the day of surgery, you can contact the primary surg ery team and recommend that they order the medication. What is premedication useful for? 1. Psychological preparation a. Anxiolysis - benzodiazepines most co mmonly used just prior to elective surgery for mild/moderate seda tion and relief of anxiety. b. Amnesia - benzos can provide anterogr ade amnesia (e.g., can prevent patient from remembering rolling back to the OR) and some retrograde amnesia. c. Insomnia - occasionally, patients may need medication the night before surgery to relieve insomnia associated w ith anxiety (again, benzos can be used or other sedating medications). 2. Pain control a. Analgesia may be necessary for patients experiencing preoperative pain in the pre-op holding area. b. Premedication with opioids facilitates placement of inva sive monitors prior to induction of anesthesia. c. Opioids also helpful prior to perfor ming a regional anesthetic technique. 3. Antisialogogue effect a. If the patient requires an awake fiber optic intubation, pretreatment with an anticholinergic agent helps re duce [Caution in patients with cardiac disease as anticholinergics increase heart rate ]. i. Scopolamine provides antisialogogue effect and some sedation. ii. Glycopyrolate provides antisial ogogue effect with out sedation. 4. Aspiration precautions a. Consider in patients who have incr eased risk of pulmonary aspiration (parturients, morbid obesity, significan t GERD, \"full stomach\", diabetics with gastroparesis). b. H2 antagonists - e.g., ranitidine - blocks histamine release from parietal cells, which decreases the secreti on of acidic gastric fluid. c. Antacids - e.g., sodium citrate - increas es the pH of gastric fluid already present in the stomach. d. Prokinetics - e.g., metoclopramide - stimulates gastric emptying. 5. Attenuation of sympathetic nervous system responses 43 a. Inclusion of an opioid in the prem edication (also known as \"preemptive analgesia\") has been shown to decr ease the likelihood that undesirable increases in heart rate will accompan y surgical stimulation (or laryngoscopy) during administration of volatile anesthetics.40 b. Beta-blockers - IV beta-blo ckers (e.g., metoprolol) may be titrated to decrease heart rate prior to the induction of anesthesia. c. Alpha-2 agonists - IV clonidine or can be used preoperatively to produce sedation and attenuate hypertension and tachycardia associated with catecholamine release. 6. Antibiotics a. Often given at the same time as other premedication to establish plasma concentration of the drug pr ior to surgical incision. 44 POST-OP PAIN CONTROL AND PROP HYLAXIS FOR NA USEA/VOMITING Pain control Studies have shown that peri operative pain is better tolerated if patients have been educated about the different modalities for treating pain. Discussing methods for post-op pain control also helps reassure patients that we view pain control as an important issue. According to guidelines for acute pain ma nagement in the perioperative setting41, a pain control plan should be included in th e anesthetic preope rative evaluation. Three techniques for perioperative pain control that ha ve shown efficacy and safety are: 1. Epidural or intrathecal opioid analgesia 2. Intravenous PCA with systemic opioids 3. Regional analgesic technique (including continuous nerve block catheter) At UCSD, the surgeons write the orders for postoperative pain control once the patient leaves the PACU. However it is appropriate and beneficial to discuss the above methods with the patient during the pre-op appointmen t, especially if the patient will be undergoing a particularly painful procedure and could benefit from an epidural or regional technique. The literature suggests th at 2 routes of admi nistration may provide more effective pain control than a single rout e, i.e. having an epidural PLUS getting IV opioids may be more effective than one or the other.41 Prophylaxis for post-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV) Patients who experience PONV are frequently very dissatisfied with their surgical and anesthetic experience. Prophylaxis is not in dicated for all patient s because it increases cost and may lead to undesirable side effect s. However, patients considered to be at increased risk of PONV may benefit from prophylactic treatment. Patient characteristics associated with increased risk of PONV: Females, especially young, thin fema les and those currently menstruating42 Patients with prior history of PONV or easy motion sickness Non-smokers Anesthetic characteristics associat ed with increased risk of PONV: General anesthesia Increased duration of anesthesia Intraoperative use Use of nitrous oxide43 45 IV Propofol-based anesthetic technique decreases risk of PONV44,45 Surgical characteristics associated with increased risk of PONV: Laparoscopic procedures Gynecologic procedures Ophthalmologic procedures, especially strabismus surgery Ear and nasal procedures Shoulder surgery46 Drug therapy for PONV prophylaxis: ondansetron, dolasetron, inhibition of 5-HT 3 receptors in trigger zone (CTZ) 2. Anti-histamines - e.g., diphenhydramine, dimenhydrinate - inhibition of H 1 receptors in the CTZ - also produce sedation 3. Anticholinergics - e.g., scopolamine - scopolamine patch applied pr ior to induction of anesth esia can help prevent PONV - inhibits muscarinic (M 1) and histamine (H 1) receptors in the hypothalamus and CTZ - also produces sedation 4. Butyrophenones - e.g., droperidol, metoclopramide - droperidol blocks dopamine receptors in the chemoreceptor trigger zone - caution with droperidol as it can prol ong QT interval and cause increased sedation - metoclopramide promotes gastric motility, blocks dopamine receptors in the CTZ, and possesses weak antagonist properties for 5-HT 3 receptors 5. Phenothiazines - e.g., promethazine, prochlor perazine (antipsychotics) - block dopamine receptors in the chemoreceptor trigger zone - can produce sedation and extrapyramidal side effects 6. Steroids - e.g., dexamethasone - anti-emetic action not well understood; may inhibit pr ostaglandin or release endorphins47 - most effective when administered prior to induction of anesthesia48 46 INSTRUCTIONS TO PATIENTS 1. Fasting instructions - see below 2. Medication instructions - as detailed earlier 3. Where and what time to arrive 4. What to bring - e.g., inhalers if asthmatic 5. What not to bring (or what they might want to leave with a family member prior to going to OR) - glasses, dentures, jewelry 6. Encourage smoking cessation prior to surgery49 7. Answer any other questions the patient or family has Preoperative fasting instructions50 1. Patients should not have any solid fo ods or nonclear liquids for 6-8 hours prior to surgery. 2. Medications may be taken with a small sip of water up to 2 hours prior to surgery. 3. A small amount (i.e. few sips) of cl ear liquid is OK up to 2 hours prior to surgery. Coffee is considered a clear liquid as long as no cream or milk is added. 4. In practice, we tell our patients not to eat or drink anything after midnight and to take their AM medications 2 hours prior to surgery with a small sip of water. 5. For pediatric cases, no solid foods for 8 hours , formula okay up to 6 hours prior, breast milk okay up to 4 hours prior, and clear liquids okay up to 2 hours prior to surgery.51 6. Patients should understand that if thes e instructions are not followed, their surgery will be delayed or possibly ca ncelled. They should also understand the purpose of these guidelines - i.e. to reduce the risk of pulmonary aspiration. 47 REFERENCES 1.
