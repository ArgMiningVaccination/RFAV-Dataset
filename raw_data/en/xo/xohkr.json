XFE progeroid syndrome is a disease of accelerated aging caused by a defect in DNA repair. NF-B, a transcription factor activated by cellular damage and stress, has increased activity with aging and aging-related chronic diseases. To determine whether NF-B drives aging in response to the accumulation of spontaneous, endogenous DNA damage, we measured the activation of NF-B in WT and progeroid model mice. As both WT and progeroid mice aged, NF-B was activated stochastically in a variety of cell types. Genetic depletion of one allele of the p65 subunit of NF-B or treatment with a pharmacological inhibitor of the NF-B-activating kinase, IKK, delayed the age-related and pathologies of progeroid mice. Additionally, inhibition of NF-B reduced oxidative DNA damage and stress and delayed cellular senescence. These results indicate that the mechanism by which DNA damage drives aging is due in part to NF-B activation. IKK/NF-B inhibitors are sufficient to attenuate this damage and could provide clinical benefit for degenerative changes associated with accelerated aging disorders and normal aging. Jeremy S.
