In this feature, we look at the types and their reported side effects. All data and statistics are based on publicly available data at the time of publication. Some information may be out of date. Visit our [coronavirus hub](/coronavirus) for the most recent information on COVID-19. As the global effort to produce vaccines that can curb the COVID-19 pandemic forges ahead, headlines continue to highlight both developmental breakthroughs and safety concerns. This article summarizes the known side effects of the [33 authorized vaccines](https://covid19.trackvaccines.org/vaccines/) and provides insight into risks that researchers are still investigating. The table below gives an overview of the 33 authorized vaccines, categorized by [type](/articles/how-do-covid-19-vaccines-work#Different-vaccine-types), based on how they function. It also shows their efficacy. Each of the following vaccines has received use authorization in at least one country. produced for Japan. ** Covishield is the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine produced for India. *** COVOVAX is the Novavax vaccine produced for 02, the reported efficacy data have not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal. The [Pfizer](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-covid-19-vaccine) And on January 31, 2022, the FDA granted full approval for the [Moderna](https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/spikevax-and-moderna-covid-19-vaccine) Vaccines allow the body to build immunity by activating T and B lymphocytes, cells that recognize virus infected host cells and those that produce antibodies to combat the virus, respectively. A vaccine cannot cause COVID-19. No vaccine contains a complete form of the virus capable of causing illness. While their body builds immunity, it is normal for a person to experience minor side effects. According to the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/expect/after.html) [World Health Organization (WHO)](https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-vaccines-safety) - a fever - fatigue - headaches - body aches - chills - nausea A person might also experience side effects around the injection site, which is usually the upper arm. These might include swelling, pain, redness, an itchy rash, and other mild forms of irritation. Health authorities recognize that each of the 33 authorized COVID-19 vaccines can cause side effects. These are often mild and last for only a few days. They are not unexpected. Every vaccine facility in the United States has to report specific post-vaccination symptoms, known as adverse events, to the government's Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). Individuals can also submit reports through the [VAERS portal](https://vaers.hhs.gov/reportevent.html). The [(FDA)](https://www.fda.gov/media/146269/download) [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/adverse-events.html) [other regulatory agencies](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/presentation/presentation-safety-monitoring-covid-19-vaccines-peter-arlett_en.pdf) are closely monitoring VAERS to evaluate the safety of the vaccines used in the U.S. Similar systems are in place in other countries. In the United Kingdom, for example, the scheme is called [Yellow Card](https://www.sps.nhs.uk/articles/reporting-suspected-covid-19-vaccine-side-effects-product-defects-and-counterfeit-products/). The [European Union](http://www.adrreports.eu/en/report_side_effect.html) asks people to report suspected side effects to their healthcare practitioners or fill out dedicated online forms. Rarely, a person experiences an allergic reaction to one or more of the ingredients in a vaccine. They might develop [hives](/articles/157260) or another type of skin rash, swelling, and respiratory symptoms. A severe allergic reaction can lead to [anaphylaxis](/articles/216062), and it presents with low [blood pressure](/articles/270644), nausea, and difficulty breathing, among other symptoms. Anaphylaxis is an extremely rare side effect of vaccination. According to the CDC, around [2-5 people per million](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/adverse-events.html) Allergic reactions to mRNA vaccines have been of [particular concern](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/12/suspicions-grow-nanoparticles-pfizer-s-covid-19-vaccine-trigger-rare-allergic-reactions) There are similar concerns about the [Janssen vaccine](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/info-by-product/janssen/downloads/Janssen-Prep-and-Admin-Summary.pdf) A [study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2777417) The data suggest that there is a very low risk of anaphylaxis as a result of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. Regardless, the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/specific-groups/allergies.html) The CDC also recommends that anyone who has had an allergic reaction to one dose of a vaccine not receive a second dose of the same type of vaccine. Side effects appear to be more commonly reported in women than men. A study by CDC researchers shows that [78.7%](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7008e3.htm) Another study observed that females represented [15 out of 16](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2777417) These findings are in line with a [2013 study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X1301342X) on the [H1N1](/articles/147720) vaccine during the 2009 [flu](/articles/15107) pandemic, which found higher rates of hypersensitivity reactions among females of childbearing age than other groups in the study population. Reproductive hormones, such as [estrogen](/articles/277177) and [testosterone](/articles/276013), may play a role in this sex discrepancy. A [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41541-019-0124-6) Recently, there have been new concerns about serious side effects of COVID-19 vaccines. These effects may be coincidental, and there is currently not enough conclusive evidence to link these effects to specific vaccines. However, regulatory agencies are taking precautionary measures to investigate these safety concerns. Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna The Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines are both two-dose [mRNA vaccines](/articles/how-do-mrna-vaccines-work). People have reported similar, common side effects after the second doses of each. These COVID-19 vaccines are the first vaccines approved for use in humans that incorporate mRNA technology. As a result, there are concerns about the long-term effects and a risk of altering the body's genetic information. People may be unaware that researchers have spent many years studying the potential of mRNA vaccine technology. There have been efforts to develop mRNA vaccines in the past, including Moderna's human-based [trial](https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-highlights-opportunity-mrna-vaccines-its-first-vaccines) of an mRNA [Zika virus](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27029595/) Furthermore, it is unlikely that an mRNA vaccine can alter genetic information. The mRNA in a vaccine does not enter the nucleus of a cell, where DNA is stored, and it degrades rather quickly in the body after it serves its purpose. Yet many were alarmed by reports from Norway that [23 people](https://www.bmj.com/content/372/bmj.n149) \"There is a possibility that these common adverse reactions \u2014 that are not dangerous in fitter, younger patients and are not unusual with vaccines \u2014may aggravate underlying disease in the elderly,\" suggests Dr. Steinar Madsen, the medical director of the Norwegian Medicines Agency. \"We are now asking for doctors to continue with the vaccination, but to carry out extra evaluation of very sick people whose underlying condition might be aggravated by it,\" he adds. Another death, which occurred in the U.S., was associated with having a low blood platelet count, or [thrombocytopenia](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health-topics/thrombocytopenia) [20 thrombocytopenia cases](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ajh.26132?af=R) Other concerns involve pregnancy and fertility. According to a February 2021 [statement](https://www.acog.org/news/news-releases/2021/02/medical-experts-assert-covid-vaccines-do-not-impact-fertility) from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine: \"While fertility was not specifically studied in the clinical trials of the vaccine, no loss of fertility has been reported among trial participants or among the millions who have received the vaccines since their authorization, and no signs of infertility appeared in animal studies. Loss of fertility is scientifically unlikely.\" A study conducted on behalf of the CDC v-safe COVID-19 Pregnancy Registry Team \u2014 whose preliminary results appeared in [NEJM](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2104983) on June 17, 2021 \u2014 found that mRNA vaccines did not pose any demonstrable danger to pregnant individuals. And further research, the results of which appeared in the [American Journal of Epidemiology](https://academic.oup.com/aje/advance-article/doi/10.1093/aje/kwac011/6511811) on January 20, 2022, found \"no adverse association between COVID-19 vaccination and fertility.\" There have been some [reports](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/myocarditis.html) Following these reports, on June 25, 2021, the FDA added [revisions](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-june-25-2021) In the patient fact sheets, the FDA [states](https://www.fda.gov/media/144414/download) However, the federal agency also adds that \"[t]he chance of having this occur is very low.\" Moreover, the CDC [notes](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/myocarditis.html) The FDA notes that the myocarditis and pericarditis symptoms that people should keep an eye out for after a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine are chest pain, shortness of breath, and \"feelings of having a fast-beating, fluttering, or pounding heart.\" Here, find links to our dedicated features about the side effects of the [Pfizer](/articles/pfizer-vaccine-for-covid-19-what-are-the-side-effects) and [Moderna](/articles/moderna-covid-19-vaccine-what-to-know-about-side-effects) vaccines. Janssen (Johnson & Johnson) The Janssen vaccine can also cause common vaccine side effects. The vaccine's product information [document](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/product-information/covid-19-vaccine-janssen-epar-product-information_en.pdf) provides details about precautions to take and the expected effects. Following [reports](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2021-04-23/03-COVID-Shimabukuro-508.pdf) [recommended](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/s0413-JJ-vaccine.html) After conducting a safety review, the two federal agencies [lifted](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-and-cdc-lift-recommended-pause-johnson-johnson-janssen-covid-19-vaccine-use-following-thorough) However, they advised that healthcare professionals and vaccine recipients should familiarize themselves with the revised [Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers Administering Vaccine (Vaccination Providers)](https://www.fda.gov/media/146304/download) [Fact Sheet for Recipients and Caregivers](https://www.fda.gov/media/146305/download) The European Medicines Agency's (EMA) safety committee also [advised](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/covid-19-vaccine-janssen-ema-finds-possible-link-very-rare-cases-unusual-blood-clots-low-blood) Janssen to include a warning about TTS in the product information for their COVID-19 vaccine. As of July 12, 2021, the [FDA](https://www.fda.gov/media/150723/download) [Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome](/articles/167892), a rare neurological and autoimmune disorder that causes muscle weakness and paralysis. According to the FDA, symptoms of this syndrome can appear during the first 42 days following vaccination. However, the \"chance of having this occur is very low,\" the agency also notes. [Read more in our dedicated feature about the side effects of the Janssen vaccine.](/articles/pfizer-vaccine-for-covid-19-what-are-the-side-effects) Oxford-AstraZeneca and Serum Institute of India The EMA and Danish Health Authority reported incidents of blood clots in people who received the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. Of the 5 million people who received this vaccine, there have been [30 reported cases](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/covid-19-vaccine-astrazeneca-prac-investigating-cases-thromboembolic-events-vaccines-benefits) of blood clots, as of March 2021. One case in Denmark was fatal. On April 7, 2021, the [EMA](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/astrazenecas-covid-19-vaccine-ema-finds-possible-link-very-rare-cases-unusual-blood-clots-low-blood) concluded that the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine should carry a warning of TTS as a very rare side effect. Multiple countries, including Denmark, Norway, Germany, and France, initially [paused the distribution](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-56357760) of the Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine as a precautionary response to initial reports of blood clots. On April 14, 2021, Denmark [decided](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/world-first-denmark-ditches-astrazenecas-covid-19-shot-2021-04-14/) to stop the distribution of this vaccine entirely. On April 15, the Norwegian Institute of Public Health [recommended](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/norway-should-exclude-jj-astrazeneca-covid-vaccination-scheme-says-commission-2021-05-10/) stopping the distribution of both the Oxford-AstraZeneca and Janssenvaccines in the country, due to the risk of blood clots. Both [Germany](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/third-wave-pandemic-appears-be-broken-german-health-minister-2021-05-07/) and [France](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/i-dont-want-that-france-struggles-pitch-astrazeneca-vaccine-2021-04-19/) have resumed administering the Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine. However, the distribution may eventually halt altogether, as the EU [has not renewed](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/eus-breton-eu-did-not-renew-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-order-after-june-2021-05-09/) its order of Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine doses beyond June 2021. The Serum Institute of India's Covishield is the locally manufactured version of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. As of March 2021, India had [not reported](https://www.businessinsider.in/science/health/news/astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-controversy-from-india-to-europe/articleshow/81527932.cms) any incidents of blood clotting related to Covishield and currently has no plans to discontinue its distribution. Drug regulatory agencies in India are still closely examining the data, however, to ensure that there are no causal links. As with the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, there have been some reports of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome developing in some people who received the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. For this reason, on July 9, 2021, the [EMA](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/meeting-highlights-pharmacovigilance-risk-assessment-committee-prac-5-8-july-2021) recommended adding a warning to the vaccine's label to reflect this potential risk. However, the agency also noted that it is not yet fully confirmed that the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is directly responsible for the development of this disorder in those who experienced it. [Read more in our dedicated feature about the side effects of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine.](/articles/oxford-astrazeneca-vaccine-what-to-know-about-side-effects) Novavax Novavax's COVID-19 vaccine, Nuvaxovid, is which is administered in a [two-dose regimen](https://www.health.gov.au/initiatives-and-programs/covid-19-vaccines/approved-vaccines/novavax#dose-schedule-) According to official data from the Australian Government's Department of Health, side effects after a dose of Nuvaxovid are usually not serious, and the most common ones include: - pain or tenderness at the injection site - tiredness - headaches - muscle or joint pain - generally feeling unwell. These side effects usually fade away after 1-2 days. According to the [EMA](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/product-information/nuvaxovid-epar-product-information_en.pdf), localized adverse reactions are more common after the second dose of Nuvaxovid. Severe allergic reactions to this vaccine are rare, though the Australian Government's Department of Health notes that \"[w]e don't yet know if there are any other rare side effects after Novavax vaccine [...] because only relatively small numbers of people have received this vaccine worldwide.\" People with a known history of allergic reactions to any components of Nuvaxovid may receive a recommendation against taking this vaccine, the Australian Government's Department of Health states. The EMA further advises that this COVID-19 vaccine \"should be given with caution in individuals receiving anticoagulant therapy or those with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder.\" It also cautions that it may be less efficacious in the case of people who are immunocompromised, and that there are insufficient data on the possible side effects of Nuvaxovid in pregnant individuals.

[Read more about the side effects of the Sinovac vaccine.](/articles/sinovac-covid-19-vaccine-what-are-the-side-effects) CoviVac and QazCovid-in There is currently no internationally available information on the possible side effects of either the [CoviVac](https://www.dw.com/en/two-more-russian-vaccines-what-we-do-and-dont-know/a-56811025) or [QazCovid-in](https://www.rferl.org/a/kazakhstan-qazvac-vaccine-worries-research-trials-covid/31240883.html) vaccine. As far as QazCovid-in is concerned, its developers have reassured the public that \"the vaccine is harmless.\" When asked about the lack of published data regarding the vaccine, they responded that they \"don't have time [...] to write articles.\" Anhui Zhifei Longcom There is currently no publicly available peer-reviewed data about the safety or efficacy of the dimeric receptor-binding domain, or RBD-dimer, vaccine. One [preprint paper](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.20.20248602v1) states that no serious adverse events were reported during a trial. FBRI EpiVacCorona is Russia's second approved COVID-19 vaccine, and trials to determine its safety and efficacy are ongoing. Tatyana Golikova, the country's deputy prime minister, [notes](https://www.precisionvaccinations.com/vaccines/epivaccorona-vaccine): \"Unlike the first Russian vaccine, Sputnik V, which is an adenoviral vector vaccine, the new vaccine [...] consists of artificially synthesized short fragments of viral proteins, peptides, through which the immune system learns and subsequently recognizes and neutralizes the virus.\" Any form of medical treatment carries risks, but in many cases, these are outweighed by the benefits. The [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/info-by-product/clinical-considerations.html#Contraindications) Receiving a vaccine does not guarantee full protection against COVID-19. People must continue to follow social distancing guidelines, wear a mask in public, and wash their hands frequently, among other precautions.
