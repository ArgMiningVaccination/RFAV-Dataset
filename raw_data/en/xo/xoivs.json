[9](/chapter/3062821#fm7_9)The issue of transformation in Chinese pharmacy has been explored in Carla Nappi's study of a sixteenth-century pharmacological text chiefly through the lens of natural history. See Nappi, Monkey and the Inkpot. The transformative power of medicines is not unique to Chinese pharmacy, as it figures in other healing traditions as well. See Whyte, van der Geest, and Hardon, eds., Social Lives of Medicines, 5-6. [10](/chapter/3062821#fm7_10)In the same vein, focusing on three medical writings in the seventh and eighth centuries, Kuo Ho-Hsiang has examined the historical meanings of du in these sources. See Kuo, \"Sui-Tang yiji zhong Orpiment is an arsenic ore. [14](/chapter/3062821#fm7_14)It is entirely possible that the knowledge of the medical use of poisons was exchanged between China and India in the premodern period. One telling example is the claim by Sun Simiao cited earlier, which he ascribed to Jvaka, the \"Medicine King\" of India, indicating the influence of Indian pharmacological thought on Sun's work.

[20](/chapter/3062821#fm7_20)No medical works devoted to poisons and antidotes appeared in China until the late sixteenth century, possibly influenced by European medicine. One such text is Formulas to Counter a Hundred Poisons (Jie baidu fang) compiled by Gao Lian (1573-1620). [21](/chapter/3062821#fm7_21)Beck, De Materia Medica, 281 (IV Pharmacy and 65-66.

Throughout this book, I use \"classical Chinese medicine\" or \"classical Chinese pharmacy\" as shorthand terms to refer to medical or pharmaceutical traditions before the nineteenth century.

[27](/chapter/3062821#fm7_27)The definition of the medieval period in China remains a contested issue due to the different historical experiences of China and Europe. The debates are also linked to the issue of the starting point of Chinese modernity, which some scholars have dated as early as the tenth century (see discussion below). This book is not a place to adjudicate these debates. Rather, I use the term as shorthand to refer to the period from the post-Han to the mid-Tang (third to eighth century). See Brook, \"Medievality and the Chinese Sense of History,\" 145-64; Knapp, \"Did the Middle Kingdom Have a and Holcombe, \"Was Medieval China Medieval?,\" 106-17.

[40](/chapter/3062821#fm7_40)From a comparative perspective, the role of the state in regulating medicine was less pronounced in medieval Europe than it was in China during the same period. In the early medieval period (fifth to tenth century), monasteries were the major sites of the production for medical writings; in the late medieval period (eleventh to fifteenth century), universities took a leading role in generating scholarly works on medicine. See Siraisi, Medieval and Early Renaissance Medicine.

In his commentary, Tao offers elaborate explanations of drugs, often based on his own observations or other people's words. See Chen Yuanpeng, de zhishi leixing,\" 212. An example of the latter is Wang Tao's Arcane Essentials from the Imperial Library (Waitai miyao fang, 752). In this text, Wang specifies the source of every formula, revealing his scholarly effort to compile medical information based on existing books.

CHAPTER 1: THE PARADOX OF DU Epigraph: \"Zur early study of du, the historian Yu Yan contends that the definition of \"thickness\" for du implies a negative sense of harmfulness. I interpret hou as a neutral word that could indicate either harm or benefit. See Yu Yan, \"Duyao bian,\" 1-4. [6](/chapter/3062823#chapter1_6)This graph of du is the prevailing way of writing the character in excavated manuscripts from the Qin and Han periods. Information from the Multi-function Chinese Character Database (http://humanum.arts.cuhk.edu.hk/Lexis/lexi-mf/search.php?word=%E6%AF%92, accessed August 1, 2020). [7](/chapter/3062823#chapter1_7)Xu Shen, Shuowen jiezi, 1b.18. The earliest appearance of the character fu is in The Book of Odes (Shijing), which refers to an unsavory vegetable that one can eat to stave off starvation. See Maoshi zhengyi, word \"toxic\" is derived from the Greek word toxon, which means \"bow,\" or toxikon, which means \"pertaining to a bow,\" indicating a similar involvement of poisons in hunting or warfare. See Stevenson, Meaning of Poison, 3-4. On the arguably earliest evidence of using poisons in hunting activities (24,000 years ago), see d'Errico et al., \"Early Evidence of San Material Culture,\" 13214-19. On the military use of poisons in ancient China, see Bisset, \"Arrow Poisons in China. Part I,\" 325-84. [10](/chapter/3062823#chapter1_10)Boltz, Origin and Early Development of System. [11](/chapter/3062823#chapter1_11)Gu Yewang, Songben yupian, 25.467. [12](/chapter/3062823#chapter1_12)I thank Constance Cook for sharing her unpublished research on reading the oracle bone graph of du. See her \"Exorcism and the Spirit Turtle,\" forthcoming. des Terminus tu ,\" 166. The ancient pronunciations of du and shu are *[d]uk and *[d]uk, respectively. Information acquired from the Baxter-Sagart reconstruction of Old Chinese (http://ocbaxtersagart.lsait.lsa.umich.edu/, accessed August 1, 2020). Relatedly, James Matisoff has interpreted the original meaning of du as \"a pregnant woman revolted by food\" (https://stedt.berkeley.edu/~stedt-cgi/rootcanal.pl/etymon/2202, accessed August 1, 2020). This interpretation, though, requires further evidence. I thank Laurent Sagart for bringing Matisoff's interpretation to my attention. [17](/chapter/3062823#chapter1_17)Zhouyi zhengyi, 2.60-61. [18](/chapter/3062823#chapter1_18)Du meaning \"govern\" only appears in the commentary section of The Classic of Changes, which is a later addition. This suggests that this meaning developed later, possibly during the Warring States period (476-221 BCE). [19](/chapter/3062823#chapter1_19)Laozi jiaoshi, of the chapter was rendered by Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Obringer, in his L'aconit et l'orpiment, 275-83. [28](/chapter/3062823#chapter1_28)On the relationship between du, fire, and heat during the Han period, see Li Jianmin, L\u00fcxingzhe de shixue, 112-15. Wang was not the first person who linked du to words. In a collection of excavated manuscripts dating to the third century BCE, we find a similar connection in a legal context, where powerful words are believed to disrupt social harmony. See Hulsew\u00e9, Remnants of Ch'in 19.629-30. [32](/chapter/3062823#chapter1_32)On the historical role of the sages in Han medical texts, see Chin, Zhongguo gudai on the origins of the materia medica genre in China, see Yamada Keiji, Literature, 98-109. [36](/chapter/3062823#chapter1_36)Among ancient works on natural history in China, the third-century Record of Comprehensive Things (Bowu zhi) by Zhang Hua is particularly important. The text has been lost, but fragments of it, including a short section on drugs, are preserved in later sources. See Zhang Hua, China, 89-109. [39](/chapter/3062823#chapter1_39)Ban, Hanshu, 30.1776-80. [40](/chapter/3062823#chapter1_40)The Han text has long been lost, but its content has been preserved in later materia medica sources, based on which a number of modern reconstructions have been produced. In my analysis, I rely on Shang Zhijun's edition to examine the text. [41](/chapter/3062823#chapter1_41)Shennong bencao jing jiaozhu, 1.1-3. The translation is mine in consultation with Unschuld, Medicine in China, 19; Lloyd and Sivin, Way and the Word, 232-33; must point out that the classification of drugs based on their du is not absolute in The Divine Farmer's Classic. For example, there are some du-possessing drugs in the top group, which I will examine in [part III](/chapter/3062829). In addition, many top-level drugs, in addition to their life-enhancement properties, can also cure sickness. However, rarely can we find an example in the text where a bottom-level drug can promote longevity. In other words, top-level drugs tend to be versatile, while those at the bottom are more restricted to treating illness. [45](/chapter/3062823#chapter1_45)Huangdi neijing suwen jiaozhu, 5.82-91. Viscera as defined in Chinese medicine cannot be reduced to anatomical organs in modern biomedicine but are functional units that act in concert in the body. Because of this, I capitalize the organ names in English to signal this difference. See Sivin, Traditional Medicine in Contemporary China, 124-33. [46](/chapter/3062823#chapter1_46)Scholars hold different views on this point. Some believe that, in order to maintain consistency between the preface and the rest of the text, the du status of each drug is specified in The Divine Farmer's Classic. Others have contended instead that this information was added later. These scholars point to a strong piece of evidence from a commentary text to buttress their claim (more on this in the following section). Moreover, there are other characteristics of drugs that are outlined in the preface but not specified in the main text. I am thus inclined to agree with the view that the definition of du for each drug is a later addition. See Shennong bencao China; Pregadio, Great Clarity. [49](/chapter/3062823#chapter1_49)Tao, Bencao jing jizhu, 1.30. Fan in the title likely refers to Fan Wang, a fourth-century officer of the Eastern Jin who excelled at medicine. See Fan Xingzhun, Zhongguo yixue shil\u00fce, 59. [50](/chapter/3062823#chapter1_50)Wei Zheng et [53](/chapter/3062823#chapter1_53)The specification of the du status for individual drugs is already seen in the third-century Materia Medica of Wu Pu (Wu Pu bencao), which is extant only in fragments. Unlike Collected Annotations, the book simply juxtaposes accounts on each drug from disparate sources without a synthesis. See Wu, Wu Pu bencao. [54](/chapter/3062823#chapter1_54)Chen Hao, Shenfen xushi possible, based on Iwamoto Atsushi's research, that the Tang court modified Tao's writing system when they copied his work, making the precise recovery of Tao's original text impossible. See Iwamoto, Tdai no iyakusho text of materia medica that is still extant to us is the Materia Medica Prepared for Emergency, Verified and Classified from the Classics and Histories (Jingshi zhenglei beiji bencao, eleventh century, often abbreviated as Zhenglei bencao), compiled by Tang Shenwei during the Northern Song dynasty. This is the text that modern scholars have used to reconstruct the whole texts of The Divine Farmer's Classic and Collected Annotations. [60](/chapter/3062823#chapter1_60)The second-century scholar Zheng Xuan, in his commentary to the ancient text Rites of Zhou, defines five types of drugs based on their natural category (herbs, trees, worms, stones, and grains). See Zhouli zhushu, 5.132. Scholars have offered various explanations for Tao's novel organization of drugs, including Indian influence, possibly facilitated by the transmission of Buddhism (Liao Yuqun, from Confucian writings where \"natural categories\" are invoked to assist political governance and offer moral guidance (Yamada Keiji, Honz to yume to renkinjutsu to, 67-72). To understand Tao's organizational scheme, it is also necessary to align this medical text with his Daoist writings. Tao seems fascinated with the number seven: both of his Daoist works, Declarations of the Perfected and Secret Instructions for Ascending for Perfection, contain seven scrolls. He claims that this organization corresponds to the seven stars of the Northern Dipper (aka the Big Dipper) that guide earthly patterns. Worshipping the Northern Dipper was an important Daoist ritual in premodern China. The numerological significance of seven in Collected Annotations is thus consistent with the cosmological thinking that undergirds his Daoist works. See Tao, Zhen'gao (HY 1016), 19.3a; Mollier, Buddhism and Taoism Face to Face, 134-73. [61](/chapter/3062823#chapter1_61)This calculation does not include the 178 drugs that \"have names but are not used anymore\" and the 81 drugs whose du statuses are not specified. Out of the 108 du-possessing drugs, 23 are new in Collected Annotations. From a comparative perspective, among major pharmacological treatises produced in Greek antiquity, about 10 percent of the drugs are perceived to be toxic. See Touwaide, \"Les poisons dans le monde antique et byzantin,\" 268. [62](/chapter/3062823#chapter1_62)The precise correspondence between the name of a drug in Chinese pharmacy and its modern referent is often difficult to identify due to the various, sometimes conflicting descriptions of the medicine across different sources. Throughout this book, I use either the common names in English to translate these substances when possible, or sometimes in the case of plants, the name of the genus instead of the species in order to leave some ambiguity granted by the sources. My identification of drugs is guided by Sivin, Chinese Alchemy, 272-94; Shiu-ying Hu, Enumeration of offspring\" refers to the side tubers of the herb. See the more detailed discussion of aconite in [chapter 2](/chapter/3062824). [65](/chapter/3062823#chapter1_65)According to Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Obringer's calculation, 10 percent of prescriptions in an eighth-century formula book use aconite. signals the use of a measure that appears to temporarily solve an urgent problem but actually leads to disasters. See Fan Ye, Hou Hanshu, 48.1616. [71](/chapter/3062823#chapter1_71)For a study of the zhen bird, see Mayanagi, \"Chintori,\" 151-85. Could a bird's feathers be so poisonous?

See Guo, San zhi shisi shiji 7.499-500 in the same book. On hallucinogenic drugs in classical Chinese pharmacy, Besides The Divine Farmer's Classic, Tao also consulted a treatise dedicated to drug combinations titled Drug Correspondences (Yaodui) to compile this [22](/chapter/3062824#chapter2_22)On the discussion of dragon's bone, which probably refers to fossilized animal bones, see Nappi, Monkey and the Inkpot, 50-68.

[31](/chapter/3062824#chapter2_31)A different term with the same pronunciation, paozhi (roast to restrain), is commonly found in modern pharmaceutical writings in China. This term only started to appear in twelfth-century texts, then gradually became the dominant phrase to designate drug processing. See Zheng Jinsheng, Yaolin a third character in the poem, fan, which refers to the roasting of dry meat. [35](/chapter/3062824#chapter2_35)Liji zhengyi, 28.997.

See cultural premodern China, see Wei Bing, [43](/chapter/3062824#chapter2_43)Harper, Early Chinese Medical Literature, 105. Wuhui, which literally means \"black beak,\" refers to the main tubers of aconite with a split, resembling a bird's bill. See Tao, Bencao jing jizhu, 5.343. [44](/chapter/3062824#chapter2_44)Harper, Early Chinese Medical Literature, 352-53. The use of aconite for speedy travel is also recorded in Ten Thousand Things (Wanwu), excavated from Shuanggudui (ca. 165 BCE), in which it is claimed that the ingestion of the plant enables both humans and horses to run fast. See Fuyang Hanjian a disease category originating during the Eastern Han period, refers to a set of acute, severe, and often infectious conditions characterized by fever. See Mitchell, Ye, and Wiseman, Shang Han Lun, 9-19. [46](/chapter/3062824#chapter2_46)Yang and Brown, \"Wuwei Medical Manuscripts,\" 241-301. On the formulas including aconite, see 258, 259, 260, 265, 274, 279, 280, 283-84, 286, 288, 291-92, 293-94, Jijiu pian, 4.276-77. [48](/chapter/3062824#chapter2_48)This estimation is based on a list of commodities with their prices from the Juyan manuscripts (Yu Xin, Zhonggu yixiang, 201). Silk was affordable during the Han period, as it was used as a common writing material (Tsien, Written on Bamboo and Silk, 130). [49](/chapter/3062824#chapter2_49)Shennong bencao jing jiaozhu, 1.8. The cold and hot maladies refer to those pathological conditions with typical symptoms of chilling and heating sensations, respectively. This principle of opposites, of course, is not unique to Chinese medicine; a wide variety of healing traditions around the world rely on it to treat illnesses. See Anderson, \"'Heating' and 'Cooling' Foods in Hong Kong and Taiwan,\" 237-68; and Messer, \"Hot/Cold Classifications and 149-67.

The term has been variously translated as \"masters of methods,\" \"recipe gentlemen,\" and \"technicians,\" among others. In the eyes of Han literati, they sometimes appeared to be \"quacks,\" especially when they tried to use their occult arts to gain imperial favor and posed a threat to established orders. But this is not always the case, as Han texts also portray them, especially those with no political ambitions, as talented masters with extraordinary faculties. Due to the historical complexity of the term, I leave it untranslated in this book.

Earlier scholars have tried to draw a correspondence between demonic infestation and a disease in modern biomedicine, for example, by identifying it as tuberculosis (Yu Yan, Gudai jibing minghou shuyi, 223; Fan Xinzhun, Zhongguo bingshi xinyi, 96-99). More recently, scholars have shifted to examining demonic influence as part of the cultural fabric of premodern China without flattening the illness to fit it into a modern disease category (Sivin, Chinese Alchemy, 297; Li Jianmin, \"They Shall Expel Demons,\" 1132-47). I adopt the approach of the latter group in exploring the rich and changing meanings of demonic infestation in its own cultural milieu. For an exemplary historical study of the disease foot qi in Chinese medicine's own framework, see Hilary Smith, Forgotten Disease.

[76](/chapter/3062826#chapter3_76)The phrase first appeared in The Record of Clouds and Mist Passing before One's Eyes (Yunyan guoyan lu) by the Song scholar Zhou Mi (1232-1298). The text describes a foreign material called \"Khottal rhino horn\" (guduo xi), which the author identified as actually the horn of a snake. The substance was extremely poisonous but could also counteract poisons. The logic, the author reasoned, was to \"use poison to attack poison.\" See Weitz, Zhou Mi's \"Record of Clouds and Mist Passing before One's Eyes,\" 82, 312. I am indebted to Fan Ka-wai for bringing this reference to my attention. On the development of this idea in the Buddhist context, see Chen Ming, Zhonggu yiliao yu wailai wenhua, 440. [77](/chapter/3062826#chapter3_77)Comparatively, we find a similar logic in homeopathy. Developed by the German physician Samuel Hahnemann (1755-1843), the therapy, based on the \"principle of similars,\" uses the pathogenic agent diluted to infinitesimal amounts to cure the disease it causes. Although the rationale of homeopathy resembles that of the medical use of poisons in China, they are also substantially different: the latter never involves ultrahigh dilutions of medicines, and the former is not about purging the body. See Jonas, Kaptchuk, and Linde, \"Critical 629-47; Rosenberg, Explaining Epidemics and Other Studies in the models are not categorically distinct but often work in a linked and dynamic manner in Chinese medical traditions. For example, Chao Yuanfang, in his On the Origins and Symptoms, fuses the concept of demons with qi; that is, he uses demonic qi to explain a variety of maladies. This approach allows him to tie the ontological etiology to the physiology of the body as expounded by the ancient classics. For detailed analysis of the entanglement of the two models, see Yan Liu, \"Words, Demons, and Epigraph: Su Xinxiu bencao, 1. [1](/chapter/3062827#chapter4_1)Wang Pu, Tang huiyao, 82.1522-23.

Instigated from the north by the Tang general An Lushan in 755, it triggered a seven-year war that devastated the Tang empire. Although the revolt was eventually suppressed in 763, Tang power was subsequently weakened and decentralized. See Hansen, Open Empire, 201-34.

See Fan Ka-wai, al., Tang liudian, 26.667. The Tang princes lived in the Eastern Palace, a different site from the emperors' residence, and hence they were served by a separate medical office.

[11](/chapter/3062827#chapter4_11)The document is preserved in the Pavilion of Heavenly One (Tianyi Ge) in Ningbo, a private library established in the sixteenth century. Previously thought to be a Ming (1368-1644) text, it was rediscovered in 1998 to be part of a long-lost legal document titled Ordinances of the Tiansheng Era (Tiansheng ling) completed in 1029. Significantly, the document contains almost five hundred Tang ordinances dating to the eighth century, many of which are not seen in other extant sources. See Dai, \"Tianyi Ge as an abbreviation for gongren huanfang (ward for the sick palace maids). The ward, established in the two capitals (Chang'an and Luoyang), offered medical services to the palace maids who were seriously ill. It had its own drug depot, as well as personnel dispatched by the Imperial Medical Office. See Ouyang Xiu, Xin Tangshu, 48.1244-45; and Ishino, \"Tdai ryky no different type of organization called \"the ward of compassion field and recuperation\" (beitian yangbing fang) or simply \"the ward of recuperation\" (bingfang) was established at the beginning of the eighth century. Based in Buddhist monasteries, they were state-organized charity sites that provided housing, food, and basic care for the elderly, invalids, and the poor. See Wang Pu, Tang huiyao, 49.862-63; Liu Shu-fen, Cibei qingjing, 41-54. [15](/chapter/3062827#chapter4_15)The Gates Office (Mensi) was part of the palace guard system that inspected articles that either entered or exited the palace. See Li Linfu et al., Tang to the lack of corroboration from other sources during the Tang period, the dating of this ordinance is not conclusive. Aconite was not on this list probably because it was frequently used as a medicine, much more so than the other two poisons (see [chapter 2](/chapter/3062824)). [22](/chapter/3062827#chapter4_22)Li Linfu et al., Tang liudian, 14.392, 409-10. [23](/chapter/3062827#chapter4_23)The two capitals refer to the main capital of Chang'an in the west and the second capital of Luoyang in the east.

For a comprehensive list of drugs with their locations in the early Tang period, see Sun, Qianjin \"Tangdai tugong ziliao xinian,\" 60-65, 59. Early scholarship focuses on the symbolic function of these tribute items (Hibino, \"Shin tjo chirishi no tok nitsuite,\" 83-99) while more recent studies point out their practical uses (Yu Xin, Zhonggu yixiang, 267- 93). [31](/chapter/3062827#chapter4_31)Du, Tongdian, 6.112-31. According to one modern scholar's research, these tribute items were collected between 742 and is slightly different from Huang's, based on my own analysis. The grouping of medicines and foods is by no means definitive, as it is often hard to distinguish them in premodern China. Samarkand, 192-93. Bovine bezoar was another costly product on the list that prompted many counterfeits on the market. See Su et al., is often touted as the first pharmacopoeia in the world, which appeared eight centuries earlier than The Nuremberg Pharmacopoeia in Europe (1542). Yet it is important to note that the Tang text did not in and of itself impose legal regulation of drug prescription, as was evident in the European work. Rather, it functioned as a guidebook for the imperial collection and use of drugs. See Unschuld, Medicine in China, 47. [41](/chapter/3062827#chapter4_41)Fan Ka-wai, Dayi jingcheng, 81. During the Tang period, foot qi was a condition whose symptoms were swelling of the feet or the lower legs, perceived of as the result of a plump body. See Hilary Smith, Forgotten Disease, 43-65. [42](/chapter/3062827#chapter4_42)Su et al., Xinxiu bencao (Japan edition), 15.216-20. For a detailed study of these authors, see Wang, Zhang, and Yin, [46](/chapter/3062827#chapter4_46)Similar to pharmacological texts in China, Newly Revised Materia Medica has long been lost to us, but its drug entries, together with a modified preface, have been preserved in Song materia medica texts thanks to the commentary tradition, allowing for the recovery of the Tang treatise. That being said, there are several manuscript fragments dating to the Tang period that contain sections of Newly Revised Materia Medica, among which the newly released one from the Kyu Shku Collection preserves a preface that is markedly different from the Song editions. [47](/chapter/3062827#chapter4_47)The term jiaoli , in Fan Ka-wai's view, should be read as yaoli , which refers to the rule of Sage Yao in high antiquity, corresponding to the phase of Fire (li) in the dynastic cycle. Some Han scholars claimed that their dynasty matched the same propitious phase. Hence, I translate the term as \"propitious fortune.\" See Chang Shu-hao, \"Xihan 'yao hou de chengli,\" 1-27. I thank Fan Ka-wai for suggesting this interpretation. [48](/chapter/3062827#chapter4_48)Zhou here refers to the dynasty of the Northern Zhou (557-581) that the Sui dynasty superseded. Certain Tang scholars, regarding the regimes of the Era of Division as unorthodox, traced the lineage of the Tang directly back to the orthodox rule of the Han dynasty. See Rao, Zhongguo shixue shang zhi zhengtong 040R, reprinted in Tonk hiky, vol. 1. The passage is incomplete, and in this reading, a gap is filled by the historian Iwamoto Atsushi based on a thirteenth-century Japanese medical work. The practice of consuming huangjing to prolong life was popular among Daoist adepts and social elites from the Era of Division to the Tang period. See Fan Ka-wai, Zhonggu shiqi de yizhe yu bingzhe, 304-9; and 84-98. [60](/chapter/3062827#chapter4_60)Wang huiyao, 82.1805; Li Fang et al., Taiping yulan, 724.3338a. On a modern reconstruction of some of the formulas in Guangji fang, see Feng, Gu fangshu jiyi, 26-92. [61](/chapter/3062827#chapter4_61)We also see such practice in the Buddhist context. For example, a collection of formulas was carved on one of the Buddhist grottos in Longmen (in present-day Henan) in the mid-seventh century, likely for the same reason of making useful medical knowledge available to the public. See Zhang, Wang, and Stanley-Baker, \"Earliest Stone Medical Inscription,\" 33.915. [63](/chapter/3062827#chapter4_63)Dunhuang manuscript P. 3714.

[4](/chapter/3062828#chapter5_4)Prior to the Song dynasty, the term appears in a collection of miracle tales (fifth or sixth century) and denotes the efficacy of divination techniques.

It is also possible that the name refers to a different text since we find several medical works with such a title in the Sui and Tang bibliographical records. [18](/chapter/3062828#chapter5_18)Gan exact year of Sun's birth is still debatable given the contradictory accounts in different sources. A new piece of evidence, the epitaph of Sun Xing, one of Sun's sons, indicates that the physician's time of birth might have been the late sixth century. Since Sun died in 682, he was a centenarian, which is possible given the emphasis in his works on the cultivation of longevity. See Hu Mingzhao, Shenfen xushi zhishi [25](/chapter/3062828#chapter5_25)Ingesting water (fushui) refers to a fasting practice that involved the ritual imbibing of water. Both Daoist and Buddhist adepts during the Tang period adopted the technique to cultivate longevity and obtain transcendence. See Fan of Essential Formulas have long been lost. The earliest complete copy of the text is the Song edition produced in the eleventh century. A different edition of the text (Sun Zhenren qianjin fang), which contains twenty scrolls, was discovered in the late eighteenth century and is considered to bear fewer traces of Song editorial changes and to preserve more features of the Tang text. My study relies on this edition for the extant scrolls (juan 1-5, 11-15, 21-30) and the Song edition for the rest of the scrolls (juan 6-10, 16-20). Moreover, I also consulted a Japanese edition (Zhenben qianjin fang) dated to the fourteenth century, with only the first scroll extant that preserves certain Tang traits of the book. See Okanishi, S izen iki k, 795-835. [30](/chapter/3062828#chapter5_30)The preface is based on the Japanese edition Zhenben qianjin fang. See Sun, Sun explanation of these schemes, see Sivin, Traditional Medicine in Contemporary China, 43-80. [34](/chapter/3062828#chapter5_34)On Bian Que in the history of Chinese medicine, see Brown, Art of Medicine in Early China, 41-62. Sun valued the works of these ancient figures, making it clear in the preface that he believed these eminent physicians possessed true medical knowledge originating in the distant past. [36](/chapter/3062828#chapter5_36)Sun, Sun Zhenren qianjin fang, 1.9-10. [37](/chapter/3062828#chapter5_37)This is most evident in juan 26, which includes more than four hundred formulas. Most of them use only one ingredient to treat emergencies such as sudden death, snake poisoning, injuries caused by beatings, and burns. Tellingly, Sun offers no theoretical discussion at all in this section. [38](/chapter/3062828#chapter5_38)Sun, Sun Zhenren 12.199-211, 23.345-77. [43](/chapter/3062828#chapter5_43)The specific mention of eighteen years of no pregnancies in this formula indicates that such information was derived from a particular medical case. [44](/chapter/3062828#chapter5_44)During the Tang period, one liang was equivalent to about forty grams; one fen, a quarter of a liang, was equivalent to about ten grams. See Guo, San zhi shisi shiji Zhongguo de quanheng fang, 2.28. [46](/chapter/3062828#chapter5_46)Although this formula doesn't specify what these effects are, other medical texts point out that aconite could induce the sensations of numbness and dizziness. See Jingui yaol\u00fce, 2.70. [47](/chapter/3062828#chapter5_47)Sun attributes another formula in his book to the magistrate of the Northern Land, who, as Sun specifies, is a figure in the Eastern Han dynasty. See Sun, Sun Zhenren qianjin fang, 15.280. examples of these phrases, see Sun, Sun coined by the historian of medicine Claire Jones. In her study of medieval English medical manuscripts, she identified these phrases at the end of many formulas and argued that they reveal the authoritative or popular voice rather than empirical knowledge. See Jones, \"Formula and Formulation,\" 199-209. [52](/chapter/3062828#chapter5_52)For example, see and Yao Sengyuan, Jiyan fang. [53](/chapter/3062828#chapter5_53)For a translation and brief analysis of some of these cases, see Sivin, \"Seventh-Century Chinese Medical involved the formation of a coagulation in the abdomen upon eating celery. See 21.297- 98. Later medical cases during the early modern period give patients a stronger voice to negotiate therapeutic options with physicians. See Tu, Jiuming; and Bian, \"Documenting Medications,\" 103-23. A similar phenomenon also arose in early modern Europe. See Pomata, Contracting a Cure. [58](/chapter/3062828#chapter5_58)Sun, Sun Zhenren qianjin fang, 24.401-2. \"Great wind\" refers to a severe, wind-induced condition, the symptoms of which resemble leprosy. See Leung, Leprosy in China, 17-59. Zizhen could be the name of a court physician who appears in another medical case of Sun (see my discussion later in this section). [63](/chapter/3062828#chapter5_63)Sun, Sun Zhenren qianjin fang, 23.349. [64](/chapter/3062828#chapter5_64)Sun included the formula from Granny Rong of Qizhou elsewhere in the same section of his book (Sun, Sun Zhenren qianjin fang, 23.347). It merits our attention that both this formula and the one from Gan Zizhen are linked to elderly women, indicating their role in medicinal preparation that likely took place in domestic spaces.

[74](/chapter/3062828#chapter5_74)This worldview, that the highest principle, or Dao, is utterly inscrutable and unpredictable, can be traced back to the ancient philosophical works Laozi and Zhuangzi. See Sivin, \"On the Limits fang, 1.3. [77](/chapter/3062828#chapter5_77)Classical Chinese medicine considers the Spleen and the Stomach to be closely related. The qi of the Spleen fosters the digestion of grains in the Stomach. To treat diarrhea, therefore, one needs to tackle the root of the problem, namely, the malfunction of the Spleen. See Chao, Zhubing yuanhou lun jiaozhu, 17.522. [78](/chapter/3062828#chapter5_78)In a separate passage, Sun remarks that drugs such as ginger, cinnamon, and ginseng were expensive and hard to obtain during his time. See Sun, Beiji 23.357-58. use 107-18. [84](/chapter/3062828#chapter5_84)This epistemic orientation became more pronounced during the Song period, when scholar-officials integrated personal experience of healing and empirical knowledge in general into their writings. See Chen Yun-ju, \"Accounts of Treating Zhang (\"miasma\") Nanshi, 32.839-40. The physician Xu Sibo in this story came from the prestigious Xu family, practitioners of medicine for eight generations. See Fan Ka-wai, origin story can be found in later physicians' works. See Chao, Zhubing yuanhou lun and Political Philosophy in China.

See Chen Shou, Sanguo zhi guanxi,\" of ingesting elixirs to achieve the transcendence of the body. These two goals, namely, the enhancement of life and the transformation of the body, entailed related but distinct practices. Sharing Qin's view, Tao Hongjing also placed Five-Stone Powder in the category of \"worldly formulas\" rather than the eminent monk Huiyuan (334-416), who took the powder at an old age, as well as the monks Zhibin and Daohong, who both produced medical writings on the powder. See Huijiao, Gaoseng zhuan, 6.221-22; 2.44. An important detail of the story is that the emperor only started to suffer from the powder after the Prefect of Grand Physicians, who might have been involved in prescribing the powder for the monarch, died, suggesting that medical guidance was central to the proper use of the drug. [19](/chapter/3062830#chapter6_19)Shen Ruiwen, In the history of Chinese medicine, Huangfu Mi has been primarily remembered as a medical scholar who capably compiled and edited ancient medical classics.

The kingdom of Nanyue, with its capital in Panyu (present-day Guangzhou), was established by a Qin general during the chaotic period of the Qin-Han transition, and later annexed to the Han empire in 111 BCE. See Twitchett and Loewe, eds., Cambridge History of China, are preserved in Sun Simiao's Qianjin yifang, juan 22. See also the summary of these formulas in Obringer, L'aconit et l'orpiment, 153-61.

Sun Simiao placed him among a group of eminent physicians during the Era of Division and included two formulas from Jin in his medical work. See Sun, Sun Zhenren qianjin fang, 2.168-69. Modern chemical analysis has shown that heating can reduce the toxicity of arsenolite. See Wang Kuike et al., \"Shen de lishi zai Zhongguo,\" 14-38. [42](/chapter/3062830#chapter6_42)This hypothesis was proposed by the historian of chemistry Wang Kuike. See Wang [44](/chapter/3062830#chapter6_44)Needham et al., Science and Civilisation in China, vol. 5, pt. II, 141, 142, 143, 144, 152, 154, 168. The exceptions are limonite (plain) and kalinite (cooling). Given kalinite is the only cooling agent on the list, it is possible that arsenolite, rather than kalinite, was actually used in the powder. [48](/chapter/3062830#chapter6_48)Tao, Bencao jing jizhu, 2.168. Arsenic poisoning causes the inflammation of the stomach, vomiting, and diarrhea, leading to extreme thirst and dehydration. These symptoms are consistent with the warming nature of the mineral as defined in Chinese materia medica texts. See Whorton, Arsenic Century, 7-16. [49](/chapter/3062830#chapter6_49)The text has long been lost, but sections of it have been preserved in later medical works. The discussion on Five-Stone Powder is preserved in Yixin fang/Ishimp, juan 19. A similar passage is also in Liu Xu the monk Huiyi, the latter by Qin Chengzu. [60](/chapter/3062830#chapter6_60)Tao's comment is cited in Formulas of the Lesser Grade (fifth century), which is preserved in Arcane Essentials from the Imperial Library (eighth century). See Wang Tao, Waitai miyao fang, 37.752. \"Waiting at the stump\" is a reference to a story in the ancient philosophical text Hanfeizi. In the story, a farmer had the good fortune of obtaining a rabbit who had accidentally run into a stump and died. After that, he waited at the stump, expecting more such fortunes, but to no avail. See Hanfeizi jijie, 25.413-17. Little is known about Daohong, and only excerpts of his text are preserved in Sui and Tang medical sources. According to On the Origins and Symptoms of All Illnesses, he lived in the south during the Era of Division and excelled at treating the disorders caused by Five-Stone Powder. See Chao, most famous case is that of the Tang scholar Han Yu (768-824), who allegedly suffered from sulfur poisoning. See Hu and Hu, \"Han Yu 'zuruo buneng 22.261a. The five and seven injuries refer to severe conditions of viscera depletion, especially the depletion of the Kidneys that leads to sexual malfunction. See Chao, not the first physician to propose the highly restrictive use of the powder. The sixth-century physician Yao Sengyuan held a similar view. In a medical case described in The History of the Zhou, he encountered a patient who contracted a qi disorder that led to panting and fluster. The family of the patient was tempted to treat him with Five-Stone Powder, probably intrigued by its panacea reputation. Yao rejected the idea and prescribed a specific formula that cured the patient. See Linghu, Zhoushu, 47.841-42. detailed study of the culture of ingesting stalactite during the Tang fang, 25.412-13. [74](/chapter/3062830#chapter6_74)Lu Xun, 35-38. The similarity between Five-Stone Powder and opium was first proposed by the Qing scholar Yu Zhengxie (1775-1840). See Yu Zhengxie, Chinesischen Social of Opium in China. Wagner, \"Lebensstil und Drogen im [2](/chapter/3062831#chapter7_2)Lard (zhufang) was mainly used for making ointments in Chinese medicine. Occasionally it was ingested to treat emergencies. See Ge, Buji zhouhou fang, 1.22. I have not yet been able to identify what \"grain lacquer\" (guqi) is. [3](/chapter/3062831#chapter7_3)Liu Xu alchemy, inner alchemy (neidan) focused on various techniques of meditation to achieve transcendence without ingesting potent substances. In this chapter, for simplicity, I use the word \"alchemy\" to refer only to the practices of outer alchemy.

IV; Ho, Explorations in Daoism. et al., Science and Civilisation in China, vol. 5, pt. IV, 472-91. [11](/chapter/3062831#chapter7_11)This sense of upward movement is evident in the affinity of the early writing of xian to qian, which means \"ascend\" or \"transfer.\" See Miura, \"Xianren,\" 1092-94. [12](/chapter/3062831#chapter7_12)Gruman, History of Ideas about the Prolongation of Life. [13](/chapter/3062831#chapter7_13)My understanding of xian is informed by Y\u00fc, \"Life and Immortality in the Mind of Han China,\" 80-122; Needham et al., Science and Civilisation in China, vol. 5, pt. II, 71-127; Bokenkamp, Early Daoist Scriptures, 21-23; Campany, To Live as Long as Heaven and Earth, Stanley-Baker, \"Cultivating Body, Cultivating Self,\" de qiyuan he fushi zhuyou,\" 301-40. An important text in the Daoist canon, Token for the Agreement of the Three According to the Book of Changes (Zhouyi cantong qi), was traditionally treated as a Han alchemical work, but more recent studies have shown that the text was originally a work of prognostication and only became associated with alchemy during the Era of Division. See Pregadio, \"Early History Jinshu, 72.1910-13; as Long as Heaven and Earth, 13-17. [18](/chapter/3062831#chapter7_18)Ge lamented that, though in possession of instructional books given by Zheng Yin for more than twenty years, he still couldn't practice alchemy, due to the lack of alchemical texts in medieval China concern only the imagination and cosmic contemplation of elixir-making rather than putting alchemy into practice (Sivin, \"Chinese Alchemy and the Manipulation of Time,\" 512-26; Bokenkamp, Early Daoist Scriptures, 289-95), but we also have abundant textual and material evidence for the actual making and ingesting of elixirs, as I will demonstrate shortly. Division consisted of mainly two groups: fangshi, who were technical adepts versed in various magical arts, and Daoist practitioners, especially in the sect of the Great Clarity (Taiqing). See Pregadio, Great Tao's intimate relationship with the court helped him promote the Daoist sect that he established in Maoshan. See Zhong, Tao Hongjing primarily based on Inner Biography of the Hermit Tao from Huayang (Huayang Tao yinju neizhuan), compiled by Jia Song during the Tang dynasty. Although this is a much later text, it preserves information that matches up well with Tao's own writings that are preserved only in fragments, allowing me to reconstruct Tao's alchemical practice with certain confidence. procedure is described in an alchemical text dated to the early Era of Division, Essential Instructions on the Scripture of the Reverted Elixir in Nine Cycles of the Perfected of the Great Ultimate. See Taiji zhenren jiuzhuan 193-200. Fabrizio Pregadio offered a full translation of the text, on which my summary is based. [39](/chapter/3062831#chapter7_39)Jia, Huayang Tao yinju neizhuan (HY 300), 2.8b-11b. We can trace this idea of choosing a sacred site for alchemy back to Ge Hong's writings. See Ge, Instructions on Elixirs is likely the abbreviated title of a lost alchemical text. [46](/chapter/3062831#chapter7_46)Jia, Huayang Tao yinju neizhuan (HY 300), 2.14a. The same source narrates that in 524, Tao made another attempt at compounding the elixir, finally succeeding when the product radiated the variegated colors of a rainbow. But we don't know what Tao did with the elixir. Another source reveals that Tao presented a certain Sublimated Elixir to Emperor Wu sometime before 519. Both the emperor and Tao ingested it and felt their bodies become light (Li Yanshou, Nanshi, 76.1899). Michel Strickmann has argued that what they ingested was not a deadly drug but a In any case, both the emperor and Tao lived long lives\u2014the emperor died at 86 and Tao at 81\u2014suggesting that they never took a lethal elixir. [47](/chapter/3062831#chapter7_47)One such daring alchemist is Tao's disciple Zhou Ziliang (497-516), who died of elixir poisoning at the age of twenty. See Zhou Ziliang, Zhoushi mingtong ji (HY Shan Huawu da Tang chun, 150-55. [57](/chapter/3062831#chapter7_57)Even without detailed explanation, the effort required to manage the potency of alchemical ingredients is already visible during the Era of Division. For instance, a text titled Oral Instructions of the Heavenly Master on the Classics of the Great Clarity briefly describes the methods of detoxifying gold and silver. See Taiqing jing mercury was relegated to the middle group of drugs, suggesting its lowered value. See Su et al., history of mercury in Chinese medicine and alchemy, see Liu and Kuriyama, \"Fluid Being.\" [65](/chapter/3062831#chapter7_65)Pregadio, yang drugs are sal ammoniac and flakes of gold and the jade-knife (daogui) is a size unit in classical Chinese pharmacy. It is four times the size of a small bean, which is eight times the size of a millet grain. Hence, from the dose of one tip of the jade-knife to that of half a millet grain, we see a difference of sixty-four times. See Tao, Bencao jing jizhu, 1.38-39. Heaven and Earth, 52-60; and Pregadio, \"Which a unit of volume measurement. During the Era of Division, one hu was equivalent to about 0.2 liters. See Qiu, more famous story is that of Wei Boyang. Wei, a Daoist master, brought three disciples to a mountain to compound an elixir. After the elixir was made, he pronounced that it was an elixir with du. He then fed it to a dog, who died instantly. Despite this, Wei, together with one trusting disciple, ingested the elixir and died too. Terrified, the other two disciples fled, only to realize later that Wei and his unflinching follower had become transcendents. See Campany, To Live as Long as Heaven and 881), 3.11a. The original quote is from the ancient text The Book of Documents (Shangshu). See Shangshu zhengyi, 10.294-95. [84](/chapter/3062831#chapter7_84)The triple jiao (sanjiao) is one of the six palace-viscera in classical Chinese medicine, with no counterpart in modern biomedicine. Functionally, it controls the opening of water channels in the body and regulates digestion and excretion. See Huangdi neijing suwen jiaozhu, 8.129, [85](/chapter/3062831#chapter7_85)Chuze, Taiqing shibi ji (HY 881), 3.10b-11a. Unlike certain early medical texts that deem pain to be a symptom of abnormal circulation of qi inside the body, this alchemical text regards pain and other strong bodily sensations as therapeutic manifestations of powerful qi from the elixir. See Lo, \"Tracking the Pain,\" 191-211. [86](/chapter/3062831#chapter7_86)In particular, worms figured prominently in the Daoist imagination of sickness as innate, destructive creatures residing in one's body that pose a perpetual menace to life. See Toshiaki Yamada, \"Longevity Techniques,\" 99-124; Huang Cosmos, [Part 2](/chapter/3062825),\" 5](/chapter/3062828)), Sun Simiao also compiled an alchemical text titled Essential Instructions from the Classics of Elixirs of the Great Clarity (Taiqing danjing yaojue), which, with regard to the therapeutic use of elixirs, resembles The Record from the Stone Wall.
