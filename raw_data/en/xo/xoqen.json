Do you feel like you have tried everything but still aren't getting the results you want? An Ayurvedic Consultation Will Change Your Life! Thousands of years before modern science established the medical model, the ancient sages of India developed Ayurveda, one of the world's most sophisticated and powerful mind-body health systems. Ayurveda uses time tested, nature-based methods for attaining health. It doesn't chase symptoms or offer a one-pill approach, but offers an individualized course of action based on your unique constitution and current state of balance. In this ancient system of healing, strengthening the person is more important than fighting the disease. \"It's far more important to know what person the disease has than what disease the person has.\" \u2014 Hippocrates Initial Ayurvedic Consultation Our time together includes a discussion of your health history and goals, as well as an in-depth look at your current diet, digestion, and lifestyle habits to see where imbalances might be showing up. Based upon this, a wellness plan will be created with specific recommendations around nutrition, herbal support, yoga & exercise, cleansing and body therapies. 90 Min Initial Consultation Available in person or via ZOOM. Initial Ayurvedic Consultation includes: A detailed review of your health history and evaluation of your diet, lifestyle, daily habits, and wellness goals Assessment of your Ayurvedic constitution and current state of balance. Ayurvedic analysis of tongue and pulse Personalized recommendations based on your constitution, current state of balance and/or season such as foods to favor or avoid, herbs, exercise, breathing practices, cleansing, and bodywork. Follow-up Consultations Follow-up consultations are an essential part of the your health plan. They give us the chance to review your program and make any necessary adjustments based on your body's response. Our bodies are constantly changing in response to our diet, lifestyle and environment, and what is helpful at one stage of your journey may be slightly or substantially different from that at another. An awareness of doshic fluctuations over time, and knowledge of ways to effectively bring yourself back into balance will empower you to prevent future health concerns. 30 Min or 60 Min Available in person or via ZOOM.
