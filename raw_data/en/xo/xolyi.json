As the pandemic caused a massive shift towards home-based beauty, hash tags such as #selfcare #homespa and #lockdownskin started to trend as we altered our habits and looked for alternative ways to care for our appearance as well as our physical and emotional wellbeing. Although sales of cosmetics have been hit hard by COVID (as people wore less makeup in lockdown) there has been a huge uplift in skincare sales. Brands are also reporting a significant increase in sales of skincare tools and devices as customers seek to care for their skin at home! It is predicted that this trend will continue as non-mechanical and 'skintech' devices are increasingly incorporated into our daily skincare regimes. One such tool that has received much acclaim is the Gua Sha. A simple, easy to use tool that offers smoother, brighter, younger-looking skin, almost instantly, without even leaving the house. What is Gua Sha Gua Sha is an ancient Chinese healing technique that involves firmly scraping the skin with a massage tool in order to boost circulation, break up stagnant energy (chi) and promote healing. It was traditionally used on the body but has now been adapted for use in facial therapies, with the firm, scraping motion evolving into a far gentler, gliding technique for the face, neck and decolletage. Gua Sha Facial Treatments Gua Sha facial treatments, often referred to as 'botox' of the East, use a flat, contoured pebble-shaped tool to apply gentle pressure to the curvatures of the skin. It is thought to have the following benefits: - Stimulates circulation and brings new blood, oxygen and nutrients to the surface - Brightens complexion - Releases tension - Stimulates collagen production - Increases skin elasticity - Helps soften fine lines and wrinkles - Sculpts facial muscles - Tones and tightens skin - Aids lymphatic drainage and removal of toxins - Reduces puffiness - Reduces inflammation - Reduces appearance of dark circles Gua Sha Stones A Gua Sha stone was traditionally made from jade, but there are now many other crystals/gemstones to choose from that have their own unique therapeutic properties and benefits. Chinese philosophy is that gemstones support Jing Qi (life essence), blood circulation and lymphatic drainage, which complement he aims of Gua Sha. Jade and rose quartz stones are most common. Jade is naturally cooling which helps counter the heat generated by Gua Sha. It is thought to balance yin and yang and is a great all-purpose stone that is good for contouring, lifting, and improving skin clarity. Rose quartz is a calming stone that is ideal for reactive or sensitive skin, and skin conditions such as rosacea and acne. It is also believed to open up the heart chakra. Practitioners say the optimum time to use rose quartz is in the morning as it is thought to enhance the natural energy patterns of the day. The differences between the stones are very subtle, so if you're not sure which stone to try, just go for the one you feel most drawn to (a bit like choosing essential oils). It not so much about the actual stone, but the technique itself - you can even buy tools that are made from stainless steel! The shape of the stone is actually the most important thing to consider. It is best to choose a stone with varying curves and contours on each edge, so you can use the different curvatures on different parts of the face and neck. How to use a Gua Sha Stone Gua Sha is easily incorporated into your skincare routine. It is recommended to use the technique at least two to three times a week, however you'll notice the most benefit from daily use. It is best done after cleansing the face and applying a moisturiser or a facial oil, which will give the tool maximum slippage. It can also be used with water in the bath or shower but is not recommended for use on bare skin. The added benefit of applying an oil or cream beforehand, is that the tool will aid the absorption and the effectiveness of your chosen skincare products. See below for some lovely aromatherapy facial oil blends to use with your stone. Using the tool is pretty straightforward. There are various instructional videos available online, so have a browse to discover the various techniques that can be used on the different areas of the face, neck and head. Make sure you hold the tool quite flat to the skin and glide outwards. Always work in the same direction (not back and forth) and repeat the move at least three times, up to a maximum of ten times. Work lightly to reduce puffiness and then more firmly to relax muscles. For a basic routine, start with gentle strokes down the neck then glide from the centre of the chin along the jawline, from the nose across the cheeks, under the eyes, over each eyebrow and up the centre of the forehead. When working under the eyes, ensure that you use only very gentle pressure focusing on a slight tugging of the skin which will help drain lymphatic fluid and reduce puffiness. Start at the inner corner of the eye and work outwards right into the hairline. Working up the centre of the forehead is particularly nice for relieving stress, anxiety, and aiding sleep - starting at the bridge of the nose glide up the centre of the forehead and into the hairline. Start off gently to see how your skin reacts and if you notice breakouts or other issues starting to surface don't stop the technique, focus on neck work until your face starts to calm down. Unblocking the neck is an important, yet often overlooked part of the practice. It is recommended that each Gua Sha practice should start (and often finish with neck work). Not only with gentle downward strokes to encourage lymphatic drainage, but also with firmer strokes to relieve tight muscles in the back of the neck which can obstruct lymph flow.
