His health minister, MantoTshabalala-Msimang, gained infamyfor downplaying the role of antiretro-viral drugs and for promoting the ideathat a diet of garlic, olive oil, lemonpeel, and beetroot effectively combatHIV . 1It wasn't until 2004 that South Africa began to offer antiretroviraldrugs to HIV patients. In a countrywith the highest number of HIVpatients in the world, 2such a stance by political leaders seems unbelievable. We often take for granted that our elected officials have the wisdomto make the right decisions, especial-ly ones where the evidence is clear and the public health issues glaringlyobvious. But recent developments in BC have made such comfortingassumptions less tenable. In late December of 2008 the government announced its intentionto substantially increase the scopes ofpractice of a number of health profes-sions. This followed on the heels of apush to allow pharmacists greaterauthority regarding prescription re -newals and therapeutic substitution.In this instance, it became clear thatissues of quality of diagnostic pro -cesses, adequacy of training, patientsafety and privacy, conflict of interest,duplication of service, and profes-sional liability had not been at theforefront of government thinking.After discussions with BCMA staff,the government's proposals wereadapted to the extent that the BCMAultimately supported the changeswhen announced. It was therefore all the more sur- prising to learn in late December of aneven greater series of proposals for scope expansion of other groups\u2014proposals that went well beyond thelimits of reasonable consideration andthat appeared to have been preparedwithout a sober examination of theissues listed above. A case in point is the changes in scope proposed for naturopaths.Naturopathy has its roots in 19th cen-tury European and North Americanspa and herbal remedy belief systemsand is composed of a varying mix ofdifferent alternative medicine treat-ments and diagnostic modalities. Thecore of most naturopathic trainingprograms is composed of botanicalremedies, hydrotherapy, homeopathy,traditional Chinese medicine, and so-called energy healing. Many variantsexist. Despite claims that naturopathyis science-based, the overwhelmingmajority of naturopathic diagnosticand treatment regimes fall far outsidethe realm of proven medical options.Incredibly, national naturopathicorgan izations continue to question theeffectiveness of vaccines (and, akin tothe South African health minister, sug-gest that dietary methods are effectiveways to prevent epidemic diseases). 3 Most practitioners are opposed to rou-tine childhood immunizations. 4 What then would propel the stew- ards of a health care system, in a mod-ern society where scientific researchand information is abundantly avail-able, to propose that groups actingcontrary to the best available evidenceshould be allowed to: Prescribe most medications (except narcotics and certain other groups ofdrugs). Order laboratory tests, X-rays, and ultrasounds (this was put on hold,but was in the original regulation). Perform minor surgery.The answer, of course, is politics. But the gains being sought will be paidfor by patients who do not receivetimely medical care for serious issues,or by children who may not receivebasic immunizations. It is time for the BCMA and the CMA to take a serious look at theseissues. Changes in scope of practiceare not new, and in some cases areentirely appropriate as new services,programs, and technologies becomeavailable. These should be done wherethe case for the public benefit is clear,proper training and education is evi-dent, and a sensible economic ratio-nale is brought forward. Provinces are clearly looking to changes in scope of practice as onemeans of addressing health humanresource shortages. While the BCMAhas a very capable infrastructure forresponding to such challenges, not allprovinces are as fortunate. We owe itto the public and to our colleagues inother provinces to share informationand experience about current or poten-tial changes to the health care system. We need to work with other pro - vinces and the CMA to ensure thatphysicians lead the way in setting thestandards for high-quality medicalcare. Our efforts should include: Developing a rapid, coordinated response to new developments\u2014including national criteria againstwhich to measure the merits of pro-posed changes to scope. Agreeing on what type of changes are most helpful (e.g., bringing inphysician assistants). Advocating, with both the public and with government, on ways todevelop the health care system. Keeping the focus on quality, partic- ularly the idea that new investmentsshould go to areas of proven benefit. council onhealth promotion Naturopaths' expanded scope: In the best interests of the public? Continued on page 218BC MEDICAL JOURNAL VOL. 51 NO. 5, JUNE 2009 218The BCMA has already begun building on these ideas. We have gar-nered support from colleagues in thewestern provinces and we plan to pro-pose further action at the CMA Gen-eral Council in August. By keeping the focus on quality and patient safety, and by building onour expertise and knowledge of thehealth care arena, physicians can con-tinue to lead the medical system andensure that patients receive the guid-ance and care they need. \u2014Lloyd Oppel, MD Chair, Allied Health Committee References 1.

If your child is sick or injured, it's a good time to take a breakfrom sports and exercise. Rest isimportant to healing and gettingwell. By returning too fast, thereis a strong risk of re-injury.
