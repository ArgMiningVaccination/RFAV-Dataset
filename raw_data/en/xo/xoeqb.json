Immune-enhancing enteral nutrition formulas containing n-3 fatty acids, and antioxidants may manage patients' nutritional status and pathophysiological processes [ [3](#B3) [4](#B4)]. The fat sources traditionally used in enteral nutrition are based on n-6 fatty acid-rich oils, such as soybean oil; however, such sources may not be ideal because they may provide excess linoleic acid [ [5](#B5)], which is a precursor for pro-inflammatory arachidonic acid synthesis [ [6](#B6)]. Clinical trials regarding the immunomodulatory effect of n-3 fatty acids have been reported in previous studies [ [7](#B7) [8](#B8)]. Meta-analyses of controlled, randomized clinical trials using n-3 fatty acids or similar formulas to enhance immune functions have shown marked decreases in the length of hospital stay and infection events; however, these effects are more significant in critically ill [ [9](#B9) [10](#B10) [11](#B11)] or postoperative patients [ [12](#B12)]. [13](#B13)]. The aim of these formulas is to reduce complications associated with infection and protect and stimulate the immune system [ [11](#B11) [14](#B14) [15](#B15) [16](#B16)]. Perioperative immunomodulating enteral nutrition has been recommended for surgical patients by the European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN) guidelines [ [17](#B17)]. Although many immune-enhancing enteral nutrition guidelines strive to achieve better patient care outcomes, a precise definition of the desirable properties of immune-strengthening fatty acid components in enteral nutrition formulas for chronic nonsurgical hospitalized inpatients is still lacking. [11](#B11)]. NK cell activity and cytokines can serve as parameters of a patient's immune status. Moreover, rehabilitation inpatients are vulnerable to infectious complications because of their prolonged hospital stays [ [18](#B18)]. Although no clear evidence regarding the immune-enhancing effect of n-3 fatty acids derived from plants on NK cell activity is available, plant-derived n-3 fatty acids can be effective for regulating the immune system [ [19](#B19) [20](#B20)] because they are rich in -linolenic acid. However, few studies have compared the effect of enteral formulas enriched with plant-derived n-3 fatty acids in nonsurgical rehabilitation patients with that of a soybean oil formula as a control. [21](#B21)]. Therefore, the goal of our research was to compare NK cell activity alterations and related cytokine changes associated with a soybean oil formula (control) and a plant-derived n-3 fatty acid-enriched formula (test) in nonsurgical patients hospitalized for rehabilitation. SUBJECTS AND METHODS Participants [ClinicalTrials.gov](ClinicalTrials.gov): [NCT03638661](NCT03638661); [http://www.clinicaltrials.gov](https://www.clinicaltrials.gov)). Implementation of the randomized clinical trial [22](#B22)]. Because of severe metabolic changes and unstable vital signs, critically ill or postoperative patients are not suitable for enteral nutrition for more than 2 weeks and were therefore ineligible for this clinical trial. Additionally, an appropriate intestinal approach cannot be carried out in pre-/peri-/postoperative patients, and these subjects may have several contraindications to enteral nutrition. Therefore, we decided that rehabilitation patients were suitable for the current clinical study using standard nutrients with an n-3 fatty acid formula. [Fig. 1](#F1). The present study was designed as a parallel, randomized, human clinical trial. Using computer-generated simple sampling randomization lists (the SAS randomization program), ninety-four patients were randomized to receive either a soybean oil-containing enteral nutrition formula (control) or an n-3 fatty acid-enriched enteral nutrition formula containing canola and flaxseed oil (n3EN, test). Yonsei Dairy Co. generated the random allocation sequence and concealed the allocation table. The attending physicians of the Department of Rehabilitation at Yonsei University Severance Hospital enrolled the participants and allocated the subjects using the given sequence. The patients assigned to the control group received a soybean oil formula by tube feeding. Those assigned to the n3EN group received the n-3 fatty acid-enriched formula by tube feeding (product; Yonsei Dairy Co., Seoul, Republic of Korea). The ready-to-use soybean oil formula and n3EN formula had an identical appearance, with no dissimilarity in packing, texture, or smell. All of the participants, health care providers, outcome assessors and data analysts were blinded after assignment to the intervention groups. The concealed allocation tables were not uncovered before all the participants' data had been clarified. Enteral nutrition formula intervention [Table 1](#T1). The nutrient (fatty acids) compositions of canola, flaxseed and soybean oils according to the United States Department of Agriculture database [ [23](#B23)] are attached as supplemental data ( [Supplemental Table 1](#S1)). The subjects participated for 14 consecutive days and consumed the enteral formula by either naso-gastric enteral tube feeding or a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) enteral tube. Enteral nutrition was started within 24 h of hospital admission and supplied at a continuous rate to achieve a minimum of 50% basal energy expenditure (BEE; determined using the Harris-Benedict equation) \u00d7 1.2 within the first 12 h. If well tolerated, enteral nutrition was increased to achieve BEE \u00d7 1.2 within 48 h. Complementary delivery with parenteral nutrition was allowed for the initial 48 h. From the third day, the subjects received a minimum of 75% of BEE \u00d7 1.2. Anthropometric parameters and blood collection [24](#B24)]. Venous blood samples were collected in EDTA-treated and plain tubes and centrifuged to acquire plasma and serum. The collected blood samples were preserved at 70 until analysis. Hematology and biochemical analysis Natural killer (NK) cell activity Cytokine concentrations in serum Statistical analysis RESULTS Basic characteristics and anthropometric values [Table 2](#T2)outlines the basic characteristics at baseline and after two weeks for the control group and the n3EN group. At baseline, no significant differences were noted between the two groups in gender, age, weight, BMI, waist circumference, and the estimated average calorie intake ( [Table 2](#T2)). After 2 weeks of consuming the enteral nutrition formulas, no statistically significant changes were observed in these clinical characteristics in the control and n3EN groups. Additionally, no noticeable differences were observed in the changes (differences from baseline) in these clinical characteristics between the two groups ( [Table 2](#T2)). Biochemical parameters [Table concentrations [Table 4](#T4)and [Fig. 2](#F2), no significant differences were found in the NK cell activities measured at baseline between the two groups. The n3EN group's NK cell activities at the 10:1, 5:1, 2.5:1 and 0.625:1 E:T ratios were significantly higher than those of the control group at week 2 (P < 0.05) compared with the baseline values ( [Fig. 2](#F2)). The n3EN group had larger increases in NK cell activity at ratios of E:T = 10:1, 5:1, and 0.625:1 than the control group (P < 0.05). No statistically significant differences were found in cytokine concentrations (IL-12, IFN-, IL-6, DISCUSSION [25](#B25) [26](#B26) [27](#B27)]. The lipid mediator system is important for mediating the inflammatory response [ [28](#B28)]. Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) in fish oil and -linolenic acid in plant oil are well known for promoting immune competence through promotion of anti-inflammatory eicosanoid synthesis [ [29](#B29)]. Plant oils, especially flaxseed and canola oils, are good sources of n-3 fatty acids (C18:3). In a practical context, an enteral formula is generally used in large amounts on a daily basis for the long term. Therefore, a patient's tolerance and preference and the stability of an enteral formula are considered important factors. The main reason that plant-derived n-3 fatty acid was incorporated into the test products used in our clinical trial rather than n-3 fatty acid from fish oil is because fish oil introduces stability problems and promotes an unacceptable taste and odor, and oxidation and hydrolysis quickly deteriorate the quality of fish oil [ [30](#B30)]. Another issue is that fish oil's functional substance may vary due to the variety of fish species and seasonal and geographical differences. When exposed to oxygen, fish oil can undergo oxidation and deterioration of its functional efficacy [ [31](#B31)]. The stability and consistent quality of effective ingredients are crucial for enteral formulas given to patients. In addition, research showing that enteral formulas containing fish oil-derived n-3 PUFA are superior to plant-derived n-3 fatty acid formulas in hospitalized patients is lacking. Thus, we hypothesized that plant-derived n-3 oils may be desirable as fat components of an immune-enhancing enteral nutrition formula for rehabilitation patients. [28](#B28) [32](#B32) [33](#B33)]. [7](#B7) [34](#B34)]. Generally, the evidence of an immune modulation effect of n-3 fatty acids is strongly supported by numerous studies. P.C. Calder summarized beneficial immune and inflammatory effects of n-3 fatty acids on monocytes in terms of phagocytosis, lymphocyte proliferation, cytokine production and human leucocyte antigen-D-related expression [ [34](#B34)]. Recently, n-3 fatty acids have been reported to stimulate the immune system, inhibiting the cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 pathway of eicosanoid synthesis; therefore, a marked decrease occurs in pro-inflammatory prostaglandins such as PGE2, which favorably influences immune system modulation [ [35](#B35)]. A recent report showing that NK cells have beneficial anti-infection and anti-inflammatory activities [ [36](#B36)] supports the idea that therapeutic immune interventions applied to patients can stimulate the function of NK cells [ [37](#B37)]. [38](#B38)]. Additionally, previous studies have demonstrated that cytokine production by PBMCs and several circulating cytokines also play vital roles in critically ill patients [ [18](#B18) [19](#B19) [20](#B20)]. The stimulated levels of NK cell activity and blood cytokine concentrations are good indicators of host immunity because they reflect actual cell function, such as their ability to generate the important cytokines involved in immune defense [ [39](#B39)]. Critically ill patients are known to exhibit hyporesponsive NK cell activity [ [40](#B40)]. In this previous study, NK cell expression was significantly lower in septic subjects than that in non-septic subjects and a healthy control group. [8](#B8)]. In another study, critically ill pediatric patients with low stimulated TNF- production were vulnerable to developing life-threatening complications [ [41](#B41) [42](#B42)]. [11](#B11)], which indicated that NK cells contribute to the immune reaction by presenting various potent immune-stimulating cytokines. On the other hand, our previously published study showed that despite NK cell activity upregulation, no corresponding trends for serum cytokine activation were noted in critically ill patients [ [43](#B43)]. In addition, Lee et al. [ [44](#B44)] demonstrated serum cytokine and NK cell activity alterations according to age, and no positive or negative associations were found between NK cell activity and serum cytokines. These observations closely concurred with our findings. IL-6 and TNF- have a short half-life [ [45](#B45)], which may explain why we failed to find an association between hyper-NK cell activity and altered serum cytokine concentrations. [46](#B46)]. In addition, Agarwal et al. [ [47](#B47)] reiterated that the bioavailability and/or action of proinflammatory cytokines may depend on circulating cytokine receptors. Additionally, since cytokines are released in a paracrine manner, the levels may vary widely depending on when a subject's blood sample is collected. Serum and plasma cytokine levels can be affected by receptor binding, temperature-induced degradation, urinary excretion, and cytokine breakdown within reacting cells [ [48](#B48)]. Thus, these properties of cytokines may be another factor underlying the lack of association with NK cell activities and other immune parameters in our study. Additionally, this contradictory finding may be due to dissimilarities in the patients' pathophysiological conditions. Our subjects were in the general inpatient ward, while most previous studies were conducted in critically ill patient care settings or in healthy subjects. Despite the small sample of sixty rehabilitation participants, this randomized placebo-controlled clinical study clearly showed that a combination of canola and flaxseed oils as a source of immune-modulating n-3 fatty acids in an enteral nutrition formula had beneficial effects without causing significant changes in serum cytokine levels, including IL-12, IFN-, IL-1, IL-6 we could not report the plasma fatty acid profiles of these patients because of limited blood (serum) volumes; therefore, NK cell activity, cytokine, and hematologic assessments were prioritized. Third, our results do not directly show that the increase in NK cell activity was correlated with cytokine changes as the circulating levels of measured cytokines may not reflect their true biological activity. Finally, as we focused on immune-specific parameters during two weeks of the patients' hospitalizations, this study could not elucidate practical values such as the involuntary readmission rate, mortality, patients' subjective tolerance or satisfaction scores, administrative costs, hospital stay durations, and follow-up clinical data after discharge regarding immune functions. Further investigation is required to evaluate the effects of plant-derived n-3 fatty acids on the immune system and clinical outcomes in larger long-term larger trials. "}
