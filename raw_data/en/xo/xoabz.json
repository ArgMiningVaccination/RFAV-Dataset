Flavonoids function to slow down the inflammatory process by inhibiting the arachidonic acid, forming prostaglandins, and releasing histamine. This study aimed to examine the anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects of MBP decoction. This study used the Winter method for anti-inflammatory assay by induction of carrageenan on the soles of rat's feet and Sigmund's method for analgesic assay with intraperitoneal induction of acetic acid in mice. Group I as a negative control, group II as a positive control with diclofenac sodium, group III as a low dose (200 mg/kg BW of MBP), group IV as a medium dose (400 mg/kg BW of MBP), and group V as a high dose (800 mg/kg BW of MBP decoction). The percentage of inhibition in the anti-inflammatory test in rats for groups II, III, IV, and V was 34.43%, 17.68%, 25.53%, and 25.4%, and the percentage of effectiveness for the anti-inflammatory test, respectively, was 51.35%, 74.15%, and 74.01%. The results of the percentage inhibition of the analgesic test in mice for groups II, III, IV, and V were 55.25%, 38.52%, 44.53%, and 49.31%, and the percentage of effectiveness for the analgesic test, respectively, followed by 69.71%, 80.59%, and 89.24%. Based on the results, it can be concluded that the decoction of the MBP has an anti-inflammatory and analgesic effect.", "sitename": "Borneo Journal of Pharmacy -", "date": "2018-05-01", "cleaned_text": "Themes by Openjournaltheme.com Novelty OJS 3 Theme by openjournaltheme.com theme Quick jump to page content Main Navigation Main Content Sidebar Borneo Journal of Pharmacy Register Login Online ISSN : 2621-4814 Toggle navigation Home About About the Journal Abstracting and Indexing Publication Frequency Journal History Citedness in Scopus Citedness in Web of Science Article Statistics Journal Diversity Subscribers Sponsorship Journal Policy Aims and Scope Publication Ethics and Malpractice Statement Retraction, Withdrawal, and Correction (R-W-C) Policy Editorial Policies Peer-Review Policy Open Access Policy Licensing Policy Archiving Policy Plagiarism Policy Study Ethics and Ethical Clearance Policy Informed Consent Policy Conflict of Interest Policy People Editorial Board Acknowledgment for past Peer-Reviewers Publisher Contact Issue Current Archives Accepted Manuscripts Author Index Submit Article Submissions Author Guidelines Article Processing Charge Copyright Notice Privacy Statement Announcements Search "}
