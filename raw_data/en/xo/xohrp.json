As far as we're concerned, inflammation often gets a bad rap. And what a shame, because it can be a useful signal indicating your body's need to recover, particularly after exercise.* Turmeric, meadowsweet and ginger all honor that indication, creating a combined effect where the whole of our formula is greater than the sum of its parts. Our [Turmeric with Meadowsweet & Ginger tea](/products/turmeric-with-meadowsweet-ginger/) aims to target the gut first, since that is where the herbs first interact with the body. After that, the body is ready to address the everyday aches and pains associated with strenuous physical activity and lifestyle.* As herbalists, we believe that the health of the body depends on the long-term health of the gut, which is why we have formulated our tea to be a trifecta of herbal wisdom and soothing relief.* Tapping into Ancient Wisdom Turmeric's wide appeal may have recently gained momentum here in the West, but this healing rhizome (or horizontal root) has been celebrated as a cooking spice, a dye, and as a medicinal herb in India for over 3,000 years. Used in Ayurveda and Traditional Chinese Medicine to support everything from digestion and the respiratory system to everyday discomfort, it's no wonder turmeric has enjoyed such an enduring legacy. Tapping into that ancient wisdom, we created one of our most popular blends: [Turmeric with Meadowsweet & Ginger](https://www.traditionalmedicinals.com/products/turmeric-with-meadowsweet-ginger/). Reinforced with meadowsweet\u2014historically used in Traditional European Herbal Medicine much like turmeric is in Ayurveda\u2014and the warming properties of ginger, our innovative formula supports a healthy response to inflammation associated with an active lifestyle, while also promoting healthy digestion.* Inflammation often gets a bad rap, but it can be a useful signal indicating your body's need recover, particularly after exercise.* How We Achieve Medicinal-Grade Quality Our team goes to great lengths to make sure our products do what they say they are going to do. This process starts with formulation, carries through into responsible sourcing, and ends in our laboratory to confirm what we've worked hard to achieve. To meet our high-quality, medicinal-grade commitment to you, our herbs must reach certain standards. Our turmeric for example, must contain no less than 2.5% essential oils. To achieve this, we partner with growers and collectors who follow organic, non-GMO practices and typically source from locations where the herbs have traditionally grown. Once we receive our herbal ingredients, our team tests every batch to confirm that the species identity, purity, concentration of essential oils, taste, and smell meet our specifications. Given turmeric's many benefits and the high quality we're able to achieve, drinking this tea is an easy way to help support an active lifestyle and the health of your digestive system.* If you haven't yet tried our Turmeric with Meadowsweet & Ginger tea, we encourage you to [order here](https://www.traditionalmedicinals.com/products/turmeric-with-meadowsweet-ginger/) or use our [store locator](https://www.traditionalmedicinals.com/store-locator/) to find out where it's sold near you.
