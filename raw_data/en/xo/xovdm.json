So how can I make the claim that common osteo-arthritis (\"OA\") is rev ersible? Because science and experience tells us so. I have seen hundreds of patients, of all ages, improve their co nditions dramatically. Yes, some will need a joint replacem ent; or are unable or unwilling to make the investment to heal their arthritis; but the process of developing OA is proof of the body's wisdom and attempt to repair. True Stories The first evidence of healing was with my brother-i n-law, over 20 years ago, when he was in his early 30's. He had knee surgery to repair a torn ligament, followed by mont hs of PT. He then developed a new, aching pain in his knee. He went back to his orthopedist who told him he was now dev eloping arthritis in his knee and there was nothing more to do. He said to me, \"Why did I go through all of that, just to develop arthritis and pain\". I asked him to show me the exercises he was doing. He was essentially doing strengthening exercises, but no stretches. The muscles and soft tissues around his knee were so strong and tight that they were forcing his knee surfaces to rub on each other excessively. I showed him some yoga stretches and his pain resolved within weeks. A similar situation occurred with a colleague, an avid squash player, in his early 50's. He already had numerous surgeries on both knees, many courses of PT, and Synvisc injections (a substance that is suppose d to help cartilage repair). He was taking so much Motrin (A dvil, ibuprofen) that he was chronically bleeding from hi s gastro- intestinal tract and was risking a fatal bleed. Wh en I examined his knee, though it showed some wear and tear, agai n I found excessive tightness in the muscles around his knee. In fact, his quadriceps muscle (the front thigh muscle) was so t ight from over-zealous PT that he couldn't even bend his knee to 90 degrees. He was a disciplined athlete with lots of motivation. He enrolled in my yoga class (the only male there!) , and followed the program of medical acupuncture and nut ritional supplementation that I designed for him. Within fo ur months, his pain was so improved that he was able to stop h is Motrin. He is still playing squash, almost 10 years later. The next story is a 60+ year old woman, overweight, who had severe arthritis in her low back. She had alre ady done everything except surgery, including PT, epidural i njections, and medications. I found her blood levels of Vitam in D were very low, and her diet/supplement program was not p roviding enough anti-inflammatory support. A combination of diet, acupuncture, and a special yoga-based PT helped her heal in six months. She has remained pain-free for years. There are many similar stories involving shoulders, thumbs, necks, ankles, and other joints. The proce ss of degeneration is the same. Many people still don't know about the work of Dean Ornish MD, a yogi who became a cardiologist. He proved, despite initial ridicule by the medical establishment, that clogging of the coronary arteri es is reversible with diet and stress reduction. If thes e small vessels that supply blood to the heart can repair themselve s, why shouldn't a joint be able to repair also? The proc ess of de- generation (and aging) should be out-paced by the p rocess of re-generation (and \"youthing\"!) What Is Osteo-Arthritis (\"OA\") OA is a wear-and-tear of the cartilage and bone of the joints. Unlike non-living things, when a joint is stressed through use, the body attempts to make it stronger. It does this by removing and then replacing some collagen in car tilage and bone underneath the cartilage. In fact, bone and o ther tissues are designed to be constantly \"re-modeled\" in respo nse to the forces placed upon them. With every stress, bone, muscle, and surrounding soft tissues are torn down and re-built. It's how we get stronger with exercise. We start this process of breakdown and repair very early in life. If this process goes right, we are stronger and more limber; if it goes awry, then we form \"bone spurs\" and the soft tissues get too tight or loose. (This process is very different from the severe destructive process of rheumatoid arthritis , which will be discussed in a future article.) Measurement of OA Imaging studies such as xrays, CAT scans, and MRI's show us the structure of joint tissues. These studies will beg in to show \"degenerative\" changes beginning in the 20's or eve n earlier. However, since these changes occur in us all, it is not yet possible to distinguish the changes that cause pain and dysfunction from those that are benign. In fact, s cientific research has shown that there is very little correl ation between pain and imaging studies. A person can have a \"hor rible\" xray but be pain-free their entire life; or a person can have a \"beautiful\" MRI and be in severe, disabling pain. In fact, most surgeons will not base decisions on these studies-- it's usually intractable pain, not an MRI that drives the decisi on to operate. Because of their \"false positive\" nature, when I or der radiologic studies, say of a painful knee (a rare e vent, usually to rule out a more serious disease), I always order both sides. An MRI of a knee in anyone over the age of 30 will always show some \"torn cartilage\". To help determine if t he findings are significant, an MRI needs to be compared to a p rior study, or if one is not available, to the other side. Whe n I do this, I do not tell the radiologist which side is the painf ul one. In the vast majority of cases, the radiologist does not se e a difference 9/26/07-1 oa_ah.doc \"Arthritis Is Reversible\" M Cheikin MD Page 2 between sides. This issue was further demonstrated by research in Boston several years ago. They performed arthroscopic \"cl ean-ups\" on middle age men with knee pain that had not respo nded to PT. However, in half the cases, they only did sham surgery, putting the patient to sleep, making cuts in the sk in around the knee, but doing nothing more. \"Post-op\" care was th e same, involving more PT and exercise. The outcomes were the same. Therefore, while imaging studies can be helpful, especially to rule-out serious conditions such as c ancer, they don't really help us measure the extent of OA. Patterns of OA In assessing the \"cause\" of OA, more important than imaging studies is the history, physical exam and b iochemical tests (blood, urine, and sometimes stool). The nat ural history of OA usually falls into two patterns: a generalize d process involving several joints, or a focussing process in volving one or two joints. A generalized process speaks to the systemic process of inflammation . A local process suggests a prior injury with a persistent injury pattern . Sometimes both processes occur simultaneously. Inflammation As discussed in prior articles, inflammation refers to a fire that burns up our body from the inside. It affects virtually every tissue of our body--our joints, our blood ves sels, our brain, our hormonal glands, and our immune system. If a person has a \"pro-inflammatory\" lifestyle, with poo r eating, sleeping and stress-reduction habits, then very oft en there are other signs of inflammation. These can include: ge neral aches and pains, pre-diabetes, hormonal imbalance, fatigu e, poor skin healing, depression and memory problems, diges tive problems and others. Often there are special blood tests that are abnormal, such as those looking at adrenal and thyroid function, heavy metal toxicity, sub-clinical yeast or bacterial infection, and nutritional deficiencies. OA and in flammation are affected by sex hormones, which is why we can s ee flares related to menarche, PMS, pregnancy and menopause. Injury Patterns After an injury, minor or major, the body alters th e way it moves. For example, after a minor ankle strain, on e may walk differently for a few weeks. However, after the an kle has healed, some of the altered (imbalanced) patterns o f movement may persist. Over a decade or two, this may cause an accelerated wear-and-tear of a specific joint, such as the knee or hip. As an analogy, a car with an imbalanced fr ont end will keep wearing out the tires. Replacing the tires wi ll not solve the problem. The alignment of the front end must b e fixed. Same with the body. Conventional imaging studies a nd PT often focus on the \"problematic\" joint, not looking at the body as a complex system. I have learned over time to l ook at least one or two joints above and below the problem joint . For example, low back pain is often caused by tight hip s. Knee problems can come from tight ankles, feet or hips. Shoulder problems can come from a tight chest or forward nec k. Using the same logic, therapies geared toward singl e joints in many cases will be of limited benefit, since the root cause has not been addressed. Often, chronic pain is cau sed by problems in two or more areas. Exercises designed to help make one area better make a second area worse, and visa versa. While strengthening exercises can support a joint, too much strength can tighten muscles and increase the stress on a joint. The Holistic Approach While conventional medicine offers medications, PT and procedures (injections and surgeries), the holistic approach utilizes education, yoga, nutrition, acupuncture, a nd lifestyle modification. It may take a bit longer, but it is a balanced approach. Not sleeping well, or having chronic con stipation or diarrhea may not seem as a \"cause\" of progressive a rthritis and pain, but such conditions indicate a situation wher e there is inflammation, toxicity, and malabsorption of nutrie nts. As implied above, the evaluation and treatment of O A is not cookbook--it's not as simple as taking a Vioxx every day. The plan is very individualized. While many of the se modalities are not \"covered\" by insurance, they are very cost effective. The investment in sleep, diet, stress r eduction and lifestyle change can promote a global healing of ma ny conditions at the same time, and ultimately save mo ney in copays, prescriptions, and lost quality of life. N ot only does the OA heal, people notice improvement in their oth er chronic diseases of aging including depression and anxiety, constipation, cardiovascular disease, cognitive dec line, fatigue, etc. IMPORTANT NOTE: This educational material may not be used to make decisions about medical care withou t the help of an experienced practitioner.
