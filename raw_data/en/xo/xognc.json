Although, collagen does more than give you shiny hair and skin; it helps support digestive function. Specifically, it satiates your appetite by activating your fullness hormone, leptin. During cold months, remember the easiest and most delicious primary source of collagen: bone broth. If you are vegan or vegetarian, don't feel left out; vegetable broth is also great. While it does not contain collagen, it does boost your body's natural collagen production because of its vitamins. Dark leafy greens and mushrooms are especially high sources of vitamins A, C, and E, among many other vegetables. While making homemade broth has diminished over the decades, it can be found at any grocery store. If you do not have time to simmer bones or veggies yourself, there is a wide range of high-quality brands. Remember, quality matters, even in supplements to aid weight loss; nutrients are depleted in poor quality products. Always look for organic vegetable broth and bone broth simmered from grass-fed animal bones. Green Tea Something else delicious you can drink during the cold, festivities-filled months to lose weight is green tea (3). Green tea has a high amount of the flavonoid catechin, which helps speed up metabolism (4). Along with a safe and low amount of caffeine, these two factors allow the body to metabolize food faster and burn more body fat. A good idea is to drink a cup of green tea with a slice of lemon in the morning before you eat anything for the day. If you decide to take green tea extract, please speak with your doctor first. Body weight can be managed and moderate weight loss is possible through drinking green tea, daily exercise, and a healthy balanced diet (5). Weight Loss Supplements Conjugated Linoleic Acid (CLA) CLAs are polyunsaturated fatty acids found in animal and fish proteins, but the highest amounts exist in beef and dairy (6). Taking CLA is a great natural supplement to curb body fat and help you stay full. Clinical trials have shown that CLAs contain anti-obesogenic properties (6). Although, always speak with your physician before adding or taking a CLA supplement, especially if you have diabetes or are at risk. Adverse effects of protection against type II diabetes may occur. Berberine [Berberine](https://centrespringmd.com/shop/metagenics-berberine-gt/) is a bioactive plant compound that acts as one of the most powerful natural supplements for short or long-term weight loss (7). To highlight, berberine has long been a prominent part of traditional Chinese medicine and Ayurveda practices. In one study, [berberine](https://centrespringmd.com/supplement-spotlight-berberine-for-weight-loss-fertility-metabolic-health-and-more/) was effective at lowering lipid levels, which in turn, can maintain healthy blood sugar levels (8). B Vitamins Forget prescription weight loss products; B vitamins are some of the most important to get. As we age, especially for women, it is harder for our bodies to absorb these . B vitamins play an important role in energy metabolism and cell regeneration (9). Foundationally, people that do not get required amounts of B vitamins could lack the ability to do strenuous exercise (9). As a result, the body could stop itself from burning more fat and calories due to fatigue. Methylation is a vital biochemical process responsible for the proper function of almost every bodily system...Without adequate levels of B vitamins, methylation breaks down (10). Methylation: - Detoxifies the body - Repairs DNA - Removes damaging proteins from the blood - Curbs inflammation - Regulates mood Surprisingly, 1 out of 2 people are unable to convert inactive B vitamins, which reduces methylation (10). [Eastwest Boost](https://centrespringmd.com/shop/eastwest-boost/) contains fully methylated B vitamins. Shop now.>> All-Natural Weight Loss Sleep Weight loss supplements can only help if you are taking care of your body. Please, do yourself a favor during this hectic time of year, and get your sleep! Poor sleep contributes to weight gain from elevated levels of cortisol, the body's stress hormone, and gremlin, the body's hunger hormone (11). When the body is tired, it craves food, especially carbohydrates. Whenever possible, take advantage of the shorter days and sleep in or go to bed early.
