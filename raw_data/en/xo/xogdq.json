Virtually all will spell out the reasons why a pregnant person shouldn't take the medication \u2014 or at least advise you to call your health care provider before doing so. But many expectant moms take at least one prescribed drug and more than one over-the-counter medication during pregnancy. So how do you sort through the fine print to know which medications can be used safely during pregnancy? Which medications can you take during pregnancy? Unfortunately, medications in pregnancy cannot be considered \"safe\" or \"unsafe.\" No drug \u2014 whether prescription, over-the-counter or herbal \u2014 can be considered 100 percent safe during pregnancy. This is because it depends so much on timing of exposure, on the dose of the medication and the indication for which the medication is being used. [[1]](javascript:void(0)) Happily, only a few drugs are known to be harmful to a developing fetus, and many can be used safely during pregnancy; some are even necessary. Always talk to your doctor or midwife before using medication to get the green light along with dosing and brand recommendations. Commonly used medications in pregnancy These medications should be safe to take when you're pregnant, though always check with your practitioner first. [[2]](javascript:void(0)) - Acetaminophen: This is the active ingredient in Tylenol. It is usually approved for short-term use for pain and fever. - Antacids: Those containing calcium carbonates (Tums, Mylanta, etc.), which also offer a dose of calcium, are often used in pregnancy, as are proton pump inhibitors for heartburn. - Antidiarrheal treatment: Kaopectate is used in limited amounts and for a limited period of time, but ask your practitioner first to be sure (most will advise waiting until after the first trimester; note that Pepto-Bismol and other salicylates should probably not be used during pregnancy). - Antihistamines: Diphenhydramine (Benadryl) is the most commonly prescribed. Many, though not all, practitioners recommend loratadine (Claritin), though some will urge you to avoid it in the first trimester. Some practitioners suggest chlorpheniramine (Chlor-Trimeton) on a limited basis, but most advise finding a better alternative. - Cough medications: Those containing dextromethorphan, including the expectorant Mucinex and cough suppressants like Robitussin and Vicks 44, as well as most cough drops, are considered safe to use. - Decongestant chest rub: Vicks VapoRub is generally considered okay to take. - Fiber laxatives: Laxatives such as Metamucil for constipation get the green light. - Gas aids: Gas-X and Mylicon are okay for the occasional [relief of pregnancy bloat](//www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/symptoms-and-solutions/bloating.aspx). - Nasal sprays: Formulas containing steroids for a stuffy nose are fine to use, but check with your doctor for dosing and brand. Same goes for saline sprays and nasal strips. - Prenatal vitamins: These are not only okay to take, they're highly recommended to [help prevent birth defects and fill any nutritional deficiencies](//www.whattoexpect.com/baby-products/pregnancy/best-prenatal-vitamins-buy-over-counter/). - Skin rash creams: Diphenhydramine (Benadryl) and hydrocortisone (Cortaid) can be used - Sleep aids: Unisom, Tylenol PM, Sominex and Nytol are generally considered safe during pregnancy and are allowed by many practitioners for occasional use (though always check with your doctor first before taking them). - Witch hazel: Tucks pads or glycerin products (Preparation H) are [safe treatments for hemorrhoids](//www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/symptoms-and-solutions/hemorrhoids.aspx). Other medications to manage chronic illnesses such as [asthma](//www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/asthma-during-pregnancy) or diabetes are often okay to continue during pregnancy \u2014 but it depends on the medication and your situation, so always be sure to check with your doctor first. Read This Next Medications you may be able to take during pregnancy In certain cases your practitioner may okay some medications for specific health conditions with close supervision: - Antibiotics: Certain antibiotics may be fine to take for bacterial infections if your doctor prescribes them, though others won't be allowed. - Antidepressants: Treating depression is very important in pregnancy. Most antidepressants can be used when you're expecting, though there others that should be discussed with your psychiatrist and OB/GYN and considered on a case-by-case basis \u2014 the research is ongoing and ever-changing. Your doctor will weigh their use against the risk of untreated (or undertreated) depression, which can have many adverse effects on a developing fetus. - Aspirin: This will likely be off-limits, especially during the third trimester, since it increases the risk for potential problems in newborns as well as complications like excessive bleeding during delivery. Some studies, however, suggest that very low dosages (baby aspirin) may help to prevent preeclampsia in certain circumstances. Other research indicates that low-dose aspirin in combination with the blood-thinning medication heparin may reduce the incidence of recurrent miscarriage in some women. In both cases, only your doctor can let you know if these drugs are safe for you and under what circumstances. - Ibuprofen (Advil or Motrin): It generally shouldn't be used during pregnancy (though there are some exceptions) \u2014 especially during the first and third trimesters, when it can have the same blood-thinning effects as aspirin. Use it only if it's specifically recommended by a physician who knows you're pregnant. Medications you should definitely avoid during pregnancy Make sure to avoid the following drugs when you're expecting: - Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors: These are prescribed for hypertension or congestive heart failure, and can cause miscarriage or birth defects. - Decongestants: Pseudoephedrine and phenylephrine (Sudafed, DayQuil, Claritin-D), especially if taken during the first trimester, may cause stomach defects or affect blood flow to the placenta \u2014 though some doctors will recommend in limited amounts in the second and third trimesters. Also avoid cough and cold meds that contain alcohol or NSAIDs. - Isotretinoin (Accutane): This medication for cystic acne raises the risk of miscarriage and physical and mental defects in babies. - Methotrexate: Used to [treat psoriasis](//www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/pregnancy-health/psoriasis-during-pregnancy/)and [rheumatoid arthritis](//www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/pregnancy-health/rheumatoid-arthritis-during-pregnancy/), methotrexate increases the risk of miscarriage and birth defects. - Valproic acid: Used for [epilepsy](//www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/pregnancy-health/epilepsy-during-pregnancy/), bipolar disorder and sometimes migraines, valproic acid can cause major birth defects, such as a heart defect, and behavior and learning problems. Check with your practitioner if valproic acid can be changed to another medication prior to pregnancy. Can you take antibiotics during pregnancy? Antibiotics can be a literal lifesaver when they're used to treat a bacterial infection. If your doctor prescribes you an antibiotic during pregnancy, it's generally because the infection it's treating is more dangerous than any potential side effects of taking the drug. If your doctor prescribes you an antibiotic, it will generally be in the penicillin or erythromycin family. That said, antibiotics can also be overused when they're not necessary, leading to antibiotic-resistant infections. A few things to remember: - Antibiotics only treat bacterial infections, which means they don't work for viral infections (like the cold and flu). - Many antibiotics are safe to use during pregnancy. So if your practitioner prescribes [an antibiotic for a UTI](//www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/uti/), don't hesitate to take it. - Every infection needs a specific type of antibiotic and dose. That means you should always get a new prescription and throw away any leftovers. - Take antibiotics exactly as your doctor prescribes; this helps ensure they have the opportunity to do their full job. Never purposely skip a dose or finish taking your meds early just because your symptoms start to subside. - Only take antibiotics prescribed for you by a doctor who knows you're pregnant. - Talk to your doctor about taking a probiotic supplement to replenish the good bacteria in your body. Try to take the probiotic and the antibiotic a few hours apart, if possible. - One antibiotic you should definitely avoid: tetracycline, which is often used to treat acne and can cause miscarriage, minor birth defects and possibly calcification of a [baby's bones and teeth](//www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/fetal-development/fetal-bones-skeletal-system/)(causing baby and permanent teeth to gray, and reducing the growth of some bones \u2014 though bone issue seems to return to normal after stopping the drug). Some research suggests that certain antibiotics may be linked to a higher risk of miscarriage and birth defects. This risk, however, is very low, and the illnesses the pregnant moms were being treated for could have been the cause for the miscarriages rather than the drugs themselves. Remember that while it's not wise to take antibiotics when they're not warranted (e.g. when you have a viral infection like the cold), they can be essential \u2014 even lifesaving \u2014 for your health and your baby's. If your doctor prescribes antibiotics and you're concerned, ask about the potential risks and benefits. How to safely take your medicine during pregnancy You've heard it before, but it bears repeating: Never take any medication, supplement or herbal remedy without checking with your health care provider first. A few more tips to keep in mind: - Make sure all your doctors are informed. Always tell any doctor you visit that you're expecting, and be sure to tell him or her about any other medications (antibiotics, etc.) that you've been prescribed. - Talk to your practitioner about meds you already take. Some medications are metabolized differently during pregnancy, so be sure to check with your doctor about whether you need to switch up dosage because you're expecting. And if you take a drug to control a chronic condition, you may need to make other adjustments. For example, if you take medication to help with morning sickness, you may want to take it at night instead so there's less of a chance you'll throw it up. Or, if you have to take a medication on an empty stomach (first thing in the morning), talk to your doctor about taking an anti-nausea suppository first. - Optimize it. Talk to your practitioner about ways you can optimize benefits and minimize risks for both you and your baby. For instance, you might want to take cold medications at night to help you sleep. Or you may be able to take a lower dose for a shorter amount of time and still get the intended/required effects. - Get all the details. Find out how often to take the medication, how to properly store it and if you should avoid any other medications, foods or beverages. (Your doctor as well as your pharmacist can help). - Know how your medication should look. Check it and read the label to make sure what you're getting is what your doctor prescribed. If you're not sure (say, because you get a generic instead of the brand-name drug), talk to your pharmacist or physician. - Double check all labels. Many OTC medications contain multiple active ingredients, some of which may be okay for pregnancy and others that may not. In addition, if you need to take more than one med to treat multiple symptoms or conditions, you may accidentally get a double dose of the same ingredient (acetaminophen, for example). - Read the patient information sheet. This helps you to understand how the medicine works along with any risks and possible side effects. Talk to your doctor about any potential side effects to look out for and report to him or her. - Take as directed. Don't alter the dose, skip doses or stop taking a medication before speaking to your doctor. - Don't share. Never use medicines that don't belong to you (or offer yours to others). If you have questions about how or when to take a medication, always talk to your practitioner first. Figuring out what's safe and what's not safe to take during pregnancy can be difficult. Fortunately, you don't have to go it alone. Understanding drug labels when you're pregnant The U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) prescription drug labeling system offers detailed summaries of a drug's effects on pregnancy, lactation and \"reproductive potential\" (i.e. men and women who might get pregnant or are trying to conceive). This label helps moms-to-be and nursing moms better understand the effects of a drug they're taking after a doc prescribes it. - The \"pregnancy\" section outlines the likelihood and seriousness of developmental abnormalities from exposure to a drug; when it should be prescribed; side effects; clinical trial data; directions for use during labor and delivery; and alternative treatments, if applicable. - The \"lactation\" section includes how much of the drug is secreted in breast milk; an estimate of how much an infant will consume as a result of mom taking the drug; data on the effects of a baby's exposure to the drug; and how to minimize an infant's exposure. - The \"reproductive potential\" section explains any effects the drug might have on contraception; pregnancy testing and infertility while and after you're taking it; and additional precautions to take. Questions? As always, talk to your doctor. "}
