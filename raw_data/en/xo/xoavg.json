One of the most common places you can get sick is at school.

[[10]](#_note-10)X Research source - 5Avoid sharing food or drinks with your friends. Although it might feel impolite to refuse your friend a sip of your soda, this is a great way to spread germs.

The best way to avoid passing your cold or flu onto someone else is to simply stay home when you are ill. Your body will also recover more quickly if you stay home and rest. [[12]](#_note-12)X Research source Avoiding Germ \"Hot Spots\" [Download Article](#) - 1Be careful in the bathroom. Although germs can live on most any surface, they are more likely to collect in certain places than others. In most schools the restrooms are cleaned at least once per day, but there are some areas that are frequently overlooked. It is estimated that 80% of all infections are caused by coming into contact with a contaminated surface. [[13]](#_note-13)X Research source - Toilet seats aren't actually as bad as we think they are, and they are usually cleaned on a regular basis. [[14]](#_note-14)X Research source - Door handles collect a lot of germs. The inside latch of a toilet stall has been touched by many students after using the toilet and wiping themselves. Many students also skip washing their hands, and then transfer their germs to the exit door as they leave. You can use a paper towel to open a door so that your hands don't get dirty. - If you are a boy, there is no need to be shy about peeing in a urinal next to other boys. This is a perfectly normal thing to do, avoids unnecessary contact with germs inside the toilet stalls, and helps to keep the stalls cleaner for everyone else. - Toilet seats aren't actually as bad as we think they are, and they are usually cleaned on a regular basis. - 2Sanitize cafeteria trays before using them.

The average desk is used by five or six students in a single day. If any of those kids were sick, they probably left some germs behind. - Keyboards and mice are also likely to collect germs. - Hand sanitizing wipes are the quickest way to clean shared surfaces. - 4Use care when using a drinking fountain. Some students put their mouths directly on the faucet, passing along their colds and flu to the next person in line. Try to avoid contact with the spout, and run the water for a few seconds before drinking. - There may be as many as 2.7 million bacteria per square inch living on a public drinking fountain spigot. [[15]](#_note-15)X Research source - If you want to be even safer, carry your own water bottle instead.

Outdoor facilities like park benches and playground equipment are usually not cleaned on a regular basis. Since these items are shared by a great number of students over the course of a day, they tend to collect a lot of germs. - Playground equipment has been shown to harbor trace amounts of fecal matter along with viruses and bacteria.
