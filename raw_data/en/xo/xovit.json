In 2001, General Assembly resolution 56/195 mandated the secretariat to \"serve as the focal point in the United Nations system for the coordination of disaster reduction and to ensure synergies among the disaster reduction activities of the United Nations system and regional organizations and activities in socio-economic and humanitarian fields\" . In 2005, the General Assembly, through resolution 60/195, endorsed the \"Hyogo Declaration\" and the \"Hyogo Framework for Action 2005-2015: Building the Resilience of Nations and Communities to Disasters\" as adopted by the World Conference on Disaster Reduction, held in Kobe, Hyogo, Japan, in January 2005. The ISDR secretariat and the United Nations system as a whole were tasked to support countries in the implementation of the Hyogo Framework. Under the Secretary-General's leadership, the United Nations system is gearing all efforts from global to national level to support countries own efforts to reduce the vulnerability of communities and building resilience of nations. Devastating recent disasters have highlighted that disaster-prone countries need an effective, efficient and well coordinated United Nations system. This is particularly the case in the area of disaster risk reduction, both in terms of institutional arrangements and levels of funding. The publication \"Disaster Risk Reduction in the United Nations\" gives an overview of roles, mandates and areas of work of a core set of United Nations agencies and the World Bank in support of national effort to reduce disaster risk. iv Roles, mandates and areas of work of key UN entitiesDisaster Risk Reduction in the United Nations While this compilation is not exhaustive, United Nations agencies were contacted to contribute to this work.

It helps developing countries and countries in transition to improve agriculture, forestry and fisheries practices to ensure food and nutrition security for all. FAO acts as a neutral forum where all nations meet as equals to negotiate agreements and debate policy strategies, priorities, norms and standards. FAO serves three global goals: 1. Reduction of the absolute number of people suffering from hunger, progressively ensuring a world in which all people at all times, have sufficient, safe and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy live. 2. Early elimination of poverty and the driving forward of economic and social progress for all with increased food production, enhanced rural development and sustainable livelihoods. 3. Sustainable management and utilization of natural resources , including land water air, climate and genetic resources, for the benefit of present and future generations. Disaster reduction goal FAO addressed DRR as integral part of its wider approach to disaster risk management, aiming to reduce the vulnerability of people before, during and after disasters. This integrated approach promotes capacity develop-ment for disaster risk reduction and livelihood resilience, ensures that disaster-affected populations recover swiftly from the initial damage and disruption.FAO The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations FAO2 Roles, mandates and areas of work of key UN entitiesDisaster Risk Reduction in the United Nations FAO's approach to DRR is linked to FAO's work on long term development and humanitarian assistance. It promotes institutional capacity development, hazard and food early warning systems as well as good practices and technologies in agriculture forestry, fisheries and natural resources management for preventing and mitigating the adverse impacts of crises on the most vulnerable people and ecosystems. FAO's goal for DRR is to reduce the vulnerability and enhance the resilience of agricultural livelihoods against threats and emergencies and protect and strengthen the food and nutrition security of farmers, fishers, pastoralists and foresters. This includes to: Support the enabling environment of member states, with appropriate legislation, policies and institutional frameworks for disaster risk reduction in agricultural sectors, and strengthen the institutional capacities to implement these. Provide, strengthen and harmonize food and nutrition security information and early warning systems to monitor the multiple threats to food security, and to enhance decision-making in preparedness and response, policy, advocacy, programming, prioritization, targeting. Develop capacities at all levels in preparedness to improve response and recovery for future threats to food and nutrition security, and to reduce their potential negative impact on livelihoods. Reduce the underlying risks to food and nutrition security and build the resilience of livelihoods through the application of good practices, processes and technologies in farming, fisheries and forestry. Policies and programmes in disaster risk reduction FAO's new Strategic Framework, launched in 2008 includes a corporate Strategic Objective on improved preparedness for, and effective response to, food and agricultural emergencies. The FAO Medium Term Plan (2010-2013) specifically identifies three key organizational results related to (1) disaster prevention and mitigation and preparedness, (2) emergency response and rehabilitation, and (3) transition and linkages to development as the focus for thematic and multidisciplinary results and interdisciplinary action over the next four years.Roles, mandates and areas of work of key UN entities 3Disaster Risk Reduction in the United Nations Each organizational result is coordinated by a dedicated multi-disiplinary technical team. In that context FAO has consolidated its DRR work into a new Framework Programme on DRR/M which is organized in four main pillars, which are correspond closely with priority areas of the HFA: Institutional Strengthening and Good Governance for DRR/M in Agricultural Sectors Information and early warning systems on food and nutrition security and trans-boundary threats Preparedness for Effective Response and Recovery in Agriculture, Livestock, Fisheries and Forestry Good practices, processes and technologies for mitigation and prevention in farming, fisheries and forestry Membership in Key Networks Inter-Agency Standing Committee International Consortium on Landslides Fire Management Actions Alliance Mountain Partnership Food Insecurity and Vulnerability Information and Mapping System Global Early Warning and Response System for Major Animal Diseases Land Degradation Assessment in Drylands National counterpart Ministries and/or departments of Agriculture, Forestry, Livestock, Fisheries and Environment and related extension services, research institutes, universities, NGOs, municipalities and farmers' organizations. FAO4 Roles, mandates and areas of work of key UN entitiesDisaster Risk Reduction in the United Nations Areas of work (to correspond with HFA priority areas 1-5) HFA Priority for Action 1 Making disaster risk reduction a policy priority, institutional strengthening Institutional strengthening and good governance on disaster risk reduction / management (DRR/M) in agriculture, fisheries, livestock, forestry and natural resources is an important area of work within FAO that promotes political commitment and supports with the resources required by member states to translate these into actionable results. Although the specific type of support provided by FAO varies across countries and depends on national needs, priorities and capacities, below are some options for capacity development, grouped under two sub-themes: 1. Institutional, legal and policy frameworks on DRR in support of food and nutrition security. National legislation on DRR/M includes and addresses agriculture, livestock, fisheries and aquaculture, forestry and natural resource management. Integration of DRR/M into agricultural and rural development policies. Integration of DRR/M into poverty reduction strategies linked to agriculture, fisheries, forestry and natural resource management. Support laws and regulations for the design, construction and equipment of safe boats safe boats and risk proven agricultural infrastructure. Representation of relevant line ministries in the national DRR/M structures. Inclusion of agriculture, food and nutrition security in national DRR/DRM strategy and action plans. Promote institutional and operational linkage between DRR and CCA in agricultural sectors. Mainstreaming pastoral risk management into national agricultural and development policies and strategies. Design vegetation fire management action frameworks at national level. 2. Capacity Development for the implementation of DRR in Agriculture Forestry and Fisheries Strengthen the capacity of line ministries, extension services and community-based organizations to deliver legislation, policies and strategies on DRR/M, through technical advice and training.Roles, mandates and areas of work of key UN entities 5Disaster Risk Reduction in the United Nations Support coordination, ensuring linkages among relevant line ministries (i.e. environment and natural resources and other sectoral authorities). Promote and support Community-based DRR/M approaches and local DRR/M planning. Support capacities of technical line ministries and extension services to translate DRR/M legislation and policies into national and local strategies and plans. Support sustainable natural resource management strategies and practices (wetland management, efficient food-energy system, land and soil and water management). Promote sustainable land use planning to reduce risks. National Action plans for the fisheries sector that follow the Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries (CCRF). Support national strategies on aquatic animal health for bio-security risks related to trans-boundary aquatic animal diseases. Promote partnerships among CBOs, research centres and extension services for DRR/M in agriculture. Integration of agriculture, food and nutrition security in national preparedness / contingency plans. HFA Priority for Action 2Risk assessment and early warning systems Technical assistance and capacity development is country-specific depending on national needs, capacities and priorities. Support and implementation of this information and early warning systems on food and nutrition security and trans-boundary threats ensure that member countries are be better equipped with high quality data and information, and analytical capacity, to anticipate and prevent food crises, and be better able to improve the food and nutrition security situation of households, communities and nations. The basis for capacity development under this thematic pillar includes: National ownership and institutional building. FAO6 Roles, mandates and areas of work of key UN entitiesDisaster Risk Reduction in the United Nations Cross-sectoral approach integrating agriculture, livestock, fisheries, forestry and natural resources and hence involving the various technical governmental bodies, universities, research institutes, NGOs and others. Reinforcing capacities and partnerships able to provide technical support and training. Options for capacity development is centred on the following 3 core themes: 1. Improved food and nutrition security information systems: Through this theme FAO strengthen the knowledge-base on risks and vulnerabilities to food and nutrition security, which may include establishing / strengthening the following: Mapping risks to agricultural livelihoods Statistical baselines Vulnerability assessment and analysis FAO support the collection, processing, analysis, storage, and information exchange of statistical data to improve the knowledge base, the scope and quality of information, and analysis of risks and vulnerability in national agriculture, livestock, fisheries, forestry and natural resources. It can do so with technical assistance, financial resources, technology transfer, information and communication technology, training and scientific cooperation. Statistics on food and nutrition security constitute the information baseline for analysis, early warning monitoring, policy formulation and programming. FAO houses, maintains and updates a substantive body of historical statistical datasets. FAO makes available its existing in-house capacities, including the statistical time series, technology and technical know-how available through FAOSTAT, CountryStat, Nutrition It strives to achieve an integrative approach that includes all data and information relevant to food and nutrition security, and hence fisheries, agriculture, livestock, and forestry. It does so on the basis of national demands, capacities and funding complementing existing information services as required, yet striving to achieve greater consistency, coherence and efficiency.Roles, mandates and areas of work of key UN entities 7Disaster Risk Reduction in the United Nations 2. Harmonized early warning for monitoring the multiple threats to food and nutrition security: FAOs early warning monitoring capacities constitutes one additional options for capacity development for member states, building on the improved food and nutrition security information systems mentioned above. In early warning, this pillar contributes to the achievement of the following outcomes: Well-designed and better-targeted investments in early warning for food and nutrition security. Harmonized early warning that integrates the agriculture, fisheries, livestock and forestry sectors to enable holistic monitoring and analysis of the multiple threats to food and nutrition security. Improved data collection and analysis on food access, utilization and supply. Improved monitoring of new emerging threats, such as volatility in agricultural commodity markets, food policies, new pandemic threats, and climate change. FAO has long-established early warning services that monitor threats to food and nutrition security, and contribute in a critical way to the fight against hunger, malnutrition and poverty. This includes the following, among others: GIEWS: Global Information and Early Warning System on Food and Agriculture, which monitors and reports on agricultural production and commodity markets, short-term forecasts and medium-term projections on food supply and demand, food balance sheets, food prices, crop prospects, requirements for external assistance, and other data. FCC EMPRES: Under its Food Chain Crisis Management Framework (FCC), FAO manages the Emergency Prevention System for Trans-boundary Animal and Plant Pests and Diseases (EMPRES), which aims to detect, prevent, contain and control the world's most serious livestock and plant pests and diseases, while also surveying for newly emerging pathogens. FIRMS: Fishery Resources Monitoring System, which provides information on the global monitoring and management of fishery marine resources. GFIMS: Global Forest Fire Information Management System, which provides real-time monitoring of forest fires around the world FAO8 Roles, mandates and areas of work of key UN entitiesDisaster Risk Reduction in the United Nations HFA Priority for Action 3 Education, information and public awareness FAO is a knowledge organization, and knowledge management is a Core Function embedded in its Strategic Framework. It is in addition a cross-cutting priority in its DRR/M Framework Programme, in line with its corporate priorities and in response to the critical role it plays in disaster risk reduction and in Climate Change Adaptation (CCA) for food and nutrition security. While there is by now considerable knowledge and knowledge sharing on disaster risk reduction in general, its direct relation to food and nutrition security is less developed. There are key knowledge gaps which FAO aims to fill by making use of its comparative advantages in this sector. The knowledge management strategy for DRR/M builds on current KM efforts within FAO, and aims to substantially increase awareness and knowledge, understanding and visibility of the importance of disaster risk reduction in the fight against hunger when embedded across the agricultural sectors. It is also strategically important for advocacy, to harness greater interest and commitment on the part of the international community, and for increasing financial resources in favour of member states and particularly vulnerable small-scale farmers. FAO is exploring DRR/M KM strategic partnerships with key partners with complementary mandates and interests. The Communication for Sustainable Development Initiative (CSDI) supports the design of local communication strategies on climate change adaptation, natural resource management and DRR, including technical assistance to extension services, farmer organizations and field projects. HFA Priority for Action 4 Reducing underlying risk factors To adequately protect agricultural livelihoods and hence food and nutrition security it is critical to reduce the underlying risks and to build the resilience of farmers, pastoralists, fishers, foresters. FAO supports member countries in reducing negative impact of natural hazards and other threats to food and nutrition security through the application of appropriate technologies and practices in agriculture forestry and fisheries, as well as sound environmental and natural resource management practices and sustainable use of ecosystems. The application of appropriate technologies, processes and/or practices is always location and context specific, depending on the threats to food and nutrition security of a particular country or geographic location, on crops produced and local agricultural practices, among other factors. Roles, mandates and areas of work of key UN entities 9Disaster Risk Reduction in the United Nations Examples of the technologies, processes and practices which FAO promoting to reduce underlying risks, include: Conservation Agriculture (CA); Seed Security, strengthening national and local seed systems; Agro-forestry integrated approach combining trees and shrubs with crops and/or livestock; Integrated Pest Management (IPM) which supports both sustainable intensification of crop production and pesticide risk reduction; Sustainable Water Management approaches addressing water use efficiency and productivity; Control of animal and plant pests and diseases; Breeding of hazard tolerant crop varieties and animal species; Biodiversity conservation; Sustainable crop and livestock production; Agricultural management, marketing and finance; Forest fires and fire management; Catchment area management; Precautionary measures for fisheries and safety at sea; and Climate change adaptation. Etc. HFA Priority for Action 5Preparedness for effective response FAO supports member states with different preparedness measures, including assisting countries to develop food safety contingency and response plans, supporting preparedness planning and simulation exercises for Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza, and much more. At the same time, FAO has been investing to strengthen its internal capacity to prepare and respond effectively to emergencies worldwide, for example through its Crisis Management Centre - Animal Health (CMC-AH) as a rapid response mechanism for trans-boundary animal disease emergencies. FAO10 Roles, mandates and areas of work of key UN entitiesDisaster Risk Reduction in the United Nations Technical assistance and capacity development for member states centre on the following two outcomes: 1. Strengthened local and national preparedness in agriculture, fisheries, livestock and forestry. Support community-level preparedness with appropriate technologies and practices, such as: Support local and national preparedness / contingency plans for agriculture, fisheries, forestry, and livestock. Integration of agriculture into local and national preparedness / contingency plans. Inclusion of agricultural sectors in inter-agency preparedness / contingency plans. 2. FAO Preparedness Plans in focus countries: FAO applied preparedness planning as standard practice to strengthen the capacity of its decentralized offices to prepare for and respond to recurrent and priority emergencies / threats. Preparedness Plans address the following elements: Crisis scenario and response requirements Surge capacity: standby agreements, roster. Management arrangements Coordination and partnerships Logistics and ICT (pre-positioning) Procurement preparedness (forward tendering, market research, local suppliers) Programming /Financing (pre-develop project and programme profiles/concept, seed funding, etc...). Procedures: focal points, contact lists, reporting lines. FAO supports member states at national level with different preparedness measures in agriculture, fisheries, livestock and forestry, including for example assisting countries to develop food safety contingency and response plans, supporting preparedness planning and simulation exercises for Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza. In addition FAO supports community-level preparedness with appropriate technologies and practices, such as:Roles, mandates and areas of work of key UN entities 11Disaster Risk Reduction in the United Nations Support local and national preparedness / contingency plans for agriculture, fisheries, forestry, and livestock.

It is a unique partnership of 36 countries and 7 international/regional organizations committed to help developing countries reduce their vulnerability to natural hazards, adapt to climate change and to support and strengthen the ISDR system. Launched in September 2006, GFDRR responds to a call from the international community to accelerate the Hyogo Framework for Action, the global blueprint for disaster risk reduction efforts adopted by the United Nations. GFDRR is managed by the World Bank on behalf of the participating donor partners and other partnering stakeholders. It offers a unique business model for advancing disaster risk reduction based on ex-ante support to high risk countries and ex-post assistance for accelerated recovery and risk reduction after a disaster. This partnership has been successful in raising the profile of disaster risk reduction for sustainable development.

GFDRR's promotion of the integration of DRR and climate adaptation in development efforts is supported by a comprehensive system that allows proactive policy dialogue on DRR with country teams while strategies and lending operations are formulated, and follow-up monitoring of process made over subsequent strategies. Through Track I, GFDRR works to enhance global and regional advocacy to promote the implementation of the Hyogo Framework for Action in partnership with the United Nations. Through advocacy and continuous engagement with key regional organizations, the partnership has helped to elevate disaster risk management as a key priority for policy-makers, governments and practitioners, thereby building a demand for more targeted country DRM programs, particularly in high-risk, low- and middle-income countries. Building national capacity is a key component of GFDRR interventions for mainstreaming DRR in GFDRR's 31 focus countries. GFDRR's investments for capacity building address the institutions in disaster-prone countries in a comprehensive, multi-sector fashion, spanning all government sectors and levels that share responsibility for reducing the vulnerability of communities to disasters. HFA Priority for Action 2 Risk assessment and early warning systems GFDRR funded disaster and climate risk assessments are the foundation of decision-making processes for a wide variety of actors from the public to the private sector. GFDRR has established close partnership with technical agencies to strengthen risk assessment. Track II has supported development of national risk maps and/or platforms in Madagascar, Mozambique, Malawi, Senegal, Yemen, Colombia and the Caribbean.Roles, mandates and areas of work of key UN entities 15Disaster Risk Reduction in the United Nations HFA Priority for Action 3 Education, information and public awareness GFDRR's investments for capacity building address the institutions in disaster-prone countries in a comprehensive, multi-sector fashion, spanning all government sectors and levels that share responsibility for reducing the vulnerability of communities to disasters. GFDRR supports development of global knowledge products with high policy impacts for disaster risk reduction such as the Handbook for Reconstruction after Natural Disasters, \"Safer Homes, Stronger Communities\" and the UN-World Bank report \"Natural Hazards, UnNatural Disasters: The Economics of Effective Prevention.The Global Assessment Report, produced by UNISDR, United Nations Development Programme and the World Bank with financial and technical support from GFDRR, has expanded the global understanding of natural disaster risks. GFDRR is also engaging with International Financial Institutions (IFIs) in disaster risk management, both at an operational level with key Regional Development Banks, and at a global level, through the newly established IFIs Forum. HFA Priority for Action 4 Reducing underlying risk factors Through its Disaster Risk Reduction Mainstreaming Program (Track II), GFDRR is funding over 120 disaster risk management and inter-related climate risk management programs in more than 50 disaster-prone low and middle-income countries with a portfolio of nearly US$ 90M. Track II provides ex-ante assistance to developing countries to mainstream and expand disaster risk reduction (DRR) and climate change adaptation activities. GFDRR's Disaster risk financing and insurance (DRFI) solutions provide efficient means for countries to financially protect themselves from natural disasters as well as foster DRM efforts. DRFI strategies allow countries to increase their financial response capacity in the aftermath of disasters and to reduce the economic and fiscal burden of natural disasters by transferring excess losses to the private capital and insurance markets. GFDRR has co-financed 17 technical assistance (TA) projects or project components on disaster risk financing since its establishment in 2006. Thirty-three developing countries spanning all six WB regions have benefitted GFDRR-funded DRFI projects. Projects fall under three categories: Sovereign disaster risk financing (SDRF), property catastrophe risk insurance (PCRI), and agricultural insurance (AI). GFDRR16 Roles, mandates and areas of work of key UN entitiesDisaster Risk Reduction in the United Nations HFA Priority for Action 5 Preparedness for effective response GFDRR's Standby Recovery Financing Facility (Track III) provides rapid technical and financial assistance for sustainable disaster recovery. Australia, EC, Luxembourg, Italy, Norway and Sweden are the contributing donors of Track III with a cumulative pledge of USD 27 million. Key highlights include: 1. Since its establishment in 2007, GFDRR has so far assisted over 38 countries in assessing medium and longer term disaster impacts and needs for sustainable post-disaster recovery. 2. GFDRR-supported Post-Disaster Needs Assessments (PDNA) have succeeded in delivering a coordinated system of international assistance to disaster-affected countries. 3. GFDRR Track III has established partnership agreements with centers of global expertise to make global best practices in disaster recovery available to disaster-stricken countries. 4. GFDRR supported capacity building for PDNAs and recovery planning has enabled countries to institutionalize PDNAs in the national system. 5. GFDRR is constantly refining the knowledge and tools needed for measuring disaster impacts. Other activities The GFDRR has developed a Results Model which provides an innovative way forward and quantification methodology for Global DRM Results Meas-urement. The current GFDRR-specific model can be further refined and rep-licated into a more generic, pre-programmed \"Global DRM Results Model\" . The biggest value-addition of such a model would that it would be able to quantify DRM Mainstreaming Progress and Impacts across all countries, using multiple international standards such as the HFA and Climate Change Risk Management standards. The GFDRR Results Model provides an innovative globally-replicable DRM results quantification model that: (a) combines qualitative information from multiple sources so as to give a '360 degree' view on impact (b) simultane-ously links the \" results-chain\" with international developmental standards and benchmarks such as the HFA, climate change standards; (c) uses a 'contribution/partnership based results measurement approach' for multi-donor, multi-recipient developmental programs; and; (d) promotes end-user participation and complete procedural transparency.Roles, mandates and areas of work of key UN entities 17Disaster Risk Reduction in the United Nations Focal Point Saroj Kumar Jha Program Manager, GFDRR and Team Leader, DRM Global Expert Team, The World Bank Website www.gfdrr.org GFDRR18 Roles, mandates and areas of work of key UN entitiesDisaster Risk Reduction in the United Nations General description of the organization The International Labour Organization (ILO) is the United Nations agency devoted to advancing opportunities for women and men to obtain decent and productive work in conditions of freedom, equity, security and human dignity. Its main aims are (i) to promote rights at work, (ii) encourage decent employment opportunities, (iii) enhance social protection and (iv) strengthen dialogue in handling work-related issues. ILO is the only 'tripartite' United Nations agency in that it brings together governments and representative organizations of employers and workers to jointly shape labour policies and to negotiate agreements by consensus. This unique arrangement gives ILO an edge in advancing the creation of decent jobs and the kind of economic and working conditions that give working people and business people a stake in coping with crisis and in creating lasting prosperity and progress. Disaster reduction goal In disaster scenarios, ILO - in partnership with other UN and multilateral agencies - contributes to enhance disaster recovery and risk reduction efforts focusing on employment creation, income generation, disaster risk reduction of vulnerable livelihoods and the promotion of sustainable local development. Policies and programmes in disaster risk reduction ILO aims to reduce the impact of disasters on the employment and income by promoting risk reduction measures for productive livelihoods and effective and efficient post-disaster recovery efforts. ILO works to respond to HFA priorities by developing the capacity of key institutions, such as economic and labour ministries, workers' and employers' organizations, ILO International Labour Organization Roles, mandates and areas of work of key UN entities 19Disaster Risk Reduction in the United Nations in order to (i) support stakeholders for quick recovery in the aftermath of disasters focusing on employment creation, (ii) introduce policies and programmes focusing on preparedness and planning for livelihood recovery, and (iii) implement active measures for reducing livelihood vulnerabilities and risks, in disaster-prone areas. By mobilizing relevant actors for reconstruction, crises can open a window of opportunity to promote decent work for a better future. The \"ILO Declaration on Social Justice for a Fair Globalization\" adopted by the International Labour Conference in 2008 institutionalizes the Decent Work concept developed by the ILO since 1999. The \"Global Employment Agenda\" is one of the instruments for the implementation of the Social Justice Declaration. The UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) approved a Ministerial Declaration encouraging the UN system to develop a toolkit to promote decent work. Since then ILO has worked closely with other agencies through the Chief Executives Board (CEB) chaired by the UN Secretary General. The final product, the CEB Toolkit for Mainstreaming Employment and Decent Work, is designed to help organizations, throughout the multilateral system, assess and improve employment and decent work outcomes of their own policies, programmes and activities. \"Decent Work Country Programmes\" (DWCP), adopted by Governments as a component of the UNDAF and PRSP , constitute the country frameworks for ILO's pre-disaster risk reduction interventions and post-disaster recovery. Within this framework, ILO promotes the participation of its constituents in implementing targeted decent employment recovery and development policies and orienting livelihood risk reduction programs. In disaster recovery scenarios, ILO works actively with the UN and other multilateral agencies to develop policies and programmes that support the creation of decent employment opportunities as a central plank of efforts to reduce and eradicate poverty, thus helping affected populations avoid becoming dependent on relief aid and fall into a vicious circle of poverty aggravated by shocks and crises. Concurrently, ILO seeks to advocate and raise awareness among disaster actors to place decent employment concerns and local economic recovery strategies at the forefront of national and international efforts in promoting disaster risk management. It focuses on employment and vulnerable livelihoods through a variety of policies and programmes: Support to Employment Policies and Social Dialogue Rapid assessments of impact of disasters on employment and income ILO20 Roles, mandates and areas of work of key UN entitiesDisaster Risk Reduction in the United Nations Implementation and monitoring of livelihood risk reduction and recovery programs Employment-intensive Infrastructure programmes Targeted support to vulnerable groups and sectors Employability development and vocational training systems Support to SMEs and micro-enterprises Support to micro finance schemes Expansion of coverage of Social Security and Safety Nets Local Economic Recovery programs Establishment/consolidation of Emergency Employment Services, and Expert support to Cash Transfer Programs, in the aftermath of disasters. The ILO Crisis Response and Reconstruction Programme (ILO/CRISIS) is charged with bringing ILO's decent work and socio-economic expertise to bear on pre-disaster livelihood risk reduction and employment recovery of affected economies. Its roles are: prompting, mobilizing and orchestrating the \"whole-of-ILO\" response to crisis challenges; building the capacities of ILO constituents, partners and field staff, through the provision of tools, training and joint crisis response work; as well as establishing and strengthening partnerships and promoting joint project financing. The International Training Centre of the ILO, based in Turin, Italy, provides training and related services that develop human resources and institutional capabilities. In conjunction with ILO/CRISIS, the International Training Centre of the ILO (ITC/ILO) is committed to contribute to the ISDR and the implementation of the Hyogo Framework for Action 2005-2015 at the local level. It focuses on disaster risk reduction within the framework of sustainable local development, through three core lines of action: Training and capacity building: design, preparation and implementation of training activities (face-to-face and distance learning modalities) on disaster risk reduction and sustainable local development. A one-year training course in blended modality is currently available for the Americas in Spanish language and an English pilot version is about to be launched at inter-regional level. Short courses and workshops are implemented at country-level.Roles, mandates and areas of work of key UN entities 21Disaster Risk Reduction in the United Nations Information sharing and knowledge management: creation and management of an effective set of ICT and networking tools and databases at the service of the ISDR system, partner institutions and participants in the training courses.

ILO supports Ministries of Labour in setting up or re-orienting governments' active labour market policies aiming at guiding and facilitating the establishment of mechanisms able to respond with national budget allocations and public programs to the livelihood risk reduction policies needed in disaster-risk areas. ILO22 Roles, mandates and areas of work of key UN entitiesDisaster Risk Reduction in the United Nations Tripartism and social dialogue at enterprise, sectoral and national levels, are ILO's bedrocks. These elements are key in disaster settings to minimize the risks and the effects of a disaster on productive livelihoods. Strong and solid dialogue helps, on one side, reduce the impact of a crisis, rebuild communities and social networks, and restart the affected productive livelihoods on a sound development path. On the other side, it helps in securing that livelihood risk management becomes a priority in policies and programs. In disaster prone countries ILO, through its institutional counterpart the Ministry of Labour, promotes and supports the establishment of Inter-institutional Livelihood Risk Management Working Groups. This WG, established within the framework of the National Integrated Disaster Management Platform, includes different institutions and helps in maintaining a broad-based dialogue among the Government, Trade Unions and Employers' organizations, at national, regional and local levels. The main task of this WG is to ensure institutional support to the integration of livelihood risk reduction measures into development policies and planning. The WG also promotes the necessary legislative modifications and facilitates coordination of all livelihood risk reduction and recovery preparedness interventions. On the basis of the assessment of existing human resource capacities for livelihood risk reduction, ILO develops capacity-building initiatives for its constituents and public officials, at central and local levels as appropriate. HFA Priority for Action 2 Risk assessment and early warning systems Rapid employment and livelihood impact assessments. ILO has a consolidated methodology for rapid labour market and livelihood assessments that return information on the extent of the employment situation and opportunities in disaster-risk areas. Recently ILO and FAO have jointly developed a toolkit for a comprehensive livelihood impact assessment (the LAT) that, in combination with hazard mappings and vulnerability assessments, provides crucial information and enable decision-makers to assess the needs for increasing resilience and reducing disaster risk of livelihoods. This assessment also contributes to build up baseline information, on labour markets and the status of livelihoods in at-risk areas, that will be essential to quantify and qualify needed recovery interventions and allow monitoring of recovery programs. Roles, mandates and areas of work of key UN entities 23Disaster Risk Reduction in the United Nations To this aim, ILO in collaboration with other agencies supports the development of common indicators and methodologies for monitoring livelihood risk management and recovery programs. It also develops cost-benefit analysis of the implementation of livelihood risk reduction measures. In collaboration with other relevant agencies ILO uses space-based technologies to support assessment of livelihood risks and vulnerabilities to disasters, particularly for determining potential effects and impacts of disasters on productive livelihoods in at-risk areas. It is also currently developing methods in view of incorporating these tools into decision-making processes. HFA Priority for Action 3 Education, information and public awareness ILO, through its constituents and taking into consideration the local culture, supports the dissemination of information on livelihood disaster risks reduction and recovery options, especially addressing workers' and employers' organizations in high-risk areas, with the aim of encouraging and enabling people to take action to reduce livelihood risks and build resilience to disaster shocks. It also promotes the establishment of networks among disaster and livelihoods experts and shares its knowledge on good practices, cost-effective livelihood risk reduction measures, and lessons learned in the field, with all actors involved in disaster risk reduction, through participating in global coordination platforms, such as the CWGER and the IRP . Through the ITC/ILO training and capacity building initiatives, the ILO is directly contributing to increase the level of information and awareness of local actors in Spanish speaking countries of the Americas, in the field of local strategic planning for disaster risk reduction, pre-disaster preparedness and post-disaster sustainable reconstruction linked to local development processes. The first two editions of the training course have contributed to the creation of a network of multiplier agents and focal points playing a key role in increasing and disseminating information in the region. This peer group of former participants actively contribute to training content validation, creation of bridges to high-risk and difficult target countries, systematization of local development and DRR practices, research and exchange on contents development and new approaches to DRR, advocacy in support of the implementation of the HFA at the local level. This network, whose members are from the Americas, should be soon attached and provide inputs to the new Local Governance Alliance for DRR initiative promoted by the UN/ISDR Secretariat in Geneva. ILO24 Roles, mandates and areas of work of key UN entitiesDisaster Risk Reduction in the United Nations HFA Priority for Action 4 Reducing underlying risk factors Mainstreaming livelihood risk management. ILO works at incorporating productive livelihoods risk reduction measures into planning policies, post-disaster recovery and rehabilitation processes and promotes the use of all opportunities to develop local capacities aiming at reducing livelihood risk in the long term. Through the mobilization of its constituents, ILO promotes the establishment of forms of public-private partnerships to better engage the local private sector in livelihood risk reduction activities; and encourages all stakeholders to foster a culture of disaster prevention, putting greater emphasis on pre-disaster risk reduction interventions. Capacity development on Disaster Risk Reduction within the Framework of Sustainable Local Development. The main objective of the training courses is to contribute to improving individual and institutional capacity in the design, implementation and assessment of sustainable local development strategies that fully integrate disaster risk reduction as a key factor of the sustainable development process. Incorporating livelihood risk reduction into development planning. ILO collaborates with relevant ministries and agencies to incorporate livelihood disaster risk management into: (i) rural development planning and management; (ii) planning and management of ecosystems, focusing on strategies for reducing livelihood risk and increasing resilience while creating job opportunities in the form of \"green jobs\"; (iii) programs promoting food security and diversification of agriculture-based livelihoods; (iv) urban planning and slum-upgrading programmes and management of disaster-prone human settlements, focusing on livelihood activities implemented within the house (considering the particular relevance in terms of livelihood risk reduction since many self-employment and livelihood activities are implemented mainly informally and in unsafe conditions in such housing); and (v) health sector programmes, in order to link livelihood risk reduction with programs for Safety and Health at Workplace as a component for promoting decent work practices, consolidate livelihood resilience and reduce risk in case of disaster. Labour-intensive programs. ILO promotes the use of labour-based/labour- intensive methods in strengthening, retrofitting and re-building critical public facilities and other physical infrastructure. In a post-disaster setting, labour-friendly activities benefit affected communities by generating jobs and income quickly while rebuilding damaged infrastructure. They Roles, mandates and areas of work of key UN entities 25Disaster Risk Reduction in the United Nations are also an important bridge between immediate needs and longer-term reconstruction and development. Enhancing employability through vocational training. ILO invests - in the aftermath of a disaster - in upgrading the employability of job-seekers to facilitate their absorption in the labour market. In post-disaster situations training can help affected individuals and households in restarting their livelihoods and reducing dependence from relief aid. In addressing this challenge, ILO has developed a solid expertise, including in the non-formal or unorthodox approaches sometimes needed to launch adapted training services in at-risk areas or badly damaged post-disaster economies. Support to SMEs and micro-enterprises. ILO promotes the diversification of household income options for populations in high-risk areas in order to reduce their vulnerability to hazards and ensure that their income and assets are not undermined by behaviours that increase their vulnerability to disasters. Through the expanded use of well tested training packages, such as Start and Improve Your Business, the Women Entrepreneurship Progamme and other tools, ILO supports enterprises to consolidate their position into the formal or informal market, provides advisory services to governments, employers' organizations and workers' associations on policies and programmes to facilitate finance for SMEs, as well as advice on tools and approaches for responsible restructuring of sectors, value chains and enterprises. To this aim, ILO also works at enabling the local environment for enterprises, developing value chains, and enhancing local economic development and the performance of the small and micro enterprises. Support to Microfinance Schemes. In order to contribute to livelihood disaster risk reduction and increase resilience of employment and income, ILO - through its microfinance programme - promotes the development of financial risk-sharing mechanisms, particularly insurance and reinsurance against disasters, as appropriate. It also promotes alternative and innovative financial instruments for addressing livelihood disaster risk. ILO's intervention tools include expert support for micro-scale informal activities and micro-credit schemes, materials, marketing advice, guidance, and training to microfinance lenders and micro- and small-scale enterprises, including cooperatives. Targeted support to vulnerable groups and sectors. By supporting the government in implementing special programs targeted to vulnerable people and sectors, such as, introducing temporary youth employment programs, ILO contributes to the aim of diversifying livelihoods and ILO26 Roles, mandates and areas of work of key UN entitiesDisaster Risk Reduction in the United Nations increasing the resilience of the household by reducing the risks related to the complete loss of job and income in the event of a disaster. ILO also works to ensure that programmes for displaced persons take into consideration the employment creation needs and do not increase livelihood risk and vulnerability to future hazards. Through its Combating Child Labour Programme - ILO works to raise awareness of the families and target psychological damage of vulnerable populations, particularly children, in the aftermath of disasters. Furthermore, ILO collaborates with the relevant ministries and agencies engaged in strengthening the implementation of social safety-net mechanisms targeting the poor, the elderly and the disabled and other vulnerable populations, as a means of reducing disaster vulnerabilities and risks. Social Security and Safety Nets. ILO provides specialized expertise in support to relevant Ministries for programs aiming the extension of the coverage of the Social Security to the poor and most-vulnerable, including those working in the informal sector in at-risk areas. It also supports the dissemination of information on the role of Safety and Health at the Workplace and social security and safety nets in mitigating the effects of natural shocks on the household. The Local Economic Recovery/Development programmes (LER/D) are an effective holistic approach that ILO applies in crises scenarios for harmonizing and enhancing the package of different measures needed for reducing livelihood disaster risk or for the recovery of affected local economies. The LER/D approach seeks to support the increasing of local business capacity and stimulating endogenous dynamics through consensus-based action. ILO has used LER/D strategies in crisis operations since the early 1990s. This approach combines tailored tools and methodologies in such areas as business promotion, employability training, social finance, employment-intensive investments, and social dialogue. Emergency Employment Services. In post-disaster situations, ILO's expertise in this area helps government revitalize or establish \"employment services\" and orient them toward current needs of job seekers and local employers. ILO works to support governments establish or reorient information exchanges to meet specific post-disaster needs, including evaluating the volume and type of job seekers, and the skill requirements of humanitarian and reconstruction operations. This also contributes to livelihood disaster risk reduction in view of future natural events. ILO works with the World Association of Public Employment Services (WAPES) to collect and share good practices and tools for crisis response.Roles, mandates and areas of work of key UN entities 27Disaster Risk Reduction in the United Nations Cash Transfer programs. In post disaster situations, ILO provides to government its specialized expertise in strengthening income maintenance measures for affected people who lost their job, through various measures, including complementary cash transfer programs. HFA Priority for Action 5 Preparedness for effective response ILO - through its \"Pre-disaster Recovery Planning for Livelihoods\" (Pre- DRP/L)\" initiative - helps governments and other constituents to consider, ahead of time, how best to identify vulnerabilities in the productive livelihoods of the people living in areas at-risk, promote livelihood risk reduction measures and increase livelihood recovery preparedness before disasters strike, thus also contributing to reduce extreme poverty in those areas. The Pre-DRP/L is specifically designed to provide key stakeholders with a guiding document to help quickly and effectively restore and enhance livelihoods and economic activity and to introduce livelihood risk reduction measures thus increasing employment resilience in view of future disasters. ILO has recently developed a first edition of specific \"Pre-DRP/L Guidelines\" to orient decision makers and technical practitioners in supporting the implementation of livelihood risk management and quick livelihood recovery measures.

OCHA is lead by the Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, who is also the Chair of the ISDR system as well as the Chair of the Inter-Agency Standing Committee. Disaster reduction goal One of OCHA's objectives is greater incorporation of disaster risk reduction approaches into humanitarian work and strengthened preparedness for effective humanitarian response. Policies and programmes in disaster risk reduction OCHA, in cooperation with UNISDR, developed a Guidance and Indicator Package for Implementing Priority 5 of the HFA, Disaster Preparedness for Effective Response. This tool provides guidance on disaster preparedness strengthening as set out in Priority 5 of the HFA. It aims primarily to assist governments, local authorities and other stakeholders and expands upon the disaster preparedness and response components of the ISDR guidelines \"Words into action: Implementing the Hyogo Framework for Action\" .

In responding to the emerging need for adapting to climate change and other humanitarian concerns, OCHA is increasingly focused not only on operational preparedness, which includes building the emergency response capacity of the humanitarian community through preparedness planning and capacity development, but also on supporting institutional preparedness through engagement with national governments, strengthened legal frameworks and resource mobilization initiatives. OCHA34 Roles, mandates and areas of work of key UN entitiesDisaster Risk Reduction in the United Nations HFA Priority for Action 2 Risk assessment and early warning systems OCHA is involved as one of the ISDR Inter-Agency partners in strengthening national capacities for tsunami early warning and response systems in the Indian Ocean. Technical assistance and support covers capacities in policy design and planning, institutional and operational infrastructure for national disaster preparedness, within the context of regional early warning and response systems. HFA Priority for Action 3 Education, information and public awareness CADRI (Capacity for Disaster Reduction Initiative) was created in March 2007 and launched in June 2007 at the Global Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction to succeed to the UN Disaster Management Training Programme (UN DMTP) which trained United Nations, government and civil society professionals for their disaster roles, between 1990-2006. CADRI is an inter-agency initiative between UNDP/BCPR, OCHA and UNISDR. CADRI aims at advancing knowledge and practices for the development of sustainable disaster risk reduction capacities in high-risk countries for Governments and the UN system and serves as the vehicle through which UNISDR, OCHA and UNDP/BCPR can achieve a more synergistic approach to disaster risk management. OCHA administers ReliefWeb, the world's leading on-line gateway to information (documents and maps) on humanitarian emergencies and disasters. An independent vehicle of information, launched in 1996 and designed specifically to assist the international humanitarian community in effective delivery of emergency assistance, it provides timely, reliable and relevant information as events unfold, while emphasizing the coverage of \"forgotten emergencies\" at the same time. The Integrated Regional Information Networks (IRIN) provides news and analysis about sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East and parts of Asia for the humanitarian community. The networks target decision-makers in relief agencies and host and donor governments, among others, and strive to ensure that affected communities can also access reliable information. OCHARoles, mandates and areas of work of key UN entities 35Disaster Risk Reduction in the United Nations HFA Priority for Action 4 Reducing underlying risk factors OCHA leads and facilitates a number of inter-agency consultations on the humanitarian implications of climate change, including the discussions in the IASC.

OCHA launched a Climate Change Campaign in December 2008 to highlight the humanitarian impacts of climate change and call for a system-wide shift of attention, resources and expertise to improve disaster preparedness, within the wider disaster risk reduction approach. OCHA promotes to ensure continuity and predictability in coordination support throughout the recovery period in cooperation with UNDGO and UNDP/BCPR. It supports and advocates for \"building back better\" through the shelter guidelines it publishes in cooperation with major international relief providers. HFA Priority for Action 5 Preparedness for effective response At the headquarters level, OCHA coordinates the promotion of emergency preparedness for effective response in close cooperation with relevant entities such as UNDP's Bureau for Crisis Prevention and Recovery, UNISDR, the World Bank, IFRC, donors, and humanitarian agencies in the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC), including the support to the IASC Task Force on Climate Change. Within the Emergency Services Branch, the Emergency Preparedness Section works in collaboration with other OCHA entities to promote the implementation of the HFA Priority 5. It supports OCHA's Regional and Field Offices in coordinating, providing technical advice and ensuring consistent emergency preparedness work across geographical regions. Moreover, OCHA promotes effective response preparedness with the humanitarian partners in such areas as promotion of inter-agency contingency planning, strengthening of international response tools (UNDAC, INSARAG), implementation of the Cluster Approach, HC/RC strengthening, information management and humanitarian financing system (CERF, CAP , Flash Appeals). At the field level, OCHA assists promotion OCHA36 Roles, mandates and areas of work of key UN entitiesDisaster Risk Reduction in the United Nations of disaster preparedness in disaster-prone countries and regions, through its network of Regional and Field Offices as well as Regional Disaster Response Advisors (RDRAs) and National Disaster Response Advisors (NDRAs). Specifically, OCHA assists RC/HCs and UNCTs in disaster-and conflict prone countries in conducting contingency and preparedness planning and promoting functioning inter-agency coordination structures. It provides technical advice to national governments in elaborating national contingency and preparedness plans, including related practical measures such as customs facilitation measures and pre-positioning of relief items. It also strengthens regional collaboration in disaster preparedness with various regional organizations. A pilot project, Strategic Partnership for Preparedness (SPP) was initiated in Ghana.

Disaster reduction goal OHCHR emphasizes the need for a human rights-based approach (HRBA) to be integrated into DRR policies and programmes, HFA and post-HFA activities. Policies and programmes in disaster risk reduction OHCHR undertook an internal review of the HFA from a human rights perspective and concluded that natural hazards are not disasters, in and of themselves. They become disasters depending on the elements of exposure, vulnerability and resilience, all factors that can be addressed by human action. A failure (by governments and others) to take reasonable preventive action to reduce exposure and vulnerability and to enhance resilience, as well as to provide effective mitigation, is therefore a human rights question. Similarly, the important factors of population shifts, the density of built up environments and shortcomings in certain development models are also the product of choices made by governments, private actors and international organizations. Human rights can be integrated in all stages of Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR): prevention, mitigation, relief, development, reconstruction, and rehabilitation. Certain human rights-relevant elements are already explicitly addressed (to varying degrees) in the HFA, includingOHCHR Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights OHCHR38 Roles, mandates and areas of work of key UN entitiesDisaster Risk Reduction in the United Nations gender, age, vulnerable groups, cultural diversity, livelihoods, and socio- economic structures. Yet some others human rights elements are missing, and should therefore be addressed, among them discrimination and inequalities, economic, social and cultural rights in general, the rights to food, housing, and property in particular, displacement/IDPs, persons with disabilities, older persons, poverty, the impact of climate change, and the need for effective and meaningful participation by affected communities in decision making processes. OHCHR advocates for the need to integrate a human rights-based approach (HRBA) in policies and measures designed for DRR. The HRBA underlines the need to bring the human dimension to the centre of the DRR debate, with a focus squarely on rights-holders. Applying a HRBA therefore requires an assessment of how disaster-related threats affect individuals and communities, especially the most vulnerable. A HRBA recognizes that human rights, including the ability to participate in decision-making processes, access to information, education, adequate health services, housing, and access to justice, are critical elements of effective DRR policies and measures.

UNDP's disaster risk reduction and recovery programming at national level focuses on three key areas: (i) strengthening national capacities in disaster prevention, risk reduction and reducing vulnerability to future hazard events; (ii) supporting the post-disaster response and recovery efforts; and (iii) addressing programming principles of UNDP , namely gender equality and South-South cooperation. In 2008, UNDP developed an Eight-Point Agenda for women's empowerment and gender equality in crisis settings. The complex interface of disaster with conflict and political instability is also an essential consideration in UNDP programming. To achieve these goals, BCPR has created positions for full-time senior regional disaster reduction advisors in all five regions in which UNDP operates and funds national disaster reduction advisors in UNDP offices in high risk countries. At global level, UNDP provides services to high-risk countries such as policy guidance, advocacy, technical assistance, global knowledge sharing and partnership building with other global actors along the following key thematic areas: Global Risk Identification Programme Capacity for Disaster Reduction Initiative Climate Risk Management Urban Risk Management Governance and Mainstreaming of Disaster Risk Reduction into Development Planning Gender Sensitive Disaster Reduction and Recovery International Recovery PlatformRoles, mandates and areas of work of key UN entities 45Disaster Risk Reduction in the United Nations UNDP has positioned itself as a key member of the International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (ISDR) system and plays leadership roles in specific technical areas in line with the priorities of the HFA through ISDR mechanisms such as the International Recovery Platform, Global Risk Identification Programme, Capacity for Disaster Reduction Initiative and Partnership for Environment and Disaster Risk Reduction.

Activities aim at strengthening the capacity of governments to integrate DRR into national and sub-national development policies, planning and programmes, along with other closely-related development priorities such as poverty alleviation, climate change, human rights and food security. Key activities include: (i) supporting the integration of DRR into national and local-level development policies and legal and regulatory frameworks, including through decentralization processes; (ii) conducting sectoral DRR analysis; (iii) integrating DRR into recovery process; (iv) integrating DRR into the broader aspects of crisis prevention and recovery as well as other UNDP priority areas (energy and environment, poverty reduction and democratic governance); (v) supporting better coordination and harmonization UNDP46 Roles, mandates and areas of work of key UN entitiesDisaster Risk Reduction in the United Nations of DRR approaches with UN system partners; and (vi) establishing DRR partnerships, networks and platforms and conducting public awareness and advocacy. In collaboration with members of the UN Development Group, UNDP has led the development of a Guidance Note on Integrating Disaster Risk Reduction into the CCA and UNDAF, followed by the training and training-of-trainers packages which are currently rolled out in various regions of the world. HFA Priority for Action 2 Risk assessment and early warning systems The Global Risk Identification Programme (GRIP) was launched as an ISDR thematic Platform for Risk Identification in 2007 at the 1st session of the Global Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction. The Programme has been adopted by the ISDR system to support worldwide activities to identify and monitor disaster risks. GRIP aims to promote sustainable development by contributing to the reduction of the impact of natural events on development. It promotes the generation of evidence-based risk information and facilitates its application to improve the quality of policy/decision making at all levels. At national level, GRIP assists its client countries in: learning from their past disasters through the establishment of National Disaster Observatories; setting up baselines and creating an enabling environment for Disaster Risk Management (DRM) through the participatory implementation of Country Situation Analyses; revising or formulating their National DRM strategy through the implementation of National Risk Assessments; and preparing effective and affordable DRM action plans through the implementation of Local Risk Assessments. In addition, GRIP has developed a series of methodologies, tools, guidelines, and standards for disaster risk assessment, including a comprehensive training package. HFA Priority for Action 3 Education, information and public awareness CADRI was formally launched in June 2007 at the Global Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction in Geneva, with a mission to increase capacity development for disaster risk reduction at global, regional and local levels. It is an inter-agency initiative of the UNDP/BCPR, ISDR Secretariat and the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). CADRI's services include: (i) advisory services for governments, national Roles, mandates and areas of work of key UN entities 47Disaster Risk Reduction in the United Nations institutions and UN entities on DRR strategies and programming; (ii) tools and materials: assisting in mapping available tools and materials, facilitating access to them and developing new tools and materials when and where there is a need; (iii) facilitation services: enhancing the capacity of national platforms and disaster management agencies for DRR, and to strengthen the coordination activities of UN Country Teams; (iv) information and networking: providing greater access to resources and to existing communities of practice. HFA Priority for Action 4 Reducing underlying risk factors Climate-related hazards - including droughts, floods, cyclones, sea-level rise and extreme temperatures - have enormous impact on the socio-economic development of a society. The frequency, magnitude and duration of damaging climate conditions are changing. UNDP's Climate Risk Management (CRM) aims to assess and manage societal vulnerability associated with existing and future patterns of risk stemming from short-term climate variability and long-term climate change, and integrates them into development strategies, policies, plans, and projects. CRM brings together elements of climate-related disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation. Through CRM, UNDP is fostering cross-practice collaboration between BCPR's disaster risk reduction work and UNDP Energy and Environment Group's climate change adaptation portfolio. UNDP's integrated CRM practice is reflected, for instance, into the Climate Risk Management Technical Assistance Support Project, a global project encompassing 20 high risk countries across the globe, the Central Asia Multi-Country Programme on Climate Risk Management targeting Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan and the Climate Risk Management capacity building programme comprising regional and national trainings. UNDP promotes the establishment of legal and legislative instruments and technical tools that prioritize DRR as an integral part of the urban development process. Key policy areas for reducing urban disaster risks at the local level include: (i) risk identification and communication; (ii) risk reduction and mitigation measures; (iii) municipal disaster management; (iv) urban governance and institutional and legislative systems; and (v) awareness-building for public officials and communities. UNDP48 Roles, mandates and areas of work of key UN entitiesDisaster Risk Reduction in the United Nations HFA Priority for Action 5 Preparedness for effective response Countries and geographic areas with a high degree of exposure and vulnerability to natural hazards experience recurrent disasters. These high-risk areas are increasingly well understood and mapped through scientific analysis. UNDP uses this knowledge to support national and local authorities to develop the capacity to prepare for disaster response and recovery, working with partner organizations through the IASC and UN country team. UNDP works with countries sharing similar hazards and risks on a regional level drawing on and facilitating South-South cooperation. Most recently UNDP is cooperating with other members of the IASC to promote disaster preparedness capacity in selected high-risk countries through the IASC sub-working group on preparedness. In 2006, UNDP launched its Immediate Crisis Response Initiative (SURGE) to enhance its institutional ability to respond more quickly and effectively in the recovery phase following a conflict or disaster. UNDP can deploy SURGE Advisors on very short notice. It has Standard Operating Procedures for immediate crisis response, which have been tested, refined and officially adopted, and a toolkit is available to country offices.

UNEP acts as a catalyst, advocate, educator and facilitator to promote the wise use and sustainable development of the global environment. To accomplish this, UNEP works with a wide range of partners, including United Nations entities, international organizations, national governments, non-governmental organizations, the private sector and civil society. Disaster reduction goal UNEP's objective under the Disasters and Conflicts subprogramme, one of six priority areas, is to minimize threats to human well-being from the environmental causes and consequences of existing and potential natural and man-made disasters. Through its disaster risk reduction (DRR) programme, UNEP aims to reduce the impacts of natural hazards on vulnerable communities and countries through sound environmental management. It seeks to prevent and reduce environmental degradation that contributes to disaster risk, while maximizing the sustainable use of environmental services for risk and vulnerability reduction. Policies and programmes in disaster risk reduction UNEP focuses on countries identified through assessments as vulnerable to natural hazards with clear links to environmental degradation as a driver of risk, but also engages in countries that articulate clear demand for technical assistance from UNEP . UNEP works to integrate environment-DRR components in development and humanitarian policies, programmes and projects at different levels (global, UNEP The United Nations Environment Programme UNEP50 Roles, mandates and areas of work of key UN entitiesDisaster Risk Reduction in the United Nations regional, national and sub-national) to ensure that development and post- disaster recovery is both environmentally-sustainable and disaster resilient. Key areas of work include the following: Early warning and integrated risk and vulnerability assessments; Technical assistance and development of education modules and policy toolkits for Member States to apply sustainable environmental management solutions for the prevention and mitigation of disasters, from both climate-related and non-climate related (geological) hazards; Increasing awareness of and mainstreaming environment-DRR approaches into development and humanitarian agendas, including post-disaster recovery processes; Pilot testing innovative environment-DRR approaches to catalyze and upscale practical action towards reducing risk; Enhanced national preparedness to respond to and mitigate acute risks caused by emergencies induced by natural hazards and industrial accidents; Strengthening partnerships, networks and institutional mechanisms, including Regional and National Platforms for DRR, that foster multi-stakeholder, cross-sectoral approaches to reducing disaster risk.

UNEP provides technical assistance and capacity development that enable national and sub-national governments to use environmental management tools for disaster resilient, sustainable development planning. For instance, UNEP in collaboration with UNDP Sri Lanka is integrating DRR into strategic environmental assessments (SEA) to inform land-use planning and development investments, with the aim of institutionalizing best practice integrated SEA approaches in the country. By providing policy advice and strengthening legal and regulatory frameworks, UNEP also builds national government capacity to promote ecosystems management that enable countries adapt and cope better with the adverse impacts of climate change, including climate-related disasters. UNEP supports cross-sectoral mechanisms at country level, such as National Platforms for DRR or other similar inter-agency mechanisms, that enable different government agencies to collaborate and coordinate in addressing environment-DRR concerns and implementing integrated solutions. For example, through an EU AIDCO-funded capacity building project, UNEP brought together disaster managers and coastal zone managers to enhance resilience of coastal zones in India, Sri Lanka and Indonesia. HFA Priority for Action 2 Risk assessment and early warning systems Since 2007, UNEP has supported the ISDR system in undertaking global risk assessments for the Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction (GAR). UNEP has served as key developer and host of PREVIEW (Project of Risk Evaluation, Vulnerability, Information and Early Warning), a leading technical platform and source data for global risk evaluation that is supported by UNISDR, UNDP , UNEP and the World Bank. UNEP52 Roles, mandates and areas of work of key UN entitiesDisaster Risk Reduction in the United Nations PREVIEW collects data to model hazards, computes human exposure and incorporates socio-economic and physical factors into risk identification to produce risk maps and indices. It allows users to visualise and download data on hazard history, exposure and risk for tropical cyclones, droughts, floods, earthquakes, forest fires, landslides, volcanoes and tsunamis. UNEP has also developed an innovative risk assessment tool that enables policymakers and decision makers to make informed decisions in support of sustainable development growth, based on clear evidence of the positive role of ecosystems in disaster risk reduction and adaptation to climate change. Successfully pilot tested in the western coast of Jamaica in 2009, the Risk and Vulnerability Assessment Methodology Development Project (RiVAMP) was conceived to take into account ecosystems and climate change factors in the analysis of disaster risk and vulnerability. RiVAMP applies a scientific approach using GIS modeling, remote sensing, hydrodynamic modeling, statistical analysis, that is combined with stakeholder consultations at different levels (national, sub-national and communities). As a pilot initiative, the RiVAMP methodology is intended mainly for application in small island developing states (SIDS) or coastal areas, with the view of developing additional methodologies for application in mountain areas (watersheds), river basins and drylands. HFA Priority for Action 3 Education, information and public awareness UNEP promotes knowledge development, information exchange and dissemination of best practices in the areas of post-disaster environmental assessments, environmentally sustainable post-disaster recovery, and ecosystem-based disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation. UNEP cultivates and supports partnerships and networks that advocate for integrated environment, DRR and CCA approaches. UNEP is a core member of the Partnership for Environment and Disaster Risk Reduction (PEDRR), a network that advocates for ecosystem-based DRR. In collaboration with PEDRR partners, UNEP participates in high-level major events such as the Global and Regional Platforms for Disaster Risk Reduction and the International Disaster and Risk Conference for awareness-raising and policy advocacy, develops policy briefs, conducts literature reviews, hosts international workshops and roundtable discussion events, and will publish a book on ecosystem-based DRR. UNEP has led the establishment of the Global Adaptation Network, which is intended to mobilize existing knowledge and best practices relevant to climateRoles, mandates and areas of work of key UN entities 53Disaster Risk Reduction in the United Nations change adaptation, including climate risk management, and provide knowledge support and advisory services to governments and practitioners. It ensures that technical know-how and information needs are made available to identify the most cost-effective, sustainable adaptation actions for integration into national policy and development planning processes. A Global Knowledge Hub as well as Regional Knowledge Hubs in Africa, Latin America, Asia and Pacific have been established. Finally, the UNEP Finance Initiative is working with major private insurance companies on a global initiative to integrate sustainability principles based on sound environmental management and disaster reduction criteria, amongst others. Risk transfer schemes have emerged as important tools to share or spread the financial risk of disasters; however, there is still insufficient evidence to clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of risk transfer in reducing or better managing risks. This Initiative therefore documents best practices and lessons from the private sector in promoting socially and environmentally-sustainable investments that yield risk reduction or resilience outcomes, such as reforestation insurance coverage, planting mangroves for protection against coastal storm hazards, and urban river restoration for flood management. HFA Priority for Action 4 Reducing underlying risk factors UNEP's priorities and programmes related to DRR are geared primarily towards addressing environmental degradation and climate change as major risk drivers. UNEP has prioritized work in four major \"eco-zones\" - coastal areas, mountains, river basins and drylands - that are vulnerable to disasters and climate change but could also be effectively and sustainably managed for hazard mitigation, vulnerability reduction and climate change adaptation. In this regard, UNEP supports country-level programmes and projects in integrated coastal zone management, integrated water resource management, watershed management, as well as river basin management, to enhance disaster resilience as well as build adaptive capacities against climate change impacts. For example, the Haiti Regeneration Initiative aims to reduce poverty and increase resilience to natural hazards through the restoration of ecosystems and livelihoods, focusing on sustainable natural resource management. The Initiative provides a platform for collaboration by various stakeholders in the country, thus enhancing the effectiveness and range of already existing development programmes and identifying opportunities for new, innovative programmes. Another example is the Nile River Basin Project, which involves 10 riparian countries, addressing water-related risks and scarcity issues and promoting sustainable river basin management for adaptation. UNEP54 Roles, mandates and areas of work of key UN entitiesDisaster Risk Reduction in the United Nations Moreover, UNEP , together with PEDRR partners, is developing a practice- oriented training course on Ecosystem-based Disaster Risk Reduction for Sustainable Development, geared towards national government policymakers and programme managers/implementers. In addition to raising awareness, the course is designed to facilitate institutional and behavioral change that support mainstreaming ecosystem-based DRR in development planning. Once the pilot-testing phase is completed, the training course will be made publicly accessible on-line and shared with international and national training institutions that provide DRR-related trainings, thus maximizing impact and sustainability at the country level. The International Environmental Technology Centre (IETC) promotes environmentally-sound technologies to mitigate and reduce the environmental impacts of disasters. IETC's focuses on water-related disasters in an urban context in order to assist cities in addressing increasing urban risk through a catchment and watershed management-based approach. HFA Priority for Action 5 Preparedness for effective response UNEP enables national and local authorities as well as other emergency responders to better prepare for and respond to disasters in order to reduce the environmental costs/impacts of disasters and protect lives and livelihoods. There are two focus areas: (i) environmental emergencies, and (ii) mainstreaming environment in humanitarian response and recovery. (i) UNEP strengthens regional and national disaster management systems and provides technical assistance in preparing for, assessing and responding to environmental emergencies stemming from natural hazard impacts, such as industrial accidents (oil spills, chemical leaks, etc) and disaster debris, that pose an immediate and acute public health and safety risk. UNEP is working to establish an Environmental Emergencies Centre to facilitate delivery of services. Also, UNEP manages the Awareness and Preparedness for Emergencies at Local Level (APELL) programme, in collaboration with governments and industry, with the purpose of minimizing the occurrence and harmful effects of technological accidents. APELL identifies and creates awareness of risks in an industrialized community, to develop coordinated preparedness between industry, local authorities and the local population. (ii) UNEP , through its Environment, Humanitarian Action, and Early Recovery Programme, works with partners in the UN, NGO and donor communities to integrate environmental concerns in humanitarian response and recovery. The aim of the project is to strengthen the capacity of humanitarian actors to minimize UNDPRoles, mandates and areas of work of key UN entities 55Disaster Risk Reduction in the United Nations the negative environmental impacts of their operations and ensure disaster response and recovery activities do not create or exacerbate vulnerabilities to future disasters, thus facilitating sustainable recovery. UNEP seeks to influence humanitarian policies, enhance information sharing, and deliver trainings that integrate environment, disaster risk reduction and humanitarian response.

UNESCO seeks to harness knowledge and technology and promote education for building effective capacities to foster prevention and reduce vulnerability to all kinds of disasters, particularly affecting poor populations. Policies and programmes in disaster risk reduction In its 34th session, the General Conference of UNESCO included contributing to disaster mitigation and preparedness among the fourteen Strategic Programme Objectives in the Organization's Medium Term Strategy for 2008-2013. Since 2008 the biennial programmes of UNESCO contain a specific main line of actions on DRR. UNESCO provides intergovernmental coordination, advice to governments and policy support for the establishment and operation of monitoring networks and early warning and risk mitigation systems for natural hazards, with particular emphasis on earthquakes, tsunamis, floods, and landslides. It also promotes joint multi-stakeholder strategies for enhancing disaster education and awareness as an intrinsic element of the United Nations Decade on Education for Sustainable Development (UN DESD) led by UNESCO, especially in communities at risk located in Africa, LDCs and SIDS.UNESCO United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization UNESCORoles, mandates and areas of work of key UN entities 57Disaster Risk Reduction in the United Nations Integrated approaches and synergies between the natural sciences, the social sciences, culture, education and information systems lay the basis for interdisciplinary platforms to manage disaster risks.

The IOC work includes complementary and sustained activities in tsunami and other sea-level related hazard risk assessment, tsunami warning training, emergency response, and preparedness as part of the comprehensive tsunami and coastal inundation mitigation programmes. IOC is cooperating with and assisting several Member States in strengthening their national end-to-end tsunami and other ocean-related hazards warning systems as part of the ongoing ocean-wide coordination processes. Besides the instrumentation networks, redundant communication channels, Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) and preparedness programmes are the key to effective early warning and thus DRR. It also promotes the end-to-end concept for early warning systems, in partnership with the UNISDR and WMO. The IOC has established intergovernmental tsunami early warning coordination groups for the Indian Ocean, Northeast Atlantic and Mediterranean, and Caribbean Regions in 2005. The Pacific Tsunami Warning System has been established as early as 1965. UNESCO is an active partner in the Integrated Global Observing Strategy (IGOS) which seeks to provide a comprehensive framework to harmonize the common interests of the major space-based and in-situ systems for global observation of the Earth. UNESCO promotes the geohazards component in the IGOS. The International Flood Initiative (IFI) is based on the integrated flood management policy and aims to ensure that end-to-end process of flood management is put in place, balancing development needs and flood risks, considering structural and non-structural measures, as well as positive and negative impacts on floods by stimulating research, improving training in both informal and academic settings, and networking information. UNESCO also strengthens international and regional networks on knowledge sharing and capacity-building for earthquake risk mitigation. An international platform regarding earthquakes and tsunamis has been developed in cooperation with the Japanese Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism, including a research and training platform for earthquake disaster reduction based on seismology and earthquake engineering. The International Consortium on Landslides (ICL) has paved the way for the organization of a World Landslide Forum. UNESCO's Man and Biosphere (MAB) Programme has been particularly concerned with drought andRoles, mandates and areas of work of key UN entities 59Disaster Risk Reduction in the United Nations combating desertification and has produced and disseminated training and educational materials in this area. HFA Priority for Action 3 Education, information and public awareness UNESCO plays a pivotal role in the ISDR Thematic Platform on Knowledge and Education. UNESCO stimulates regional partnerships and networks devoted to the collection and dissemination of relevant information and knowledge on hazards, vulnerabilities and risk mitigation capacities. It disseminates, promotes and advocates guidelines, good practices and tools for proactive policies to reduce vulnerabilities and to promote integrated assessment and mitigation of disaster risks. UNESCO pays particular attention to gender-sensitive and socioculturally relevant approaches and to the promotion of local and indigenous practices for risk reduction, to the use of formal and informal channels to mobilize and sensitize community leaders, women, youth and children, and to the dissemination of guidelines for the protection of schools and cultural heritage sites at risk. Integration of disaster risk reduction is an intrinsic element of the UNESCO- led United Nations Decade of Education for Sustainable Development (UN DESD). One of the key objectives is to integrate disaster risk reduction into school curricula and promote guidelines for school safety and preparedness programmes. The World Disaster Reduction Campaign \"Disaster Risk Reduction Begins at School\" (2006-2007), jointly coordinated by UNESCO and UNISDR, created a global momentum for strengthening disaster risk education and ensuring school safety. UNESCO also collects and makes information available over the internet on disaster risk reduction educational materials.

With 194 Parties, the Convention enjoys near-universal membership. The ultimate objective of the Convention is to stabilise greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that will prevent dangerous human interference with the climate system. The Convention is complemented by the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, which enjoys the membership of 192 Parties. Under this treaty, 37 industrialized countries and the European Community have committed to reducing their emissions by an average of 5 percent by 2012 against 1990 levels. The UNFCCC and its Kyoto Protocol are also designed to assist developing country Parties to adapt to the inevitable adverse effects of climate change. The UNFCCC commits all Parties to formulate, implement, publish, and regularly update national and, where appropriate, regional programmes containing measures to facilitate adequate adaptation to climate change. The UNFCCC catalyses action on climate change, including action on adaptation. The UNFCCC secretariat services the Conference of Parties, the subsidiary bodies and their Bureau, and other bodies established by the COP . The secretariat makes practical arrangements for meetings, compiles and distributes statistics and information, and assists member countries in meeting their commitments under the Convention. The secretariat is based in Bonn, Germany. In relation to adaptation related goals of the Convention, activities are undertaken within a range of work programmes under various Convention bodies including: UNFCCC SECRETARIAT The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Secretariat UNFCCC62 Roles, mandates and areas of work of key UN entitiesDisaster Risk Reduction in the United Nations The Cancun Adaptation Framework, which resulted from negotiations on enhanced action on adaptation as part of the Bali Action Plan under the COP; The Nairobi work programme on impacts, vulnerability and adaptation to climate change, research and systematic observation under the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA) National adaptation programmes of action (NAPAs), and decision 1/CP .10 Buenos Aires work programme on adaptation and response measure under the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI). Disaster reduction goal The Cancun Adaptation Framework includes specific provisions for disaster risk reduction (DRR) and risk management as part of enhanced action on adaptation to climate change. Recognizing the need to strengthen inter-national cooperation and expertise to understand and reduce loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change, including impacts related to extreme weather events and slow onset events, member countries to the UNFCCC decided to establish a work programme. This work programme enables consideration of approaches to address loss and dam-age associated with climate change impacts in developing countries that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change. Policies and programmes in disaster risk reduction The Nairobi Work Programme identifies 'climate-related risks and extreme events' as a work area. Activities under this work area are implemented to promote understanding of impacts of, and vulnerability to, climate change, current and future climate variability and extreme events, and the implications for sustainable development. Another work area, adaptation planning and practices, addresses issues on integrating practices, tools and systems for climate risk assessment and management, and DRR strategies into national policies and programmes. Under the Convention, all Parties are required to prepare reports, known as 'national communications' , on the steps they are taking to implement the Convention. National communications contains information on vulnerability assessment, expected impacts of climate change and adaptation measures. In order to address the urgent and immediate adaptation needs of the least developed countries (LDCs), a process to develop and implement NAPAs was established. UNFCCC SECRETARIATRoles, mandates and areas of work of key UN entities 63Disaster Risk Reduction in the United Nations As of January 2010, the UNFCCC Secretariat had received NAPAs from 45 of the 48 LDCs, outlining approximately 500 priority projects. Priority projects vary among countries according to their specific vulnerabilities and the adverse effects of climate change variability and extremes they are experiencing. Projects may be cross-sectoral projects or applicable to specific sectors. Examples of project areas include: disaster management; early warning and forecasting; education and training; zones marine ecosystems; insurance; infrastructure; terrestrial ecosystems and biodiversity; food security and agriculture; and water resources, among others. UNFCCC Parties have recognized that existing knowledge and capacities for coping with extreme weather events must be enhanced. The Bali Action Plan, adopted at the 2007 Climate Change Conference in Bali, Indonesia (COP 13), which sought to enable the full, effective and sustained implementation of the Convention through long-term cooperative action, now, up to and beyond 2012, highlighted the significance of DRR as part of enhanced action on adaptation, including the consideration of: - risk management and risk reduction strategies, including risk sharing and transfer mechanisms such as insurance; and - disaster reduction strategies and means to address loss and damage associated with climate change impacts in developing countries that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change. In addition, enhanced action on adaptation under the Bali Action Plan includes other elements that are highly relevant to reducing disaster risk, such as vulnerability assessments, capacity-building and response strategies, as well as integration of actions into sectoral and national planning. After three years of negotiations on the post-2012 climate change regime under the Bali Action Plan, Parties adopted the Cancun Adaptation Framework as part of the Cancun Agreements at the 2010 Climate Change Conference in Cancun, Mexico (COP 16). In the Agreements, Parties affirmed that adaptation must be addressed with the same level of priority as mitigation. The objective of the Cancun Adaptation Framework is to enhance action on adaptation, including through international cooperation and coherent consideration of matters relating to adaptation under the Convention. Ultimately, enhanced action on adaptation seeks to reduce vulnerability and build resilience in developing country Parties, taking into account the urgent and immediate needs of those developing countries that are particularly vulnerable.

HFA Priority for Action 2Risk assessment and early warning systems The UNFCCC Secretariat has undertaken activities to build capacity on risk assessment through workshops, and share knowledge and information on risk assessment, including through publications. Through the Nairobi Work Programme, Parties and organizations share knowledge and information on methods and tools, data and observations, socio-economic information, climate-related risks and extreme events, climate modelling, scenarios and downscaling, and adaptation planning and practices. These efforts are informed by a wide range of organizations and stakeholders, including by the ISDR System. HFA Priority for Action 3 Education, information and public awareness A series of regional workshops were undertaken under Decision 1/ CP .10 to reflect on Parties' vulnerability to future climate change; current adaptation plans, strategies and actions; and future adaptation options. 1 The UNFCCC Secretariat summarized findings from these workshops, National Communications, NAPAs and other sources in the publication, \"Climate Change: Impacts, Vulnerabilities and Adaptation in Developing Countries\" . The book reports on countries' interests in linking disaster risk reduction and adaptation efforts. 2 Another book \"Action on the Ground\" provides a synthesis of activities in the areas of education, training and awareness-raising for adaptation. To promote knowledge sharing in adaptation, the UNFCCC Secretariat developed a local coping strategies database, and the Nairobi work programme partners' database. The former aims to facilitate the transfer of long-standing coping strategies and knowledge from communities which have adapted to specific hazards or climatic conditions, to communities which may just be starting to experience such conditions as a result of climate change. 3 The latter is a gateway to information on adaptation UNFCCC66 Roles, mandates and areas of work of key UN entitiesDisaster Risk Reduction in the United Nations practices worldwide. It provides a summary of adaptation practices by a large range of organizations, agencies and businesses, along with descriptions and relevant links and publications. Information is searchable by various adaptation delivery activities, including DRR. 4 1 For further details on the regional workshops under decision 1/CP .10, please see http://unfccc.int/2535.php. 2 This book is available on-line at: http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/ publications/impacts.pdf 3 For more information on the Local coping strategies database, please see http://maindb.unfccc.int/public/adaptation/ 4 For more information on the Adaptation practices interface, please see http://unfccc.int/5005.php HFA Priority for Action 4 Reducing underlying risk factors The UNFCCC Secretariat is the convener of international negotiations on climate change. As awareness that countries will need to adapt to the inevitable impacts of climate change has grown among Parties, adaptation has gained importance in the of the UNFCCC and associated negotiations. The Nairobi work programme aims to help all countries improve their understanding and assessment of the impacts of climate change and make informed decisions on practical adaptation actions and measures. It is implemented by Parties, intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations, the private sector, communities and other stakeholders. The National Adaptation Programmes of Action (NAPAs) provide an important way to prioritize urgent adaptation needs for least developed countries (Article 4.9). They draw on existing information and community-level input to identify adaptation projects required now in order to enable these countries to cope with the immediate impacts of climate change. The National Communications provide information on the steps Parties are taking to implement the Convention. Reporting in the National Communication includes on vulnerability assessment, expected impacts of climate change and adaptation measures. Support for Adaptation (Articles 4.4, 4.8 and 4.9): Developing countries require international assistance for adapting to climate change. This includes funding, technology transfer and insurance as well as resources to reduce the risk of disasters and raise the resilience of communities to increasing extreme events. LDCs and small islandRoles, mandates and areas of work of key UN entities 67Disaster Risk Reduction in the United Nations developing States (SIDS) need particular consideration due to their extreme vulnerability. Funding for adaptation is provided through the financial mechanism of the Convention, currently operated by the Global Environment Facility (GEF). Funding opportunities include: the Trust Fund, including the Strategic Priority on Adaptation and support for national communications including vulnerability and adaptation assessments; the Least Developed Countries Fund (LDCF) under the Convention; the Special Climate Change Fund (SCCF) under the Convention. A further source of funding is the Adaptation Fund (AF) under the Kyoto Protocol managed by the Adaptation Fund Board (AFB). The overarching framework for adaptation, adopted at COP 16, the Cancun Adaptation Framework, encourages all Parties to plan, prioritize and implement adaptation actions, and to use existing channels to provide information on support provided and received for adaptation actions and on activities undertaken. It also invites all Parties to enhance action on adaptation by undertaking, inter alia: enhancing climate change related disaster risk reduction strategies, taking into consideration the Hyogo Framework for Action where appropriate; early warning systems; risk assessment and management; and sharing and transfer mechanisms such as insurance, at local, national, subregional and regional levels, as appropriate; measures to enhance understanding, coordination and cooperation with regard to climate change induced displacement, migration and planned relocation, where appropriate, at national, regional and international levels; impact, vulnerability and adaptation assessments, including assessments of financial needs as well as economic, social and environmental evaluation of adaptation options; and strengthening institutional capacities and enabling environments for adaptation, including for climate-resilient development and vulnerability reduction. Focal point UNFCCC Secretariat: Adaptation, Technology and Science Programme Website http://unfccc.int/adaptation UNFCCC68 Roles, mandates and areas of work of key UN entitiesDisaster Risk Reduction in the United Nations General description of the organization UNFPA is an international development agency that promotes the right of every woman, man and child to enjoy a life of health and equal opportunity. UNFPA supports countries in using population data for policies and programmes to reduce poverty and to ensure that every pregnancy is wanted, every birth is safe, every young person is free of HIV/AIDS, and every girl and woman is treated with dignity and respect. Disaster reduction goal To ensure adequate emergency preparedness and contingency planning at country level and to improve environmental protection. Policies and programmes in disaster risk reduction UNFPA's three-year institutional strategy for emergency preparedness, humanitarian response and transition and recovery includes various measures to strengthen technical and institutional capacities to incorporate population, reproductive health and gender concerns into overall emergency preparedness, response, transition and recovery. UNFPA supports national capacity-building in emergency preparedness as an integral part of regular country programme activities. Various UNFPA programmes have been strengthened to be adequately prepared on the basis of scenario planning and risk assessment which also take into account early warning systems. UNFPA is actively engaged in emergency preparedness and contingency planning through (1) ongoing efforts to collect, analyze and monitor basic population data; (2) building the capacity of national counterparts to implement the Minimum Initial Service Package (MISP) for Reproductive Health in Crisis Situations, and (3) the pre-positioning of reproductiveUNFPA United Nations Population Fund UNFPARoles, mandates and areas of work of key UN entities 69Disaster Risk Reduction in the United Nations health supplies such as reproductive health emergency kits as well as dignity kits. UNFPA supports the work in the following three focus areas: 1) provision and/or organization of reproductive health and emergency obstetric care, including distribution of safe delivery kits to field hospitals and rape kits for women in shelters and assembly points; 2) promotion and protection of women's rights and dignity in areas vulnerable to or affected by disasters, including monitoring and prevention of sexual violence, including follow-up of reported cases; and 3) special attention to the rights of marginalized groups, including people living with HIV/AIDS, sex workers, street youths, and persons with disabilities, using community networks as direct vehicles for the distribution of emergency commodities and vital supplies. UNFPA works for securing essential supplies - from contraceptives to HIV testing kits to equipment for emergency obstetric care - so that the right to reproductive health can be fully exercised. UNFPA takes a lead role in reproductive health commodity security, coordinating the process, forecasting needs, mobilizing support and building logistical capacity at the country level. The 1994 International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) emphasized that \"efforts to slow down population growth, to reduce poverty, to achieve economic progress, to improve environmental protection, and to reduce unsustainable consumption and production patterns are mutually reinforcing.\" Mobilizing the resources needed to implement the ICPD Programme of Action is therefore a key action to protect the environment, as well as to promote women's rights and sustainable development. The 2001 UNFPA State of the World Population Report on Population and Environmental Change stressed the close and complex relation between population and the environment. Similarly it was recognized that climate change would have a serious impact including increased storms, flooding and soil erosion, accelerated extinction of plants and animals, shifting agricultural zones, and a threat to public health due to increased water stress and tropical disease. These conditions could increase environmental refugees and international economic migration. UNFPA, at an institutional level, is increasingly studying how to adapt its programming processes to better incorporate DRR both in development programmes as well as in emergency preparedness.

In 2007 and 2008, UNFPA carried out a series of regional capacity building workshops for UNFPA staff as well as government and NGO partners in Latin America and the Caribbean, Africa, the Middle East, Central Asia, South and West Asia and the Pacific Region. These workshops provide skills to be better prepared for humanitarian preparedness as well as response and recovery interventions. Focus is increasingly put on climate change related disasters. HFA Priority for Action 4 Reducing underlying risk factors UNFPA recognizes that limited land availability can lead poor people to settle in fragile areas. UNFPA supports constructive policies that will make the most of opportunities, avoid limits and promote equity. It also pursues an integrated approach to defeating poverty and protecting the environment building on national ownership of development initiative as well as local control and respect for local knowledge at community level. UNFPA pays attention to the voices of women, who are responsible for food, water, fuel and other household resources. UNFPA advocates for climate and environmental policies to address the geographical distribution and movement of people. The combined effects of population growth and climate change could produce regional resource shortages, which in turn could result in the exploitation of environmentally sensitive areas such as hillsides, flood plains, coastal areas and wetlands. These conditions will also increase environmental refugees, international economic migration and associated socio-political challenges. HFA Priority for Action 5 Preparedness for effective response UNFPA is committed to assisting and protecting women, men and youth made vulnerable by disasters caused by natural hazards, armed conflict, and other causes. This includes refugees, internally displaced persons, and people made homeless or vulnerable by disaster. UNFPA72 Roles, mandates and areas of work of key UN entitiesDisaster Risk Reduction in the United Nations Within the coordinated, inter-agency response to disasters, UNFPA takes the lead in providing supplies and services to protect reproductive health, with an emphasis on the special needs and vulnerabilities of women and young people. Priority areas include safe motherhood; prevention of sexually transmitted infections, including HIV; adolescent health; and gender-based violence. UNFPA also supports various data collection activities, including censuses to provide detailed information for planning and rapid health assessments to allow for appropriate, effective and efficient relief. UNFPA encourages the full participation of women and young people in efforts to rebuild their societies. UNFPA protects the reproductive health of communities in crisis. It also provides assistance to stricken communities as they move beyond the acute crisis and enter the reconstruction phase and supports various data collection activities, including censuses to provide detailed information for planning and rapid health assessments to allow for appropriate, effective and efficient relief. Reproductive health supplies, equipment and medicine are organized and stored by UNFPA in preparation for immediate distribution when an earthquake, flood, violent conflict or other crisis arises. A rapid-response fund enables UNFPA to mount a quick response to emergencies, especially in the initial stages. The Fund can ship out supplies of condoms and other commodities within a few days of receiving a request. Once an emergency situation stabilizes, the procurement of reproductive health materials becomes a regular part of a more comprehensive health care programme. Quick response saves lives, which is why UNFPA ships pre-packaged supplies directly to emergency situations (Pre-packaged Supplies Speed Response). These supplies help to implement the Minimum Initial Service Package - a set of objectives and activities for achieving certain minimum requirements in an emergency. The MISP was developed by the Inter-Agency Working Group for Reproductive Health in Refugee Situations, of which UNFPA is a founding member. Reproductive health needs in the early phase of an emergency include: Safe delivery for births with and without skilled help Condoms to prevent STI transmission and unwanted pregnancy Contraceptives and family planning support Rape prevention and management STI prevention and drugs for treatment HIV/AIDS prevention Roles, mandates and areas of work of key UN entities 73Disaster Risk Reduction in the United Nations Care after miscarriages and unsafe abortions Sutures and surgery for Caesarean sections and bleeding Safe blood transfusions and instructions on universal precautions Referrals for more advanced care UNFPA is also increasingly providing \"dignity kits\" with basic commodities such as soap, sanitary napkins, underwear, tooth brush/tooth paste to allow crisis affected populations to maintain their dignity, and access services which they would otherwise not be able to reach.

It is mandated by the UN General Assembly to promote socially and environmentally sustainable towns and cities with the goal of providing adequate shelter for all. UN-HABITAT is one of the few international institutions that provides an overall perspective on urbanisation processes and the only one with housing and urban development as its principal mandate. Disaster reduction goal UN-HABITAT's main goals related to disaster risk reduction are: Increasing investment in disaster risk reduction - redirecting priorities from visible and short-term development projects to abstract long term potential threats and risks. Addressing the root causes of disasters - inadequate development practices increase the vulnerability of communities, and more focus on pre-disaster risk reduction needs to be integrated in all development planning. Incorporating vulnerability reduction and disaster management into on-going national and local development and poverty reduction plans. Redirecting the focus on disaster risk reduction and mitigation rather than preparedness and response related strategies in the human settlements context. Building a culture of prevention entails a cross sectoral, multi-dimensional approach integrating participatory analysis of risk, implementation of programmes, and development of policy and legal frameworks with all stakeholders including civil society, private sector, local, national and international government, in a gendered and comprehensive process.UN-HABITAT United Nations Human Settlements Programme Roles, mandates and areas of work of key UN entities 75Disaster Risk Reduction in the United Nations Policies and programmes in disaster risk reduction The Habitat Agenda (Istanbul 1996), which details its mandate, calls upon the agency to assist member states in disaster prevention, mitigation and preparedness, and post-disaster rehabilitation capabilities in human settlements. In 2007, a Strategic Policy on Human Settlements in Crisis was adopted starting from UN-HABITAT's Sustainable Relief and Reconstruction Framework which includes the Hyogo Framework for Action and aims at: Reducing the vulnerabilities of human settlements and strengthen their capacities for managing disasters at all levels; Responding to immediate needs in the aftermath of crises that are linked to Agency mandated interventions supporting sustainable human settlements. The Disaster Management Programme (DMP) has been tasked to fulfill this mandate through supporting national governments, local authorities and communities in strengthening their capacity in managing disasters. This applies both to the prevention and mitigation of disasters as well as the rehabilitation of human settlements. DMP also creates awareness among decision makers and communities on mitigation methodologies and adequate rehabilitation in human settlements. It bridges the gap between relief and development by combining the technical expertise, normative understanding and lessons learned through UN-HABITAT field operations. DMP provides a combination of long term technical and normative support through ongoing partnerships within and outside UN-HABITAT with a surge facility to allow for the provision of immediate support during emergency phases. This combination ensures that DMP is able to impact all phases of post-conflict and disaster management cycles to promote sustainable human settlements development within situations of crisis with maximum effect.

UNICEF is guided by the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women and strives to establish girls and boys rights as enduring ethical principles and international standards of behavior towards children. Disaster reduction goal To meet the objectives of the HFA, UNICEF believes it is critical that DRR is fully integrated into development and that humanitarian action and recov-ery contribute to a reduction of disaster risk. UNICEF advocates that DRR not only addresses the risks faced by children and women but that children have a right to play an active role in DRR and climate change adaptation. Policies and programmes in disaster risk reduction UNICEF has developed a global framework for disaster reduction. This focuses on protection and risk reduction for those who are most vulnerable to disasters: children and women. Children and women suffer the heaviest burden from disasters, including loss of life, psychosocial trauma, disruption of education and impact on livelihoods. Therefore, awareness, preparedness, mitigation, response and recovery measures need to be adapted to their specific capacities and vulnerabilities. UNICEF is committed to sustaining and enhancing its support of national risk reduction efforts, specifically, those most directly related to threats to children, both in non-crisis and emergency situations. UNICEF sees risk reduction as an integral part of all sector activities.UNICEF United Nations Children's FundRoles, mandates and areas of work of key UN entities 79Disaster Risk Reduction in the United Nations UNICEF encourages a comprehensive approach to disaster risk reduction from prevention, mitigation, preparedness and early warning through to response and recovery. UNICEF holds that in all aspects of risk reduction, the specific needs of women and children should be integrally addressed, their capacities enhanced, and their participation encouraged and facilitated. UNICEF believes that disaster risk reduction cannot be fully effective without the full contribution and participation of women and children, through family and community mobilization, training, and utilization of the educational system. Underpinning this child focused approach is a belief that its efforts should enhance capacities of families, communities, governments, national institutions and civil society organizations.

UNICEF80 Roles, mandates and areas of work of key UN entitiesDisaster Risk Reduction in the United Nations HFA Priority for Action 2 Risk assessment and early warning systems UNICEF country programmes are based on a regular assessment of disaster risk. In order to ensure a better understanding of sub-national disaster risk, UNICEF is working to strengthen its capacity and that of its partners in vulnerability and capacity assessment. UNICEF has developed its own organizational early warning system and plays a lead role in early warning within the IASC Sub Working Group on Preparedness and Contingency Planning (including co-drafting the IASC Early Warning / Early Action report). HFA Priority for Action 3 Education, information and public awareness UNICEF works to ensure that all children realize their right to a quality basic education. It focuses on, amongst others, the most excluded and vulnerable children: girls, the disabled, ethnic minorities, rural and urban poor, those who are affected by war and disasters, and those affected by HIV and AIDS. UNICEF works with its partners to ensure learning facilities are safe and that basic preparedness and mitigation measures are included in the school curriculum. In humanitarian action and post-crisis recovery, UNICEF works on quickly restoring education and protection services by setting up safe learning spaces for children. In particular, UNICEF seeks to promote education services and facilities that ensure the security, privacy, dignity and full equality for children and women. UNICEF provides basic facilities and supplies for quality learning. UNICEF believes this provides a platform to help countries get children back to school, to rebuild sustainable education systems and to reduce future risk. As an example, UNICEF and UNISDR have produced an educational kit for children called \"Let's learn to prevent disasters!\" . It includes the board game \"Riskland\" whereby players learn about what they can do to reduce disaster impacts by answering questions and advancing along the board's winding path. The kit and game may be adapted according to the different hazards communities face, and translated into multiple languages.

Website http://www.unu.eduRoles, mandates and areas of work of key UN entities 97Disaster Risk Reduction in the United Nations General description of the organization The United Nations Volunteers (UNV) programme is the UN organization that contributes to peace and development through volunteerism worldwide. Volunteerism is a powerful means of engaging people in tackling development challenges, and it can transform the pace and nature of development. Volunteerism benefits both society at large and the individual volunteer by strengthening trust, solidarity and reciprocity among citizens, and by purposefully creating opportunities for participation. UNV contributes to peace and development by advocating for recognition of volunteers, working with partners to integrate volunteerism into development programming, and mobilizing an increasing number and diversity of volunteers, including experienced UNV volunteers, throughout the world. UNV embraces volunteerism as universal and inclusive, and recognizes volunteerism in its diversity as well as the values that sustain it: free will, commitment, engagement and solidarity. UNV directly mobilizes around 8,000 UNV volunteers every year, of which one third volunteer within their own countries. Almost 80% of UNV volunteers come from developing countries. Disaster reduction goal To mobilize volunteers and strengthen volunteerism initiatives in support of disaster risk reduction and management, especially to strengthen commu-nity capacity to respond to and prevent disasters. Policies and programmes in disaster risk reduction UNV mobilizes and places national and international UN Volunteers in response to requests from UN entities and government partners. UNV also works with partners to integrate volunteerism into programming for disaster risk reduction and management. UNV works in disaster response, risk reduction, crisis prevention and community-based adaptation to climate change.UNV United Nations Volunteers UNV98 Roles, mandates and areas of work of key UN entitiesDisaster Risk Reduction in the United Nations The Hyogo Framework for Action adopted at the 2005 World Conference on Disaster Reduction explicitly recognized volunteer contributions in disaster risk reduction and the need of the strategic management of volunteer resources at all levels of DRR, with particular attention to its role in strengthening the community level. Accordingly, UNV has intensified its work in disaster risk reduction and management, together with partners, especially in strengthening community capacity to respond to and prevent disasters. UNV was awarded a United Nations Sasakawa Certificate of Merit for its achievements in mobilizing university graduates to support disaster reduction initiatives in Guatemala in 2002. National counterpart At the country level UNV is officially represented through the UNDP Resident Representative. In approximately 100 countries UNV has a Field Unit (FU), which is part of the UNDP Country Office. Volunteers could be placed with all UN entities and with government counterparts. Areas of work (to correspond with HFA priority areas 1-5) HFA Priority for Action 1 Making disaster risk reduction a policy priority, institutional strengthening UNV works with governments on developing national volunteer infrastructure, which could include supporting the development of specific volunteer legislation and national volunteer schemes. In some countries UNV has specifically worked on developing volunteer infrastructure for disaster risk reduction and management that could support for example the mobilization of volunteers, coordinate the activities of volunteer involving organizations, promote good volunteer management, advocate for the value of volunteerism, and develop a database of volunteers.Roles, mandates and areas of work of key UN entities 99Disaster Risk Reduction in the United Nations HFA Priority for Action 2 Risk assessment and early warning systems UNV supports the creation of early warning systems through the establishment of disaster management teams and taskforces, and ensuring community participation by training a large number of volunteers in local and rural communities.

WFP also provides the logistics support necessary to get food to the right people at the right time and in the right place. WFP heads the Logistics Cluster in order to provide common service to the humanitarian community in emergency interventions. WFP works to put hunger at the centre of the international agenda, promoting policies, strategies and operations that directly benefit the poor and hungry. Disaster reduction goal The 2008-2013 Strategic Plan reflects the changing nature of food as-sistance and hunger and marks a historical shift from WFP as a food aid agency to WFP as a food assistance agency, with a more nuanced and robust set of tools to respond to critical hunger needs. The overarching goal is to reduce dependency and to support governmental and global efforts to ensure long-term solutions to the hunger challenge. As part of the Strategic Objective 2, WFP aims at preventing acute hun- ger by investing in disaster preparedness and mitigation measures. WFP also contributes to strengthening the capacity of governments and local communities to prevent prepare for and respond to humanitarian crises. Policies and programmes in disaster risk reduction WFP Disaster Risk Reduction Policy was presented to the Executive Board in 2009. It aims at strengthening WFP's compliance with the Hyogo Framework and mainstreaming DRR at all levels within the Organization. Overall, the policies governing the use of WFP food assistance are oriented towards eradicating hunger and poverty by reducing vulnerability, improving livelihoods and strengthening disaster resilience. The consolidated framework of WFP policies also emphasizes the mitigation of the effects of recurring disasters in vulnerable areas as one of the five priority areas under programming principles. WFP World Food Programme WFP102 Roles, mandates and areas of work of key UN entitiesDisaster Risk Reduction in the United Nations WFP works with local, national and international partners to incorporate disaster prevention and mitigation activities in Country Strategy Outlines, Country Programmes and Protracted Relief and Recovery Operations. WFP develops standard procedures jointly with government counterparts for borrowing from and replenishing national food stocks and seeks donor flexibility to use donations, especially directed contributions, for disaster mitigation.

Improved disaster risk mapping supports early targeting systems for populations at risk. The Vulnerability Assessment and Mapping unit (VAM) of the WFP establishes the basis for conclusions on why and where food security and vulnerability exist in any given country. VAM also identifies potential priorities for the targeting of WFP programmes, the appropriate role of food aid in addressing food security problems and potential sectors for WFP intervention. These same elements are also key inputs into the WFP Country Strategy Outline, where the WFP country office describes its development strategies and programmes. Early warning systems focus on tracking the status of regularly occurring hazards to food security such as drought, floods, El Ni\u00f1o and market prices over time. WFP uses this information to predict the potential onset of a crisis that could affect the food security status of groups of people within a country or region. Roles, mandates and areas of work of key UN entities 103Disaster Risk Reduction in the United Nations Where there is no organized early warning capability within a country or region, WFP and partners (Governments, NGOs, or regional organizations) work to establish such a mechanism. The Vulnerability Assessment and Mapping unit plays a key role in assisting with the design and implementation or data collection or reporting for early warning activities through monitoring activities. WFP has developed partnerships with institutional and academic institutions in order to improve its access to real-time information. The aim is to improve early warning systems. One example is the ITHACA programme, launched in February 2007 as a joint initiative with Italy's Polytechnic University of Turin. The programme was conceived to provide WFP with remote sensing-based applications in order to accurately predict and assess the impact of disasters on communities and infrastructure. The IASC Humanitarian Early Warning Service (HEWSWeb) is an inter- agency partnership project aimed at establishing a common platform for humanitarian early warnings and forecasts for natural hazards. The service has been developed by WFP who is responsible for coordinating and managing the overall information content, design, and organization of HEWS web on behalf of the Inter-Agency Standing Committee and its members. WFP Climate Change and Disaster Risk Reduction Coordination Office is also supporting WFP country offices and governments in the development of comprehensive disaster risk management frameworks by linking early assessment, early warning, contingency planning, capacity building with contingent finance and innovative disaster risk transfer mechanisms. The overall goal of this approach is to provide a more comprehensive and integrated solution to translate early warning information into early response, enabling a shift from managing disasters to managing risk. HFA Priority for Action 4Reducing underlying risk factors As integrating part of its country programmes, post-disaster recovery programmes and emergency operations WFP undertakes measures aimed at preventing disaster risk, reducing vulnerability and enhancing disaster preparedness. In all contexts, WFP aims at comprehensive disaster mitigation strategies based on an analysis of disaster-related risks and the possibilities to reduce those risks, especially for poor people who are food insecure or particularly vulnerable in the event of a crisis or disaster. WFP104 Roles, mandates and areas of work of key UN entitiesDisaster Risk Reduction in the United Nations WFP has two approaches to Disaster Mitigation, the anticipating approach and the recovery approach. The former indicates programmes and projects aiming at longer term mitigation activities to reduce the vulnerability to the risk of disasters and help avert an emergency before it turns into a full-fledged crisis. The recovery approach indicates the inclusion of mitigation elements in WFP's general recovery programmes and projects, such as ensuring that houses, schools and infrastructure destroyed by a disaster are rebuilt to resist future shocks. Headquarters-based Policy and Programme units dealing with risk reduction, disaster mitigation, social protection and livelihoods service support country offices in programme design and implementation. This includes the introduction of Food for Work (FFW), Food for Assets (FFA) and cash or voucher based initiatives which help households and communities to shift to sustainable livelihoods, improve productivity and prevent loss or degradation of assets. Food and labour based initiatives also contribute to sustainable natural-resource management and stabilization of areas subject to resource degradation through community activities such as terracing, tree planting and soil and water conservation. HFA Priority for Action 5Preparedness for effective response WFP has strengthened emergency support functions at all levels and mainstreamed emergency preparedness throughout the organization. Contingency planning and operational planning are used as strategic planning tools. WFP has also improved its capacities to prepare for and respond in emergencies through the upgrading of its assessments via the Strengthening Emergency Needs Assessment Capacity (SENAC) project. WFP is the leader of the global logistics cluster and co-leader of the emergency telecommunications cluster. As cluster leader, it ensures efficient, reliable and predictable logistics and ICT services to the humanitarian community. WFP's strategy of pre-positioning emergency food and support equipment through the UNHRD Network relies on five strategically located depots providing the humanitarian community with a global footprint that will drastically reduce the cost of deploying relief items, decrease response time and, most importantly, save lives. Emergency Preparedness and Response Branch is the focal point for technical aspects of disaster preparedness, while Logistics Services leads design and implementation of logistics activities in WFP and for the United Nations system.Roles, mandates and areas of work of key UN entities 105Disaster Risk Reduction in the United Nations Focal point Climate Change and Disaster Risk Reduction Coordination Office.

WHO's Constitution came into force on 7 April 1948. WHO is responsible for providing leadership on global health matters, shaping the health research agenda, setting norms and standards, articulating evidence-based policy options, providing technical support to countries and monitoring and assessing health trends. Disaster reduction goal To support countries in building national capacity in risk reduction and emergency preparedness, and to assist the health sector in Member States in reducing the adverse public health consequences for communities in terms of mortality, morbidity, disability and damage to health care delivery services and health systems resulting from emergencies, disasters and other crises. Policies and programmes in disaster risk reduction WHO Six-Year Risk Reduction and Emergency Preparedness Strategy for Health Sector and Community Capacity Development was released in 2007. The priority areas identified in the strategy include: Baseline assessments on the status of risk reduction and emergency preparedness in the health sector at regional and country levels; Institutionalizing emergency preparedness and risk management in ministries of health; WHO World Health Organization WHORoles, mandates and areas of work of key UN entities 107Disaster Risk Reduction in the United Nations Establishing an effective all-hazard/whole-health programme for this purpose; Encouraging and supporting community-based emergency preparedness and risk management; and Improving knowledge and skills in health emergency preparedness and response, and risk management. All-Hazard approach entails developing and implementing emergency management strategies for the full range of likely risks and emergencies (natural, biological, technological and societal). A Whole-Health approach emphasizes that emergency planning processes, overall coordination procedures, surge and operational platforms should be unified under one emergency preparedness and response unit so that the plans of the health sector can then be effectively coordinated with other sectors as well as with the designated. The World Health Assembly will be considering adoption of an Executive Board Resolution on \"Strengthening national and community health emergency and disaster management capacity and resilience of health systems\" in May 2011. The World Health Assembly (WHA) has adopted a number of resolutions in the past which are relevant to disaster risk reduction. WHA Resolution 58.1 (May 2005) drew on experiences and lessons learned from major crises and the outcomes of the World Disaster Reduction Conference in Kobe in 2005. This Resolution urged Member States to make their best efforts to engage actively in collective measures to establish global and regional preparedness plans that integrate risk reduction into the health sector and to build capacity to respond to health-related crises. It also requested Member States to formulate national emergency preparedness plans that give due attention to public health, including health infrastructure, in order to mitigate the damage and loss of function associated with events related to hazards and to improve the effectiveness of responses to crises and contributions to the recovery of health systems. In 2006, WHA Resolution 59.22 reiterated the importance of action needed to build national capacities in emergency preparedness. Resolutions have been passed by every Regional Committee over the past 20 years to reinforce the mandate given to WHO and to strengthen initiatives in the area of emergency preparedness and response in WHO108 Roles, mandates and areas of work of key UN entitiesDisaster Risk Reduction in the United Nations Member States. In 2010, the Regional Committee for the Eastern Mediterranean adopted Resolution EM/RC57/R.2 which urges Member States to integrate health in all national emergency management and disaster risk reduction programmes, and to integrate emergency preparedness and risk reduction in all health development programmes. The Directing Council of the Pan American Organisation, by adopting Resolution CD50.R15, approved a Plan of Action on Safe Hospitals, and urged Member States to prioritize adoption of a national safe hospitals policy. In 2009, Ministers of Health of the South-east Asian Region endorsed the Kathmandu Declaration on Protecting Health Facilities from Disasters, which includes a commitment to the implementation of the Hyogo Framework for Action. Strategic Objective 5 of WHO's Medium-Term Strategic Plan (MTSP) for 2008-2013 is: \"To reduce the health consequences of emergencies, disasters, crises and conflicts, and minimize their social and economic impact.\" The 2010-2011 biennial global work plan recognizes the crucial importance of supporting countries in the areas of health sector risk reduction and emergency preparedness, and building institutional capacity in WHO for emergency preparedness and response. International Health Regulations (IHR 2005) came into force in June 2007. The agreement provides a framework for the coordination of the management of events that may constitute a public health emergency of international concerns, and will improve the capacity of all countries to detect, assess, notify and respond to public health threats. This includes efforts from WHO and partners to build capacity to reduce risks and respond to pandemics through a multisectoral approach. The Global Work Plan on Climate Change and Health and the WHO guidance and advocacy materials describe disaster risk reduction as a key climate change adaption measure. The Global Health Cluster has endorsed a Guidance Note which promotes the need for a coordinated approach of Global Health Cluster partners in support of health emergency preparedness and risk reduction at national and local levels, and recommends that the roll-out of country-level Health Clusters should take fully into account of national arrangements and existing capacities for emergency preparedness and response.

WHO has also developed capacity assessment tools that can contribute to capacity assessment of health emergency systems for risk reduction and emergency preparedness. WHORoles, mandates and areas of work of key UN entities 111Disaster Risk Reduction in the United Nations WHO-EMRO has developed the e-Atlas of disaster risk for the Eastern Mediterranean Region: Exposure to natural hazards, Volume 1. The Atlas uses geographic information systems and various disaster models to assist disaster management decision-makers to reduce health risk to vulnerable populations. Subsequent volumes which are still under development will focus on vulnerability and risk and capacity assessments, in order to improve risk reduction and emergency preparedness in the health sector. WHO has established the Vulnerability and Risk Analysis and Mapping (VRAM) platform within the WHO Mediterranean Centre for Health Risk Reduction (WMC) in Tunis. The objective of the VRAM platform is to support countries in developing the capacity to assess health risks (mortality, morbidity and disability) and incorporate the results in emergency and response preparedness planning. As its knowledge base grows, VRAM's goal is to become a network of excellence in assessing health-related vulnerabilities and risks supported by a technical unit whose expertise can be utilized effectively by various partners (governments, UN and research organizations, NGOs or others) at an affordable cost. VRAM activities include partnership with organizations through the Global Risk Identification Programme (GRIP). HFA Priority for Action 3 Education, information and public awareness WHO works with Member States and other partners to improve skills and knowledge in risk reduction and emergency preparedness and response in the health sector. The work focuses on two main areas: (1) Developing and updating guidelines, standards and sound technical information on emergency preparedness and response; and (2) Promoting the development of sound and credible training and educational materials and the organization of courses, workshops, simulations, other mechanisms of transfer of knowledge, and platforms where health emergency managers can share experience and material at local, national, regional and international levels.

WHO-WPRO has developed a number of emergency guidelines and tools, including a pocket emergency manual which contains a section on preparing for emergencies. It has also produced Field Manual for Capacity Assessment of Health Facilities in Responding to Emergencies. Training focuses on awareness raising, advocacy and sensitization on risk reduction and emergency preparedness health issues, planning processes, needs assessment in emergencies, inter-sectoral emergency management and standardizing and building technical skills within all health disciplines involved in emergency preparedness and response: WHO-SEARO and WPRO have a Public Health and Emergency Management in Asia-Pacific Programme with the Asian Disaster Preparedness Center (ADPC) which provides training courses at bi-regional and national levels for the development of health system capacities to prepare for and respond to emergencies. EMRO have a similar programme - Management of Public Health Risks - which has been conducted at regional and national levels, while EURO have conducted a regional PHEM-EURO course. WHORoles, mandates and areas of work of key UN entities 113Disaster Risk Reduction in the United Nations WHO-HQ and Regional Offices organizes Public Health Pre-deployment Training courses which prepare health professionals to work effectively in providing health programmes to populations affected by emergencies, disasters and other crises. HFA Priority for Action 4Reducing underlying risk factors References are provided above to WHO's policy commitment and continuing support for country programes to make hospitals safer and better prepared for emergencies and disasters. The World Disaster Reduction Campaign 2008-2009 \"Hospitals Safe from Disasters: Reduce Risk, Protect Health Facilities, Save Lives\" led by WHO and the UNISDR, with support from the World Bank was aimed at building the resilience of hospitals and other health facilities to disasters, and on making sure health workers are prepared, so that they will be functional under emergency situations . WHO also dedicated World Health Day 2009 to the theme of health facilities in emergencies. Through WHD 2009, WHO promoted the safe design, building and operation of all types of health facilities so they (and their staff) can withstand any type of emergency and the emergency preparedness of health facilities to provide health care services during the emergency and in their aftermath. The campaign provided a platform for strengthening of hospitals, health facilities and systems in the context of risk reduction and emergency preparedness and response. The campaign also provided visibility and a platform for advocacy on risk health reduction and emergency preparedness at global, national and community levels. HFA Priority for Action 5 Preparedness for effective response WHO promotes the establishment or strengthening of a risk reduction and emergency preparedness unit in each Ministry of Health reporting directly to the highest relevant authority. This unit works as the focal point for the designated national emergency management agency and for other sectors involved in emergency preparedness and response. WHO advocates that proper preparedness requires improvement and protection of the baseline capacities including health care facilities, services and skills. WHO114 Roles, mandates and areas of work of key UN entitiesDisaster Risk Reduction in the United Nations WHO assists Ministries of Health to integrate emergency preparedness into existing community structures. The strategy to support all-hazard emergency preparedness for the communities includes joining forces with UN agencies, non-government organizations, development cooperation partners, academic institutions and other partners to reduce risks to public health, facilities and health systems. WHO and partners are focusing on advocacy and measures to scale up the community-based health workforce for health emergency risk management. WHO is the designated lead of the Global Health Custer, the role of which is to build global capacity for humanitarian health action by developing global guidance, standards, tools and resources to inform, enhance and facilitate the implementation of the Cluster Approach at the country level as well as to improve surge capacity, access to trained technical expertise and material stockpiles to improve response operations. The strengthening of the preparedness capacity of countries and communities particularly at risk before emergency strikes is a major part of the cluster approach. Risk reduction is integrated in the health component of Post-Disaster Needs Assessment tools and processes. This ensures that planning for disaster recovery and reconstruction will take account of measures to reduce health risks, and strengthen health emergency risk management capacities as part of building the resilience of health systems.

The hazards under its mandate include severe storms, tropical cyclones (hurricanes and typhoons), storm surges, floods, cold spells, heat waves, cold waves, droughts, volcanic ash transport, air pollution, sand and dust storms, among others. It also contributes with data, information products and services for the monitoring and prediction of forest fires, locust swarms, health epidemics, tsunami, among others. Through the coordinated network of the National Meteorological and Hydrological Services (NMHSs) of its 189 Members, WMO coordinates the WMO Integrated Global Observing System (WIGOS), the WMO Information system (WIS) and the Global Data Processing and Forecasting System, providing a wide range of products and services based on observations, monitoring, hazard analysis and forecasting. Under the Global Framework for Climate Services (GFCS), established by the Third World Climate Conference (WCC-3) to strengthen the provision and use of climate predictions, products and information worldwide, WMO will coordinate the network of Regional Specialized Meteorological Centres (RSMCs), Global Producing Centres for Long Range Forecasts (GPCs), Regional Climate Centres (RCCs), and Drought Monitoring Centres, which provide information products and services that will enable better management of the risks associated with climate variability and change at all levels, through development and incorporation of science based climate information and predictions into planning, policy and practice. In addition WMO is supported by the work of Technical Programmes, Technical Commissions and Regional Associations.WMO World Meteorological Organization Roles, mandates and areas of work of key UN entities 117Disaster Risk Reduction in the United Nations Disaster reduction goal To enhance the contributions of National Meteorological and Hydrologi- cal Services, in a more cost-effective, systematic and sustainable manner, towards the protection of lives, livelihoods and property, through strength-ening of capabilities and cooperation in the field of disaster risk reduction at national to international levels. Policies and programmes in disaster risk reduction WMO Congress XIV, in 2003, established the WMO Disaster Risk Reduction Programme to strengthen and integrate disaster risk reduction processes related to meteorological, hydrological and climate services of its WMO operational and research networks in all countries, particularly those with least resources. WMO is committed to the implementation of the Hyogo Framework for Action 2005-2015, and plays a lead role for the second priority area, namely \"Identify, assess and monitor disaster risks and enhance early warning\" , in relation with meteorological, hydrological and climate-related hazards, while contributing to other priority areas. HFA has been mainstreamed within WMO through the establishment of the strategic priorities and implementation of WMO's DRR programme. Through extensive consultations across WMO network, HFA was analysed to identify activities to which National Meteorological and Hydrological Services and WMO provide lead and contributing support. Five strategic priorities where derived from these analysis and have been approved by WMO Congress XV. Strategic Goal 1: Development, improvement and sustainability of early warning systems in particular related to scientific and technical infrastructures, systems and capabilities for research, observing, detecting, forecasting and warnings of weather-, water- and climate-related hazards; Strategic Goal 2: Development, improvement and sustainability of systems, methods, tools and applications of modern technologies such as geographical information systems for recording, analyzing and providing hazard information for risk assessment, sectoral planning and other informed decision-making; Strategic Goal 3: Development and delivery of warnings, specialized forecasts and other products and services that are timely, understandable to those at risk and driven by requirements of disaster risk reduction decision processes and operations; WMO118 Roles, mandates and areas of work of key UN entitiesDisaster Risk Reduction in the United Nations Strategic Goal 4: Stimulate a culture of disaster preparedness through strengthening of capacities for better integration of NMHSs' products and services in disaster risk reduction, and continued public education and outreach campaigns; Strategic Goal 5: Strengthening cooperation and partnerships of WMO and NMHSs in national, regional and international mechanisms and structures for implementation of disaster risk reduction. The successful implementation of the Plan contributes to national disaster risk management, by facilitating and strengthening contribution of the National Meteorological and Hydrological Services through provision of meteorological, hydrological and climate-related information, for (i) hydro-meteorological risk identification with in the context of changing climate, (ii) risk reduction, through provision of meteorological, hydrological and climate related information for sectoral planning and early warning systems and (iii) financial risk transfer for weather related risks such as droughts, tropical cyclone and floods. WMO DRR strategic goals are implemented through national and regional projects, which leverage activities of WMO Programmes, Technical Commissions, Regional Associations, Members and partners to ensure: Modernization of NMHS and their observing networks; Implementation of national operational multi-hazard early warning systems; Implementation of hydro-meteorological risk assessment capacities to support risk assessment, risk reduction and risk transfer; Strengthening of NMHS partnerships with disaster risk management agencies and other national DRM stakeholders; Coordinated training of NMHS and DRM partners and outreach programmes targeted at governments, DRM stakeholders and the public. Involvement of partner, primarily from the international humanitarian and development agencies, who are actively working with national governments in developing their DRM capacities, is critical. These are identified on the basis of the analysis of their priorities, roles and mandates, and synergies with WMO strategic goals in DRR. A key factor for the success of the DRR Programme rests in engaging these partners in national/regional projects to ensure that institutional and operationalRoles, mandates and areas of work of key UN entities 119Disaster Risk Reduction in the United Nations capacities of the NMHSs and DRM institutions are developed in parallel supported by clear plans, and legislation that clearly identify roles and responsibilities of the different agencies. WMO in cooperation with its Members and international and regional partners is involved in capacity development programmes with long term development goals implemented through phased projects at national levels with a regional cooperation framework including: The Regional Programme on Disaster Risk reduction in South East Europe, targeting 8 beneficiaries (Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, Kosovo (as defined by UNSCR 1244/99) and Turkey.

HFA Priority for Action 2 Risk assessment and early warning systems Risk Assessment: WMO conducted a country-level fact-finding survey on DRR in 2006, which provided a benchmark on Members' capacities, requirements and priorities in disaster risk management. It indicated that droughts, flash and river floods, strong winds, severe storms, tropical cyclones, storm surges, forest fires, heat waves, landslides and aviation hazards were the top ten hazards of concern to all Members. The survey confirmed that over 90% of National Meteorological and Hydrological Services needed guidance on standard methodologies for monitoring, archiving, analysis and mapping of hazards and early warning systems with a multi-hazard approach. WMO through its Hydrology and Water Resource Programme and Agricultural Meteorology Programmes and in collaboration with Global Risk Assessment Programme (GRIP) supports NMHSs in maintenance of hazard data and analysis for national risk assessments. Initiated projects aim at developing standard guidelines for maintaining databases, metadata and mapping methodologies for floods and droughts. Other initiatives are underway for standardization of hazard information for other meteorological hazards. Early Warning Systems: WMO in cooperation with its Members and other UN-ISDR System partners has developed a systematic process for documenting good practices in early warning systems (EWS). This has involved extensive consultations with experts during two international symposia and various regional and WMO122 Roles, mandates and areas of work of key UN entitiesDisaster Risk Reduction in the United Nations national events. To-date seven good practices have been documented through a multi-agency process, including, (i) Bangladesh Cyclone Preparedness Programme, (ii) Tropical Cyclone Early Warning System of Cuba, (iii) French \"Vigilance\" System, (iv) Shanghai Multi-Hazard Early Warning and Emergency Preparedness Programme (v) The Warning Management of the Deutscher Wetterdienst of Germany, (vi) the Japan Multi-Hazard Early Warning System and (vii) the United States of America Multi-Hazard Early Warning System. These cases along with guidelines on \"Institutional partnerships and coordination on Multi-Hazard EWS\" will be published in 2011 and have been used to develop training targeted at high-level officials from hydrometeorological and DRM institutions. HFA Priority for Action 3 Education, information and public awareness WMO through its sponsored and co-sponsored Research Programmes coordinates the development of technical and scientific knowledge on meteorological, hydrological and climate related hazards, their predictability and forecasting, and linkages to climate change and climate variability. HFA Priority for Action 4 Reducing underlying risk factors Through its new Global Framework for Climate Services, WMO is launching a new initiative to facilitate the provision of relevant climate information to support climate adaptation and disaster risk reduction. WMO is also developing, through expert teams, guidelines on utilization of meteorological, hydrological hazard analysis and historical climate information and forecasts as input to urban and infrastructure planning, land use management, etc. The risk of economic damages associated with hydrometeorological and climate-related hazards can be hedged through weather-indexed and catastrophe insurance schemes. To introduce the work of the insurance sector into the planning activities of NMHSs the WMO DRR Programme facilitated a user workshop on Requirements of Catastrophe Insurance and Weather-indexed Insurance for Meteorological, Hydrological and Climate Services in 2007 (http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/drr/events/cat-insurance-wrm-markets-2007/index_en.html). The meeting recommended that WMO facilitates development of guidelines for provision of services by NMHSs to support the needs of the Insurance/Reinsurance Sector. Under the umbrella of an industry-led researchRoles, mandates and areas of work of key UN entities 123Disaster Risk Reduction in the United Nations network involving a large group of insurance and reinsurance companies and associations, a coordinated research programme has been initiated in partnership with NCAR/UCAR, GFDL, UK Met Office, University of Reading, University of Exeter, Scripts School of Oceanography, Princeton University, University of Oklahoma, Oxford University and catastrophe risk modelling companies to develop climate services based on various climate forecasting and analysis technologies, with a strong emphasis on understanding of the characteristics and patterns of extreme events on seasonal, inter-annual and decadal time frames. This initiative follows a wave of new legislation in the USA, UK and EU requiring the insurance sector to regularly report on their climate risks associated with extreme events. This is part of government actions to initiate discussions with the insurance/reinsurance private companies to anticipate ways in which through stronger public/private partnerships climate risks related to this sector can be addressed. These movements are expected to expand to all western European countries as well as the emerging markets for insurance (India, China, Brazil, etc.). Weather-indexed and catastrophe insurance schemes have also been successfully used in Ethiopia and Malawi, providing scope for the use of such schemes in least developing countries. HFA Priority for Action 5 Preparedness for effective response WMO ensures through the projects launched with other ISDR system partners in Early Warning Systems that feedback is provided for improving emergency planning and response operations. WMO is developing capacity development and training programmes between national meteorological agencies and emergency preparedness and response agencies. WMO has established a partnership with WFP and World Bank to support the development of financial risk transfer and weather risk management markets, systematically, through facilitating participation of NMHS for provision of meteorological and hydrological data. Focal point DRR Programme Website http://www.wmo.int/disasters WMO124 Roles, mandates and areas of work of key UN entitiesDisaster Risk Reduction in the United Nations General description of the organization Since inception in 1944, the World Bank has expanded from a single institution to a closely associated group of five development institutions. The mission has evolved from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development as facilitator of post-war reconstruction and development to the present day mandate of worldwide poverty alleviation. The five institutions are the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), International Development Association (IDA), International Finance Corporation (IFC), Multilateral Guarantee Agency (MIGA), and International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID). The World Bank's projects and operations are designed to support low- income and middle-income countries' poverty reduction strategies. It does so within each country's specific socio-economic context, adapting programmes to country capacity and needs. The Bank provides low-interest loans, interest-free credits and grants to developing countries for a wide array of purposes that include investments in disaster recovery and risk mitigation, education, health, public administration, infrastructure, financial and private sector development, agriculture, and environmental and natural resource management. Although the Bank has traditionally played a key role in post-disaster recovery and reconstruction, recently it has increased its involvement in longer term disaster risk reduction. Disaster reduction goal The overarching objective is to mainstream disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation in country development strategies, such as Poverty Reduc - tion Strategies (PRSP), Country Assistance Strategies (CAS), United Nations Development Assistance Frameworks (UNDAFs), and National Adaptation Programmes of Action (NAPAs), to reduce vulnerabilities to natural hazards. This is done through providing analytical, technical and operational support to countries for disaster risk reduction.THE WORLD BANK THE WORLD BANKRoles, mandates and areas of work of key UN entities 125Disaster Risk Reduction in the United Nations Policies and programmes in disaster risk reduction The World Bank is the largest provider of development assistance for disaster recovery and risk mitigation. Disaster assistance has accounted for nearly a tenth of the World Bank Commitments since 1984. The IDA alone committed about US$ 12 billion dollars to disaster assistance to low income countries between 1996 and 2007. Increasingly the focus of the World Bank is on disaster risk reduction, not just reconstruction. The World Bank's ex-ante work in integrating disaster risk reduction in development is carried out primarily through the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (www.GFDRR.org). Together with major donors and the UN, the World Bank in 2006 launched GFDRR to support the implementation of the Hyogo Framework for Action 2005-2015 and thereby address the needs of vulnerable countries and provide coherent approaches globally and regionally to risk reduction and recovery by using the ISDR system. The GFDRR is managed by the World Bank on behalf of the participating donor partners and other partnering stakeholders. It offers a unique business model for advancing disaster risk reduction based on ex ante support to high risk countries and ex post assistance for accelerated recovery and risk reduction after a disaster. This partnership has been successful in raising the profile of disaster risk reduction for sustainable development. GFDRR works to reduce disaster risks in countries through three-track operations. Track I Working in partnership with the UNISDR, the main objective of this track is to enhance the capacities of regional inter-governmental organizations. Track II provides technical and financial assistance to low and middle income countries to mainstream disaster risk reduction into their country assistance and poverty reduction strategies. Track III catalyzes greater cooperation between the humanitarian and development actors for accelerated recovery and risk reduction. The World Bank has also established a Global Expert Team (GET) for Disaster Risk Management to provide high quality rapid advisory support to Governments in disaster risk assessments, risk reduction, risk transfer and insurance products, post-disaster needs assessment and recovery and reconstruction operations. GET consists of World Bank staff and experts from its partner organizations with global expertise in disaster risk management.

It also supports the mainstreaming of disaster risk reduction in national development strategies such as the Country Assistance Strategies, the Poverty Reduction Strategies and the sectoral strategies. The World Bank and the UN have jointly conducted the first-ever assessment on the economics of disaster risk reduction 'Natural Hazards, UnNatural Disasters: The economics of effective prevention' with the aim of evaluating economic arguments related to disaster risk reduction through an analytical, conceptual, and empirical examination of the following themes: ex-ante v. ex-post disaster risk management, longer term impacts of disasters, benefit-cost analysis, disasters and conflicts and urbanization of disasters. The findings are intended to influence broader thinking related to disaster risk and occurrence, raise awareness of the potential to reduce disaster costs, and provide guidance on the implementation of disaster risk reduction investments. HFA Priority for Action 2 Risk assessment and early warning systems The World Bank provides technical and financial assistance for developing appropriate instruments for risk assessments and early warning systems. The World Bank has developed a number of tools and methodologies such as Probabilistic Risk Assessments, Housing reconstruction handbook, Climate Change Primer for City Managers, and Drought Adaptation Plan. THE WORLD BANKRoles, mandates and areas of work of key UN entities 127Disaster Risk Reduction in the United Nations HFA Priority for Action 3 Education, information and public awareness The World Bank supports the documentation and dissemination of good practices on disaster risk mainstreaming, facilitates exchange of lessons and experiences; promotes need-based research and transfer of low-cost risk reduction solutions. It trains Bank teams in the methodologies to assess risks, damages, economic losses and financial needs for recovery and reconstruction; and disaster risk mitigation and financing. It also promotes exchange and co-operation in disaster risk reduction: The South-South Cooperation Programme launched by GFDRR catalyses cooperation in disaster risk reduction by supporting public, private, and civil society partnerships between institutions and organizations in low-and middle-income countries. HFA Priority for Action 4 Reducing underlying risk factors The World Bank provides technical and financial assistance for developing appropriate instruments for risk mitigation such as in climate change adaptation projects, municipal planning and coastal zone management. It also provides input for incorporating disaster risk reduction into planning/implementation across different sectors and develops toolkits for safer school and hospital buildings which provide a step by step guide on integrating disaster resilience in such investment. It provides technical and financial assistance for developing appropriate instruments for risk financing: These include promoting Contingent Loans, such as the Catastrophe Risk Deferred Drawdown Options (CAT DDO), and providing access to international catastrophe reinsurance markets on competitive terms such as the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility (CCRIF), Insurance Linked Securities such as Cat bonds, Property Catastrophe Insurance Programs such as the Turkish Catastrophe Insurance Pool (TCIP), and Agriculture Insurance Programs such as Index-Based Livestock Insurance and weather Based Crop Insurance. THE WORLD BANK128 Roles, mandates and areas of work of key UN entitiesDisaster Risk Reduction in the United Nations HFA Priority for Action 5 Preparedness for effective response The World Bank provides Emergency Recovery Loans to countries in the aftermath of a major disaster and helps countries coordinate the post-disaster damage, losses and needs assessment for an efficient and risk reducing recovery. It bridges the gap between humanitarian assistance and longer term recovery in the event of a disaster: GFDRR established the world's first global disaster recovery fund - the Standby Recovery Financing Facility (SRFF) for this purpose. The Fund can be activated when a disaster strikes to provide assistance for recovery and reconstruction activities, and also to support damage and loss assessments. The SRFF includes two financing windows: a Technical Assistance Fund, to support damage loss, needs assessment and planning; and a Callable Fund, to provide speedy access to financial resources for disaster recovery. The World Bank has also established a Quick Reaction Team (QRT), which is a group of highly-trained and experienced staff drawn from both within the Bank and outside the Bank. QRT provides rapid assistance and expedited knowledge services to requesting country teams and directly to the governments of disaster-affected countries.

Second Committee recommends to the General Assembly the adoption of one annual resolution on disaster risk reduction: International Strategy for Disaster Reduction and two biennial resolutions: Natural disasters and vulnerability, and International cooperation to reduce the impact of the El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon. In 2010, the General Assembly resolution on International Strategy for Disas- ter Reduction (A/RES/64/200) recognized that certain measures for disaster risk reduction in the context of the Hyogo Framework for Action can also support adaptation to climate change, and emphasizing the importance of strengthening the resilience of nations and communities to natural disasters through disaster risk reduction programmes. It also stressed the importance of advancing the implementation of the Plan of Implementation of the World Summit on Sustainable Development (\"Johannesburg Plan of Imple-mentation\") and its relevant provisions on vulnerability, risk assessment and disaster management. The resolution invited increased efforts to support, implement and follow up the Hyogo Framework for Action, and stressed the importance in this regard of the continued cooperation and coordination of stakeholders at all levels with respect to addressing effectively the impact of natural disasters. GENERAL ASSEMBLYRoles, mandates and areas of work of key UN entities 131Disaster Risk Reduction in the United Nations It called upon the United Nations system to integrate the goals of, and take into full account, the Hyogo Framework for Action in their strategies and programmes, making use of existing coordination mechanisms, and to assist developing countries with those mechanisms to design and implement, as appropriate, disaster risk reduction measures with a sense of urgency. Issues related to International Strategy for Disaster Reduction are also referred to in the humanitarian resolutions of the Third Committee: Strengthening of the coordination of emergency humanitarian assistance of the United Nations; International cooperation on humanitarian assistance in the field of natural disasters, from relief to development; and Strengthening emergency relief, rehabilitation, reconstruction and prevention in the aftermath of the Indian Ocean tsunami disaster The General Assembly resolution on United Nations Millennium Declaration (A/RES/55/2) decided the following: \" We resolve therefore to adopt in all our environmental actions a new ethic of conservation and stewardship and, as first steps, we resolve: To intensify cooperation to reduce the number and effects of natural and manmade disasters.\" The UNISDR participates into and organizes side events during the general debate of the General Assembly and in relation to thematic debates throughout the year.

However, ISDR related issues are considered in the humanitarian segment of the ECOSOC, and UNISDR organizes side events during humanitarian and/or general segments. In 2008, there was a panel discussion during humanitarian affairs segment on \"Building capabilities and capacities at all levels for timely humanitarian assistance, including disaster risk reduction\" . ECOSOC Functional Commissions most relevant to disaster risk reduction: The Commission on the Status of Women (CWS) is a functional commission of ECOSOC dedicated exclusively to gender equality and advancement of women. It is the principal global policy-making body established by ECOSOC resolution 11(II) in 1946. Every year, representatives of Member States gather at United Nations Headquarters in New York to evaluate progress on gender equality, identify challenges, set global standards and formulate concrete policies to promote gender equality and advancement of women worldwide. CWS addressed environmental management and the mitigation of disasters caused by natural hazards at its 46th session in 2002. In its fifty-second session in March 2008, it considered \"Gender perspectives on climate change\" as the emerging issue. The United Nations Commission on Sustainable Development (CSD) was established by the UN General Assembly in December 1992 to ensure effective follow-up of United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED), also known as the Earth Summit. The Commission is responsible for reviewing progress in the implementation of Agenda 21 and the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development; as well as providing policy guidance to follow up the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation (JPOI) at the local, national, regional and international levels. The JPOI reaffirmed that the CSD is the high-level forum for sustainable development within the United Nations system. The CSD meets annually in New York, in two-year cycles, with each cycle focusing on clusters of specific thematic and cross-sectoral issues, outlined in its multi-year programme of work (2003-2017) (E/CN.17/2003/6).

Risk management and vulnerability have also been examined in the context of other thematic clusters of CSD, such as water, sanitation and human settlements (2004-2005) and drought and desertification (2008-2009). Poverty eradication, protecting and managing the natural resource base, sustainable development of SIDS and sustainable development for Africa, in particular land, drought and desertification related issues, are very relevant to the implementation of the Hyogo Framework for Action. UNISDR participates into the CSD and usually organizes one side event together with its partners during the CSD session. United Nations Forum on Forests (UNFF) was established in October 2000, by ECOSOC resolution 2000/35 as a subsidiary body with the main objective to promote \"... the management, conservation and sustainable development of all types of forests and to strengthen long-term political commitment to this end...\" based on the Rio Declaration, the Forest Principles, Chapter 11 of Agenda 21 and the outcome of the IPF/IFF Processes and other key milestones of international forest policy. The outcome of the sixth session of the United Nations Forum on Forests (E/2006/INF/2/Add.1) expressed its concern about continued deforestation and forest degradation and its adverse impact on the livelihoods of over a billion people (including many of the poorest and most vulnerable), and about the need for more effective implementation of actions to facilitate the management, conservation and sustainable development of all types of forests. ECOSOC Regional Commissions are working actively in disaster risk reduction: - Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) - Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) - Economic Commission for Europe (ECE) - Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) - Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA) Roles, mandates and areas of work of key UN entities 135Disaster Risk Reduction in the United Nations ECOSOC Expert bodies, such as the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues discusses issues relevant to the implementation of the Hyogo Framework for Action.

CEB is the successor body to the Administrative Committee on Coordination (ACC). CEB brings together on a regular basis the executive heads of the organizations of the United Nations system, under the chairmanship of the Secretary General of the United Nations. In addition to its regular reviews of contemporary political issues and major concerns facing the UN system, on the basis of recommendations from bodies reporting to it, CEB approves policy statements on behalf of the UN system as a whole. CEB is supported by three High Level Committees, HLCP , HLCM and UNDG. The division of responsibilities between the three bodies can be summarized as follows: HLCP: Promotion of global policy coherence, including the development of common policy tools, including toolkits, in addition to its work on global policy and programme issues and global public goods. The High Level Committee on Programmes (HLCP), established by CEB in 2000, is the principal mechanism for system-wide coordination in the programme area. It is chaired by the President of the International Fund for Agricultural Development, and is composed of senior-most programme managers of the organizations of the system. In addition to providing the forum for inter-agency dialogue in the development and launching of new programme initiatives, HLCP advises CEB on issues of strategic planning, policy and programme development and implementation, and on other areas that require priority attention in response to the challenges facing the UN system and the global community. HLCP holds its regular sessions in the spring and fall of each year, and undertakes consultations on a continuing basis.CEB The Chief Executives BoardRoles, mandates and areas of work of key UN entities 137Disaster Risk Reduction in the United Nations CEBHLCM (High Level Committee on Management): Harmonization of business practices across the system, including general management issues, thus ensuring overall management coherence from global to country level. UNDG (United Nations Development Group): Promotion of coherent and effective oversight, provision of guidance and capacity building with country level partners, coordination of UN development operations at country level, addressing policy guidance issues related to country level operations, including the implementation of the TCPR resolutions, and support to the Resident Coordinator (RC) system. Role in disaster risk reduction The UN System Chief Executives Board for Coordination took up the issue of disaster risk reduction at its first regular session of 2011 (Nairobi, 1-2 April). The Board expressed its strong commitment to mainstreaming disaster risk reduction in the programmes and operations of the UN system. It agreed to continue working on the further implementation of HLCP's recommendations of 2008, and to consider how such recommendations may be expanded and broadened in the light of current disaster impact trends. HLCP discussed disaster risk reduction in its sixteenth session in September 2008. The policy paper on Strengthening Disaster Risk Reduction throughout the UN System: Proposal for Mainstreaming and Programmatic Coherence (CEB/2008/HLCP-XVI/CRP .6) provided the rationale and proposed action for the UN system to more coherently address the increasing losses to disasters, through mainstreaming well-developed disaster risk reduction policy tools and practical measures through the entire UN system. HLCP has taken forward, through a Working Group on Climate Change led by its Vice-Chair, the development of a system-wide approach to address climate change and to support the process for a global agreement for the post-2012 period. The HLCP Working Group on climate change prepared a report Acting on Climate Change: The UN Delivering as One, on UN system actions on climate change for the COP-14 in Poznan in December 2008. The document provided a mid-term progress report to Member States meeting in Poznan in December 2008, as work continued toward the development of a common framework for presentation at the UNFCCC Conference of Parties meeting in Copenhagen in 2009. Website http://ceb.unsystemceb.org/138 Roles, mandates and areas of work of key UN entitiesDisaster Risk Reduction in the United Nations General description The UN Development Group (UNDG) unites the 33 UN funds, programmes, agencies, departments, and offices that play a role in development. The group's common objective is to deliver more coherent, effective and efficient support to countries seeking to attain internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals. Established by the Secretary-General in 1997 as an instrument for UN reform, the UNDG designs system-wide guidance to coordinate, harmonize and align UN development activities. The group strengthens the UN development system at the country level, prepares it to meet future challenges and ensures that operations are conducted in accordance with mandates from UN governing bodies such as the General Assembly. By strengthening the UN Resident Coordinator System and helping UN organizations work together in new and better ways, the UNDG generates synergies and efficiencies that increase the impact of UN programmes and policy advice. Coordinating development operations promotes more strategic support for national plans and priorities, makes operations more efficient and reduces transaction costs for governments. This helps the UN to be a more relevant and reliable partner for governments. The UNDG is one of the three pillars of the UN Chief Executives Board (CEB), which furthers coordination and cooperation on a wide range of substantive and management issues facing UN System organizations. The CEB brings the executive heads of UN organizations together on a regular basis under the chairmanship of the Secretary-General. Within the CEB structure, the High-Level Committee on Management works on system-wide administrative and management issues, the High-Level Committee on Programmes considers global policy issues, while the United Nations Development Group deals with operational activities for development with a focus on country-level work. The Administrator of the UN Development Programme (UNDP) chairs the UNDG.

UNDG members include: ECA, ECE, the World Bank, UNFIP , OCHA, the Office of the Spokesperson for the Secretary-General, and the Office of the Deputy Secretary-General. The UN Development Operations Coordination Office (DOCO) (formerly the Development Group Office) is the technical support unit for the UNDG. DOCO provides the link between UNDG discussions at headquarters and the work of the UN development system at the country level, and helps the group prepare system-wide agreements, policies and guidelines for country offices. Much of DOCO's work focuses on supporting and strengthening the Resident Coordinator System with funding, policy guidance and training. DOCO advises RCs on how to make country programmes more efficient, effective and aligned with national priorities, and work to streamline coordination mechanisms. Role in disaster risk reduction The Common Country Assessment (CCA) is a common instrument of the United Nations system to analyse the national development situation and identify key development issues with a focus on the Millennium Declaration / MDGs, and other internationally agreed treaty obligations and development goals. One of the five expected results from the UN Country Team's (UNCT) analytical contribution to country analysis is the recognition of the risks of crises and disasters, as well as capacities for crisis prevention and disaster preparedness. A key function of the CCA is to support and strengthen the national development framework which may include planning mechanisms such as: a Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), sector programmes, or a joint assistance strategy (JAS), and may also involve direct budget support. The CCA may also assist in a Consolidated Appeal Process (CAP) or a transition strategy, where they are developed. One of the results of the CCA process is a contribution to developing measures and building capacity for crisis prevention and disaster preparedness; and where applicable to mitigation140 Roles, mandates and areas of work of key UN entitiesDisaster Risk Reduction in the United Nations plans, post-conflict/disaster recovery and rehabilitation, and planning the transition from relief to development. The UNDG Working Group on Programming Issues endorsed a Guidance Note on Integrating Disaster Risk Reduction into the Common Country Assessment and United Nations Development Assistance Framework in November 2008. The guidance note was revised and updated by a joint UNDG/ISDR Task Team on Mainstreaming of Disaster Risk Reduction over the course of 2008. The guidance note was approved by the UNDG in January 2009 after which it is being made available to UNCTs and relevant parties. Website www.undg.orgRoles, mandates and areas of work of key UN entities 141Disaster Risk Reduction in the United Nations IASCGeneral description The Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC) is a unique inter-agency forum for coordination, policy development and decision-making involving the key UN and non-UN humanitarian partners. The IASC was established in June 1992 in response to United Nations General Assembly Resolution 46/182 on the strengthening of humanitarian assistance. General Assembly Resolution 48/57 affirmed its role as the primary mechanism for inter-agency coordination of humanitarian assistance. The following are the primary objectives of the IASC: To develop and agree on system-wide humanitarian policies; To allocate responsibilities among agencies in humanitarian programmes; To develop and agree on a common ethical framework for all humanitarian activities; To advocate for common humanitarian principles to parties outside the IASC; To identify areas where gaps in mandates or lack of operational capacity exist; To resolve disputes or disagreement about and between humanitarian agencies on system-wide humanitarian issues. According to General Assembly Resolution 46/182, the IASC should be composed of \"all operational organizations and with a standing invitation to the ICRC, IFRC, and IOM. Relevant NGOs can be invited to participate on an ad hoc basis.\" In practice, no distinction is made between \"Members\" and \"Standing Invitees\" and the number of participating agencies has expanded since inception of the IASC in 1992. Members of the ICVA, IDPs, SCHR and the World Bank. IASC The Inter-Agency Standing Committee142 Roles, mandates and areas of work of key UN entitiesDisaster Risk Reduction in the United Nations Together with Executive Committee for Humanitarian Affairs (ECHA), the IASC forms the key strategic coordination mechanism among major humanitarian actors. The Executive Committee on Humanitarian Affairs, ECHA, is one of the four Committees created by the Secretary-General in the framework of the UN reform with the aim of enhancing coordination among UN agencies. Chaired by the Emergency Relief Coordinator, ECHA meets on a monthly basis in New York. ECHA's membership, notably with the participation of UN Departments, adds a political and peacekeeping dimension to humanitarian consultations. Role in disaster risk reduction Disaster preparedness IASC Working Group requested at its 61st meeting in June 2005, to OCHA and UNISDR secretariat to consult with all IASC members on the most appropriate mechanisms by which the IASC can give effect to its obligations on the Hyogo Framework for Action follow-up taking into account existing IASC and other mechanisms dealing with preparedness issues, time and resources. Based on this request, UNISDR and OCHA developed a Disaster Preparedness for Effective Response - Guidance and Indicator Package for Implementing Priority Five of the Hyogo Framework, published in 2008. The tool provides strengthened guidance to facilitate the implementation of Priority Five of the Hyogo Framework for Action (HFA) and aims to assist governments, local authorities, and other stakeholders develop and measure preparedness for response capability at the international, regional, national and local level. Inter-Agency Contingency Planning Guidelines for Humanitarian Assistance were prepared by the IASC Reference Group on Contingency Planning and Preparedness in 2001 and updated in 2007 by the IASC Sub-Working Group on Preparedness and Contingency Planning. Guidelines were designed to provide a common inter-agency methodology for contingency planning and to ensure effective response to humanitarian needs at the onset of a crisis. The IASC Humanitarian Early Warning Service (HEWSweb) is an inter- agency partnership project aimed at establishing a common platform for humanitarian early warnings and forecasts for natural hazards. The service has been developed by WFP who is responsible for coordinating Roles, mandates and areas of work of key UN entities 143Disaster Risk Reduction in the United Nations and managing the overall information content, design, and organization of HEWSweb on behalf of the Inter-Agency Standing Committee and its members. Climate change The IASC Working Group at its 71st meeting in June 2008 requested IFRC with support from OCHA, WFP and IOM to convene a Task Force of relevant IASC organizations to lead the preparation of inputs to the UNFCCC process leading to the Copenhagen Conference (COP-15) in December 2009 and to provide guidance to the IASC on related issues. This informal IASC Task Force on Climate Change and UNISDR made a joint submission in November 2008 to the UNFCCC Ad hoc Working Group on Long Term Cooperative Action on Disaster Risk Reduction Strategies and Risk Management Practices: Critical Elements for Adaptation to Climate Change to highlight the disaster risk reduction and humanitarian implications of climate change to the UNFCCC Parties. The IASC with its Task Force on Climate Change organized a COP-14 Side Event on the Humanitarian Response to Climate Change: Early Warning - Early Action. Moreover, an informal group convened by IOM, in collaboration with UNHCR and the RSG on Human Rights of IDPs and other interested IASC organizations produced a working paper on Climate Change, Migration and Displacement: Who will be affected?, which was submitted to the UNFCCC. Early recovery As part of ongoing efforts to improve the timeliness and effectiveness of the humanitarian response, IASC has embarked upon an initiative to strengthen leadership and accountability in nine key \"clusters\" of the humanitarian response. Among these is the cluster for \"early recovery\" \u2014 a complex area that is critical in linking immediate responses to disasters with medium and long-term recovery efforts. UNDP was designated as the lead agency for this cluster. Working with 17 humanitarian and development partners, UNDP has identified critical gaps in early recovery and priority actions and resource requirements, in order to improve capacities and apply the cluster approach to crisis situations. IASC144 Roles, mandates and areas of work of key UN entitiesDisaster Risk Reduction in the United Nations Gender International humanitarian, human rights, and refugee law share a common goal in aiming to prevent and relieve suffering, and to protect the rights and freedoms of women, girls, boys and men. While there has been emphasis by the IASC on promoting gender equality in all aspects of its work, real-time evaluations conducted in 2005-2006 of the crises in Darfur, the Tsunami and Pakistan earthquake point to clear gaps in promoting gender equality. To address this gap, The IASC issued in 2006 The IASC Gender Handbook, Women, Girls, Boys and Men: Different Needs - Equal Opportunities which provides field-friendly guidance on how to deliver humanitarian protection and assistance based on the different needs, capacities and vulnerabilities of women, girls, boys and men. IASC policy statement on Gender Equality in Humanitarian Action was approved by the IASC Working Group in June 2008.

It is led by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Disaster Risk Reduction. In 2001, the GA, through resolution 56/195, expanded the mandate of the ISDR secretariat to serve as the focal point in the United Nations system for the coordination of disaster reduction and to ensure synergies among the disaster reduction activities of the United Nations system and regional organizations and activities in socio-economic and humanitarian fields. This was in response to a need to mainstream disaster risk reduction within the United Nations development agenda and other areas of work. UNISDR's mission is to be an effective coordinator and guide for all ISDR partners globally and regionally and to: Mobilize political and financial commitments to disaster risk reduction and Hyogo Framework for Action 2005-2015: Building the Resilience of Nations and Communities to Disasters (HFA); Develop and sustain a robust, multistakeholder system; Provide relevant knowledge and guidance. Core functions of UNISDR include: Inter-agency and stakeholder coordination for disaster risk reduction policy development, reporting, information sharing and support for national efforts, at regional and global level; Monitor the implementation of HFA and report on progress through core indicators, including through the biennial Global Assessment Report, organize regional platforms and manage the Global Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction; 152 Roles, mandates and areas of work of key UN entitiesDisaster Risk Reduction in the United Nations Coordinate preparation of policy guidelines for the HFA priority areas, in particular linking disaster risk reduction to climate change adaptation and mitigation; Conduct advocacy and awareness campaigns and media outreach; Provide information services and practical tools, such as virtual libraries, and assembling databases of good practices, country profiles, events calendar, and electronic workspaces; Promote national multi-sector coordination mechanisms for disaster risk reduction (national platforms) and advise UN Resident Coordinators and ISDR system partners. UNISDR administers the UN Trust Fund for Disaster Reduction and is partner to the World Bank in the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery. UNISDR headquarters is in Geneva, Switzerland, with a liaison office in New York. It has regional and sub-regional offices in Africa, Asia and the Pacific, the Americas and Europe and supports the thematic platforms on recovery (in Kobe) and early warning (in Bonn). ISDR mechanisms The International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (ISDR) is implemented by a system of partnerships with the overall objective to generate and support a global disaster risk reduction movement. Their work is underpined by the HFA, which is the overall framework for implementing disaster risk reduction endorsed by the World Conference on Disaster Reduction in 2004 and by UN General Assembly (A/RES/60/195). These partnerships comprise a broad range of actors, all of which have essential roles in supporting nations and communities to reduce risk. ISDR partners include Governments, inter-governmental and non-governmental organizations, international financial institutions, scientific and technical bodies and specialized networks as well as civil society and the private sector In addition to the secretariat outlined above, ISDR mechanisms include: The biennial Global Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction as the main global forum continued and concerted emphasis on disaster reduction. Open to all States and ISDR stakeholders, it serves primarily as a vehicle to assess progress made in the implementation of the HFA, enhance awareness of disaster risk reduction, share experiences and learn from good practice, and also identify remaining gaps and necessary actions to accelerate national and local implementation. Roles, mandates and areas of work of key UN entities 153Disaster Risk Reduction in the United Nations Regional platforms for disaster risk reduction, including ministerial meetings, led by regional inter-governmental organizations. Thematic platforms led by United Nations specialized agencies or technical institutions, provide knowledge products, and help to report on developments (for instance early warning, recovery, education, and risk identification, among others). Multistakeholder national platforms for disaster risk reduction are established by Member States to facilitate coordination across sectors. Several stakeholder groups and networks associated with ISDR - includes among others, a Scientific Technical Committee, Global NGO Network for DRR, Gender-and-Disasters and Media groupings and an emerging Parliamentarian Network. A United Nations Inter-Agency Group acts as a venue for improving coherence among the participating organizations, thus better supporting countries in their implementation of the HFA.
