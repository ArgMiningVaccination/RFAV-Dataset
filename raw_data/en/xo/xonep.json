What Are DNA Homeopathic Supplements: DNA molecules are central to the body's most core functions. As we age, our bodies can struggle to effectively produce and replicate DNA. Our diets, stress, toxins, and free radicals can cause serious harm to our cells. Telomeres\u2014the tips of our DNA strands that protect genetic information\u2014shorten and affect the cell's ability to replicate well. Fortunately, you can help your body restore this vital aspect of your well being with ProBLEN Telomere/DNA Homeopathic spray. This natural booster is a safe way to aid in the replication of DNA, protect your telomeres and restore the health of your cells. By supporting your cells you're giving all of your internal systems a boost. When you protect your telomeres, you're also protecting the vital genetic data stored inside your DNA. This important information allows your body to facilitate biological growth and cell repair, fight infection and disease, and aid the normal function of organs like the heart, gut, and brain. Use all natural ProBLEN Telomere/DNA booster and improve your cellular health. This formula also includes Omega 3, CA-98, and a full range of vitamins\u2014including B complex, Vitamin C, Vitamin D3, and Vitamin E to help you live young and age well, with no side effects. Benefits Of Telomere / DNA Homeopathic supplements: Boost Your Immunity Healthy DNA is a key to longevity and overall health. The immune system relies on the body's ability to generate new cells and transport information from one cell to another. Invaders like bacteria and viruses cannot be fought without a coordinated effort from the immune system. If cells can't properly communicate with each other, the body can't work together to fight illnesses. ProBLEN specially formulated Telomere/DNA booster helps keep your messengers healthy so your whole body stays healthy. Plus, this formula includes a mix of vitamins, Omega 3, and other ingredients to aid your immune system. Make You Look Younger The health of your hair, skin, and nails completely relies on your body's ability to heal and generate new cells. Since DNA and RNA are central to cellular repair and new cell growth, damage to your DNA will result in weak or brittle nails, dry, breakage-prone, thinning hair, and visible signs of aging in the skin such as fine lines and wrinkles. Researchers now believe that telomeres, found at the end of your DNA strands to protect your chromosomes, hold the key to longevity. ProBLEN Telomere/DNA booster helps your cells function properly so you can look your best. Regain Vitality When your cellular health is compromised, so is your vitality. Short telomeres lead to damaged DNA which can lead to decreased energy and greater susceptibility to illnesses. When your cells aren't functioning well, your sex hormones also experience a decline, leading to decreased sex drive and function. Regain your vitality by supporting cellular health with ProBLEN homeopathic Telomere/DNA remedy. Why DNA Matters: You're Only as Healthy as Your Cells Supporting DNA and RNA is vital for your cellular health and for your overall well-being. DNA\u2014the blueprint of who we are as organisms\u2014defines an endless list of things. It makes us human, contains information about our hair color, eye color, skin tone, allergies, and more. But DNA is much more than a simple blueprint \u2014 DNA, along with RNA, are nucleic acids that serve many important functions in the body. Effective cellular replication requires DNA and RNA to their jobs, perfectly. Our DNA helix unwinds and creates a carbon copy to facilitate cellular mitosis\u2014the process where one cell splits into two. At the same time, RNA aids in transcription, the part of this process where RNA reads the data on the DNA strands and, like a good messenger, confers that information to the cell's nucleus so it can construct and direct the function of proteins. At the end of each strand of DNA you find telomeres. The best way to think of these is like the caps on the end of your shoelaces. Telomeres protect the strands of DNA from sticking together. The longer they are, the healthier your DNA and cells are. As telomeres shorten, cells become less healthy and can stop replicating and die. Scientists now believe that telomeres could hold the key to longevity, cellular health, and even fighting disease. Long telomeres are being considered a predictor of health, while short telomeres are associated with diseases such as cancer. Cellular replication, including the replication of DNA, is why our human bodies are capable of healing themselves of almost anything. But, unfortunately, as we age, our body's DNA and RNA manufacturing process can suffer. Using ProBLEN specially formulated Telomeres/DNA blend can help you support your cells, preserve telomere length, and boost your health at a cellular level. Vital Immune System Support As the foundation of the immune system, DNA and RNA enable the correct identification of invaders to trigger immune functions. Imbalances force your immune system to work without this necessary information. This makes your body less effective at fighting off disease. Certain viruses specifically attack your DNA and RNA, compounding this problem. As you age, your cells can suffer the impact of oxidative stress. This can be caused by smoking, alcohol, infection, or inflammation. Even if you don't smoke or drink\u2014 diet (including genetically-modified foods), stress, injury, and environmental toxins can alter this information and wreak havoc on our health. Many people suffer from chronic inflammation and all this takes a toll on your cells. As we age our telomeres, which work to protect your DNA, can suffer and cause damage to the cell or cause it to die. Our ability to replicate healthy cells, especially as we face infection or disease, is a key to overall health. Because our DNA and RNA are responsible for everything from the normal function of vital organs (heart, brain, gut) to how your hair, skin, and nails look, looking and feeling healthy\u2014both inside and out\u2014depends on it! ProBLEN Telomeres/DNA booster spray helps support your cells, while you look and feel better! Look Like You Have Good Genes Signs of aging like sagging skin, weak nails, and dull, brittle hair may all be the result of Telomere/DNA imbalances. As the engineers of life, DNA and RNA are responsible for cell reproduction and regeneration. When your DNA & RNA are healthy, your skin, hair, and nails retain more of their youthful traits. ProBLEN Telomere/DNA blend includes ingredients to help you naturally support your DNA, RNA and telomeres. Plus, this new blend includes Omega 3 and a wide variety of vitamins\u2014including B complex, Vitamin C, Vitamin D3, and Vitamin E\u2014to give your health an even greater boost. Improving cellular health improves the smoothness of your skin, minimize the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles and get rid of acne. Bringing your hormones into balance can naturally restore shine and smoothness to your hair and strengthen your nails. Instead of spending thousands on expensive chemical-laden creams and serums that only treat the symptoms of your problem, use ProBLEN Telomere/DNA to restore your beauty from the inside, out. You may not be able to change your genes, but you can look like you've been blessed with good ones using ProBLEN Telomere/DNA booster. "}
