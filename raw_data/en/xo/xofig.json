Vaccination does not protect every individual patient even when they are properly Knowledge of immunology and vaccinology, including associated benefits and risks, and the pathobiology of infectious diseases, are necessary to implement an effective vaccination program. Topics Basis of protective immunity Veterinary vaccine U.S. regulations Properties of vaccine types Reasons for vaccine failure Adverse vaccine reactions Duration of immunity Vaccination in the presence of maternal antibody Vaccination to protect mucosal surfaces Vaccination for multifactorial diseases and the Basis for Protective Immunity for the Disease in Question Circulating Mechanisms Defensive Mechanisms Adherence to mucosa Mucosal antibody (IgA) Parasites TH2, antibody Intracytoplasmic growth Cytotoxic T cells Rapid virus replication Types 1 and 2 Interferons Intracellular growth Th1 cytokines Infect epithelial Immunity: Respiratory Virus Infection Pathogenic Mechanisms Defensive Mechanisms Adherence to mucosa Mucosal antibody (IgA) Parasites TH2, antibody Intracytoplasmic growth Cytotoxic T cells Rapid virus replication Types 1 and 2 Interferons Intracellular growth Th1 cytokines Infect epithelial to Viral Antigens External viral antigens may be highly variable to avoid antibody neutralization (especially RNA viruses) Non-structural proteins are often highly conserved because they must interact with cell machinery for replication oAntibody does not bind to them oThey are processed through the exogenous pathway and stimulate THcells oThey are processed through endogenous pathway and stimulate CD8 T cells (CTLs) oCTLs and TH cells can provide broad protection against some viruses that have antigenic variation in external proteins oKilled vaccines do not usually stimulate CD8 T cell "}
