Introduction All persons working and living in Municipally -operated Shelters (MOS) expect that the environment is one where risk of infection is minim al. Housekeeping services , of which cleaning and disinfection is a key component, reduce the risk of trans mission in every environment. MOS provide housekeeping services in a proactive and responsible manner to maintain a healthy and safe shelter environment. However, there are no national or provincial standards for the shelter system in Canada regarding the provision of consistent, effective and efficient housekeeping services. In preparing this housekeeping manual, Hostel Services reviewed resources and standards applicable to the health sector and adapt ed it to the shelter setting . While recognizing the unique characteristics of shelters including client density and age of facil ities, the manual provides a framework for achieving consistency in the provision of housekeeping services . The manual constitutes a primary resource regarding housekeeping standards and procedures across MOS. Its implementation will be guided by the philosophy of continuous learning and improvement. The expectation is that all employees will comply with the policies, procedures and practices in this manual to ensure a clean, healt hy and safe shelter environment at all times. 1.1 Purpose The manual provides guidelines regarding the provision of housekeeping services in MOS with the objective of ensuring a clean, safe and healthy environment for staff, clients and the public. It is also intended to help M OS meet requirements of the Occupational Health and Safety Ac t and the Toronto Shelter Standards . 1.2 Guiding Principles The guiding principles underpinning the development of the standards for cleaning and disinfection in MOS are: Health and safety considerations must be integral to the development of housekeeping policies and procedures. Customer service orientation is required to maintain a workplace where health and safety considerations permeate all levels of decision- making. Reducing potential exposure to risk and harm of all types is required to secure a safe, clean and healthy environment. Cleaning is a continuous event and must be carried out in accordance with relevant legislative requirements , policies and practices . Educati on and training is essential to ensur e that staff obtain required knowledge and skills they need to effectively di scharge their responsibilities . Outcome driven approach to housekeeping helps achieve effectiveness and efficiency in the delivery of services . Accountability must be linked to clear definition of roles , responsibilities and outcomes . Regular monitoring of housekeeping services is required to ensure quality assurance. 1.3 Application Everyone has a personal responsibility to identify issues of risks that affect their health and safety and that of others while in any MOS. The policies, procedures and practices set out in Hostel Services' Housekeeping Manual May 2016 Page 1 Section 1: this document are applicable to all employees of the City working in MOS . Where there is a conflict between this manual and any of the Shelter, Support and Housing Administration (SSHA) Division policies and corporate policies , the latter shall prevail. 1.4 Glossary of Terms Alcohol -based Hand Rub (ABHR): A liquid, gel or foam formulation of alcohol (e.g., ethanol, isopropanol) w hich is used to reduce the number of microorganisms on hands in clinical situations when the hands are not visibly soiled. ABHRs contain emollients to reduce skin irritation and are less time- consuming to use than washing with soap and water . Biomedical w aste: A waste containing or derived from one or more of (a) human anatomical waste, (b) human blood waste, (c) animal anatomical waste, (d) animal blood waste, (e) microbiology laboratory waste, (f) sharps waste, (h) cytotoxic waste and (g) waste that has come into contact with human blood waste that is infected or suspected of being infected with any infectious substance (human). Body substance: Fluids or tissues excreted or secreted directly from the body or indirectly in the form of a specimen. Body substances can be vectors for infectious diseases. Examples blood, sputum, urine and faeces. Cleaning: Purposeful and systematic activity involving physical remov al of foreign material s (e.g. soil) and organic material s (e.g. microorganisms) from an environm ent or a surface . Cleaning physically removes rather than kills microorganisms. It is accomplished with water, detergents and mechanical action. Client: Any person living in or accessing services provided by Municipally -Operated Shelters (MOS). Contamina tion: The presence of an infectious agent on hands or on a surface such as clothes, gloves, bedding, personal belongings, client care equipm ent or other inanimate objects. Disinfectant: A product that is used on surfaces or equipment which results in disi nfection of the surface or equipment. Disinfectants are applied only to inanimate objects. Some products combine a cleaning solution with a disinfectant . Disinfection : A process used on inanimate objects and surfaces to kill micro- organisms. Disinfection kills most dis ease- causing micro -organisms, but may not kill all bacterial spores. For any surface or object to be properly disinfected, thorough cleaning is required as organic material may inactivate a disinfectant. Hand Hygiene: A general term referrin g to any action of hand cleaning. It relates to the removal of visible soil and removal or killing of transient microorganisms from the hands. Hand hygiene may be accomplished using soap and running water or an Alcohol -based Hand Rub (ABHR). Infection: The entry and multiplication of an infectious agent in the tissues of the host. Infection Prevention and Control: Evidence- based practices and procedures that, when applied consistently can prevent or reduce the risk of infection. Hostel Services' Housekeeping Manual May 2016 Page 2 Section 1: Personal Protective Equi pment (PPE): Clothing or equipment worn by staff for protection against hazards. PPE prevents transmission of micro- organisms, serving as barriers. It can be used individually or in combination to protect mucous membranes, airways, skin and clothing from getting into contact with blood, body fluids, secretions, excretions, non- intact skin or mucous membranes. Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDSs): A document that contains information on the potential hazards (health, fire, reactivity and environmental) and how to work safely with a chemical product. It also contains information on the use, storage, handling and emergency procedures all related to the hazards of the material. MSDSs are prepared by the supplier or manufacturer of the material. Microorganisms: Very small organisms invisible to the naked eye. Include bacteria, viruses, and fungi. Some microorganisms can cause infections while others do not. Sharps: Any material that has the potential to cut or penetrate skin. Include needles, syringes and blades Staff: Bargaining unit employees of the City working in designated Municipally -operated shelters. Standards: Represent the minimum acceptable performance levels that will need to be maintained by all shelters. The standards aim to improve the quality of property services provision by ensuring that risks associated with cleaning and di sinfection are identified and managed in a responsible and timely manner with the view to preventing, reducing and avoiding contamination and spread of infections within s helters. Workplace Hazardous Materials Information System (WHMIS): The Workplace Hazardous Materials Information System (WHMIS) is Canada's national hazard communication standard. The key elements of the system are cautionary labelling of containers of WH MIS 'controlled products', the provision of Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDSs) and staff education and training programs. Hostel Services' Housekeeping Manual May 2016 Page 3 Section 2: 2. Occupational Health and Safety The City of Toronto is required by the Occupational Health and Safety Act and Workplace Insurance Act to take every precaution reasonable for the protection of City employees .

Hostel Services' Housekeeping Manual May 2016 Page 8 Section 3: 3. Infection Prevention and Control Reducing risk of transmission requires the consistent application of infection prevention and control (IPAC) principles and practices. Property services supervisors, their designate and staff shall be trained in infection preven tion and control to ensure they have the required knowledge and skills to safely undertake their assigned work . They must consistently apply the IPAC practices below in their day -to-day activities following recommended procedures (see Appendix 3). 3.1 Hand Hygiene Hand hygiene is the single most important practice for reducing the transmission of micro - organisms. All MOS employees must adhere to hand hygiene practices in all situations involving potential or direct contact with contaminated items and surfaces (see Appendix 3.1) . The situations include but are not limited to : After contact with client environments such as rooms, dormitories and washrooms. After moving from one program to another. After cleaning equipment and changing dust mops and mop heads. Immediately prior to and after removing gloves and other personal protective equipment . Before and after having contact with food. After personal body functions such as using the toilet , sneezing or blowing one's nose. Before and after smoking. After contact with any item or surface likely to be contaminated wi th blood and other body fluids. Property services supervisors are required to: Ensure continued access of their staff to adequate supplies of soap, disposable towels and Alcohol -based Hand Rub (ABHR). Provide appropriate training to staff on hand hygiene. 3.2 Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) PPE in this situation refers to a variety of barriers used alone or in combination to protect people's mucous membranes, airways, skin and clothing from getting into contact with blood and other body substances. PPE reduces likely transmission of micro- organisms in addition to protecting t he skin from all irritants used in cleaning and disinfecting surfaces, items and equipment (see Appendix 3.2) .

Hostel Services' Housekeeping Manual May 2016 Page 9 Section 3: Put on and remove appropriate PPE as per their training and manufacturer's instructions. Participate in mask fit -test as required. Notify their supervisor when supplies are low. 3.3 Staff Immunization Infection prevention and control has many aspects. Ensuring immunity to infections through immunization is an effective way of preventing infection. Property services supervisors, their designate and staff are responsible for consulting with their doctors to determine their susceptibilities to Vaccine Preventable Diseases (VPD) and updating their immunization records. The Canadian Immunization Guide (CIG) recommends that all adults be immuniz ed against the following: Diphtheria. Tetanus . Pertussis immunizations are recommended for persons who come into contact with settings where the potential for transmitting or acquiring influenza or other infectious diseases is high. Such persons are recommended to receive influenza vaccine, Hepatitis B vaccine and other immunizations as spec ified by the Toronto Shelter Standards and the CIG. Prop erty services supervisors are required to ensure: Property services s taff hav e access to information on VPD. Newly hired property services staff are provided with information on diseases such as TB, HIV, Hepatitis B and C as required by the Toronto Shelter Standards. 3.4 Safe Disposal of Sharps Sharps are devices capable of causing a cut or puncture wound and may cause harm if not disposed of properly. Examples of sharps include blades, needles and syringes including safety engineered needles. MOS will be r equired to ensure the protection of staff, client and the public from injury and infection from discarded sharps. Property services supervisors must: Educate staff about the risks associated with sharps. Make rigid, puncture -resistant sharps containers ac cessible. Train staff on safe recovery and disposal of sharps in puncture -resistant containers. Educate shelter staff and clients/residents on safe disposal of sharps. All property services staff must follow proper procedure for the collection and dispos al of sharps (see Appendix 3.3). Hostel Services' Housekeeping Manual May 2016 Page 10 Section 3: 3.5 Waste Disposal The City of Toronto is committed to reducing waste generated during cleaning and disinfection. MOS will be required to handle, store and dispose of waste properly and in accordance with the City's solid w aste bylaws . Property services supervisors are required to: Provide appropriate training to staff on waste collection and disposal. Engage staff in waste prevention and minimization. Provide containers with the capacity to withstand the weight of was te without tearing or breaking. Train staff to be able to identify and wear appropriate PPE. Conduct periodic review of waste management practices . Property service staff must: Collect and dispose of waste in accordance with City's waste management policies. Put on appropriate PPE when collecting and disposing of waste. Place sharps in puncture -resistant sharps containers. Perform hand hygiene immediately after disposing of waste. If a shelter provides healthcare and/or dietary services, p roperty services supervisors must develop joint protocols with the healthcare staff (e.g. n urse manager or nurse) and /or food services supervisor respectively to ensure effective and efficient management of waste generated by Healthcare Services and Dietary Services. 3.6 Biomedica l Waste MOS that generate biomedical waste shall handle such waste in a manner that does not impact on the health and safety of staff and clients . Biomedical waste should be segregated from all other wastes and immediately deposited into an appropri ate single use or reusable container (see Appendix 6). Biomedical waste should be stored in a secure location and transported by an authorized waste management company. The minimum standards for biomedical waste containers as per the Ontario Ministry of Environment guideline on the m anagement of biomedical w aste in Ontario are as follows: a. Single Use Biomedical Waste Containers (Non Sharps Waste) The container must be: Made up of an unlined rigid and leak proof plastic drum or pail or an outer cardboard container that can be sealed and is lined with a liner made of a leak proof plastic film that can be securely tied. Capable of withstanding the weight of the biomedical waste without tearing, cracking, crushing, breaking or otherwise allowing the accidental release or discharge of the waste. Colour coded and clearly labelled. b. Reusable Biomedical Waste Containers The container must be: Made of a puncture resistant and leak proof material that can be cleaned and disinfected prior to reuse. Hostel Services' Housekeeping Manual May 2016 Page 11 Section 3: Capable of withstanding the weight of the biomedical waste without tearing, cracking, crushing, breaking or otherwise allowing the accidental release or discharge of the waste. c. Single- Use Biomedical Waste Containers (Sharps Waste) A single -use sharps container should: Be made of rigid materials that are puncture resistant and leak resistant . Have a lid which cannot be removed after the container is sealed. d. Re-usable Biomedical Waste Containers (Sharps Waste) A reusable sharps container should: Be made of rigid materials that are punctu re resistant and leak resistant. Have a lid that is securely attached to the container that can be closed and locked when the container is full . Designed or intended by the manufacturer to be suitable for reprocessing and reuse. Property servic es supervisors are required to ensure that: Property services staff are trained in the safe collection and dispos al of biomedical waste . Biomedical waste containers are available and waste is p laced in appropriate containers by staff. Biomedical waste is transported in leak -proof containers using carts . Carts used to transport biomedical waste are cleaned on a regular basis. Property services staff (if appropriate) must: Receive training in safe handling of biomedical waste. Take necessary safety precaut ions including using appropriate PPE and performing hand hygiene. Remove waste safely to central holding areas at frequent intervals using carts. Store waste in a safe and secure location prior to being transported. Clean cart used to transport biomedi cal waste. Report any accidents including sharp injuries im mediately to their supervisors. Hostel Services' Housekeeping Manual May 2016 Page 12 Section 4: 4. Housekeeping Services Housekeeping services are an integral part of infection prevention and control. The delivery of housekeeping services will be driven by health and safety considerations and client needs. MOS shall provide effective and responsive housekeeping services to ensure a clean, safe and healthy environment is maintained. 4.1 Routine Cleaning and Disinfection Cleaning and disinfection reduces the num ber and amount of i nfectious agents and routes for transfer ring micro -organisms from one person or object to another. Routine cleaning in MOS involves a pre- determined frequency based on the risk of transmission. All other cleaning and disinfecting activit ies may be categorized as periodic such as cleaning of biological spill, during outbreak and after flood. 4.1.1 Risk Assessment Like any other setting, items and surfaces in shelters have the potential to harbour micro -organisms. MOS employees, clients and visitors with different levels of susceptibility to infection come into contact with contaminated items and surfaces every now and then. The level of risk of transmission of each individual to micro -organisms depends on the frequency of such contacts and their immunization status. All property services supervisors, their designate and staff shall assess their individual exposure to risk of transmission in relation to their assigned duties as basis for determining the appropriate preventive measures , including equipment , training and supplies required to address identified risk . MOS wil l be required to perform a detailed risk assessment to determine the cleaning frequencies for their routine cleaning service s. Property services supervisors or designates shall use the risk assessment framework in Table 1 below to assess and determine risk of transmission for their location. The assessment framework , adapted from the Provincial Infectious Disease Prevention Committee's (PIDAC) Best Practices for Environment al Cleaning for Prevention and Control of Infections in All Health Care Settings has been modified to reflect shelter conditions . Table 1: Risk Assessment Framework Probability of Contamination with Items and Surfaces Potential for Exposure High-touch surfaces (score = 3) Low-touch surfaces (score = 1) More susceptible clients , staff and visitors (score =1) Less susceptible clients , staff and visitors (score = 0) More susceptible clients , staff and visitors (score =1) Less susceptible clients , staff and visitors (score = 0) Heavy (score = 3) 7 6 5 4 Moderate (score = 2) 6 5 4 3 Light (score = 1) 5 4 3 2 Notes: 1. Probability of c ontamination of i tems and s urfaces Heavy: Areas, items and surfaces highly likely to be in direct contact with blood or other body fluids. Hostel Services' Housekeeping Manual May 2016 Page 13 Section 4: Moderate: Areas, items and surfaces less likely to be in direct contact with blood or other body fluids. Light: Areas, items and surfaces not likely to be in direct contact with blood or other body. 2. Frequency of c ontact with contaminated items and s urfaces High -touch surface : Include doorknobs, handrails, elevator buttons, telephones and light switches . Low-touch surface : Include walls, ceil ings, mirrors and window sills . 3. Susceptibility of c lients, staff and v isitors More susceptible: Clients, staff and visitors who are immunocompromised (e.g. people with chronic diseases, people with HIV infection, multiple antibiotic users and people with poor nutrition status). Less susceptible: Clients, staff and visitors who are immunocompetent (i .e. people with have normal immune system). As shown in Table 1, the highest level of risk of transmission (i.e. score of 7) is characterized by high- touch surfaces, heavy probability of contamination with items and surfaces, and more susceptible clients , staff and visitors. The lowest score of 2 is represented by low -touch surface, low probability of contamination with items and surfaces and clients, staff and visitors who are less susceptible. The risk assessment framework may also be used to assess ri sks for periodic cleaning services if it is considered necessary. 4.1.2 Cleaning Frequency Property services supervisors relying on their knowledge and experience will determine the risk level for a room or area by selecting a value for the probability of contamination (i.e. either 3, 2 or 1) and potential for exposure (i.e. either 3 for high- touch surfaces or 1 for low -touch surfaces and either 1 for more susceptible or 0 for less susceptible client s, staff and visitors) . The risk level is categorized as high, moderate or low depending on the overall score. Each level of risk of transmission has its corresponding cleaning frequency. I n Table 2 below, the recommended cleaning frequencies for each of the three risk levels are provided. Table 2: Cleaning Frequencies Risk Level Risk Score Cleaning Frequency High 7 Clean i mmediately or as soon as possible Clean at least twice every 24 hours Service and c lean additionally as required Moderate 4-6 Clean at least once every 24 hours Service and c lean additi onally as required Low 2-3 Clean according to a fixed schedule (i.e. cleaning frequencies extending beyond 24 hour interval) Service and c lean additionally as required An excel -based Assessment Tool ( see Appendix 1) has been developed as part of this manual to assist in determining cleaning frequencies All M OS will be required to use the Cleaning Frequency Assessment Tool to determine cleaning frequencies ( see User Guide in Appendix 2) in their respective locations . Hostel Services' Housekeeping Manual May 2016 Page 14 Section 4: Property services supervisors may s eek professional advice from outside of Hostel Services regarding the risk assessment and determination of cleaning frequencies with the permission of their shelter manager as needed. 4.2 Management of Biological Spills MOS must provide timely response and tools to contain and isolate biological spills.

Property services supervisors (or designate) must: Clearly define and assign responsibility for cl eaning spills. Provide access to PPE and supplies for staff. Ensure required training is provided to staff. Ensure proper disposal of waste. Document spill incident. Property services staff and other shelter staff assigned the responsibility for cleaning biological spills will be required to follow procedures for cleaning of biological spills (see Appendix 4.20). 4.3 Cleaning After Flooding In the event of flooding due to overflow from washing machine, dishwasher, toilet and sewer, the flood water should be assumed to be contaminated. The risk of mould should be assessed as it can potentially impact on the health and safety of staff and clients. Property services supervisors or designate are required to: Immediately assess and determine the risk of contamination. Provide direction to property services staff or designate regarding procedures to use. Ensure all areas, items, surfaces and equipment affected by the flood is properly cleaned and disinfected. Prepare and submit a report to shelter manager . Property services staff or designate must Assess risk of exposure to transmission . Take appropriate health and safety and infection preventive measures . Follow direction of proper ty service s supervisor or designate regarding procedure to use to clean affecte d areas, items and e quipment . Consult with the su pervisor or designate for clarification if required . 4.4 Cleaning During an Outbreak An outbreak occurs whenever there is an increase (e.g. in a shelter) in the number of people with a particular disease or infection above what would normally be expected. Outbreaks are declared by the Toronto Public Health and MOS shall comply with t heir directives and guidelines. As a preventive measure, MOS will be required to implement enhanced infection prevention and control measures to minimize the spread of micro -organism s causing the outbreak. Property services supervisors or designate are required to: Hostel Services' Housekeeping Manual May 2016 Page 15 Section 4: Monitor and a ssess exposure to risk of transmission by staff, clients and the public. Review cleaning frequencies t o reflect increased exposure to infection. Provide information to staff and clients on effective ways to respond to the outbreak. Reinforce hand hygiene practic es and the use of required PPE. Review with staff, infection prevention and control and outbreak management measures. Increase disinfection of items and surfaces including mattresses, beds, chai rs and all high-touch surfaces. Property services supervisors, their designate and staff will be required to perform hand hygiene and use PPE as required in addition to following directives from the Public Health and the Director of Hostel Services. 4.5 Linen and Laundry Services Soiled linen can be contaminated with pathogenic microorganisms if linens are not handled, transported and laundered properly. Linen and laundry services in shelters shall be done properl y to avoid cross -contamination. Property services supervisors or their designate are required to ensure: Staff involved in the collection, transport, sorting, and washing of linens are adequately trained. PPE is accessible to staff . Contaminated linens are handled with minimum agitation to avoid contamination of air, surfaces and persons. Linens are placed in strong and appropriate bags and securely tied or closed to prevent leakage. Linens are washed with only approved cleaning solutions. Soiled linens in bags are transported to the laundry processing area using carts or containers with lids. Clean linens are transported and stored in a manner that prevents contamination. Separate designated areas for storing clean linens and soiled linens are maintained. Property services staff and other shelter staff involved in laundr y services will be required to: Perform hand hygiene. Wear appropriate PPE. Clean hands whenever gloves are changed or removed. Look out for sharps when collecting and placing soiled linens in bags.

Develop and implement a m attress replacement plan. Frequent ly clean and disinfect rooms, equipment and surfaces. Provide l aundry services to clients as needed . Regular inspection of rooms and facilities by l icensed pest control operat ors. 4.8 Facility Maintenance Maintenance of shelter facilities is an important part of housekeeping services. It directly impacts on the quality of cleaning and disinfection service . As buildings and fixtures age or are frequently used, they become more difficult to clean and maintain in an acceptable condition. MOS must ensure that buildings, equipment and machinery are properly maintained. Property services supervisors are required to: Keep a maintenance log book where staff will log any damage to property and malfunctioning of any equipment , machinery or system defect s may be identif ied. Ensure routine maintenance is carried- out as scheduled. Ensure items, equipment and/or machinery are repaired or replaced as needed. Conduct formal inspections of bui lding and facilities and document their conditions. Property services staff must : Report any defect in equipment, machinery or damage to property to their supervisor or designate . 4.9 Housekeeping Procedures Procedures provide step by step guidelines on how to perform a given activity and ensure consistency in the delivery of services across shelter locations. MOS management shall provide their staff with adequate training o n housekeeping procedures, equipment and supplies they need to perform their duties safety. Property services supervisors must supervise staff to ensure they follow the procedures.

Quality Assurance Quality control measures are required to evaluate service standards , identify gaps and remedial actions required to maintain outcome expectations . To achieve continuous quality improvements in service delivery, the quality assurance process shall be guided by the following principles: a. Health and safety: Maintain a workplace where health and safety considerations permeate all levels of decision making. b. Service specification: Provid e a clear statement of scope of work , deliverables and accountability for outcomes , ensur ing that there is a common understanding of obligations among employees . c. Training and education: Implement a comprehensive training program that is relevant and enables employees to perform their work safely and responsibly. d. Customer service: Constantly engage staff and clients, solicit their input in planning of activities that affect their working and living environment. MOS will be required to maintain a mon itoring system that is sufficiently flexible and capable of providing timely feedback that helps identify potential risks and provides critical input for programming. 5.1 Monitoring Service Delivery Regular monitoring of the delivery of housekeeping serv ices helps identify gaps early , enabling employees to take the necessary action required to ensure expected outcomes on time . Property services supervisors and shelter managers (as needed) shall respond appropriately and in a timely manner to any deficienc ies regarding the deliver y housekeeping services . The monitoring process will involve: Risk a ssessment to ensure \"high -risk\" areas are monitored more frequently . Statement of roles and responsibilities of staff . Defining performance outcomes and measureme nt criteria. Scheduling cleaning activities and developing a checklist. Use of checklist to confirm performance of assigned tasks. Property services supervisors or designate are required to: Develop criteria for assessing cleaning tasks performed by staf f. Prepare an assessment schedule and checklist . Inspect and assess the activities of property services staff using a checklist . Provi de timely feedback to staff after assessing cleaning tasks. Provi de training to staff after observ ing deficiencies in service delivery . Involve clients in the assessment of cleanin g activities . Analyse monitoring results as input for planning. Document and share of best practices across shelters. If employees are unable to achieve the expected cleaning outcomes consistently, MOS managers shall request property services supervisors to submit a plan, outlining detailed actions and timeliness to address identified challenge(s). Hostel Services' Housekeeping Manual May 2016 Page 20 Section 5: 5.2 Evaluating Quality of Service Delivery Evaluation helps assess effectiveness, efficiency and sustainability of service delivery and can serve as a useful tool for recognizing staff performance, identifying staff training needs, improving existing training regimes and solicit ing client input for improved service delivery. Assessment of housekeeping serv ices in MOS will be carried -out using a combination of the following evaluation methods, dependin g on a shelter's circumstances. Table 4: Evaluation Methods Method Scope/Process Responsibility Self Assessment Involves the use of a checklist by p roperty services staff . Checklist covers specified procedures for a particular room/area. Cleaning staff confirms performing assigned task(s) following required proc edures and per instructions by signing off on completion . Cleaning staff Visual Assessment Prop erty services s upervisor or designate inspects and assesses task completed by staff as soon as staff signs off . Level of cleanliness assessed using the following criteria: 0 = Unacceptable (i.e. dirty - presence of dust, debris and soil) 1 = Accept able (i.e. clean - absence of dust, debris and soil) Total number of unacceptable scores is expressed as a percentage of the total possible number of acceptable scores. For example, if a room/area had a maximum of 10 components, and 8 were scored as acceptable, the overall percentage cleanliness will be calculated as 80%. The pass rate for visually clean items/surfaces will vary with the type of activity ta king place in an area. Cleaning rate of 90 -100% for all areas is recommended. Property services super visor or designate reviews scores with staff and signs off. If any deficiency is identified property services supervisor or designate provides required support to improve service outcome. Property services supervisor and shift leader Observation of Performance Property services staff observed by s upervisor to ensure adherence to policies, proc edures, practices and training instructions Property services supervisor or designate observes staff on a routine basis to ensure consistency and reproducibility of observations . Supervisor provides timely feedback to staff and retrains as needed . Property services supervisor, custodian and s hift leader Client Satisfaction Survey Involves m easur ing perceptions of clients about quality of cleaning services del ivered using: \"Yes\" = positive response \"'No\" = negative response Standardized deliveries of survey - e.g., collect data for the same two-week period each year from clients on the same floor and then compare percentage of positive responses to those of previous months/years. Note: Perceptions may not reflect the quality of services provided as it represents the views of a select group of clients. It however, constitutes a useful source of information and input for quality assurance Shelter manager, property services superv isor and staff, and client represent ative(s) Peer Review Periodic assessment of cleaning activities of a site by a team of Property services s upervisors from other sites.

The tool is expected to be used by property services supervisors (or designate). This tool was also created to be user friendly and simplify the assessment process. As a result, users enter information (e.g., steps 2, 3 and 4 below) using a series of drop- down boxes that include the most frequently occurrin g responses. The tool then automatically generates a recommendation for the user. However, any tool is only effective if the user knows how to use the tool. Users can more effectively use the assessment tool if they understand the risk factors that are being assessed; apply appropriate risk levels; and adhere to the steps outlined in the section on \"Procedure\" below . All users of this Assessment Tool must ensure they are properly trained in its use. Procedure Step 1: Identify room(s) / area(s) to be assessed a) List all rooms/areas to be assessed by floor and type of space. Step 2: Complete the G eneral information section of the assessment tool a) Complete shelter location information and the date of assessment. b) Review the instructions and defined terms that are listed. Step 3: Complete the location information section of the assessment tool a) Select the room/area to be assessed from the drop down box. b) Select the corresponding floor (i.e. where the room/ area to be cleaned is located). c) Select type of space. If responsibility for cleaning is shared, cleaning frequency for the selected room/area is automatically generated after selecting the type of space. Go to 3a to complete the list of rooms/areas in 1a. d) Enter comments or note if required. Step 4: Complete t he risk of exposure information section of the assessment tool a) Select the probability of contamination for the selected room or area. b) Select susceptibility of clients, staff and visitors. c) Select frequency of surface contact. Cleaning frequency for the selected room/area is automatically generated after completing step 4c d) Go to step 3a and repeat the process for each room/area listed in 1a. Step 5: Finalize cleaning frequency assessment a) Review cleaning frequencies with staff when all rooms/areas listed in 1a have been appropriately assessed. If the responsibility for cleaning is shared, review cleaning responsibilities and schedule with staff of appropriate departments. b) Revise assessment of cleaning frequency as needed after reviewing cleaning frequencies with staff. Hostel Services' Housekeeping Manual March 2013 Page 27 Appendices : c) Review cleaning frequencies with the p roperty services supervisors ' team. Revise the team's assessment of cleaning frequency as needed. d) Finalize and submits cleaning frequencies for the shelter manager's approval. e) File approved cleaning frequencies in accordance with their location's record keeping practices. Step 6: Update cleaning frequency assessment a) Review cleaning frequency assessment annually to determine whether update or revision is necessary. b) Update cleaning frequency as needed. c) Go to step 5c. Hostel Services' Housekeeping Manual March 2013 Page 28 Appendices : Appendix 3 : Sample Infection Prevention and Control Procedures 3.1 Hand Hygiene Purpose: To outline hand hygiene methods and techniques to be used in MOS. Application: Property services staff. Equipment: Hand washing sink; hand ABHR; hand towel Procedure: Tips: Always clean hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty . Perform hand hygiene using alcohol -based hand rub (ABHR) when hands are not visibly dirty. Make sure hands are dry before using ABHR. Wet hands will dilute the product. Remove soil before using an ABHR if hands are soiled and soap and water are not available. Steps a. Hand Washing Wet hands with warm water. Do not use hot water. Apply liquid or foam soap. Use of bar soap i s not recommended. Wash all surfaces of hands (front, back, thumbs, between fingers and under nails) for a minimum of 15 seconds. Thoroughly rinse soap from hands under running water using rubbing motion. Wipe and dry hands gently with a single- use paper t owel or forced- air dryer. Turn off taps (if required) with paper towel to avoid recontamination of hands. b. Using Alcohol -based Hand Rubs (ABHR) Apply between 1 to 2 full pumps of product or spray onto palm. Spread product over all surfaces of hands, concentrating on finger tips, between fingers, back of hands and base of thumbs.
