PART 2 - The Art of Healing with Herbal Medicine - Program Descriptions For more details of the full program - [SEE SYLLABUS HERE](https://www.opencenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Syllabus-TCM-Training-Part-2.pdf) **All sessions will be taking place online.** Saturday & Sunday, April 23 - 24, 2022 The Earth Element: The Digestive System in Chinese Medicine The spleen/pancreas, associated with the Earth element, is responsible for a variety of functions associated with digestion and the assimilation and transportation of foods, fluids and qi energy throughout the body. In this section, we'll cover herbal and dietary strategies for \"middle burner\" disharmonies such as weak digestion, acid reflux, chronic tiredness, food sensitivities, anemia, blood sugar and dampness imbalances and irregular bowel patterns. We'll also explore detoxification and mucus and microbes and how they can contribute to degenerative diseases. Saturday & Sunday, May 21 - 22, 2022 The Wood Element: The Liver System in Chinese Medicine The liver, associated with the wood element, stores blood and maintains the smooth flow of qi energy. The material covered will include: \"harmonization theory\" and common syndromes of the liver; symptoms of imbalances; formulas and diet strategies to address nervous system disorders, allergies, blood disorders, anger, depression, aggression, menstrual irregularities, learning disabilities, alcoholism and addiction; and the benefits and basics of a detoxification program. Saturday & Sunday, June 18 - 19, 2022 The Metal Element: The Respiratory System & Large Intestine \"The forces of Autumn create dryness in Heaven and metal on Earth; they create the lung organ and the skin upon the body...and the nose, and the white color, and the pungent flavor...the emotion grief, and the ability to make a weeping sound.\" - from an ancient classic text The lungs, associated with the metal element, control \"qi\" and take energy from the environment to feed the body. They control breath and assist the heart with the circulation of blood and energy. The breath regulates respiration, supports metabolism, and controls pulse. Topics covered will include: the \"Shan Hun Lun\" theory of cold-induced disorders; the theory of Febrile Diseases including \"fire toxins\" such as bacteria and viruses; the lungs in harmony and illness; inflammation; deficient lung qi; environmental allergies; bronchitis and asthma; the importance of breath; skin disorders; and formulas, herbs and diet strategies to heal respiratory imbalances. Saturday, July 23, 2022 The Tao of Sexology and Anti-aging & Spring Medicine Making Taoists have long regarded sex as natural and indispensable to human health and longevity, as vital to humans as water is to plants, and in fact, in the 5 Element system, sexual energy, related to the kidneys, is indeed regarded as related to the water element. In the Tao of Sexology, we will learn practices that permit us to cultivate this vital life force within ourselves for both balance and healing. Sunday, July 24, 2022 Pharmacy: The Elements of Herbal Medicine Making In this hands-on workshop, we will learn traditional herbal medicine-making, a holistic art involving time-honored methods developed over centuries combined with modern scientific refinements. The material covered will include: techniques for extracting the healing constituencies of plants in different menstruums (solvents); how to do an herb press; how to prepare herbal infusions and decoctions; and how to make capsules, pills, poultices and healing salves for external application. We will explore many resources and gain hands-on experience in making our own herbal remedies. Saturday & Sunday, August 20 - 21, 2022 The Water Element: The Kidney System in Chinese Medicine The Chinese medical concept of the \"kidneys\" is far broader than in Western physiology. Associated with the water element, the kidney system is viewed as the \"root of life\" and main storehouse of \"qi\" energy and includes the bones, marrow, hair, ears, and adrenal glands. In this segment, we'll cover common syndromes and imbalances of the kidney system: adrenal malfunction, bone problems, ear and bladder infections, hormonal and reproductive imbalances, premature aging, excessive fear, insecurity and poor growth and development. We'll also delve into the use of tonic herbs for healthy aging, increasing energy and managing chronic illness. Saturday & Sunday, September 17 - 18, 2022 The Fire Element: The Heart System in Chinese Medicine Calming the Mind and Balancing the Spirit The heart, associated with the fire element, governs the blood vessels, promotes the smooth circulation of blood throughout the body, and also houses the Spirit. The heart relies on other organs for its nourishment and energy, so the great majority of heart problems are caused by imbalances in other organ systems. Symptoms of heart-mind imbalances include loss of memory, poor circulation, confused speech, mental depression, anxiety and heart disease. Besides studying these heart-related ailments, we'll also examine blood disorders that affect the heart and the dietary and herbal strategies that can help address those imbalances. Saturday, October 15, 2022 The Tao of Success Advanced - How to Build A Successful Practice - Part II / Clinic Rounds: CASE STUDIES AND STUDENT CLINIC In this next to the last session, we'll practice applying what we've learned about Five Element Theory in hands-on application to specific case studies. We'll practice under supervision to refine our skills in Chinese medical diagnostics/assessing health conditions, case taking and making practical herbal recommendations. There will be a small group discussion of each case study. We will also receive resources and opportunities for continued studies. Sunday, October 16, 2022 GRADUATION QIGONG & T'ai Chi: Connecting with our Inner Healer Some internal martial arts and qigong systems coordinate slow movements with deep breathing and promote health by moving and strengthening the \"qi\" energy of the whole body, mind, and spirit. With practice, one understands the innate healing energy that exists within each of us. Qigong is recognized for helping to heal a wide variety of chronic health conditions by increasing strength, flexibility, balance, circulation, concentration and relaxation.
