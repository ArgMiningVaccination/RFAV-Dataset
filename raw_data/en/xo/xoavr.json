Contractual agreements with Chippewa Springs distributors inhibited distribution expansion and volume growth. While natural spring water is used for both brands - Premium Waters identified the source for Nature's Crystal as the La Fayette Spring, in La Fayette Township Wisconsin. The move gave Premium Waters dual entry into the water market. Nature's Crystal \u2014 which is available in spring, distilled, fluoridated and drinking water \u2014 has been used for multi-channel distribution.
