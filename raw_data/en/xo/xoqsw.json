Only once all of these have been satisfied is it possible to arrive at a state Maslow referred to as \" self-actualization \". In 1986, WHO refined its definition of \" health \" as not just an absence of disease or infirmity, but as a \" resource for every- day life, not the objective of living. Health is a positive concept emphasizing social and personal resources, as well as physi- cal capacities \". Live longer. Live better. Health is not simply a matter of meeting basic needs. It can be said that ISO has excelled at providing solutions to meet a great many basic global needs over the years, by delivering an array of International Standards that address some of the world's most basic safety, health, performance and security needs. But does ISO have a role to play in helping to satisfy these soft, higher-level expectations, pushing the envelope to include higher aspirations ? The answer is \" Yes \". This issue of ISO Focus+ reveals how a number of important (and yet not-so- obvious) projects and ideas have a part to play in helping us to satisfy needs ema-nating from issues related to self-esteem, independence and fulfillment. Aromatherapy, for example, is used to enhance psychological and physical well- being. It provides a potentially effective treatment using natural oils extracted from flowers, bark, stems, leaves, roots or other parts of a plant.The psychologist Abraham Maslow described a so-called \" hierar- chy of needs \" pyramid. The lower part of the pyramid includes basic needs such as safety, security and shelter. The top sections describe higher-order needs related to responsibility, achievement, and re-spect by and for others. moments of relaxation are safe, secure and relevant to your wellness needs. Finally, although it's not (yet) an ISO standard, the Gross National Happiness (GNP) index developed by the Kingdom of Bhutan is inspired and ambitious. The index leapfrogs traditional linear indicators of national performance - such as Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The index shows us how a proper balance between material and spiritual wealth is necessary, and can be measured. So will reading a technical ISO standard guarantee you happiness, fulfillment, sound physical and mental health ? No - although some may help you fall asleep and get needed rest ! But reading this ISO Focus+ issue will show you how certain standards and pro- jects play their part in helping us realize higher-level needs on our own paths to \" self-actualization \". Kevin McKinley, ISO Deputy Secretary-GeneralISO has excelled at providing solutions to meet basic global needs.The rising interest in aromatherapy and the use of essential oils translates into increased global attention to the quality, safety and consistency of these products. ISO standards can help provide the confidence needed so that these aspects are taken into consideration, and the potential for their beneficial effects can be achieved, without unnecessary worry.Healthy minds and bodies How ISO standards serve higher-level growth needs Without a doubt, cosmetics contrib- ute positively to people's perception of themselves, directly affecting issues of self-esteem. ISO standards from technical committee ISO/TC 217, Cosmetics, help to ensure that the cosmetics consumers choose are both safe to use and deliver on their promises. Assistive devices can provide a disabled person needed independence that all indi-viduals desire, and have a right to. ISO standards help ensure that these products are safe, effective and durable, helping to reduce disabled individuals' reliance on others to perform everyday activities. The ability to relax, to reflect and to gain perspective is also associated with the realization of high-order needs. A new ISO project on wellness spas can help ensure that service offerings in these important ISO Focus + July-August 2012 1 aInternational Organization for StandardizationDOPLAN CHECKACT The Kids' ISO 14000 Programme DO PLAN CHECK CHECK ACT The Kids' The Kids' The Kids' The Kids' The Kids' The Kids' The Kids' ISO 14000 Programme ISO 14000 Programme ISO 14000 Programme ISO 14000 Programme ISO 14000 Programme ISO 14000 Programme ISO 14000 Programme Sustainable events with Sustainable events with Sustainable events with Sustainable events with Sustainable events with Sustainable events with Sustainable events with Sustainable events with Sustainable events with Sustainable events with Sustainable events with Sustainable events with Sustainable events with ISO 20121 Sustainable events with Sustainable events with Sustainable events with Sustainable events with Sustainable events with Sustainable events with Sustainable events with Sustainable events with Sustainable events with Sustainable events with Sustainable events with Sustainable events with Sustainable events with Sustainable events with Sustainable events with Sustainable events with Sustainable events with Sustainable events with Sustainable events with Sustainable events with Sustainable events with Sustainable events with Sustainable events with Sustainable events with Sustainable events with ISO 20121 Sustainable events with Sustainable events with Sustainable events with Sustainable events with ISO 20121 Sustainable events with Sustainable events with Sustainable events with Sustainable events with Sustainable events with Sustainable events with ISO 20121 Sustainable events with Sustainable events with Sustainable events with Sustainable events with Sustainable events with Sustainable events with Sustainable events with Sustainable events with Sustainable events with Sustainable events with ISO 20121 Sustainable events with ISO 20121 Sustainable events with Sustainable events with ISO 20121 Sustainable events with ISO 20121 ISO 20121 ISO 20121 Sustainable events with Sustainable events with Sustainable events with Sustainable events with Sustainable events with Sustainable events with Sustainable events with Sustainable events with Sustainable events with Sustainable events with Sustainable events with Sustainable events with Sustainable events with Sustainable events with Sustainable events with ISO 20121 Sustainable events with Sustainable events with ISO 20121 Sustainable events with Sustainable events with ISO 20121Sustainable events with Sustainable events with Sustainable events with Sustainable events with ISO 20121Sustainable events with Sustainable events with Sustainable events with Sustainable events with Sustainable events with Sustainable events with ISO 20121 Sustainable events with Sustainable events with Sustainable events with Sustainable events with Sustainable events with Sustainable events with ISO 20121 Sustainable events with Sustainable events with Sustainable events with Sustainable events with Sustainable events with Sustainable events with ISO 20121 Sustainable events with Sustainable events with Sustainable events with Sustainable events with ISO 20121 World Scene Guest Interview Paul Bulcke Nestl\u00e9 Paul Bulcke has been Chief Ex- ecutive Officer of Nestl\u00e9 S.A., since April 2008. After a brief period as a finan- cial analyst with Scott Graphics International in Belgium, Paul Bulcke joined the Nestl\u00e9 Group in Vevey, Switzerland as a mar-keting trainee in 1979. Over the next 16 years, he held various positions in marketing and sales, was appointed Division Head in Peru, Ecuador and Chile, before moving to Portugal as Market Head, a position he subse-quently held in the Czech and Slovak Republics and finally in Germany. In July 2004, Paul Bulcke joined the Nestl\u00e9 Executive Board as Executive Vice Presi-dent with responsibility for Zone Americas. In April 2008, after a career of almost 30 years with the Nestl\u00e9 group, Paul Bulcke was appointed Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Bulcke graduated from the University of Leuven (Belgium) with a degree in commercial engineering, followed by a postgraduate degree from the Vlerick Management School. He also attended the programme for Executive Development at the International Institute for Man-agement Development (IMD) in Lausanne, Switzerland.Eco-Kids' Instructors for Kids' ISO 14000 Programme A training course for Eco-Kids' Instructors will be held on 1-3 August 2012 at UNESCO headquarters in Paris, France, within the framework of the United Nations Decade of Education for Sustainable Development (UN- DESD 2005-2014). This 10th International Seminar and Training Course for Eco-Kids' Instructors of Environmental Education for Sustainable Development is organized by ArTech and UNESCO. The course is based on the celebrated Kids' ISO 14000 programme started by ArTech (founded by the late Prof. Takaya Kawabe and Ms. Miyuki Koyama). Kids' ISO 14000's sphere of influence has now expanded inter-nationally through UN organizations. The programme will start with a one-day seminar and then embark on a two-day train - ing course and workshops concentrating on stimulating the environmental awareness of children, teaching simplified methodology of environmental management and giving children the concept and experience of working together and networking locally and internationally to solve current local and global environmental issues. This event will be supported by ISO and the United Nations Environment Programme, in addition to UN-DESD. Several Japanese government ministries will participate along with some of Japan's most prominent private sector corporations providing sponsorship.groundbreaking, pragmatic solution to coun-tering global warming through its proposal to fund business grants to favour the implementa- tion of ISO 50001:2011, Energy management systems - Requirements with guidance for use . To strengthen and expand Canada's com- mitment to energy efficiency, the Canadian Government, through Natural Resources Canada (NRCan), is offering business fund-ing grants to provide financial assistance for the industrial sector. The Government will give industry the finances necessary (and a financial incentive) to adopt systems and processes to improve energy performance. This grant funding is designed to lead to reductions in energy costs, greenhouse gas emissions. The aim is to lessen the negative aspects of environmental impact through the implementation of ISO 50001. Two types of energy studies (process integration and computational fluid dynam- ics) are, in particular, being funded. The \" ecoENERGY Efficiency for Industry Pro- gram \" provides a financial incentive of up to 50 % of eligible costs for implementation of ISO 50001. The ecoENERGY pilot is designed for industrial facilities. Certain qualifying criteria must be met for applicants to be admitted to the programme. Among the criteria for selection, applicants must submit an energy performance improve- ment plan, addressing targets and associated projects, and have the ability to monitor and report on project results.countries, e-Health is most often carried out using mobile phones (m-Health). However, very important security issues have arisen in connection with m-Health (problems with patient security). Christopher Chute, Chair of ISO technical committee ISO/TC 215, Health informatics, pointed out the importance of sharing experi- ence gained from partner standards organiza- tions, and the need to identify the barriers to the broad adoption of successful initiatives. It is essential to determine why standards are not used and applied in certain settings. International Standards developed by ISO/TC 215 contribute to the efficiency and dissemination of medical technologies and are a key element for getting access to global markets. More importantly, however, the spirit of the committee to serve all stakeholders worldwide - industry, the business community, governments and other international organiza - tions, users, including consumers - leads to synergies and innovation in its work. Danish sustainable Presidency Denmark wished to conduct the EU Presi- dency as sustainably as possible. This took place by reducing the direct environmental impact of meeting activities by simultaneously displaying social and economic responsibility. At the end of its six-month term in June 2012, the Danish Foreign Ministry logistics team supported the organization of 100 meet- ings serving 15 000 total participants. The implementation of ISO 20121 for sustain- able events management played a key role in these events. The logistics team delivered an EU Presi- dency at a fraction of the total cost of past Presidencies. The savings were an important result of the sustainable event management system. One of the important objectives of the sustainability initiative was to demonstrate that a large-scale project such as the EU Presidency could be organized sustainably without any additional costs. It is hoped that the experience and initiatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, together with ISO 20121, will serve as an inspiration for others. Workshop on e-Health ISO took part in a workshop organized by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and the World Health Organization (WHO) on the use and implementation of e-Health standards in low-, middle- and high- income countries, in April 2012. Worldwide, health services and systems must improve the quality, safety and cost- effectiveness of care. E-Health is already making a valuable contribution. As e-Health continues to increase its influence, it must integrate legacy systems with medical devices and information systems. E-Health will also need to provide a foundation for stakeholders to innovate, as it will only reach its potential if based on global, common and interoperable standards. WHO has produced a survey \" e-Health Standards and Interoperability \" of all its member bodies. In low- and middle-income Greening the Great North Canada is talking ISO's talk while walking the planet 's walk when it comes to studying and promoting the efficient use of energy.

How does Nestl\u00e9 manage to maintain a worldwide consumer base when traditions and tastes vary from one country to the next ? What is the key ingredient to its success ? How have International Standards contributed ? Paul Bulcke:\u0003 How can Nestl\u00e9 be so active worldwide and connect with consumers in a meaningful way ? Actually, the answer is that we are very decentralized, because we believe consumers and food are always \" local \". Very much from the beginning, over 145 years ago, we commercialized our products outside of our home market Switzerland. So, right from the start, we were decentralized and present in many markets with local structures. We are a global company, but one that is very con- nected on a local level to our consumers. Our great variety of products are manu- factured in 461 factories in 83 countries around the world. Our factories are located there where consumption is. Local raw materials, local tastes, the dietary needs of the local population demand it. Handing over real decision-making power to the markets demands alignment behind a common vision. We have a very strong, explicit corporate objective and strategic roadmap which is very simple, straightfor- ward, and shared with the 330 000 employees that make up Nestl\u00e9. Our strategic ambition is to be the pre-eminent nutrition, health and wellness company. Then, the long term has always dictated our strategic direction. Yes, we do also focus on delivering short term, but never sacrifice the long term. And finally, a very important aspect is our corporate culture, our people living up to the same values such as thinking long term, openness to diversity, passion for quality in products and relations. This is how we run our business and this is the basis of our success : facilitating decentralization while ensuring everybody is singing from the same song sheet. We maintain our internal alignment behind a global corporate vision. On the subject of International Standards, a global company like ours has a common strategic objective. Just as we have to have common values and a common culture, we need common standards as well. International Standards provide a frame- work for the world. Tastes may differ, but health requirements and minimum standards are the same the world over. International Standards, therefore, help to shape our company so that we can be a global player with globally recognized terms of reference. But they serve only to frame our work, the \" paintings \" inside those frames are locally made.ISO has a specific role to play as a truly global, multi-stakeholder, expert-driven, consensus-based standardization organiza - tion : it enables us to work efficiently. If that were not the case, if the interpretation of certain dimensions were really local and not relevant and not the same, we would be totally inefficient as a society and as a company in that society. ISO Focus+ :\u0003 What is the strategic value of International Standards to a company like Nestl\u00e9, with an international workforce of 330 000 people ? ISO has developed 1 000 food-related standards. How many does Nestl\u00e9 implement and what are the benefits? Paul Bulcke:\u0003 One of our basic strengths is that we have deep-rooted principles which put value on compliance. I could hardly steer a company like ours if I could not trust our people to comply with our own values, culture and strategic direction. Beyond our internal functioning, they also need to meet the demands coming from the outside world. International Standards help me to apply, throughout the company, the same dimen- sion of judgment and the same terms of reference. In turn, this helps me scale up efforts to comply with these standards. If I have a standard that is the same the world over, I can muster the resources to achieve or, whenever relevant, surpass the require- ments of those standards. As for ISO's 1 000 food-related standards, we are a food and beverage company so those are the minimum with which we comply. But we comply as an operation, as a part of society, with many other standards, too. We also provide services and operate factories where we apply standards on health and safety. We are committed to environmentally sustainable business practices, so we also comply with environmental standards. And these are just some examples. There are many standards beyond those concerned with food that are important for us. Because ISO's impact goes beyond product criteria to best practices in factories, and even to our environmental performance, these standards are part of an overarching reference framework. ISO Focus+ :\u0003 Can you describe the use made by Nestl\u00e9 of ISO's management systems standards ISO 9001 for quality and ISO 14001 for environmental management and how this has evolved over the years ?Paul Bulcke:\u0003 We pride ourselves on being part of an industry that works with ISO to shape standards, putting at your disposal our knowledge, our expertise. ISO has sup- ported our industry through the publication of internationally consistent measurement and management tools, processes and practices. The extent of your involvement has led to the achievement of improved environmental performance. In other words, ISO helps us work towards our goal, and we encourage the development and use of relevant International Standards. ISO's global authority is useful for us. For example, building on the Nestl\u00e9 Environmental Management System, we have 413 out of our 461 factories which are already certified to ISO 14001. We have distribution centres, R&D centres, all undergoing certification. That is the value ISO gives us : by being a global standard, globally accepted, when we comply with ISO International Standards, people know straight away what they are getting and the level at which we are working. ISO Focus+ :\u0003 Whatconcrete benefitshas ISO 22000 for food safety management brought Nestl\u00e9 ? Paul Bulcke:\u0003 Food safety is essential. Since the adoption of ISO 22000:2005, Food safety management systems Requirements for any organization in the food chain, we were able to measure our own very stringent standards against those stipulated by ISO. We are again using as our terms of ref- erence a globally accepted standard. This is the best way to get recognition for our own systems for assessing the safety of food. Issues of food safety are not purely intramural. They lead us upstream to our suppliers and downstream to retailers. We pride ourselves on being part of an industry that works with ISO to shape standards. Nestl\u00e9 Pontecesures factory in Spain. From left to right , A.

ISO Focus+ :\u0003 Nestl\u00e9 recently opened Nestl\u00e9 Health Science and the Nestl\u00e9 Institute of Health Sciences, two separate organizations intended to develop the innovative area of personalized health science and nutrition to prevent and treat health conditions such as diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular disease and Alzheimer's disease. Could you please expand on this ? Are there subjects for which standards could facilitate your work and, if so, in which areas ? Paul Bulcke:\u0003 Nestl\u00e9 Health Science and Nestl\u00e9 Institute of Health Sciences were launched at the beginning of last year. This brings a new dimension to the nutrition, health and wellness strategy of the Nestl\u00e9 Group by pioneering the development and application of evolving science to create a new role for personalized nutrition in disease prevention and management. additional standards as we are trying to embrace several disciplines - like diagnos- tics, nutritional management and therapy - and add them into the mix. ISO Focus+ :\u0003 What is the business case for investing in socially responsible actions thatmaynotbeimmediately beneficial to the bottom line in a competitive market ? How could ISO 26000 on social responsi- bility contribute to the company's already well-established CSR Paul Bulcke:\u0003 Like I said, Nestl\u00e9's orienta- tion is long term. We would not do anything for a short-term advantage which might jeopardize our long-term interests. This reflects how we see our role : evolving with About Nestl\u00e9 Nestl\u00e9 can trace its origins back to 1866, when the first European condensed milk factory was opened in Cham, Switzerland, by the Anglo-Swiss Condensed Milk Company. One year later, Henri Nestl\u00e9, a trained pharmacist, launched one of the world's first prepared infant cereals \" Farine lact\u00e9e \" in Vevey, Switzerland. The two companies merged in 1905 to become the Nestl\u00e9 we know today, with headquarters still based in the Swiss town of Vevey. Nestl\u00e9 employs around 330 000 people and have factories or operations in almost every country in the world. Nestl\u00e9's sales for 2011 were almost 83.7 billion swiss francs. Nestl\u00e9 headquarters, Vevey, Switzerland. Photo : Nestl\u00e9society, safeguarding our relationship with the communities in which we work, because we intend to continue to be a part of those communities. This is why we have linked the concept of corporate social responsibil - ity with our basic activities. Our success must be linked, not only to the creation of value for our shareholder, but also to the creation of value for society. This is what we call \" creating shared value \". It is factored into every step in our value chain, interactions with suppliers, customers and consumers, the business impact on the environment of our products. We also work to create value for society at large. This has many expressions : healthy, sustainable economic activity creates jobs. It also creates opportunities for training and Yan Reach, client farmer of International Development Enterprises (IDE), winner of the Nestl\u00e9 Creating Shared Value Prize.

Linking with suppliers in a sustainable way helps us to implement minimum standards upstream as well.Photo : Nestl\u00e9Life cycle assessment - Water footprint - Requirements and guidelines. Our third focus is on rural development. Nestl\u00e9's 461 factories are usually located in rural areas because that is where the raw materials of agriculture are found. We are directly linked to 600 000 farmers, and indirectly linked to millions. Connecting with farmers helps them to be more efficient, have better incomes and helps us to ensure the high quality of our ingredients. Getting back to ISO, using internationally recognized standards such as ISO 26000 gives us the added authority of a globally recognized body, provided it can be certified. We have been in contact with ISO on this topic and will be happy to make further contributions. ISO Focus+ :\u0003 What would you like to see coming out of ISO ? Paul Bulcke:\u0003 As an international company, we are facing many different evaluation practices, be it of company or of product performance. To eliminate the different yardsticks and the resulting unnecessary administrative burden, a worldwide author- ity facilitating alignment among rating agencies and evaluation methodologies, would reduce the time lost and volatility involved in juggling different standards. Standardization of standards is not a bad thing ! Alignment between ISO stand- ards, for instance between ISO 9001 and ISO 14001, possibly merging them into an integrated management system - along with occupational health and safety - would be a step forward. Like Pascal Lamy, Director-General of the World Trade Organization (WTO), Nestl\u00e9 actively defends the free move - ment of goods and the suppression of trade barriers, particularly when standards and regulations are politically motivated and counterproductive for delivering the best value at the lowest cost to consumers. The technical authority of ISO is impor- tant because it is neutral and objective in a society that is subject to so many influ-ences. ISO helps us build bridges. Pascal Lamy is very vocal in his support for ISO and for opening up the world to increased acceptance of global standards. ISO Focus+ :\u0003 May I ask an additional question ? What's your favourite Nestl\u00e9 product ? Paul Bulcke:\u0003 That is like asking a parent which child is their favourite ! I normally do not answer, but sitting in front of me, on my desk, is my Nescaf\u00e9 so that is definitely one of them. But there are so many other Nestl\u00e9 products that I love. Photo : Nestl\u00e9 Photo : Nestl\u00e9 Nestl\u00e9 scientists at work. Photo : Nestl\u00e9International Standards provide a framework for the world. Nestl\u00e9 has focused on three priority areas where we add value to society. Nutrition is first, because that is who we are and where our investment in research and development goes. Our second focus is on water. Water is one of the most important issues in the world today, and it is particularly important for Nestl\u00e9. We are using agricultural raw materials and agriculture uses up 70 % of the world's freshwater supply. We use water in our processes, in our factories. Consumers need water to prepare our products. It is a conditioning factor for the future of the planet. We are, therefore, very supportive of the ongoing work towards the defini- tion of the future ISO 14046 standard on ISO helps us build bridges. Nestl\u00e9 Health Science is going to inte- grate science and knowledge coming from different disciplines, some of which are quite new to us. We are learning a lot here. In many of these areas, there are already some standards. Nutrition is increasingly more sophis- ticated in how it is defined and how it is perceived. Personalization is based on a deeper understanding of people's genetic make-up, as well as how genes affect diet and lifestyle factors.

This implies that they need to feel better as they age, and that illness will be prevented as much as possible. At a meeting convened by the Gov- ernment of Bhutan on, \" Happiness and Well-being : Defining a New Economic Paradigm \", UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon stressed that sustainable devel- opment is intricately linked to happiness and well-being. While the content of the majority of ISO standards is technical, their imple- mentation goes beyond solving technical problems to delivering positive results in all three pillars of sustainable development - economic, environmental and social. And since ISO standards contribute to sustainable development, they are also indirectly responsible for creating hap- piness and well-being. In an exclusive interview in this ISO Focus+ issue, Paul Bulcke, Chief Execu- tive Officer of Nestl\u00e9, says, \" International Standards provide a framework for the world.\" And a framework they are, not only for Nestl\u00e9, but for all companies, countries and people around the world with whom we share this planet. Elizabeth Gasiorowski-Denis is Editor in Chief, ISO Focus+.And here's where the health and well- ness industry comes into the equation, as it caters to the need and desire of people to stay in shape and live up to the old adage that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. As explained by Paul Zane Pilzer, economist and author of, The New Well- ness Revolution : How to Make a Fortune in the Next Trillion Dollar Industry, the wellness industry includes products and services provided proactively to already healthy people to make them feel even healthier and look even better, to slow the effects of aging and to prevent diseases from developing in the first place. With the rapid progression in public interest in wellness, the growth potential of the health and wellness industry is indeed very high. One only needs to look at the recent committees created, or standards work undertaken by ISO, to confirm this. The July/August 2012 issue of ISO Focus+ explores key issues arising from the health and wellness trend. A portfolio of articles highlight the progress and use- fulness of ISO standards aimed at ensuring quality and safety in this growth industry. ISO Focus + July-August 2012 ISO Focus + July-August 2012 8 9 aSpecial ReportInternational Standards have improved the health and well-being of millions, and even billions, of people.Changing the face of cosmetics by John L. James Cosmetics have long been an important part of daily life. Imagine a world without soap, toothpaste, hair products, deodorants or decora-tive cosmetics. They are essential for hygiene and self-esteem, and they support personal image. The availability of cosmetics has even been shown to improve the behaviour of prison inmates. Best practice Manufacturers are in favour of necessary regulation, so long as rules are sensible and do not restrict innovation or market opportunities. This is why the \" best practice \" route, through the adoption and implementation of ISO standards, is always the preferred way. Developing globally acceptable stand- ards might have proved difficult. This has not been the case, however, due to sound reasoning and careful, clear justification. Cosmetics-related standards aim to : Harmonize technical rulesWe regularly use about four products a day. Globally the USD 130 billion a year cosmetics market is split roughly into 40 % Europe, 30 % Asia and 30 % USA, with Africa becoming increasingly important. While there are a significant number of multinational cosmetic companies, there are also thousands of smaller businesses manufacturing and supplying many indi- vidual products for consumers. The market is highly competitive and product formulation and manufacture are usually closely guarded secrets. Cosmetics manufacturers justifiably pride themselves on high-quality products that meet the needs of their customers. Improve health and safety Boost environmental protection Enhance product quality Reduce costs Create a level playing field, making the global market accessible to all types of business There has been great enthusiasm for, and effort by, the cosmetics industry to address these issues, especially through its active support of ISO technical committee ISO/TC 217, Cosmetics. ISO/TC 217 has achieved much, par- ticularly for consumers worldwide and the industry's smaller, less well-resourced companies. International Standards in areas such as sun protection have improved the health and well-being of millions, and even billions, of people. Customer focused Until ISO/TC 217, there was no world- wide mechanism to bring together the many expectations for product safety and the effects on individual (and community) health of using personal care products. One of the outstanding features of ISO/TC 217 is the way its experts are so attuned to stakeholders. While most of its experts are from cosmetic production com- panies or trade associations, ISO/TC 217 is unquestionably a consumer-focused group. Microbiological and chemical testing ensures that possible contaminants are identified and quantified to confirm that consumers are not put at risk of harm, and that the product will remain viable for the stated lifespan under the environmental conditions where the products are marketed. Package labelling assists the consumer and is essential for traceability in cases of alleged problems. Consumers will be able to buy products confident that the protection factors stated on a product are universal. John L. James is Chair of ISO technical commit- tee ISO/TC 217, Cosmetics, with nearly 35 years of experience in standardization at both the national and international levels. A Chartered Scientist with several professional quali-fications in medical laboratory science and in risk management, he holds an MSc and a Diploma in Management Studies. Mr. James has been a consultant in the cosmetics industry for the past 16 years following a career as a healthcare profes- sional, including his role as advisor to the United Kingdom Department of Health. About the author Not just skin deep cosmetic products intended to cover the quality aspects of cosmetics. Such quality aspects have the inherent expectation that the end user will have access to reliable and safe products that support their healthy lifestyle and well-being. Dynamic and innovative, the cosmetic industry constantly seeks to improve and excel. ISO/TC 217 continually receives reviews of stakeholders' needs and aspira- tions from government agencies, consumer representatives, experts and liaison bodies. Such feedback indicated the need for an ISO standard for sun protection test methods. For many years, the determination of sun protection values has been open to manufacturer interpretation. ISO/TC 217 working group WG 7 project groups researched the literature and undertook primary research and ring tests to ensure scientifically supported recommendations for SPF (sun protection factor) and UVA (ultraviolet A) test methods in the sun protection standards. Consumers will be able to buy such products confident that the protection factors stated on a product are the same across a wide range of suppliers who claim to test to the relevant standards. Its clear understanding is that cosmetics shall be safe and of high quality, valued and appreciated by consumers, and will contribute to their health and well-being. Achievements and ongoing work The original scope proposed for ISO/TC 217 focused on microbiological and chemical test methods for cosmetics (see Box). These were prioritized to ensure that safe and viable products were, and are, delivered to the consumer. Extensive testing of both ingredients and finished products is a statutory requirement in many countries, but is also a routine activity in the manufacturing process by ethical producers of cosmetics.Terminology and definitions need to be clear and unambiguous. For example, work is underway to define such terms as \" fresh \" and \" organic \" when applied to cosmetics. Over time, regulatory authorities and con- sumer interests have become more involved in the work of ISO/TC 217, particularly where its standards have been recognized as having the potential to support legislation. One such example is that of ISO 22716:2007, Cosmetics - Good Manu- facturing Practices (GMP) - Guidelines on Good Manufacturing Practices. This has been accepted as being appropriate to underpin the requirements for GMP under the European Cosmetic Regulations. GMPs provide guidelines for the pro- duction, control, storage and shipment of Expanding scope and membership When first established in 1998, ISO/TC 217's scope was limited to the standardization of microbiological and chemical test methods for cosmetics. In 2000, its scope was enlarged and, to accommodate this expansion, several working groups were set up. Today, the committee consists of : Microbiological standards and limits (WG 1) Packaging, labelling and marking (WG 2) Analytical methods (WG 3) Terminology (WG 4) Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) (WG 6) Sun protection test methods (WG 7) Nanomaterials (WG 8) In its 14 years to date, ISO/TC 217 has been recognized for its development of highly relevant and required standards. A wide range of developed and developing countries are represented in its work, which currently consists of 39 participating members with another 21 as observers. ISO/TC 217 is greatly assisted by its links with other ISO technical committees, including ISO/TC 229, Nanotechnologies. Membership continues to grow. Keen to be involved, experts from many countries have requested to join ISO/TC 217, in several instances encouraging their national standards body to achieve this by establishing mirror committees. There is also active participation by ISO/TC 217's liaison partners.

These oils are the oldest known form of medicine and cosmetics, and were once considered more valuable than gold. and flavours, including the essential oils of lemon, peppermint and rosemary. Boosting the benefits By ensuring product quality and safety, essential oils standardization has boosted the trade of the principal essential oils used in the food, perfumery and cosmet- ics industries. Standards are becoming increasingly important too, due mainly to the introduction of new technologies and market globalization.What is known as an \" essential oil \" is the oil of the plant from which it was extracted. It is \"essential\" in the sense that it carries a distinctive scent, or essence, of the plant.In addition, and as a result of some of these factors, analytical methodologies are being continually improved to obtain more precise and accurate results. This solves authentic- ity problems and facilitates the detection of adulterated essential oils. Therefore, with the industry's growing unification of analytical methods, which aims to expand the trade in essential oils, the analytical methods of ISO technical committee ISO/TC 54, Essential oils, are gaining global significance. Regarding cooperation with other organi- zations, ISO/TC 54 works closely with the European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines & HealthCare (EDQM), which is responsible for developing and revising the European Pharmacopoeia monographs. ISO/TC 54 participated in the latest revi- sions and new European Pharmacopoeia monographs. The technical committee has taken the cosmetics regulations, European Pharmacopeia and aromatherapy as social, safety, health, environmental or cultural issues related to the sectors, products, mater- ials, disciplines or practices in its work. Key liaison body, the International Fra- grance Association (IFRA), participates in the development of ISO/TC 54 standards and methods and, likewise, IFRA standards are taken into account in standards elaboration. The committee is open to collaborate with other organizations such as the United Alternative health therapies could soon increase the use of essential oils. Arantxa Bordas is Chair of ISO technical commit- tee ISO/TC 54, Essential oils. She is Product Quality Control Manager at Des- tilaciones Bordas Chinchurreta SA, which she joined in 1992. About the authors Esther Bermejo is a technical of- ficer in the chemis- try and fuels unit of AENOR, the Span-ish standardization body. She is Secre-tary of ISO/TC 54, Essential oils. in the investigation of new varieties, and, commercially, standards are an information source that provides the industry with the properties of products' natural components. Current and future developments Due to Europe-wide interest in essential oils, the European Committee for Standardi- zation (CEN) chose years ago to adopt two International Standards : ISO 3218:1976, Essential oils Principles of nomencla- ture, and ISO 9235:1997, Aromatic natural raw materials Vocabulary. These two standards are being updated in a parallel procedure with CEN. ISO/TC 54 aims to provide the best possible service to its members, to help generate strong profits for the sector and to continue standardization work of interest and relevance to its members.The sweet smell of standards For more than 65 years, ISO technical committee ISO/TC 54, Essential oils, has been active in developing International Standards. ISO standards help encourage innovation and expand the global trade in essential oils, and ensure their quality and safety. Today, ISO/TC 54 comprises 18 participating country members, with another 29 as observers, and five liaison organizations. It represents most of the main producers, suppliers and consumers of the world's essential oils industry. ISO/TC 54's international standardization of analytical methods and specifications involves : Developing specific monographs for quality standardization of every essential oil Standardizing analytical methods to control the quality of essential oils Setting requirements for transport, labelling and marking Deciding nomenclature and botanical names The committee's international membership ensures that developed standards represent and reflect wide- ranging experiences, test methods and techniques. The committee has published 129 standards with another 14 being developed. At plenary meetings held every two years, ISO/TC 54's members set priorities and schedules in standards development, revise the work programme and solve difficult issues. The next meeting will be held in Sydney in September 2012. Essential oils are subtle, aromatic and volatile liquids extracted from vegetable raw materials by distillation processes using water or steam, dry distillation or mechanical processes. Essential oils are widely used in the food and perfumery industries and, in smaller amounts, in cosmetics and some health-related fields such as pharmaceuticals, phytotherapy and aromatherapy. The food industry consumes about 60 % of essential oils production, while the rest is used in perfumery. Around 300 essential oils are commonly used in making fragrances States Pharmacopeial Convention (USP). This makes sense, since the USP aims to improve people's health through public standards that help to ensure the quality, safety and benefit of medicines and foods. The USP is responsible for revising the Food Chemicals Codex monographs of essential oils and analytical methods. These are valuable reference standards for the food industry and the USP and National Formulary monographs. Changing market Essential oils production has moved to developing countries, while quality control and consumption tend to take place in developed countries. There have also been trends towards market globalization, the lowering of some trade barriers, the growth of big companies and greater specialization by small companies. Against this background, ISO/TC 54 aims to : Facilitate the global trade in essential oils Enhance the quality of essential oils on the market Protect the health of essential oils consumers Enhance the safety of essential oils products and processes Promote the use of advanced industrial technology Standardization is remarkable techni - cally because it is an important reference Acting as a central point and focus, ISO/TC 54 unifies and manages essential oils knowledge and information, and is a reference source for all its members. Since the main essential oils companies collaborate with their national standardization bodies participating in ISO/TC 54, its standards and methods of analysis are widely used as homologated working references. People's growing interest in alterna- tive health therapies, and collaboration between ISO/TC 54 and bodies such as the European Pharmacopoeia and USP, could soon increase the use of essential oils in aromatherapy, pharmaceuticals and other areas of medicine.

Wellness spa clients, or guests, expect \" pleasure at leisure \". According to ISO 18513:2003, Tourism services - Hotels and other types of tourism accommodation - Terminology, a \" spa \" is an acknowledged health resort with specific natural factors - natural remedies of the soil (such as a mineral spring), the sea, or the climate - sometimes complemented by appropriate health treatments. With the increasing popularity of wellness spas and a plethora of standards, ISO is work- ing to identify the essence of wellness spa services by introducing a reference standard. Health, disease and wellness Since 1947, the World Health Organiza - tion (WHO) has stated : \" Health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being, and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.\" The WHO definition focuses on the key ideas of well-being and disease/infirmity.However, the perception of health generally has disease/infirmity at its core. Healthcare is currently disease-oriented : prevention, control and treatment. This emphasis on the absence of sickness is negative and unsuitable for a dynamic programme to improve wellness. Instead, though not measurable, the idea that there are gradations of health is understandable and gaining support. A healthy individual is well-integrated in terms of physical structure and physiological, mental, emotional and spiritual functioning. The completely healthy person meets trou- ble with equanimity and has the time and inclination for sociability and recreation. This positive perspective calls for not only the cure, alleviation or prevention of disease. Rather, it looks beyond to strive for the maximum possible physical, mental, emotional, social and spiritual efficiency for the individual, family and community. Progress in science and medicine has led to better preservation of the body and less disease, yet mental, emotional, social and spiritual problems are often left untreated. In contrast, high-level wellness can never be achieved in fragments, ignoring the unity of the whole. This special state of health comprises an overall sense of well-being and A wellness spa concentrates on improving the quality of life.sees mankind as consisting of body, spirit and mind and all dependent on the environment. This dynamic state is an ongoing process, not a static state reached and never considered again. Since there are degrees of wellness as there are degrees of sickness, wellness services should focus on identifying causes of wellness rather than causes of sickness. Hospitals versus wellness spas People seeking to ensure their own wellness can claim services for their physical well-being that are similar to medical services used by patients in a conventional hospital. Although some hospitals can house both patients and wellness clients, offering them similar services and facilities, plus their know-how, they are not preferred by wellness-seekers. A hospital is a place to help patients suf- fering from illness. Healthcare professionals use a wide range of medical technologies to manage the causes of disease or treat the physical symptoms. The main purpose is to maximize biological safety, get rid of the symptoms and eradicate pathogens. Some clinical interventions are painful. Patients are not allowed to do, or must avoid, many things to make sure that their disease will not return. Their privacy and psychological security are limited according to their illness condition. Although hospitals can often extend patients' lives, they rarely add life to the years extended.their mental/emotional stress and enable them to see the world more positively. Some techniques from traditional medicine are used to revitalize clients and restore well-being. Aiming at rejuvenation, many wellness programmes provide modern and advanced healthcare within a holistic framework. Varying service standards As our appreciation of health, wellness and longevity grows, the wellness spa is gaining popularity. However, with the increased diversity of wellness spas, there Supol Sripan is Director General of the Department of Tourism in Thai- land. He holds a Bachelor of Science in Engineering and a Master of Public Administration. Tourism makes a larger contribution to Thailand's economy (typically about 6 % of gross domestic product) than that of any other Asian nation. Most tourists come to Thailand primarily for the beaches and relaxation, including wellness spas. About the authors Dr. Tanin Sonthiraksa is leading the development of an ISO standard on wellness spas. He works at the Department of Medical Services, Ministry of Public Health in Thailand. Dr. Sonthiraksa holds a Diploma in Geri-atrics and Gerontology and a Diploma in Clinical Preventive Medicine. He is also a member of the Thai Medical Council Board on Clinical Preventive Services. some of the essential services most clients expect. Repeatedly dissatisfied clients, in turn, reduce confidence and damage the industry. Planned standard ISO technical committee ISO/TC 228, Tourism and related services, working group WG 2, Health tourism services, is developing an International Standard which aims to define, establish, ensure quality in, and improve wellness spa services. This will enable these services to be monitored and is a growing need to identify and encourage high-quality services, create transparency, increase clients' confidence and promote the exchange of information. Wellness spas are often globally traded services and compete in both international and national markets on the basis of quality and/or price. So-called \" low-cost spas \" can adversely affect the wellness spa industry by cutting provide guidelines for selecting relevant and effective measurement methods. ISO/TC 228/WG 2 will ensure the new International Standard respects the principle of cultural identity and cultural differences. The standard will be a much-needed and highly useful reference document for the wellness spa industry. Importantly, it will also help clients to differentiate and choose wellness spa services worldwide. On the other hand, a wellness spa concen- trates on improving the quality of life. Its approach is not to avoid all negative things or risk factors, but to focus on more positive things or pleasant factors. It provides a secluded, private, relaxing space that is ideal for quiet reflection. It is a place for everyone : healthy people, patients and people with disabilities. At a wellness spa a practitioner of wellness philosophy/science, such as a master of tai chi, yoga or meditation, can help clients to learn. Cleansing programmes for body and mind include water treatments, manual treatments and detoxification. When clients feel clean, they tend to feel more positive. Appropriate skincare techniques include scrubs, masks, wraps and baths.

Including a wide range of medicines, devices, massages and diets, TCM has a common basis with other traditional systems such as Japanese Kampo and Korean medicine. As TCM techniques and medicines are exported globally, International Standards are needed to protect consumers. An essential component of many health systems around the world, traditional medi - cine reflects practices and products that have evolved over many years. They are usually based on experience rather than conventional scientific evidence. TCM adopts a holistic approach to health and well-being. Traditional medicine is widely regarded by people in many countries as integral to their culture. It is also considered an acces- sible and affordable means of healthcare, particularly in locations with limited access to \" conventional \" scientific medicine. Its growing reputation and the movement of people between countries are causing traditional medicine systems to cross bor- ders. While some countries have standards, processes and regulations in place for TCM practitioners and products, many others do not. This makes the need to maintain quality, Traditional Chinese medicine Dr. David Graham is Chair of ISO technical commit- tee ISO/TC 249, Traditional Chinese medicine. He also works on a number of health-related boards. Dr. Graham has held senior management roles in the Australian Public Service, mainly in the health sector. His achievements have included developing national therapeu- tic products legislation, which had the challenge of incorporating traditional and complementary health products into a regulatory system based on conventional medicinal products. About the authorInternational Standards will support public health, safety and trade. Two billion acupuncture needles are used annually. Strong interest Generating strong interest and participation from the start, ISO/TC 249, Traditional Chinese medicine, comprises 23 participating member countries and nine observer countries. Participating countries include Australia, Austria, Canada, China, Finland, France, Germany, Ghana, India, Israel, Italy, Japan, Korea, Mongolia, Netherlands, Norway, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Thailand, Tunisia, USA and Vietnam. The committee has also established liaisons with WHO, the World Federation of Acupuncture- Moxibustion Societies and the World Federation of Chinese Medicine Societies. The technical committee secretariat is provided by the Standardization Association of China.around the world. Moreover, the current lack of adequate quality control makes it more difficult to increase integration of traditional medicine with other healthcare systems in a country. Responding to the increasing acceptance and global use of traditional medicine, an ISO technical committee ISO/TC 249, Traditional Chinese medicine (provisional title), is developing much needed Interna-tional Standards to support public health, safety and trade. Priorities ISO/TC 249 investigated priority areas for the development of International Stand- ards. These are : Quality and safety of products, includ-ing medicines and medical devices Informatics, including terminology and classification Education, training and practices of practitioners Methodology for obtaining evidence to support practices and products To avoid duplication of effort and facilitate cooperation with relevant organizations, ISO/TC 249 took into account work being done elsewhere. For example, it excluded clinical practice guidelines because of the important effort carried out by the World Health Organization (WHO) in this area. It was finally decided that ISO/TC 249 will begin by concentrating on the first two priority areas (quality and safety of products, and informatics), and five working groups were established for this purpose.Works starts A number of projects are already underway, including on two major aspects of TCM : acupuncture needles and ginseng seed and seedlings. Acupuncture is a popular technique which has been endorsed by the WHO for some conditions such as migraine pain relief.seedlings, Panax ginseng C.A. Meyer, will focus on the requirements for this herb. Projects currently being considered include standards for moxibustion and electro-acupuncture devices. ISO/TC 249 is also working closely with ISO/TC 215, Health informatics, to establish a joint working group for relevant standards in informatics. This initiative also involves WHO, responsible for the International Clas- sification of Traditional Medicine project. Road ahead Establishing a technical committee in such a complex area has proved challenging. However, by taking a conservative approach to its scope, progress is being made. As the committee grows and gains experience, its scope may expand and diversify, in response to emerging needs. It may be that the com - mittee will even accommodate additional forms of traditional medicine, depending on demand, need and available resources - as this opens a huge area of work. safety, and efficacy of traditional practices and products even more important. While many \" modern \" medicines were originally obtained by extracting single compounds from natural materials, in tra- ditional medicine the therapeutic benefits of natural substances may depend on an intricate range of factors. This complexity must be respected to ensure the quality of such products. For example, the efficacy and safety of a herb can be influenced by its variety and horticulture, collection, processing and storage. Additional challenges are presented as many traditional medicines are commercial- ized and provided in more modern pharma- ceutical presentations such as tablets and capsules. International Standards can help ensure the same requirements are followed Establishing a global benchmark It is estimated that more than two billion acupuncture needles are used annually. These may have different shapes and sizes depending on their purpose, but all must be sterile. The committee has therefore started work on the future standard ISO 17218, Sterile acupuncture needles for single use. Another key project is that of ginseng, one of the most important herbs from the hundreds used in TCM.

Jones Dental standards play an im- portant and vital role in society, enhancing oral health. They contribute to the quality and safety of products used in treat-ments by dental professionals, as well as hygiene products used by the public. environment, ISO's wide ranging, far reaching achievements show once again how International Standards make sense. In the beginning In 1926, the US National Bureau of Standards developed the very first dental standard, which provided specifications for dental amalgam filling materials - a mixture of metals, including mercury, used to fill cavities caused by tooth decay. Nine International Standards followed in the 1950s, developed by the International Dental Federation (FDI). ISO/TC 106 was Oral health Getting your teeth into dental standards International Standards make a significant contribution to oral health.established in 1962 to continue this work. Since then, the committee has collaborated with the FDI in the development of several clinical standards. Much larger in scope and more complex, today's dentistry has a greater scientific base and emphasis on conserving natural tissues. But in 2012, the need for interna- tional dental standards is as strong as ever. Today In recent years, ISO/TC 106 has aimed to develop \" horizontal \" standards wherever possible. By horizontal we mean standards that are applicable to all areas in a particular field, while vertical standards apply to one particular subject. For example, a standard that outlines requirements for a range of different types of cements or dental hand- pieces is regarded as horizontal, while a standard on the performance of a single type of dental cement such as zinc phosphate or of a dental (drill) handpiece is vertical. The committee's recent focus has also been on performance-based standards rather than prescriptive standards. Open your mouth to ISO Dental standards are developed in response to consumer pressure for higher-quality dental care. For example, standardized packaging and labelling information, helps dentists compare products enabling them to choose the best ones for their patients. Artificial materials are used to replace dental tissues more than in any other part of the human body. The varying pH in the mouth and the stresses of mastication (chew- ing of food), however, have an aggressive effect on the integrity and wear of materials replacing natural tooth structure. Dental restorative materials must therefore have particular chemical, physical and biologi-cal characteristics, which are specified in ISO/TC 106 standards.an ISO standard specifies the limits for exposure to ultraviolet irradiance from dental operating lights, protecting both the dentist and the patient. An interesting issue is that of dental mercury - used in amalgam fillings - which has raised public concern. In order to address the wider social implications of the release of mercury from the dental office, the committee developed ISO 11143:2008, Dentistry - Amalgam separators, which addresses the question of protection of the environment. The biocompatibility of medical devices used in dentistry are covered by ISO 7405:2008, Dentistry - Evaluation of biocompatibility of medical devices used in dentistry, which specifies test methods for the evaluation of biological effects. It includes specifications for testing the pharmacological agents that are used by the devices.It is estimated that about 99 % of all adults in developed countries suffer from some form of dental disease or malfunc- tion at some time. Most people will therefore require dental care during their lives, making the ultimate consumer of dental standards, directly or indirectly, the general public. There is no reason to fear the dentist's office. Over the past five decades, ISO technical committee ISO/TC 106, Dentistry, has made a big difference to the quality of dental treatment received by billions of people worldwide. In today's global restorative materials, including limits for physical and chemical properties. Another important subject is radio- opacity, which helps dentists diagnose recurrent caries. An improved standard for determining the radio-opacity of restorative materials is being developed. Standards have also been developed on implantable materials (resorbable or non- resorbable) for bone filling and augmenta- tion in oral and maxillofacial surgery, and on membrane materials for guided tissue regeneration in similar operations. In addition, many dental standards cover products supplied directly to consumers, for example oral hygiene products such as mouthwash, dentifrice and toothbrushes. ISO/TC 106 has also developed a range of standards for the complex variety of instruments and devices used by dental professionals, as well as the range of equip- ment in the dental operatory. For example, ISO standards have been developed for casting alloys, ceramics and cements. They outline requirements for setting time, strength, colour stability, biocompatibil - ity, expansion and contraction of dental Photo : Caprasilana - Fotolia.com Photo : Oigro - Fotolia.com ISO Focus + July-August 2012 ISO Focus + July-August 2012 18 19 aSpecial ReportDerek W. Jones, BSc, PhD, DO,h.c., Chartered Chem- ist, is Chair of ISO technical commit-tee ISO/TC 106, Dentistry, and has been involved with standards develop- ment since 1971. He is a Fellow of the British Royal Society Chemistry, a Fel-low of the Institute of Materials, Miner - als, Mining, and a Fellow, Biomaterials Science and Engineering. He is currently Professor Emeritus of Biomaterials, Dal-housie University, Canada. About the authorThere are also standards for the general requirements of the dental stool, the dental operation unit, suction systems, compressor systems and the patient chair. Another standard looks at test methods for improving or maintaining the microbiologi- cal quality of water used in dental units. Busy bee Since 1962 many experienced and knowledgeable individuals have generously dedicated many hours to produce and revise dental standards within ISO technical committee ISO/TC 106, Dentistry. Today the committee has 300 dental experts from around the world, speaking a total of 26 languages ! ISO/TC 106 has a total of nine active subcommittees with close to 50 working groups devoted to developing standards for : Biocompatibility Restorative materials Prosthodontic materials Orthodontic materials and devices Instruments Equipment Oral hygiene products Implant devices and materials Computer-aided design/manufacture (CAD/CAM) Terminology and coding systems To date, the committee has developed 158 International Standards - more if you consider that many of these are actually a group of standards compiled into one document for ease of use. Over the past 50 years, attendance at annual meetings has increased by over 600 %. Participation of ISO member countries has also significantly grown. Today a total of 47 countries are involved in the work. From the establishment of ISO/TC 106 in 1962 until 2004, the Secretariat of the committee was held by the British Standards Institution. The Standards Council Canada then took over, and the TC is now administered by the Canadian Dental Association. There are even standards for ensuring that the materials used on the external surfaces of dental equipment can resist the chemical disinfectants used in dentistry. And the road is not ending anytime soon. The committee plans to start work on a classification of both caries (dental decay) and types of prepared cavities in teeth. This initiative is driven by today's trend towards a more conservative approach and minimal intervention. Billions of people benefit Globally, around a million dental pro- fessionals are using materials, devices, equipment and procedures covered by International Standards. And billions of consumers use over-the-counter dental hygiene products that also benefit from International Standards.A photograph from 1979, from left : Dr. Derek W. Jones, Chair of ISO/TC 106 (2006-present) and the late Dr. John W. McLean first ISO/TC 106 Chair (1967-1981). The wide stakeholder participation involved in the development of ISO stand- ards improves information flows between manufacturers, the dental profession, aca- demics and government regulators. ISO dental standards also facilitate the availability of devices that meet important clinical requirements, and help ensure suc- cessful clinical outcomes. Above all, International Standards make a significant and positive contribution to the quality of oral health and the safety of dental care, as well as stimulating the development of improved products. They also help to break down trade barriers, thus making a wider range of quality dental products available to more people in more places. by Tom Stewart Standards development is an important but potentially dull activity. It involves reading and commenting on a large number of documents, some of which are long and complex. It also involves attending many meetings and taking part in often lengthy and detailed discussions.Designing for people How technology can support a healthier lifestyle ISO standards ensure that technology is highly usable, contributing to users' health and well-being.in its business plan as : \" Ergonomics is the scientific discipline concerned with the understanding of the interactions among human and other elements of a system, and the profession that applies theory, principles, data and methods to design in order to optimize human well-being and overall system performance.\" This definition comes from the Interna- tional Ergonomics Association, which has almost 50 national professional societies as members. But many people still misunderstand ergonomics. This may be because its origins come from the Greek words ergon (work) and nomos (natural laws) and it received its biggest impetus after the Second World Of course, we would not get involved in standards making if we did not believe that the final results were worthwhile and that the world was improved in some way as a result of our efforts. But in the midst of the detailed documents and formal procedures, it is easy to forget the big picture and what we are really trying to achieve. For this reason, it is occasionally useful to stand back and consider our work in the context of the wider world. This article is therefore a good opportunity for me to reflect on the relationship between ISO technical committee ISO/TC 159, Ergo- nomics, subcommittee SC 4, Ergonomics of human-system interaction, and health and well-being. Understanding human factors People are using technology for ever more hours a day, potentially leading to problems with their health. Fortunately, ISO standards are ensuring that technology is highly usable, therefore contributing to users' health and well-being. In some ways, the relationship is obvi- ous. ISO/TC 159, Ergonomics, defines ergonomics (also known as human factors) ISO Focus + July-August 2012 ISO Focus + July-August 2012 20 21 aFigure 1 : Cranfield man - a lathe operator redesigned to suit the machine. Based on a figure in WT Singleton, \" A preliminary study of a capstan lathe \", International Journal of Production Research, Volume 3, Issue 3, 1964. Special ReportThe ergonomics approach, redesigning the machine tool to suit real people, was clearly more effective. Applying ergonom- ics to productivity problems resulted in a boost to industrial output between the 1960s and 1980s. Health and safety In Europe, ergonomics has more recently become part of health and safety legisla- tion following the so-called \" six-pack \" of European Economic Community directives introduced in 1992. Two of these directives (one concerned with manual handling and one with display screen equipment) have been instrumental in making European employers take ergo- nomics seriously. As a result of this link to health and safety, many people now see ergonomics as being focused primarily on reducing accidents and injuries. This health and safety milestone was not a sudden development. It emerged after growing concern in the 1980s over the issues the six-pack addressed. One of these issues, work with display screen equipment, was the incentive for the formation of ISO/TC 159/SC 4 in 1983 to deal with a new work item with the title, Visual information processing, which had just been approved. Several years' work later, this resulted in a six-part standard published under the general title, ISO 9241, Ergonomic require - ments for office work with visual display terminals (VDTs). The focus on office work reflected concerns in the 1970s and 1980s about the impact of display screen use on people's health. These concerns included the impact on vision and visual health and musculoskeletal issues including discomfort and repetitive strain injury (RSI). Health risks associated with visual dis- play screens had been highly controversial with very public claims and counter claims about the nature and magnitude of the risks. However, most scientific and reg- ulatory authori- ties recognized that the risks were relatively minor compared with such areas as manufactur- ing and construc - tion work, where serious injury and even death are still far too common. Nonetheless, the arguments in favour of regu- lation were that many more peo- ple were using display screen equipment for an increasing amount of time and that there was a sig- nificant collective risk for society. In this context, ISO/TC 159/SC 4 developed a series of ISO 9241 standards aimed at ensur- ing a minimum ergonomic quality in computer displays (Part 3), computer keyboards (Part 4), computer workstations (Part 5) and the office working environment (Part 6). From the start, we recognized that even if someone were provided with the ideal ergonomic screen, keyboard, desk and environment, the nature of the job could still give rise to problems through long working hours, repetitive work and so on. Part 2 of ISO 9241 was therefore developed to provide guidance on task and job design to mitigate against such problems. We also recognized early on that software played a major part in determining the user's experience, and so several other parts were added dealing specifically with broader usability and software interface issues. ISO 9241 has been an influential standard across the world and is referenced in many countries' regulations, including the United Kingdom's Health and Safety (Display Screen Equipment) Regulations 1992. A total of 35 countries take part in ISO/TC 159/SC 4's work, and many go on to adopt these Inter-national Standards as national standards. Usability One of our most purchased standards is ISO 9241-210:2010, Ergonomics of human- system interaction - Part 210 : Human-cen - tred design process for interactive systems. This is a revision of ISO 13407:1999. These standards have been widely accepted as the recommended approach to developing usable systems, services and products. Our definition of usability, which comes from ISO 9241-11:1998, Ergonomic requirements for office work with visual display terminals (VDTs) - Part 11 : Guidance on usability, explains that usability is about much more than making things easy.Tom Stewart is Chair of ISO technical commit- tee ISO/TC 159, Ergonomics, sub-committee SC 4, Ergonomics of human-system interaction. He is also Executive Chairman of System Concepts, one of the largest ergonomics and usability consultants in Europe. About the authorUsability is the extent to which a product can be used by specified users to achieve specified goals with efficiency, effectiveness and satisfaction in a specified context of use. Although efficiency, effectiveness and satisfaction map closely to productivity and safety, they go beyond simply ensuring that technology does not injure its users. User satisfaction might seem like a luxury to those concerned with work systems, despite the evidence that if people get satisfaction from their work, the quality of their work is also likely to be higher. In today's computer-based workplace, however, many organizations rely on their staff to deliver good customer service. In my 40 years as an ergonomics and usability consultant, I know that one of the key drivers of customer service is motivated and effec- tive staff. Ensuring that the technology they use is usable is therefore far from a luxury. Technological explosion One of the biggest changes to technology (and also the work of ISO/TC 159/SC 4) in recent years is the explosion of personal information technol- ogy ranging from personal computers to laptops, netbooks, personal digital assis- tants, tablets and smartphones. Usability and user interface design affect far more peo- ple today than when we started in 1983 where computers were mainly confined to business. The IBM PC had only just been launched in 1981 and was still expensive for use at home, where games and hobby computers were beginning to make a mark. Nowadays, many people use the same technology to run their lives as they use at work. This has two implications for our standards : first, the context of use may now have to include social and leisure uses of computers ; and secondly, people expect more from using their technology - they increas- ingly expect it to be fun and pleasurable. Healthy working So what has this to do with health ? In fact, quite a lot. As far back as 1948, the World Health Organization (WHO) defined health as a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being, and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity. Technology which is efficient, effective and satisfying to use can, therefore, contrib- ute directly to our health and well-being. However, the widespread adoption of computer-based technology in all aspects The best way of making sure these two issues do not cause problems is to encour- age people to take frequent short breaks and change their postures. As mentioned earlier, ISO 9241-2 : 1992 contains just such guidance (among other job and task design issues). This guidance was aimed at employers to ensure they did not create unhealthy jobs. But even when we have the choice and freedom to take breaks and move around, for example at home, there is a tendency for us to forget and get locked into what we are doing. We all need to take more responsibility for our own health and well-being. One aim of the human-centred design standard (ISO 9241-210:2010) is to ensure users are fully engaged in the design process - which should help. Technology can contribute directly to our health and well-being. ISO 9241 has been an influential standard across the world.War where improved ergonomics in the industrial workplace was seen as a key part of the economic recovery. Post-war, the focus of ergonomics was on productivity, especially industrial output. One of the classic ergonomics illustra- tions by the pioneer Tom Singleton showed \" Cranfield man \" - a person \" redesigned \" to suit a specific machine tool (see Figure 1). Trying to recruit people with these rather strange characteristics (just over one metre tall, with one arm longer than the other and so on) was clearly not a good solution.of our lives has two potentially negative consequences which pose a challenge for our standards making. Firstly, many people now spend far longer than a typical working day hunched over keyboards or staring at screens. This increases the likelihood of them develop-ing musculoskeletal symptoms and visual discomfort. Secondly, many people now work at home or in offices which look more like homes with coffee bars, rest areas and so on. While most people welcome this, the downside is that they are often using computers in less than ideal postures and working environments - the ideal chair for lounging and chatting is not ideal for using a laptop.

This maximizes potential use when de- veloping products, services, environments and facilities. Accessible design and similar concepts, such as universal design, design for all and inclusive design, emerged in the 1980s. With ageing populations in many countries, the UN adopted the Convention on Human Rights of People with Disabilities. Better access, better health A comfortable, low-stress life improves human health and wellness. Accessible design makes life more comfortable by making products, services, environments and facilities accessible to everyone, including older people and people with disabilities.Accessibility for all Products, services and facilities should be accessible to all. Ken Sagawa is a Professor at Japan Women's University in To- kyo. Prof. Sagawa's research field is visual psychophys-ics and age-related changes in visual functions. He is a Convenor of ISO tech- nical committee ISO/TC 159, Ergonom- ics, 2, Ergonomics for people with special requirements, ISO/TC 159/AG, Advisory group for accessible design, and ISO/TC 122, Packaging, WG 9, Acces- sible design for packaging. About the authors Dr. Kenji Kurakata is Leader of the Accessible Design Group at the Hu-man Technology Research Institute of the National In- stitute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Tsukuba, Japan. Dr. Kurakata's research interests are ageing effects on auditory perception and acoustic design of the human-machine interface. He is Secre-tary of ISO/TC 159/WG 2 and Convenor of accessibility-related working groups in ISO/TC 159. He is also an expert of ISO/TC 43, Acoustics. Products designed to maintain or enhance health are big business. Since health and wellness are of great concern to older people, these sought-after products should be as accessible to older people as everyone else. A new approach As people become older, they gener- ally become less able to use the (perhaps still growing number of) goods, services and facilities that are designed mainly for younger people or those without a disability. Products, services and facilities should be accessible to all. Accessible design helps to do this by removing barriers, increasing user comfort and reducing user stress. As a result, ISO/IEC Guide 71, Guidelines for standards developers to address the needs of older persons and persons with disabilities, was developed in 2001. Since its publication, ISO and other standards bodies have developed many accessibility standards. These aim to improve older and disabled people's access to products and services - and therefore their lives. Many accessible design standards have been developed by ISO and other interna- tional and national standards organizations. A number of technical committees have recently increased the pace of development, both on new standards and revisions to existing standards. Three technical committee working groups are taking a leading role developing general or specific standards on accessible design : ISO technical committee ISO/TC 159, Ergo- nomics ; ISO/TC 173, Assistive products for persons with disabilities ; and JTC1/SWG-A, Information technology / Special working group on accessibility.International accessibility standards may also target tele-medication systems. Revising ISO/IEC Guide 71 The revision of ISO/IEC Guide 71 is cur- rently underway. A joint technical advisory group has been formed and experts invited to discuss how the guide should be updated to further encourage standards developers and those involved in accessibility applica - tions. The new version is expected to be published in 2013. In addition, an ISO technical report, ISO/TR 22411:2008, Ergonomics data and guidelines for the application of ISO/IEC Guide 71 to products and services to address the needs of older persons and persons with disabilities, is being revised to incorporate new technical information. Over recent decades, ISO has paid more attention to standards related to human life and, particularly positively, on human- friendly standards that enhance people's quality of life. ISO/IEC Guide 71 has had a great impact and driven accessibility standardization in ISO and other standards organizations. However, accessibility is a broad field and further development is required, as is more support from social and industrial fields. We look forward to working with our partners and the various stakeholders involved and making an even greater impact. Improving the lives of older people and people with disabilities In ISO/TC 159, standards on visual signs and announcements are being developed to provide a legible font size in public spaces and audible public announcements. Both will improve older people's lives and increase their involvement in society. To give another example, since phar- maceutical packages without Braille could increase blind people's risk of taking the wrong medicine, ISO/TC 122, Packaging , is working with the European Committee for Standardization (CEN) to develop a new standard. In the USA, medical diagnostic equip- ment accessibility standards are being developed. By setting design criteria, these will help people with disabilities to benefit from standardized examination tables and chairs, weight scales and radiological and other equipment.

Special Reportby Hidekatsu Aoki and Seiji Mitani The newly published ISO 23599:2012, Assistive products for blind and vision-impaired persons - Tactile walking surface indicators, will contribute to high quality and consistency in the use of tactile walking surface indicators (TWSI). Around the world, this standard will make urban streets safer for people with visual impairments.Tactile walking surface indicatorsISO 23599 will enable the safe and secure travel of people with visual impair - ments around the world. The World Health Organization has reported that the world now has 285 million people with visual impairments, 39 million of whom are totally blind, and 246 million of whom have low vision. Although many people who are visually impaired travel independently, wayfinding can be difficult in congested areas and where there are no features that can be used for guidance, for example walls, kerbs and changes in tex- ture such as between pavement (sidewalk) and grass. The role of TWSIs TWSIs are widely used in many developed and some developing countries to provide wayfinding information to pedestrians who are visually impaired. TWSIs are also used to alert people with visual impairments when they are approaching a hazard such as the edge of a platform, a flight of stairs or the end of the pavement and the beginning of the street. They are used in indoor as well as outdoor locations. By providing information for safety and wayfinding, TWSIs improve the confidence, independence and quality of life of people who are visually impaired. This is achieved by enabling them to participate in employ- ment, social, recreational, educational, cultural and religious activities. There are other systems and devices for providing wayfinding and safety informa-tion to people who are visually impaired. These include accessible signals that use sound and/or vibration to provide informa- tion for crossing at pedestrian traffic lights TWSIs around the world : 1. in the United Kingdom - 2. in Germany - 3. in Australia - 4. in Hong Kong - 5. in the USA - 6. in Switzerland.Making streets safer for visually impaired pedestrians(standardized as ISO 23600:2007, Assistive products for persons with vision impair - ments and persons with vision and hearing impairments Acoustic and tactile signals for pedestrian traffic lights).can complement, but do not replace, the requirement for tactual information. Among their advantages, TWSIs can lead users precisely to a destination, can be used to provide information both indoors and outdoors, do not require electric power and do not require users to purchase or maintain any special equipment. TWSIs were originally developed in 1965 by Seiichi Miyake who lived in Okayama, a city about 550 kilometers southwest of Tokyo. He did this with the cooperation of a friend who was becoming vision impaired. TWSIs were first installed to indicate the location of a pedestrian crossing, but they are now used to provide information for wayfinding and safety on railway plat- forms, pavements and in public facilities. It is now possible for people who are visually impaired to use both GPS-based, real-time wayfinding information and some electronic information systems for public buildings.

Mr. Aoki holds a Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering from Hiroshima University in Japan. Two main patterns of TWSIs : \" Attention \" pattern and \" Guiding \" pattern.Originally, two types of TWSIs were used : a pattern of truncated domes to indicate danger ; and a pattern of raised bars to indicate a direction to walk. Their benefit has been well acknowledged, and their use is now quite widespread.A working group was therefore set up under ISO technical committee ISO/TC 173, Assistive products for persons with disability, to develop standards for TWSIs to ensure they would provide effective information for safety and wayfinding, and would be as consistent as possible globally. Challenges involved Around 1990, the first working group (WG 6) on the standardization of TWSIs was established under ISO/TC 173. How- ever, the work was cancelled and restarted twice because consensus could not be reached within the ISO time limit. In March 2012, ISO 23599 was finally completed by ISO/TC 173, working group WG 8, Tactile walking surface indicators, under the chair- manship of Dr. Shigeru Yamauchi of Japan. The lengthy development period for this standard occurred largely because, both before and during the standard's develop- ment, the use of TWSIs was becoming increasingly widespread and varied. In addition, research was taking place in many countries, and divergent national standards were being developed. The installation of TWSIs is relatively expensive, and development of a standard that required the retrofit of TWSIs became an impractical goal. If visually-impaired pedestrians and travellers have become used to particular types of installations in an area or country where they live, chang-ing them would lead to confusion and loss of confidence in the system. Nonetheless, development of a standard based on the consolidated findings of sci- ence, technology and experience remained desirable to encourage consistency in new installations of TWSIs, and to increase quality of the products. experience. However, \" national design standards should provide for high-quality products and consistent TWSI systems within a country.\" Contents of the standard ISO 23599 includes both technical stand- ards for TWSI surfaces and principles for installation. Technical standards include the shape, dimensions, arrangements and spacing of texture elements for TWSIs that have been demonstrated to promote accurate detection and identification both under foot and by the use of the long white cane. There is also a technical standard for luminance contrast, assuring that TWSIs will be maximally visible to people with low vision. Principles for installation are followed by an annex of examples of TWSIs in dif- ferent situations, including at pedestrian crossings, at grade kerbs, railway platforms, stairs, ramps, escalators, lifts (elevators) and revolving doors. Consistency is important for people who are visually impaired.Travellers who are visually impaired can have reasonable confidence.Members of ISO/TC 173, Assistive products for persons with disability, WG 8, Tactile walking surface indicators.

In others, attention patterns and guiding patterns are used as a system, but the guiding patterns are not used where good natural guidance is provided by features such as walls, building lines and curbs. Characteristics and use Based on the consolidated findings of sci - ence, technology and experience in various countries, ISO 23599 aims to specify the most detectable and recognizable shapes, dimensions and luminance of TWSIs. It also aims to specify best practice in installation to ensure wayfinding and safety of users who are blind or who have low vision. In Explanatory information with each example always begins with the expres- sion \" When used... \". There is, therefore, no absolute requirement for TWSIs to be used in all types of locations. ISO 23599 recognizes that national standards vary in the types of situations or locations requiring TWSIs. This may be because of specific construction design and materials (such as for pavements) and special physical, climatic and/or social situations in different countries. Two textures (patterns) are used for TWSIs. An \" attention pattern \" comprises truncated domes or cones, and is used primarily to indicate hazards and decision points. A decision point may be at the intersection of two guiding paths, or at a change of direction along a guiding path. A \" guiding pattern \" comprises raised bars and is used to guide visually-impaired pedestrians to particular places such as pedestrian crossings, entrances to buildings, lifts and other amenities. In some countries, attention patterns and guiding patterns are used as a continuous addition, the comfort and safety of people with mobility impairments are considered. This standard gives some choices in areas such as shapes, dimensions, arrangements, formula of the luminance and method of installation. This is to give certain flexibility when considering different national circum- stances. However, we strongly recommend that any choices adopted by a country be applied consistently throughout that country. The technical experts engaged in devel- oping ISO 23599 sincerely hope that this standard will contribute to the consistent use and excellence of TWSIs and, in so doing, enable the safe and secure travel of people with visual impairments around the world. Over many years, extensive research in various countries has established that both truncated domes and raised bars are highly detectable when used in association with typical walking surfaces, and that they are distinguishable from each other. Standardization needed Since 1965, TWSI surface textures have been modified, and systems of installation have become somewhat varied, not only between countries, but also within coun-tries. Multiple patterns, sizes, colours and specifications of materials and systems for installation can now be found. However, consistency is important when providing tactile information for people who are visually impaired. These people are unable, or have limited ability, to use vision to confirm information about the environment. When different TWSIs are used in differ- ent ways from one place to another, there is a high probability that pedestrians with visual impairments will find them confusing, and may not use them effectively. The standard is intended to ensure that best practice is followed by countries that do not have TWSIs or do not yet have widespread installations of TWSIs. Travellers who are visually impaired can then have reasonable confidence in the consistent presence, type and meaning of TWSIs as they travel from one country to another. The scope of the standard says that \" it is not intended to replace requirements and recommendations contained in...national standards, regulations and guidelines \" based on the findings of science, technology and ISO Focus + July-August 2012 ISO Focus + July-August 2012 30 31 aSpecial Reportby Phuntsho Wangdi In seeking a sustainable balance between materialistic and spiritual growth, the Kingdom of Bhutan has developed the idea of Gross Nation- al Happiness (GNH). Now a key part of Bhutan's overall Development Philosophy, GNH is central to ensuring the happiness of its people. Happiness explained Having understood this basic human need - happiness - His Majesty King Jigme Singye Wangchuck has, since 1972, made GNH the guiding philosophy of Bhutan's development. In these four decades, research, studies and conferences have taken place to develop this concept. GNH is a unique philosophy stimulating a huge shift from conventional consumer- based development. It aims to achieve a balance between material and spiritual growth, maintaining people's happiness as a core criterion. Article 9 of the consti- tution of the Kingdom of Bhutan states : \" The State shall strive to promote those conditions that will enable the successful pursuit of GNH.\" For Bhutanese people, GNH is not an optional extra but central to the constitution. In market-oriented western societies, GNH may be interpreted and construed as an overwhelmingly individualistic cul- ture in which happiness is deemed to be merely quantitative and emotional. Since exotic curiosity cannot blend with current Are you happy ? imperatives and social structuring, there may be only superficial acceptance of GNH. The fact is, even wealthy individuals and societies can be dissatisfied with life. In today's highly competitive consumer- based economy, peoples' lives are ever more regulated, time-bound and tied to responsibilities. At the same time, there seems to be very little room for love, kind- ness, compassion, sympathy and respect. Put simply, happiness comes to you when you make others happy. This is achieved by harmoniously combining wisdom, compas- sion and self-restraint. These sensibilities are derived largely from Buddhist philosophies. GNH is a holistic approach towards all- round economic and social development that gives equal importance to the physical, emotional, and spiritual aspects of well-being. It recognizes that individual well-being will be achieved sustainably if happiness is pursued in the context of the greater good of society, and it believes that it cannot be Happiness is a human's physical and mental well-being. As the ultimate goal, every human hopes to achieve happiness individually and collectively. But how is it achieved ? People in general may argue that happi- ness depends on economic growth, culture, race and religion. However, the basic factors driving happiness are in fact largely the same in any location or socio-economic environment. Every human hopes to achieve happiness indivi - dually and collectively.left alone as a personal responsibility. The state must, therefore, create the conditions and an enabling environment for pursuing collective happiness and well-being. In Bhutan, the four priority \" pillars of GNH \" are : Sustainable and equitable socio-eco-nomic development Conservation of the environment Preservation and promotion of culture Promotion of good governance Understanding GNH The four pillars have been further classified into nine indicators to increase understanding of GNH, and to reveal the holistic range of GNH values. They are : Psychological well-being Psychological well-being is defined in terms of the internal experience of individuals and their own perception of life. Both momentary moods and long-term states of mental well-being are considered. This indicator reflects actual experiences such as the quality of relationships, the regulation of emo-tions and whether feelings of isolation and depression pervade daily life. Health Identified as a strong determinant of happiness, the enhancement of public health is a state priority. The Royal Government of Bhutan ensures every citizen benefits from free healthcare. Education Education improves literacy, know-ledge, skills, creativity and human capital, and in this manner helps to alleviate poverty. This indicator not only tries to assess achievements made through conventional education, but also seeks to measure people's acquired knowledge and expertise, including historical, cultural, civic and ecological knowledge and skills. Time use Time is a significant but limited resource. Time-use studies show what people actually do in their lives, including how much time is spent on work and labour (including child care) within households, both at a point in time and over a period of time. This information is used to design inclusive and balanced eco-nomic and social policies. Cultural diversity and resilience This is important in maintaining a diverse cultural identity. To understand people's perceptions in this area, the awareness of cultural elements such as language, sense of identity, core values, beliefs, norms and customs, and participation in various cultural activities, are assessed. Good governance Good governance is important as government policies, projects and pro-grammes have a direct impact on soci- ety. Since state control helps achieve common objectives, these indicators help ensure governance performance, deliver effective public services and provide fundamental rights. Community vitality Community vitality examines commu-nity relationships and interactions. The indicator helps to understand the vari- ables required to maximize community well-being. Ecological diversity and resilience This is important as we depend on dif-ferent life forms and the environment for our survival. The indicator is used to assess environmental parameters such as air quality, water quality and the effective use of land. Living standards A higher standard of living is usu-ally the most important goal of all. However, rising incomes may only increase happiness and well-being to a certain level.Phuntsho Wangdi is Director General of the Bhutan Standards Bureau (BSB), ISO member for the country. Prior to joining BSB, he was in Bhutan's Department of Roads until June 2008. Mr. Wangdi holds a degree in Civil Engineering from the Punjab Engineering College, India, and is one of the Board Directors of SARSO (the South Asian Regional Standards Organization).

GNH indicators serve as evalu- ation tools to track developmental progress over time ; and they serve as a link between GNH concepts and actual implementation in policies and programmes. GNH's many faces include wisdom, insight, kindness towards others, self- restraint and appreciation of things as they are, helping to free us from constant grasp- ing and greed. By incorporating GNH in its development, Bhutan is continually seeking the right balance between materialistic and spiritual growth. Measuring the well-being of a population It has been demonstrated that increases in Gross Domestic Product or Gross National Product do not necessarily make people hap- pier. In fact, higher incomes and wealth may induce further wants, cravings and desires that hold back the growth of happiness. Happiness is what each of us values the most. Governments and institutions must therefore develop the means to deliver services based on GNH. 32 33 aPlanet ISOPlanet ISO Simpler, faster and better access to information on ISO standards is the aim of the new edition of ISO's Website, which has been fully revised with customer focus and readability in mind. The new Website puts users first. The layout and con- tent have been specifically designed to help visitors find information quickly and easily, in any device. ISO Secretary-General Rob Steele comments : \" This is another example of ISO's continual goal to be \" simpler and faster and better \". We are very excited about the project and hope visitors will enjoy navigating through our new site ! \" Today, most of us access the Internet through a variety of platforms. The new ISO Website adopts a \" one-Web \" approach. Its fluid and responsive layout flexibly adapts to different resolutions, browsers and screen sizes, so that no matter how users access the site (desktop, laptop, tablet, smartphone, etc.), they can read it comfortably and easily. The new site is also much easier to navigate than its predecessor. \" Another area where you will see a big difference is the content, \" says Luigi Principi, Manager, ISO Web Information Services. \" We started by looking at what users were doing and built our new site based on that. Our goal was to increase understanding of what ISO does, and how it does it, without losing our audience to endless information.\" The site adopts a completely new approach to content management. Developers started by creating a series of \" ideal \" user profiles by aggregating statistics from ISO's old Website. The profiles helped identify ISO's core online audience, their goals and needs - from the occasional visi- tor who wants the answer to a quick question, to regular and experienced users.

The new edition of ISO 20022, consisting of eight parts, is scheduled for publication later this year. The meeting also discussed the publica- tion of ISO 17442 on Legal Entity Identifier (LEI). The new standard provides a global solution for the accurate and unambiguous identification of entities engaged in financial transactions. It is the first ISO standard for the financial services industry to be adopted by global regulators. Reports were given on the progress of work in mobile banking, ISO 9362 on the Business Identifier Code (BIC), ISO 4217 on currency codes, ISO 6166 on International Securities Identifying Number (ISIN), and ISO 10962 on classification of financial instruments standards, including readiness to proceed with Registration Authority arrangements for ISO 18773 and ISO 18774 on financial instrument short name and abbreviations. Finally, an advisory group was created to assess arrangements for ISO Registra- tion Authorities and to compile a set of recommendations. Global human resource standards The second plenary of ISO/TC 260, Human resource management, will be held to coincide with the World Human Resource Congress in Melbourne, Australia, on 26-27 September 2012. The ISO committee will explore HR prac- tices around the world with a view to adopting uniform standards in areas such as terminology, measurement and governance. The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and Standards Australia (SA), ISO members for the USA and Australia respectively, are the joint hosts of the meeting. The director of HR standards with the US Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM), Lee Webster, said that the meeting \" will not only be a fabulous opportunity to further define and advance the practice of human resource management, but will also occur in an environment where an assembly of other global experts are sharing their wis- dom about how to make workplaces more effective and humane. Clearly the centre of the HR universe will be in Melbourne in September.\" The national president of the Australian Human Resources Institute (AHRI), Peter Wilson, agrees that \" by holding the ple- nary standards meeting in Australia during September, the committee has chosen to be in the right place at the right time. This is a first for much-needed HR standards that will cross borders, and it is very pleasing to see the presence of a high level of collabora- tion. There will be plenty of interest in the deliberations of the committee and congress delegates will eagerly look forward to hear- ing a report on its findings.\" AHRI is hosting the 2012 World HR Congress (HRIZON) in Melbourne with a mandate from the World Federation of People Management Associations (WFPMA). Simpler, faster and better access to information on ISO standards The ISO team has been working hard to launch the new ISO Website. The whole package : how not to leave a mark on the environment At a recent plenary meeting in Seoul, Republic of Korea, ISO's technical committee ISO/TC 122, Packaging, and its subcommittee SC 4, Packaging and environment, ushered in the beginning of a new era in global manu- facturing and distribution. Up until now, the process which creates packaging has made its elimination an enor-mous challenge. The environmental aspects of packaging will now be taken into account throughout the supply and recycle chain thanks to the publication of ISO standards and other deliverables.

Preference is given to participating mem- bers (P-member category) and candidates have to satisfy a strict technical profile. Continued support is contingent upon the member establishing and maintaining a national committee (also referred to as a national mirror committee) involving relevant stakeholders. Since the launch of this sponsorship pro- gramme, the developing country membership in the committee has increased from 25 to 37. Out of these 37 members in the committee, 25 hold P-member status. Table 1 below indicates the changes in membership of ISO/TC 223 and the sponsorships provided. Overall, through the sponsorship pro- gramme, 27 developing country members of ISO/TC 223 have attended at least one of the committee meetings. Furthermore, in the last two years for each committee meeting held, at least seven sponsorships have helped some developing countries attend meetings systematically.

This output is among the priority actions undertaken by the ISO Development and Training Services to realize ISOs strategic objective to enhance the \"capacity and participation of developing countries in international standardization\". Since 2007, a sponsorship programme has been implemented with funding sup- port provided by the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida) to enable developing country experts to attend meetings of ISO technical committee ISO/TC 223, Societal security 1). In addition, the programme involves the organization of regional workshops to raise awareness of the committees work, and pre-plenary workshops to give updates on ongoing committee work in order to help them better participate in future meetings. The sponsorship programme finances the participation of full ISO members. These sponsorships are provided through 1) ISO/TC 223 was first initiated in 2001 under the title Civil defence .

Twenty-seven representatives from 15 French-speaking African country members of ISO which are also involved in Interna- tional Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) activities, attended the course in March 2012. Representatives from the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU), Mr. Koffi NGoyet, Director of Direction de la Normalisation et de la Promotion de la Qualit\u00e9 (DNPQ), and Ms. Ad\u00e9la\u00efde Belemsigri, Officer in charge of the Regional Secretariat of Standardiza- tion, Certification and Quality Promotion (NORMCERQ), were also in attendance. The training course was intended to dem- onstrate the potential value of using ISO and IEC standards as a basis for technical regulations, and how such standards could be used by governments to underpin good regulatory practices. More specifically, the training courses goals were to : Help participants understand the bene-fits of adopting International Standards as regional or national standards Explain the methods for adopting International Standards (and other documents) as regional or national standards (or documents) Give guidance on the policies and practices that national standards bodies (NSBs) should establish over the use, adoption and referencing of Interna- tional Standards on the basis of the trainers practical experience Give guidance and hands-on experi-ence in drafting references to Inter-national Standards, whether as part of voluntary standards or of technical regulations This course provided participants with the opportunity to exchange and share experience. It also helped NSBs, which had already adopted International Standards, to increase their knowledge and, in the process, it provided a solid base for other NSBs. Participants were urged to comply with the provisions of ISO/IEC Guide 21 on the regional or national adoption of Inter- national Standards, and other international deliverables, and to report their progress to ISO and IEC. The course was organized by ISO under the patronage of Bernard Zougouri, the Secretary-General to the Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Craftsmanship, representing the Minister.

To this end, ISO, with help from members of the International Accreditation Forum (IAF), has been able to draw up an updated list of around 1700 accredited certification bodies located all around the world. In addition to an improved methodology, the questionnaire sent to the certification bodies has been slightly modified to also include ISO 50001:2011, Energy manage- ment systems - Requirements with guidance for use. The collection of data started in April and the final results of the survey will be known in August.

ISO survey on MSS certification by Laurent Charlet How many ISO 9001 certificates were issued in, for example, Brazil, or in the USA or in South Africa in 2010 ? Is the number of certificates increasing every year ? Which sector has the greatest num- ber of ISO 9001 certificates ? What about ISO 14001 certificates on environmental management systems ? These are just some of the questions the next ISO survey on management system standards (MSS) certification will reveal and more. The ISO survey has been issued on an annual basis and continuously improved to reveal a broad range of information on ISO management system standards certificates. This year, a particular effort was made to revise the methodology for the collection of data in order to increase, as far as possible, ISO pilots new course for chairs by Glenn Bosmans A new training course for ISO chairs and convenors was held in May 2012 at the Central Secretariat in Geneva, Switzerland. The pilot included the participation of 28 individuals, comprising six chairs and 22 convenors from Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, India, Italy, the Republic of Korea, Malaysia, the Netherlands, Sweden, Swit- zerland, the United Kingdom and the USA. A range of key skills were highlighted including knowledge of ISO procedures, running effective meetings, consensus- building, together with negotiation and leadership techniques. The course uses a variety of instruction techniques including role-plays, quizzes, Q+A sessions, job-aids and experience-sharing discussions. The course was facilitated by Gra - ham Holloway, former chair of over 60 national standards committees, as well as ISO/TC 157, Non-systemic contraceptives and STI barrier prophylactics. Participants provided positive and con- structive feedback with 96 % of respondents stating they would recommend the course to other ISO chairs or convenors.

Glenn Bosmans is Programme Manager, Participation in ISO technical work, Development and Training Services, ISO Central Secretariat.ISO technical committee ISO/TC 34, Food products, held its third plenary meeting in Nairobi, Kenya. Preceding this meeting, ISO and the Kenya Bureau of Standards (KEBS), ISO member for Kenya, organized a two- day workshop on the theme \" Standards contribution to the food sector in Africa \" that was jointly supported by the generous financial contributions of the Swedish Inter- national Development Cooperation Agency (Sida) and the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB). The workshop was opened by the Minister of Industry and Evah Oduor, the managing director of KEBS. It highlighted the importance of the food sector in Africa as a major export for the continent. Therefore, ensuring food safety and security, as well as productivity and sustainability, is of prime importance for Africas population of 1 billion people. Food safety is important at all levels of the food chain, from farm to fork, in terms of exports as well as for local consumption. This April 2012 event, presented by international experts and regional speak- ers, offered the opportunity to have an overview of the food supply chain, exposed the links and differences among the vari- ous international players, and reviewed the challenges, opportunities and solutions that a coherent implementation of standards and practices can provide to countries in Africa. Experiences and best practices were presented, drawn from leading countries in the implementation of standards in several fields involving ISO/TC 34 subcommittees. The different presentations were very much appreciated, as they provided use - ful information on different food sectors, such as coffee, cocoa or milk products. Participants shared their experiences and their knowledge, allowing different national practices to be benchmarked. Question-and-answer sessions were very useful in helping participants better under- stand the roles of the different organizations and how to contribute to their work and gain benefits from the assistance provided to improve national practices in the food sector. For instance, discussions led by major cocoa bean-producer countries such as Ghana, Cote dIvoire, Cameroon and Nigeria showed the importance of quality and sustainability for the sector in Africa. Nutrition was another key issue raised for Africa, and Kenya just took the lead for new works on nutrition within ISO/TC 34. KEBS Managing Director Eva Oduor said Africa must participate in the formulation of standards. She also urged that nutrition be included in the standards list because of the prevalent lack of proper nutrition in Africa. Two interactive workgroups gave partici- pants the opportunity to share their views and experience in smaller numbers, and allowed everyone to share and express their opinions. During the seminar, a WebEx connection allowed a live, interactive follow-up to the seminar, with simultaneous translation and slides presented both in English and French to cater to a wider audience (e.g. the French- speaking African countries) and improve the dissemination of information. The outcome was positive with the reg- istration of at least 17 African countries with ISO/TC 34 and a proposed action plan to promote the future of food safety in Africa and in its sub-regions, thanks to the assistance and cooperation of international and regional organizations and stakeholders. As Fran\u00e7ois Falconnet, Chair of ISO/TC 34, pointed out in his opening remarks to the plenary session : \" Organ- izing this meeting in Africa falls in line with ISO/TC 34's policy of promoting the participation of developing countries ; the strong African representation in our audi- ence is indicative of the great interest you have shown in the work of standardization and, through the choice of this venue, we were able to increase your participation \".Marketing and promotion training in Saint Lucia by Nicolas Fleury The first 2012 edition of the series of seminars on the marketing and promotion of ISO standards was held in Saint Lucia, at the invitation of the Saint Lucia Bureau of Standards (SLBS), ISO member for the country. The seminar was part of a training programme developed by the ISO Central Secretariat to enhance the capacity of developing countries to disseminate ISO standards and publications. It is intended to help ISO members become familiar with and implement the existing procedures to promote standards, increase their dissemi- nation and meet customer expectations in their countries. This course also helps them to gain further knowledge about the basic principles of copyright protection and ISO's policy in this respect. About 30 participants, representing 18 countries, were welcomed by Sherry Constantine, Director of SLBS, and by Emma Hippolyte, Minister for Commerce, Business Development, Investment and Consumer Affairs. During this three-day seminar, the participants learnt about aspects related to the dissemination of ISO standards, to customer requests for authorization to reproduce their content, and to copyright protection matters. The course allowed participants to share experience and consolidate links with their marketing and sales colleagues from ISO members and the Central Secretariat. The seminar also provided trainers with the opportunity to explore the use of social Participants at the first pilot training course for chairs and convenors in Geneva, Switzerland.

The participants immediately under- stood the power and the potential, both for themselves and their customers, of the new applications developed using the eXtensible Markup Language (XML). The challenge for the ISO Central Secretariat is to provide the best support to ISO members so that they can harness the full potential of such technology. This is one of the reasons why, from one seminar to the next, the course content changes. This course took place in April, and the next edition of the seminar is scheduled for October 2012.

This will ensure consistency among future and revised management system standards and make integrated use simpler. It will also make the standards easier to read and, in so doing, be understood by users. Three management system standards have already been published in this new harmon ized format with another seven on the way. Both ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 will follow the new outline during their revision process. Why ? ISO has over the years published many management system standards for topics ranging from quality and environment to information security, business continuity management and records management. Despite sharing common elements, ISO management system standards come in many different shapes and structures. This, in turn, results in some confusion and difficulties at the implementation stage. From theory to practice All technical committees developing management system standards have to fol- low Annex SL in the new consolidated ISO Supplement. Annex SL harmonizes structure, text and terms and definitions, while leaving the standards developers with the flexibility to integrate their specific technical topics and requirements. Box 1 includes the high level structure and examples of definitions and identical text. New requirements There are subtle language issues such as the change from document and records to documented information, to the use of IT and other tools to illustrate what is being done. The new text recognizes the use of the broad concept of risk and the need to understand risk in the context of the management system. It also encourages everyone to view preventive action as a broader concept than simply preventing an incident from re-occurring. No challenge is too big Any change represents challenges and opportunities. And this is no exception. Over the next few months, we will promote understanding of what this change means to avoid confusion and improve understanding among the affected technical committees, as well as among the users of the standards.

It will take a few years before all exist- ing management system standards have been fully harmonized. However, there were an impressive number of standards that used the new format as it was being developed. Two of ISOs flagship management sys- tem standards have launched their revision processes (ISO 9001 and ISO 14001) and both will use the new format for their revi- sions. Box 2 sets out the list of standards that have used the new approach. The Joint Technical Coordination Group (JTCG) is responsible for the development of the document at the request of the ISO Technical Management Board (TMB). JTCG plans to collect information on user experience in 2012. It is available to answer any questions from standards writers, although users should initially ask their standards developing community. ISO Focus + July-August 2012 ISO Focus + July-August 2012 40 41 aManagement SolutionsManagement systems integration Five lessons learnt by Saudi Arabian ICT company by Husam A. Alrashed and Osama Elmeligy Since its inception in 1998, Shabakah Net has pioneered the provision of Internet services in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and has evolved into an integrated information and communications technology (ICT) service provider capable of delivering complete end-to-end technological and operational solutions to its cus-tomers across several industries - aided by ISO management system standards (MSS) integration. From early 2011, Shabakah Net has based its business processes on the ITIL (Information Technology Infrastructure Library), eTOM (enhanced Telecoms Operations Map), and Six Sigma busi - ness management frameworks. Shabakah was also the first Saudi ICT company to be awarded ISO 9001:2008 (quality), ISO/IEC 27001:2005 (information security) and ISO/IEC 20000-1:2011 (information technology service management) certifi- cations in recognition of its management practices and customer-focused processes. This integrated ISO management stand- ards-based system has elevated our products and services to a higher level of competi- tiveness and sustainability. In this article, we review the experiences of Shabakah Net in implementing the ISO MSS in an effective and efficient manner, and highlight the five key lessons learnt from the process. Lesson 1 : organizational culture Implementing an integrated management systems model that conforms to ISO MSS has liberated us from old constraints by helping the organization to evolve new concepts and aspects in the information technology (IT) environment. This has enabled Shabakah Net to enhance its managed services, service quality and security level, and control its key performance indicators (KPIs) to meet busi- ness needs more effectively. The end result is that we enhance customer satisfaction by fulfilling their requirements more closely.Lesson 2 : going beyond conformity to excellence We learned from implementing an inte - grated management system that performance and process improvements have no limita - tions, so we saw it as a platform towards excellence in performance and a means to continually improve our processes. Our approach is to measure every activity or pro - cess by using KPIs to judge our perform ance. We have established two important values for each KPI - the hard (HT) and soft (ST) thresholds. The HT is the maximum value of the KPI, and represents a barrier that must not be breached if we are to achieve accept - able performance for the process. Then each time we enhance a process, we set the ST, a new maximum value for the KPI that establishes a new maximum acceptable performance level for the pro- cess, below HT - the area between HT and ST is the degree of freedom. To achieve excellence in performance, we enlarge the degree of freedom by continually enhancing the process and reducing the ST value, so whenever we face any variation or anomaly in process performance, we never breach the HT. We apply this approach to all our pro- cesses to reach excellence in performance. Lesson 3 : integrating security via ISO/IEC 27001 Understanding and conforming to ISO/IEC 27001 elevates the security standard bar and leads us to innovate two important policies, first is \"QITMAN\" ( ,)our security policy. QITMAN is an Arabic word meaning secrecy and confidentiality. The second policy is \"DARAA\" ( ,)our risk management approach, based on the Arabic for prevention, and for avoiding and mitigating the impact of a potential risk. We talk of \" integrating security \" rather than \" implementing a security standard \", because we feel that information security must be an integral part of our decisions, policies, practices, services and relationships, and part of our total responsibility. In our company security is visible, audible and practiced via a thorough understanding of ISO/IEC 27001. Lesson 4 : enhancing customer satisfaction Previously we used a customer survey model to measure customer satisfaction, and by analyzing the survey input, we took immediate action to resolve any issues of dissatisfied customers, converting them into satisfied customers. However, using this model meant we solved problems reactively, which cost us financially and in other ways. Shabakah Nets integrated ISO MSS changed our way of thinking about customer satisfaction, so we decided to shift to a proactive model by continually improving our processes and policies to maintain the customer satisfaction indicator within the predefined target. The proactive model enables us to regularly identify and monitor any single issue causing customer dissatisfaction, and ensure we take the appropriate action in time to avoid cost to our organiza- tion. Figure 1 illustrates Shabakah Nets customer satisfaction life cycle, starting from the enumeration of KPIs through the continual process of enhancing customer satisfaction. Its objective is to proactively avoid any issues that may affect customer satisfaction, and dramatically enhance customer satisfaction KPIs to ensure that we provide the best possible service. Lesson 5 : enhanced decision-making process Factual decision making is one of the eight Quality Management Principles in ISO 9000. Guided by those principles, we have improved our decision-making process in three ways : 1. Shabakah Nets integrated manage- ment system enhanced how we gather and analyze data by dealing with the root cause instead of symptoms. We have established an internal policy for keeping and controlling records - the main source of our organizational data. This policy affects the quality of our decision making, and promotes complete, accurate, and timely records. 2. We have restructured our organi-zational chart based on the inte-grated model and have changed the Shabakah Net's integrated ISO MSS changed our way of thinking about customer satisfaction.Present at Shabakah Nets ISO 9001, ISO/IEC 27001 and ISO/IEC 20000 certification award ceremony were (from left to right) Abdul Aziz Omar Karamah, Executive Secretary to the CEO ; Haitham Abdul Kader, Key Account Manager ; Attieb Khalil, Regional Sales Manager ; Abdul Aziz Khan, Key Account Manager ; Mohammed Hamada, Corporate Account Manager ; Husam Alrashed, CEO ; Abdul Ghaffar M.

Standards in ActionStandards in Action DHL How ISO standards deliver Chris Hillis, Managing Director of DHL Express Switzerland, and Roman Bisig, Managing Director of DHL Freight Switzerland, sit down with ISO Focus+ to discuss the role of International Standards and how the company benefits. International Standards offer this com- mon language and help to secure a valid and proven understanding of procedures and business principles. DHL recognizes the importance of standards which enable proper controls, together with the flexibility to grow an efficient and reliable interna- tional network. Roman Bisig:\u0003 International Standards are of the highest importance to us, both internally and externally. We continuously improve our internal procedures by implementing clearly structured processes and, by so doing, help to minimize errors. This leads to increased profits, satisfied customers and legal requirements being met (e.g. list of applicable laws). At the end of the day, we have a competitive advantage by meeting customers' requirements. ISO Focus+ :\u0003 Can you describe the use made by DHL of ISO 9001 and how has this evolved over the years ? What concrete benefitshasISO9001brought the company ?ISO Focus+ :\u0003 For DHL, the company's greatest growth came in the 1980s when it expanded into countries that could not be served by any other delivery service. In the context of trade globalization, what is the strategic importance of Interna- tional Standards for a global company such as DHL ? International Standards are of highest importance to us.The benefits of these two management system standards are numerous. Chris Hillis:\u0003 DHL Express Switzerland has been working with quality standards for more than 30 years. In 1995, DHL was officially certified to ISO 9001. Since then, DHL in Switzerland continually improves its management system along with the International Standards developed by ISO. In 1995, DHL Express Switzerland suc- cessfully passed the ISO 14001 certification. Both sets of standards play an important role in our daily business practice, and strongly support the continual improve- ment of our quality and environmental management systems.Over the years, DHL staff has increased their awareness of quality and the environ- ment and the value of standards. An added benefit for DHL is the awareness by its customers and other stakeholders that the company is a reliable partner, working with known and proven standards. Roman Bisig:\u0003 As with DHL Express Switzerland, DHL Freight Switzerland implemented and obtained official cer- tification to ISO 9001 in 1995 followed by certification to ISO 14001 in 2005. The benefits of these two management system standards are numerous, but the most important is the process itself. This process-driven approach helps us to better describe, analyze and improve the existing way of doing business. ISO Focus+ :\u0003 It was recently announced that DHL would become the official partner of Denmark's European Union presidency supplying all ministers with GOGREEN services and sustainable products. Canyoubrieflydescribe this project ? How do ISO standards for environmental management (ISO 14001), energy management (ISO 50001) and social responsibility (ISO 26000) align with your GOGREEN initiative ? Chris Hillis:\u0003 GOGREEN means accepting responsibility for the environment and the world we live and do business in. It is a programme aimed at significantly improving our CO2 efficiency. Within GOGREEN, we are committed to minimizing environmental impacts with specific measurable initiatives. In addition, we offer the GOGREEN service which secures the offsetting of CO2 emissions due to door-to-door ship- ments. The offsetting is done via selected carbon offsetting projects which are financed through the company's carbon fund. To date, ISO 50001 and ISO 26000 are being applied.efficient vehicles, use rail and intermodal transport, and support DHL staff in their use of public transportation.

The results are dangerous goods, premature failures, more expensive legitimate products and a loss of confidence. So how can consumers trust claims made by manufacturers and sales people ? Are enforcement agencies doing their job ? How can ISO help ? Industry and Trade in Nadi, Fiji, in May 2012. Over 145 representatives from consumer organizations, public authorities and industry from more than 20 countries came together to discuss how International Standards and These were the questions asked at the annual workshop of the ISO Committee on consumer policy (ISO/COPOLCO), which looked at, \" How do consumers know what they are getting ? \" hosted by the Ministry of Trade in counterfeit products amounts to over USD 500 billion annually.good market surveillance programmes can protect consumer health and safety, combat fraud and prevent product misrepresentation. \" The ISO Strategic Plan 2011-2015 rec- ognizes that the advice and involvement of consumer stakeholders is essential to ISOs overall performance and success, \" explained the Chair of ISO/COPOLCO, Norma McCor- mick, \" ISO/COPOLCOs mandate is to ensure that the concerns of consumers are taken into account in ISO standards. We provide a forum to identify and recommend to ISO new and current areas of interest to consumers.\" A bigger issue Consumers around the world, but par- ticularly in poor and remote areas, have been victims of double labeling, imita- tion, incomplete information, deceptive packaging, false claims, and misleading or inadequate measurements. \" The Pacific region has been an easy target for traders exporting low cost, sub-standard, and coun- terfeit products, \" said Attorney General and Minister for Industry and Trade Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum in his opening address. \" I urge you to consider ... why these goods are so easily peddled, \" he added. \" It is not just an issue of unscrupulous companies and marketing tactics, but it is also one of enforcement, adequate resources and, of course, poverty... Demand creates supply.\" For example, fines that are dispropor- tionately high will open the door to bribery and corruption. Similarly, an impoverished population will take the risks associated with fake goods if legitimate ones are unaf - fordable. Solutions must address specific local challenges, and education is crucial for both consumers and business. Participants concluded that counterfeiting and fraud were fuelled by : Rising volume of global trade and e-commerce Lack of consumer awareness and information Involvement of organized crime Minimal and inconsistent enforcement and penalties Consumer demand and economic pressures driven by high prices and poverty. We are part of the problem Yet consumers must also make informed and responsible purchasing decisions, urged Ms. McCormick. \" We must recognize that we, as consumers, are part of the problem. Therefore, it is important that we become part of the solution.\" Participants emphasized over and over again that consumers have a responsibility to be informed and vigilant. Counterfeiting and fraud endanger our safety and that of our families. So what can we do ? Take photographs. Recognize quality marks. And if something does not add up, ask, advised Rae Dulmage, Director Standards Depart- ment at Underwriters Laboratories Canada - an organization whose aggressive stance against counterfeiting, involves education, enforcement and partnerships.\" If the price is too good to be true, ask yourself why, \" added Doug Geralde, Regu- lator Relations Advisor at the Canadian Standards Association. His own advice to consumers included checking packaging and labeling, acting on recalls, informing manufacturers about failures and buying from reputable sources.traceability of goods throughout the supply chain, design with safety first, monitor the market and promote market surveillance. Nothing to declare \" Customs is at the very center of the battle against counterfeiting and fraud,\" said Mr. Watisoni Rauicava, National Manager, Border Control, Fiji Revenue and Customs Authority. However, officers do not always have sufficient experience and knowledge. Close collaboration between government agencies and the private sector is essential to share information and best practice in order to detect and capture counterfeit goods at the border. As the World Customs Organization Secretary General said in a congress on the subject, \" Each of us has a part to play, but we must play our part together \". Solutions ahead Partnership and cooperation are at the very heart of the ISO system, which brings all stakeholders together to develop practical global solutions. Two ISO committees are particularly relevant : ISO/PC 246, Anti-counterfeiting tools ISO/TC 247, Fraud countermeasures and controls The standards being developed by these committees will help prevent, detect and control identity, financial, product and other forms of social and economic fraud. By promoting strong authentication and secu- rity, these standards will bring confidence to consumers, government and industry.

One advocate was Premila Kumar from the Consumer Council of Fiji, who highlighted the plight of the Pacific islands, which are far from the countries that manufacture many of the goods that they use, and therefore particularly vulnerable.Break-out sessions allowed participants to exchange thoughts and ideas. Education and information are crucial.Prime Minister of Fiji opens ISO consumer plenary Emphasizing the importance of consumers to the economy and the need to ensure their safety and well-being, the Prime Minister of Fiji, Mr. Josaia Voreqe Bainimarama, officially opened the 34th plenary of the ISO Committee on consumer policy (ISO/COPOLCO). Some 94 participants from 23 countries attended the event which took place in May, in Nadi, Fiji, hosted by the Ministry of Industry and Trade. \" Our hosting of the ISO/COPOLCO meeting is another commitment of my Government's will to enhance consumer protection and enforce standards nationally, and to collaborate internationally, \" said Prime Minister Bainimarama. \" I must congratulate ISO/COPOLCO for its unwavering commitment to promoting consumer interests and ensuring they are addressed at a global level. For the past 33 years, ISO/COPOLCO has made a tremendous contribution towards policies that strengthen consumer safety through standards development and the promotion of fair trade and environmentally safe products.\" He added that consumers were among the first to call for the development of standards for environmental management, resulting in the ISO 14000 series. Consumers were also at the forefront of ISO's decision to develop an International Standard on social responsibility (ISO 26000). Addressing the needs of all stakeholders - including consumers - is key when developing policies and standards to ensure multi- level engagement, credibility and tangible outcomes, explained the Prime Minister. Not only does this ensure market-relevance, but enhances consumer confidence, while enabling goods and services to circulate freely within and across borders. But the Prime Minister warned, \" This requires all countries to commit and adhere to internationally acceptable standards and practices.\" He emphasized that in today's globalized trade and commerce practices, there must be international collaboration, citing as an example the ISO/COPOLCO plenary.\" Given the increasing complexities and relevance of consumer-related issues, such as fraud and the trading of counterfeit products, this week's meetings are very timely for consumers around the world, \" he concluded, highlighting the value of these discussions to enhance global standards and practices, while giving impetus to national systems. Thanking the hosts, ISO Vice-President (policy) Sadao Takeda said, \" It is proof of your great commitment that despite the damage caused by the recent floods in your country, you have offered us a warm and excellent welcome.\" Mr. Takeda then went on to highlight the benefits of the ISO system as a medium for seeking solutions on behalf of all stakeholders, including consumers. \" What makes ISO so effective is that it provides a non-political, non-partisan platform. Standards are developed through open, transparent processes by representatives of the people that need them, implement them, are affected by them - and who can review and continually improve the results of their implementation, \" he said. Drawing attention to the valuable role of ISO/COPOLCO, Mr. Takeda concluded, \" Consumers are both a compass and a driving force for standards development, your discussions and recommendations during this plenary will help strengthen ISO's efforts.\"Prime Minister of Fiji Josaia Voreqe Bainimarama (left) and ISO Vice-President (policy) Sadao Takeda receive garlands to honour their presence at the opening of the ISO/COPOLCO plenary. Even some of the authorities dont know this, \" said Guillermo Zucal, from IRAM, ISO member for Argentina. Although the country has systems in place to protect consumers, the biggest challenge is rais- ing awareness of the issues among the general population, such as the existence of compliance marks. But Arnold Pindar, from ANEC, the Euro- pean consumer organization, believes that a single mark is not the solution. Consumers place more trust in brands, retailers and advice from friends than in certification marks. All laws and regulations are worthless without effective market surveillance and enforcement, he said. What ISO can do Participants concluded that international cooperation is essential to fight counterfeiting and fraud. They called for better practices in border protection, sharing of information within and across countries (for example, for product recalls and seizures), increasing awareness among consumers (including risks and where to seek recourse), and more transparency and traceability throughout the supply chain. So how can ISO help ? ISO standards provide practical solutions that can be imple- mented all over the world to address the needs of industry, government and consumers. They harmonize efforts, spread best practice and increase confidence. Participants therefore suggested that ISO tackle the following areas in the fight against counterfeiting and fraud : Additional guidance on market surveillance Comparative testing Consistent classification and formats for reporting and sharing incident data on a global scale. Maria Lazarte is Assistant Editor, ISO Focus+.by ISO/PC 246 has already been published. The standard will help organizations of all types and sizes to validate the authenticity of material goods. ISO/TC 247 is currently working on two standards : A security management system for fraud countermeasures and controls An anti-counterfeiting track and trace method using unique identifier numberingShort measure Another area where we can develop solu- tions is through metrology - the science of measurement, explained John Birch, AM Honorary Board Member, International Organization of Legal Metrology. Standard- ized measurements can be used to protect consumers against short measure and fraud. Throughout history, fraud has been endemic in trade measurements, whether through lack of transparency, manipulating technology to distort results (e.g. taximeters) or simply by using inappropriate quanti- ties. For example, petroleum is sold by volume not energy content, but temperature variations can result in up to 2 % effective short measure. What can be done ? Standard size packag- ing and requirements, clear and appropriate quantity labeling, unit pricing and quality marks, can provide consumer protection - particularly important as pre-packaged goods now dominate retail food purchases, increasingly crossing borders. Acting on promises \" To promise is one thing, to deliver is another. Proof in the form of conformity assessment is needed, \" emphasized Olivier Peyrat, Director General of AFNOR, ISO member for France. The ISO Committee on conformity assess- ment (ISO/CASCO) has developed numerous standards and guides on testing, inspections and management system implementation to ensure that consumers know what they are getting. \" For those companies that are too recent, too small or too remote, good conformity assessment, preferably against an International Standard, can help achieve consumer confidence, \" said Mr. Peyrat. He also suggested that implementation of ISO 26000 on social responsibility, can promote consumer trust. Market surveillance Conformity assessment standards can be used in market surveillance, one of the solutions that participants agreed upon, was essential to address counterfeiting. Governments should increase the regulatory power of market surveillance and consumer protection, advised Graeme Drake, speaking on behalf of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE). He also emphasized that International Standards for market surveillance terminology can make it easier for countries to work together. \" Non-compliance and counterfeiting are increasing and becoming more difficult to detect, \" he said. UNECE is working to counter these trends by making recom- mendations to governments, developing a database of market surveillance authorities, promoting best practice and raising aware- ness. He emphasized the importance of col - laborating with ISO, and invited increased cooperation with ISO/COPOLCO.Ms. Kumar explained that if a product is recalled in another country, the Pacific islands are not always informed. And often, products are labelled in languages they do not understand. She also called for improved market surveillance, enhanced consumer involvement and strong deterrent measures, such as compensations to users. Indonesia has introduced a Consumer Protection Law addressing regulation, sur- veillance and education, said Nus Nuzulia Ishak, from the Indonesian Ministry of Trade. She explained that market surveillance is the joint effort of the government, society (consumers) and consumer protection NGOs. Carlos Amorin from ABNT, ISO member for Brazil, highlighted the challenges faced by the country, such as its large territorial exten- sion and the low level of consumer claims. However, with a system in place for inspec- tions and conformity checking, Brazil ensures a high level of conformity and compliance.

Efficiency refers to the ability of an organization to achieve objectives with optimal quality and minimal waste, expense, or unnecessary effort. It helps organizations maximize profits and meet their goals, and is key to success in today's challenging and competitive economic environment. International Standards are crucial for promoting efficiency, which is why the theme of this year's World Standards Day (WSD) is \" Less waste, better results - Standards increase efficiency \". This is also the subject of the special report of the September 2012 ISO Focus+. WSD is organized annually on the 14 October, by the three sister organizations making up the World Standards Cooperation - the International Electrotechnical Com-mission (IEC), ISO and the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). \" In today's highly competitive and complex world, the issue of sustainability, viewed from an economic, environmental and societal perspective, means that busi- nesses must be more efficient across a wide range of measures and issues, \" say the IEC, ISO and ITU leaders in their WSD 2012 message. \" International Standards are powerful tools for helping organizations capitalize on their potential in the global marketplace. Developed by experts from around the world, they contain internationally harmon- ized best practice which can be used to measure, compare and increase efficiency and reduce waste. \" For example, by providing common specifications, International Standards enable products, services and technology from different vendors to fit together like pieces in a puzzle. They support interoperability and compatibility, providing a solid base for developing innovations and facilitating market access to new products. They ensure that countries, organizations, regulators and researchers do not have to reinvent the wheel, and can invest in other priorities.\" The September 2012 issue of ISO Focus+ will showcase a number of examples of standards that are making a difference, such as innovative additive manufactur- ing, environmental efficiency, credit card transactions and project management. Find out how International Standards not only make good business sense, but con-tribute to a more efficient and sustainable world in the September issue ! Efficiency Clean cookstoves to save lives Exposure to smoke from traditional cookstoves and open fires causes two million premature deaths annually, with women and young children among the most affected. To reduce this risk and facilitate the large-scale adoption of clean cooking solutions, stakeholders have recognized the need for an Inter-national Standard to define criteria for cookstove performance. In June 2012, a major step was taken for clean, efficient and safe cookstoves, with the approval of an ISO Interna- tional Workshop Agreement (IWA) ISO IWA 10:2012, Guidelines for evaluating cookstove performance. Just out by Roger Frost ISO has just published a new standard to support the organizers of events of all types - sporting, business, cultural, political - in inte- grating sustainability with their activities. event can also generate negative economic, environmental and social impacts, such as material waste, energy consumption and strains on local communities. ISO 20121 provides the framework for identifying the potentially negative social, economic and environmental impacts of events by removing or reducing them, and capitalizing on more positive impacts through improved planning and processes. Among the stakeholders who have provided input to the development of the standard are members of the sustainability team for the London Organising Committee ISO 20121:2012, Event sustainability management systems - Requirements with guidance for use, is suitable for ensuring that events, ranging from local celebrations to \" mega events \" such as the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games, leave behind a posi - tive legacy.

ISO 20121 has been created by the event industry for the event industry. More than 30 countries and liaison bodies participated in the work. Fiona Pelham, Chair of the ISO team of experts who developed ISO 20121, com- ments : \" The development process has been led by members of the event industry from around the world who have experience of event management and sustainability leader- ship initiatives. Among its key benefits are : Best business practice It makes sense to take an organized, processed approach to managing economic, environmental and social impacts.
