According to the WHO coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) dashboard, there are more than 127.8 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection and more than 2.7 million deaths worldwide as of March 29th 2021 with a fatality rate of 2.19%. The COVID-19 pandemic has not only affected the health of infected individuals but has also disrupted many aspects of our everyday life. People have become aware of the importance of immune function and interested in strategies to improve it. Optimal immune function is important for defenses against and recovery from viral infections. Nutritional status, immune function, and viral infection are closely interrelated. Undernutrition impairs immune function, which can lead to increased susceptibility to viral infection. Meanwhile, viral infection can result in changes in nutritional status that may further exacerbate the course of infection or delay viral clearance. Deficiency of any nutrient can cause an impaired immune response; however, several nutrients have been shown to play more significant roles than others in modulation of immune function and viral infection. Here, we review the nutrients reported to have a significant impact on immune responses, particularly the control of viral infection, and discuss the implications for COVID-19. The roles of vitamins A, C, D, and E, and zinc, iron, and selenium in immune function and viral infection and their relevance to COVID-19 will be reviewed. COVID-19 AND IMMUNE RESPONSES [2](#B2-nrp-15-S1)]. SARS-CoV-2 binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors and enters the cells in the airway of the host. Replicated viruses infect bronchial epithelial cells, type I and type II alveolar pneumocytes, and capillary endothelial cells. The that are produced recruit monocytes, macrophages, and T cells to the infection site. The immune response of the host is one factor that determines the severity of COVID-19. With a healthy immune response, neutralizing antibodies inactivate viruses, macrophages clear neutralized viruses, CD8+ T cells eliminate virus-infected cells, and CD4+ T cells mediate efficient immune responses. However, when the immune response is dysfunctional, overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines occurs and leads to a cytokine storm and multi-organ damage [ [2](#B2-nrp-15-S1)]. Therefore, effective and controlled immune responses are critical for efficient early clearance of viruses and prevention of excessive inflammatory responses. [3](#B3-nrp-15-S1)]. NUTRITIONAL CHANGES WITH COVID-19 AND VIRAL INFECTION [4](#B4-nrp-15-S1)]. On the other hand, the adoption of healthier dietary habits, reflected by a higher adherence to the Mediterranean Diet, in the studied population (n = 7,514) was reported in Spain during the COVID-19 confinement [ [5](#B5-nrp-15-S1)]. The purpose of the Spanish COVIDiet study was to evaluate the changes in dietary behavior during the COVID-19 confinement. Data related to the Mediterranean diet, intake of processed foods, changes in food choices, and weight gain were collected by an online questionnaire. The major difference in the surveyed individuals between the 2 studies was their age; 81.9% of the studied population was younger than 35 years in the Polish study, while only 34.0% of the studied population was younger than 35 years in the Spanish study. Changes in eating behavior affect nutrient intake, resulting in altered nutrition status. [6](#B6-nrp-15-S1)]. Among 1,020 hospitalized patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in Israel, folic acid levels were available from 333 patients, and 38 patients (11.4%) had low folate levels (< 5.9 ng/mL), but an association between low folate levels and clinical outcomes was not observed [ [7](#B7-nrp-15-S1)]. A retrospective analysis of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations in plasma from patients from Switzerland showed that 25(OH)D levels were lower in patients with SARS-CoV-2 positive polymerase chain reaction results (median value, 11.1 ng/mL) than in those with negative results (24.6 ng/mL) [ [8](#B8-nrp-15-S1)]. Im et al. [ [9](#B9-nrp-15-S1)] reported that vitamin D levels were significantly lower in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 (mean value, 15.7 ng/mL, n = 50) than in a healthy control group matched by age and sex (25.0 ng/mL, n = 150). Overall, 76% of patients with COVID-19 were vitamin D deficient and 42% were selenium deficient. VITAMIN C Role of vitamin C [10](#B10-nrp-15-S1)]. Vitamin C can strengthen the epithelial barrier function against pathogens through synthesis of collagen and protect against oxidative stress by promoting scavenging activity. In addition, vitamin C can adjust gene expression in dermal fibroblasts, enhancing their proliferation and migration, which are important for tissue remodeling and wound healing [ [11](#B11-nrp-15-S1)]. Vitamin C enhances migration of neutrophils to infection sites in response to chemoattractants, enhances phagocytosis of microbes, and stimulates the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and destruction of microbes. It is also needed for neutrophil apoptosis from sites of infection to protect the host tissue from potential damage. For adaptive immunity, vitamin C promotes the differentiation and proliferation of B and T cells, possibly through its gene regulating effects [ [10](#B10-nrp-15-S1)]. Similar effects on proliferation and differentiation have been observed in natural killer (NK) cells [ [12](#B12-nrp-15-S1)]. Moreover, vitamin C may help inhibit age-related impairments in immune function. High vitamin C intake has been reported to suppress age-induced thymic atrophy and maintain T cell production in mice, which is crucial for preventing the deterioration of T cell function that occurs with age [ [13](#B13-nrp-15-S1)]. Therefore, vitamin C deficiency can impair immune function and result in increased susceptibility to infections. Effects of vitamin C on viral infection [14](#B14-nrp-15-S1)]. These protective effects include increased resistance of chick embryos and tracheal organs to avian coronavirus after ingestion of vitamin C. High plasma concentrations of vitamin C have been shown to be associated with enhanced immune function, such as antibody responses, neutrophil function, and antiviral activity in animal studies [ [10](#B10-nrp-15-S1)]. In a study of mice exposed to influenza A virus (H3N2), vitamin C was shown to be an essential factor for antiviral immune response by producing interferon (IFN)-/ during the early stages of infection [ [15](#B15-nrp-15-S1)]. [16](#B16-nrp-15-S1)]. In addition, the study concluded that high-dose supplementation is not necessary for general community but may be reasonable during periods of heavy physical stress. A more recent meta-analysis of 9 RCTs found that the combination of extra doses of vitamin C (0.7 to 8 g/day) and a daily supplemental dose (no more than 1 g/day) reduced the duration of the common cold and relieved symptoms [ [17](#B17-nrp-15-S1)]. [18](#B18-nrp-15-S1)]. Excessive increases in inflammatory cytokines and chemokines at once, which is called a cytokine storm, is a cause of severity in some conditions, such as sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Excessive generation of cytokines increases neutrophil infiltration, leading to neutrophil extracellular traps (NETosis). NETosis is a cell death pathway that leads to tissue injury, organ damage, and the development of multi-organ failure. Evidence suggests that vitamin C can regulate this process. Vitamin C infusion has been shown to attenuate NETosis induced by sepsis in vitamin C-deficient Gulo/ mice model [ [19](#B19-nrp-15-S1)]. Moreover, vitamin C supplementation decreased serum levels of TNF- and IL-6 and enhanced superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione levels in a rat ARDS model [ [20](#B20-nrp-15-S1)]. [14](#B14-nrp-15-S1)]. In severe cases, high-dose intravenous vitamin C may be required to achieve high enough levels to compensate for the turnover of the vitamin in the body. A meta-analysis of intravenous vitamin C supplementation (200 mg/kg body weight/day) in the critically ill patients found that it shortened the intensive care unit (ICU) stay and decreased the need for mechanical ventilation [ [21](#B21-nrp-15-S1)]. In addition, an RCT involving patients with sepsis-associated ARDS reported that administration of ~15 g/day of intravenous vitamin C for 4 days decreased 28-day all-cause mortality; however, it did not improve organ function scores or inflammatory markers [ [22](#B22-nrp-15-S1)]. Relevance to COVID-19 [23](#B23-nrp-15-S1)]. A cytokine storm can damage the lung tissue by uncontrolled inflammation and is regarded as a key factor in the progression to ARDS. Considering the beneficial effects of large doses of vitamin C in sepsis and ARDS, high-dose vitamin C may have beneficial applicability in patients with COVID-19. More than 20 clinical trials studying the therapeutic effects of vitamin C alone or in combination with other substances are registered on clinicaltrials.gov [ [24](#B24-nrp-15-S1)]. Results from these ongoing or just completed clinical trials will help to produce definitive evidence in the near future. A recent review proposed that much higher doses of intravenous vitamin C may be required to reduce the cytokine storm in ARDS that occurs during the late stage of COVID-19 [ [25](#B25-nrp-15-S1)]. VITAMIN D Role of vitamin D [26](#B26-nrp-15-S1)]. Upon discovery of CYP27B1 and VDR expression in immune cells, including macrophages, T cells and B cells, the role of vitamin D in immunity has been highlighted [ [27](#B27-nrp-15-S1) [28](#B28-nrp-15-S1)]. Overall, vitamin D has been reported to have inhibitory effects on the adaptive immune system by inhibiting Th1 and Th17 responses and decreasing the proliferation of T and B cells; in contrast, it has relatively stimulatory effects on innate immune cells specifically monocytes and macrophages. Vitamin D has been reported to suppress the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs). The effects of vitamin D on NK cell activity remain unclear because enhanced lytic activity of NK cells, inhibited NK cytotoxicity, or no changes in NK cytotoxicity have been reported with in vitro vitamin D treatment. In particular, vitamin D induces monocyte proliferation and regulates the expression of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), such as cathelicidin (LL37), beta-defensin2 (DEFB4), and IL-1, thereby contributing to innate immune responses in respiratory tract infections (RTIs) [ [29](#B29-nrp-15-S1)]. Effects of vitamin D on viral infection [30](#B30-nrp-15-S1)]. AMPs, also known as host defense peptides, function as an important first line of defense against bacterial, viral, or fungal infections of eukaryotic organisms by killing microorganisms directly or by affecting other innate immune cells. 1,25(OH)2D and VDR complex directly induce the antibiotic protein LL37 in monocytes and neutrophils by binding to the LL37 [ [31](#B31-nrp-15-S1) [32](#B32-nrp-15-S1)]. Peripheral blood monocyte LL37 expression has been reported to be positively correlated with variations in serum 25(OH)D levels and significantly enhanced by exogenous 25(OH)D treatment [ [32](#B32-nrp-15-S1)]. Human DEFB4, which is expressed in monocytes, macrophages, and DCs, also contains a VDRE in the proximal promoter site [ [31](#B31-nrp-15-S1)]. Human DEFB4 is modestly induced by 1,25(OH)2D and enhances protection against viral infection [ [31](#B31-nrp-15-S1) [33](#B33-nrp-15-S1)]. [34](#B34-nrp-15-S1) [35](#B35-nrp-15-S1) [36](#B36-nrp-15-S1)]. A retrospective analysis of the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey of 18,883 patients showed an increased prevalence of upper RTIs in people with serum 25(OH)D levels less than 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L) when compared with a subgroup of individuals with 25(OH)D levels higher than 30 ng/mL [ [37](#B37-nrp-15-S1)]. Furthermore, according to a meta-analysis that assessed the preventive effect of vitamin D intake on RTIs, vitamin D supplementation showed a protective effect against RTIs and this effect was stronger with daily doses than with a bolus dose [ [38](#B38-nrp-15-S1)]. Although several studies have reported contradictory results showing no significant difference in 25(OH)D levels between patients with RTIs and control subjects [ [35](#B35-nrp-15-S1) [39](#B39-nrp-15-S1)], vitamin D may have a beneficial role in the respiratory tract in response to viruses by induction of AMPs. Relevance to COVID-19 [40](#B40-nrp-15-S1)]. On the other hand, a negative correlation between vitamin D levels and COVID-19 cases [ [41](#B41-nrp-15-S1)] and negative correlations between the mean vitamin D levels and the number of COVID-19 cases/1 M population were observed in 20 European countries [ [42](#B42-nrp-15-S1)]. Kaufman et al. [ [43](#B43-nrp-15-S1)] reported that there is a strong negative correlation between circulating 25(OH)D levels and SARS-CoV-2 positivity, regardless of latitude, ethnicity, sex, and age. A total of 191,779 patients from all 50 states with SARS-CoV-2 results and matching 25(OH)D results from the preceding 12 months were included in the study. Patients with vitamin D deficiency (25(OH)D < 20 ng/mL) showed a significantly higher SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate than patients in subgroups with higher vitamin D levels (30-34 ng/mL and > 55 ng/mL). [44](#B44-nrp-15-S1)]. The authors screened 4 compound libraries: a United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug library, an ACE2-targeted compound library, a flavonoid compound library, and a natural product library. Among them, only 1,25(OH)2D mediated inhibition of SARS-CoV-2. VITAMIN A Role of vitamin A [45](#B45-nrp-15-S1)]. Retinoic acid enhances cytotoxicity and T cell proliferation in part by enhancing IL-2 secretion and promotes Th2 differentiation by inducing Il4 gene expression and Th2-cell promoting transcription factors, such as GATA3. Retinoic acid blocks the differentiation of Th17 cells and enhances the induction of regulatory T cells (Treg cells) [ [29](#B29-nrp-15-S1)]. Retinoic acid promotes upregulates gut-homing receptors [ [29](#B29-nrp-15-S1) [45](#B45-nrp-15-S1)]; therefore, vitamin A is especially important for gut immunity and integrity, which explains why vitamin A deficiency puts children at risk for diarrhea. Effects of vitamin A on viral infection [46](#B46-nrp-15-S1)]. [47](#B47-nrp-15-S1)]. Vitamin A deficiency is also associated with dysregulated immune responses to influenza virus and increased mortality rates after bacterial coinfections. Vitamin A-deficient mice failed to recruit CD4+ T cells to the lungs and their viral titers were higher than the vitamin A-sufficient mice and viral clearance was delayed [ [48](#B48-nrp-15-S1)]. Relevance to COVID-19 [49](#B49-nrp-15-S1)] reviewed the relevance of vitamin A to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The authors suggested that vitamin A may play a role in COVID-19 by maintaining innate and adaptive immunity to promote clearance of primary infection and to reduce the risk of secondary infections. In addition, it may play a role in the respiratory tract by minimizing inflammation, supporting repair of the respiratory epithelium, and preventing fibrosis. Vitamin A deficiency can develop during COVID-19 due to specific effects on lung and liver stores caused by inflammation and impaired kidney function, which may necessitate vitamin A supplementation to restore its status. However, vitamin A status and the levels and duration of vitamin A supplementation should be carefully considered because excessive vitamin A intake is associated with toxicity and because vitamin A storage in the body varies among individuals. Furthermore, vitamin A supplementation may restrain the adverse effects of SARS-CoV2 on the angiotensin system as well as counterbalance the adverse effects of COVID-19 therapies. However, evidence specific to COVID-19 is needed to support these suggestions. [45](#B45-nrp-15-S1)]. Therefore, the use of serum retinol during inflammation to assess the vitamin A status may be problematic, and vitamin A status in individuals with COVID-19 should be interpreted in the context of each individual's inflammation status. VITAMIN E Role of vitamin E [50](#B50-nrp-15-S1)]. [50](#B50-nrp-15-S1) [51](#B51-nrp-15-S1)]. In vitro treatment with vitamin E enhanced the cell division and IL-2 producing capacity of na\u00efve T cells, increased the percentage of CD4+ T cells capable of forming an effective immune synapse, and reversed age-associated defects in the phosphorylation of linker for activation of T cells in CD4+ T cells from old animals [ [52](#B52-nrp-15-S1) [53](#B53-nrp-15-S1)]. Effects of vitamin E on viral infection [50](#B50-nrp-15-S1) [54](#B54-nrp-15-S1)]. Vitamin E alleviated the excessive production of TNF- in old mice [ [54](#B54-nrp-15-S1)]. [50](#B50-nrp-15-S1) [51](#B51-nrp-15-S1)]. Relevance to COVID-19 [55](#B55-nrp-15-S1)]. ZINC Role of zinc [56](#B56-nrp-15-S1)]. Nearly 2 billion individuals in the developing world are estimated to be affected by a nutritional zinc deficiency. Zinc deficiency is related not only to inadequate intake but also to malabsorption of zinc from the diet. Nutritional zinc deficiency is caused by a phytate, a potent inhibitor of zinc absorption, which is present in staple foods such as unrefined cereal in developing countries [ [57](#B57-nrp-15-S1)]. Since zinc plays critical roles in multiple aspects of the immune system, zinc deficiency affects the development and function of immune cells, including neutrophils, NK cells, and macrophages, and negatively affects the proliferation and function of T and B cells [ [58](#B58-nrp-15-S1)]. According to the World Health Report by the WHO [ [59](#B59-nrp-15-S1)], zinc deficiency is responsible for approximately 16% of lower RTIs. Effects of zinc on viral infection [60](#B60-nrp-15-S1)]. Furthermore, zinc administration within 24 h after the onset of common flu symptoms reduced the duration of the flu [ [61](#B61-nrp-15-S1)]. According to a review by Overbeck et al. [ [62](#B62-nrp-15-S1)], these beneficial effects of zinc on viral infection are related to inhibition of viral replication and modulation of immune cells by reducing cytokine production. First, binding of positively charged zinc ions (Zn2+) with negatively charged regions of rhinovirus can inhibit viral binding of ICAM-1. Second, IFN- production induced by zinc can contribute to its antiviral action. In addition, the inhibitory effect of zinc on prostaglandin metabolism has been suggested as a potential mechanism of action of zinc against the common cold; however, the authors concluded that more studies are needed to explain how in vivo zinc treatment works for the common flu. The level of Zn2+ in cells is tightly controlled, by binding to cellular proteins, in particular to metallothioneins, and by involving zinc transporters such as SLC39 and SLC30 [ [63](#B63-nrp-15-S1)]. However, some compounds such as pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate or pyrithione (PT), which stimulate cellular import of zinc, can induce high intracellular Zn2+ levels; thereby, zinc can inhibit the replication of influenza and RNA rhino viruses [ [64](#B64-nrp-15-S1) [65](#B65-nrp-15-S1)]. [66](#B66-nrp-15-S1)]. Furthermore, Zn2+ uptake into cells has been shown to be enhanced by chloroquine, which has emerged as a potential candidate treatment for COVID-19; furthermore, increased intracellular Zn2+ has been shown to increase the cytotoxicity and mediate the antiviral effect of chloroquine against COVID-19 [ [67](#B67-nrp-15-S1)]. Relevance to COVID-19 [68](#B68-nrp-15-S1)], zinc is closely associated with the activity of ACE2, which is known to be the receptor SARS-CoV-2 utilizes for entry into target cells, since ACE2 is a zinc-metalloenzyme that requires zinc for its enzymatic activity. The authors [ [68](#B68-nrp-15-S1)] suggested that zinc may decrease ACE2 expression through downregulation of Sirt-1 activity, thereby reducing viral entry into cells. In addition, zinc deficiency is associated with the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and ROS in the lungs, which is one of the characteristics of COVID-19, and this inflammatory response is reversible by zinc supplementation [ [69](#B69-nrp-15-S1)]. Zinc modulates immunity through inhibition of NF-B, a cytoplasmic transcription factor, is critical for the expression of many pro-inflammatory cytokines, and is required for T-cell proliferation, the balance between CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and the secretion of T-cell dependent ILs and cytokines including IL-1, IL-2, IL-4, and IFN- [70]. Therefore, the immunomodulatory effects of zinc may be beneficial for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19, including limiting the cytokine storm associated with COVID-19. [71](#B71-nrp-15-S1)]. Another study of supplementation of 440 mg of zinc sulfate in patients with COVID-19, found no significant casual association between zinc and the risk of in-hospital mortality; however, the authors concluded that their results must not be used to confirm the clinical benefits of zinc for COVID-19 management because of the limitations of their study design (short period of observation) [ [72](#B72-nrp-15-S1)]. [68](#B68-nrp-15-S1)]. Zinc supplementation for preventing respiratory infection was more effective than therapeutic procedures. Therefore, it is recommended for vulnerable people to Covid-19 infection to take zinc supplementation. However, large dose of zinc can cause the suppression of immune system and interfere with absorption of other minerals. The tolerable upper intake level established by the Food and Nutrition Board of the US institute of Medicine is 40 mg a day and tolerable upper intake level from dietary reference intakes (DRIs) for Koreans is 35 mg/day. IRON Effects of iron on immune function and viral infection [73](#B73-nrp-15-S1)]. Considering that ribonucleotide reductase, which is involved in DNA synthesis, requires iron, iron deficiency can lead to decreased lymphocyte proliferation [ [74](#B74-nrp-15-S1)]. In addition, iron modulates lymphocyte function by regulating cytokine production and PKC activation. Moreover, iron is required for myeloperoxidase activity, which is involved in the bactericidal process through the formation of highly toxic hydroxyl radicals. Prolonged iron deficiency has been shown to reduce antibody production in mice exposed to influenza virus [ [75](#B75-nrp-15-S1)]. [73](#B73-nrp-15-S1)]. These detrimental effects may be because supplementation provides iron-requiring microorganisms with a suitable environment to grow and replicate. Therefore, both iron deficiency and overload above a threshold level are associated with unfavorable immune responses. Relevance to COVID-19 [76](#B76-nrp-15-S1)]. Hyper-ferritinemia has been associated with increased mortality risk [ [23](#B23-nrp-15-S1)]. The serum ferritin levels in COVID-19 non-survivors were two-fold those in survivors. Ferritin is a major intracellular iron storage protein in its ferric state (Fe3+). Hepcidin is a peptide hormone secreted by the liver and plays a role in the regulation of iron metabolism. It controls serum iron by binding to ferroportin, an iron transporter in iron-absorptive enterocytes and iron-recycling macrophages. Binding of hepcidin causes internalization and degradation of ferroportin, which prevents entry of iron into plasma [ [77](#B77-nrp-15-S1)]. [78](#B78-nrp-15-S1)]. This response is important for immune function to limit the available iron for proliferating pathogens and for preventing excessive oxidative damage. Evidence suggests that a 'cytokine storm' is a hallmark of the hyper-inflammatory state in patients with COVID-19 and contributes to deterioration of the patients [ [23](#B23-nrp-15-S1)]. Decreased iron influx into plasma results in low transferrin saturation, and less iron is delivered to the developing erythroblasts, leading to anemia of inflammation. A modest decrease in hemoglobin levels has been observed in patients with COVID-19 [ [79](#B79-nrp-15-S1)]. [80](#B80-nrp-15-S1)]. Iron overload can also increase blood coagulation by interacting with proteins of the coagulation cascade, which is a major concern in the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Therefore, altered iron homeostasis in association with hyper-inflammatory status may be a key modulator of the pathogenesis of COVID-19. [81](#B81-nrp-15-S1)] based on the understanding that iron chelation can inhibit viral replication and endothelial inflammation by decreasing iron availability. However, there is a concern about the application of iron chelators. Withholding iron may be counterproductive and should not be employed until there is evidence that elevated iron levels exist and have relevance in COVID-19 [ [82](#B82-nrp-15-S1)]. There are few studies in this regard. In a study with 50 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, serum iron deficiency was observed in these patients, and the severity of COVID-19 was correlated with low serum iron levels [ [83](#B83-nrp-15-S1)]. Other therapeutic approaches may include ferroptosis inhibitors, hepcidin modulators, and erythropoietin. However, large RCTs and data analyses are needed to elucidate the efficacy and safety of therapeutic treatments for COVID-19. It is important to maintain an optimal iron level for immune function and to mitigate risk factors associated with COVID19 infection. Selenium Role of selenium [84](#B84-nrp-15-S1)]. Dietary selenium is incorporated into selenoproteins during their synthesis in the form of selenocysteine. Selenocysteine is an analogue of cysteine in which sulfur is substituted with selenium. The biological function of selenium is performed primarily through selenoproteins. To date, 25 selenoproteins have been identified in humans, including enzymes that play crucial roles in oxidative stress response such as glutathione peroxidases (GPXs) and thioredoxin reductases (TXNRDs). GPXs have important roles in protecting against ROS damage, and TXNRDs participate in a redox homeostasis and signaling. In addition, a series of selenoproteins are present in the endoplasmic reticulum where they function in protein folding and activation of various signaling pathways [ [84](#B84-nrp-15-S1) [85](#B85-nrp-15-S1)]. Effects of selenium on immune function and viral infection [84](#B84-nrp-15-S1)]. Selenium influences both the innate and adaptive immune systems [ [86](#B86-nrp-15-S1)]. During infection, excessive ROS production by immune cells, especially macrophages, at the site of infection triggers oxidative damage to the tissues and initiates signaling cascades that lead to inflammatory responses. Selenium can contribute to epithelial barrier maintenance by protecting against ROS through the antioxidant function of selenoproteins such as GPXs. In addition, T-cell proliferation and NK cell activity are impaired, and the production of immunoglobulins is decreased in selenium deficiency [ [87](#B87-nrp-15-S1)]. A prospective study involving 83 patients with respiratory disease found that serum selenium levels were 28% lower in the ICU group than in the general ward group [ [88](#B88-nrp-15-S1)]. Low serum selenium status has been shown to be associated with decreased lymphocyte counts and albumin concentrations as well as increased CRP, which is a marker of inflammation. In addition, selenium deficiency can increase the virulence of viruses. The first evidence came from the study of Keshan disease, an endemic cardiomyopathy in the Keshan area in China that leads to congestive heart failure and death. The disease is caused by a combination of selenium deficiency and infection with coxsackievirus B3 (CVB), a single-stranded RNA virus [ [89](#B89-nrp-15-S1)]. Sequencing of the viral genome revealed that CVB and influenza viruses mutated into more virulent forms in selenium-deficient mice that were unable to produce adequate GPX [ [90](#B90-nrp-15-S1)]. Selenium deficiency has been linked to increased mortality in patients infected with some other RNA viruses, such as HIV-1, hepatitis, and hantavirus [ [91](#B91-nrp-15-S1)]. Therefore, low selenium status not only affects the host response to infection but also affects the viral mutations and pathogenicity. [92](#B92-nrp-15-S1)]. Selenium supplementation (50-100 g/day of selenium weeks in adults with marginally low selenium status (< 95 ng/mL) increased plasma selenium concentrations and enhanced cellular immune responses to a live polio vaccine, leading to more rapid clearance of the virus with earlier peak T-cell proliferation and increased numbers of T-helper cells [ [93](#B93-nrp-15-S1)]. Similarly, a 12-week RCT involving healthy adults with a marginal selenium status (< 110 ng/mL) supplemented with selenium (50, 100 g/day of selenomethionine in a yeast matrix) after flu vaccination resulted in beneficial effects for cellular immunity, such as increased T-cell proliferation, IL-8, and IL-10; however, humoral immune responses were unaffected. However, higher doses of supplementation (200 g/day of selenomethionine in a yeast matrix) resulted in reduced granzyme B content of CD8 cells, suggesting a detrimental effect of high supplemental doses [ [94](#B94-nrp-15-S1)]. Therefore, optimizing plasma selenium may be required to improve immune responses. Relevance to COVID-19 [95](#B95-nrp-15-S1)]. In addition, a German study found markedly low levels of serum selenium and selenoprotein P in patients with COVID-19 compared with reference data from the European EPIC cross-sectional study [ [96](#B96-nrp-15-S1)]. Moreover, selenium status was higher in COVID-19 survivors than in non-survivors. [23](#B23-nrp-15-S1)]. This cytokine storm can be caused by unregulated ROS production through NF-B signaling [ [97](#B97-nrp-15-S1)]. A recent murine study found that selenium deficiency promoted NFB-mediated inflammation and inhibited macrophage phagocytosis [ [98](#B98-nrp-15-S1)]. Based on these results, selenium supplementation might be beneficial for patients with COVID-19 with moderate to severe symptoms. In a recent RCT study, critically ill patients with COVID-19 and ARDS were administered intravenous selenium (1 mg for 3 days and 1 mg/day for 6 successive days as sodium selenite). Serum selenium concentrations were associated with serum GPXs and inversely related to serum levels of IL-1\u00df and IL-6, indicating that selenium restored antioxidant activity and moderated inflammatory responses [ [99](#B99-nrp-15-S1)]. However, there were no apparent effects on survival or the duration of mechanical ventilation or ICU stay in that study. Further studies are needed to elucidate the effect of selenium supplementation on NF-B expression and survival benefit in patients with COVID-19. Nevertheless, selenium status may be a determinant of COVID-19 disease outcome, and selenium supplementation could be beneficial for patients with COVID19 with a sub optimal or low selenium status. [95](#B95-nrp-15-S1)]. In addition, daily doses of 1 mg of intravenous selenium (as selenite) have been used in critically ill patients with sepsis or ARDS without causing adverse effects [ [99](#B99-nrp-15-S1)]. CONCLUSION [Table 1](#T1-nrp-15-S1)); however, clinical research data are needed to support the therapeutic use of these nutrients. Currently many clinical trials designed to investigate the effects of vitamins D, C, A, and B12, and zinc as single components or in combination in relation to COVID-19 are registered in the clinical trial registry of the National Institutes of Health ( [https://clinicaltrials.gov/](https://clinicaltrials.gov/)) [ [100](#B100-nrp-15-S1)]. Findings from these studies will provide the insight into efficacy of supplemental doses of vitamins and minerals on the progression, clinical outcomes, and treatment of COVID-19. Table 1 "}
