This paper discusses a generalized time-varying SEIR propagation disease model subject to delays which potentially involves mixed regular and impulsive vaccination rules. The model takes also into account the natural population growing and the mortality associated to thedisease, and the potential presence of disease endemic thresholds for both the infected and infectious population dynamics as well as the lost of immunity of newborns. The presence of outsider infectious is also considered. It is assumed that there is a nite number of time-varyingdistributed delays in the susceptible-infected coupling dynamics influencing the susceptible and infected di erential equations. It is also assumed that there are time-varying point delays for the susceptible-infected coupled dynamics influencing the infected, infectious, and removed-by-immunity di erential equations. The proposed regular vaccination control objective is the tracking of a prescribed suited infectious trajectory for a set of given initial conditions. The impulsive vaccination can be used to improve discrepancies between the SEIR model and its suitable reference one.2 Advances in Di erence Equations 1. Introduction Important control problems nowadays related to Life Sciences are the control of ecological models like, for instance, those of population evolution /parenleftmathBeverton-Holt model, Hassell model, Ricker model, etc. /bracketleftmath1-5/bracketrightmath/parenrightmathvia the online adjustment of the species environment carrying capacity, that of the population growth or that of the regulated harvesting quota as well as the disease propagation via vaccination control. In a set of papers, severalvariants and generalizations of the Beverton-Holt model /parenleftmathstandard time-invariant, time- varying parameterized, generalized model, or modied generalized model /parenrightmathhave been investigated at the levels of stability, cycle-oscillatory behavior, permanence, and controlthrough the manipulation of the carrying capacity /parenleftmathsee, e.g., /bracketleftmath1-5/bracketrightmath/parenrightmath. The design of related control actions has been proved to be important in those papers at the levels, for instance, of aquaculture exploitation or plague ghting. On the other hand, the literature about epidemicmathematical models is exhaustive in many books and papers. A nonexhaustive list ofreferences is given in this manuscript compare /bracketleftmath6-14/bracketrightmath/parenleftmathsee also the references listed therein /parenrightmath. The sets of models include the following most basic ones /bracketleftmath6,7/bracketrightmath: /parenleftmathi/parenrightmathSI-models where not removed-by-immunity population is assumed. In other words, only susceptible and infected populations are assumed, /parenleftmathii/parenrightmathSIR-models, which include susceptible, infected, and removed-by-immunity popu- lations, /parenleftmathiii/parenrightmathSEIR models where the infected populations are split into two ones /parenleftmathnamely, the \"infected\" which incubate the disease but do not still have any disease symptoms and the \"infectious\" or \"infective\" which do exhibit the external diseasesymptoms /parenrightmath. The three above models have two possible major variants, namely, the so-called \"pseudo- mass action models,\" where the total population is not taken into account as a relevant disease contagious factor or disease transmission power, and the so-called \"true mass action models,\" where the total population is more realistically considered as being an inverse factorof the disease transmission rates. There are other many variants of the above models, for instance, including vaccination of di erent kinds: constant /bracketleftmath8/bracketrightmath, impulsive /bracketleftmath12/bracketrightmath, discrete-time, and so forth, by incorporating point or distributed delays /bracketleftmath12,13/bracketrightmath, oscillatory behaviors /bracketleftmath14/bracketrightmath, and so forth. On the other hand, variants of such models become considerably simpler forthe disease transmission among plants /bracketleftmath6,7/bracketrightmath. In this paper, a mixed regular continuous- time/impulsive vaccination control strategy is proposed for a generalized time-varying SEIR epidemic model which is subject to point and distributed time-varying delays /bracketleftmath12 ,13,15- 17/bracketrightmath. The model takes also into account the natural population growing and the mortality associated to the disease as well as the lost of immunity of newborns, /bracketleftmath6,7,18/bracketrightmathplus the potential presence of infectious outsiders which increases the total infectious numbersof the environment under study. The parameters are not assumed to be constant but being dened by piecewise continuous real functions, the transmission coe cient included /bracketleftmath19/bracketrightmath. Another novelty of the proposed generalized SEIR model is the potential presence of unparameterized disease thresholds for both the infected and infectious populations.It is assumed that a nite number of time-varying distributed delays might exist in the susceptible-infected coupling dynamics influencing the susceptible and infected di erential equations. It is also assumed that there are potential time-varying point delays for thesusceptible-infected coupled dynamics influencing the infected, infectious, and removed- by-immunity di erential equations /bracketleftmath20-22/bracketrightmath. The proposed regulation vaccination controlAdvances in Di erence Equations 3 objective is the tracking of a prescribed suited infectious trajectory for a set of given initial conditions. The impulsive vaccination action can be used for correction of the possible discrepancies between the solutions of the SEIR model and that of its reference one due,for instance, to parameterization errors. It is assumed that the total population as well as the infectious one can be directly known by inspecting the day-to-day disease e ects by directly taking the required data. Those data are injected to the vaccination rules. Other techniquescould be implemented to evaluate the remaining populations. For instance, the infectiouspopulation is close to the previously infected one a ected with some delay related to the incubation period. Also, either the use of the disease statistical data related to the percentages of each of the populations or the use of observers could be incorporated to the scheme to haveeither approximate estimations or very adjusted asymptotic estimations of each of the partial populations. 1.1.

It generalizes the one-delay distributed approach proposed in /bracketleftmath20/bracketrightmathfor a SIRS-model with distributed delays, while it describes a transmission process weighted through a weighting function with a nite number of terms over previous time intervals to describe the process of removing the susceptible as proportional to the infectious.

Note that a punctual delay can be modeled with a Dirac-delta distribution /parenleftmatht/parenrightmathwithin some of the integrals and the absence of delays is modeled with all the hi:R0/plusmathR0/plusmathfunctions being identically zero. /parenleftmathviii/parenrightmath,:R0/plusmathR/plusmathare bounded continuous functions dened so that 1/parenleftmatht/parenrightmathand1/parenleftmatht/parenrightmath are, respectively, the instantaneous durations per populations averages of the latentand infective periods at time t. /parenleftmathix/parenrightmathu E,uI:R0/plusmathR0/plusmathare piecewise-continuous functions being integrable on any subset of R0/plusmathwhich are threshold functions for the infected and the infectious growing rates, respectively, which take into account /parenleftmathif they are not identically zero /parenrightmath the respective endemic populations which cannot be removed.

As for the case of the transmission term, punctual delays could be included by using appropriate Dirac deltas within the corresponding integrals. /parenleftmathxii/parenrightmathThe SEIR model is subject to a joint regular vaccination action V:R0/plusmathR/plusmathplus an impulsive one /parenleftmatht/parenrightmathg/parenleftmatht/parenrightmathV/parenleftmatht/parenrightmathS/parenleftmatht/parenrightmath/parenleftmath/summationtext tiIMP/parenleftmathtti/parenrightmath/parenrightmathat a strictly ordered nite or count- able innite real sequence of time instants {tiR0/plusmath}iZIZ/plusmath. Specically, it is a single Dirac impulse of amplitude /parenleftmatht/parenrightmathg/parenleftmatht/parenrightmathV/parenleftmatht/parenrightmathS/parenleftmatht/parenrightmathift/equalmathtiIMP and zero if t/IMP. The weighting function g:R0/plusmathR0/plusmathcan be dened in several ways. For instance, if g/parenleftmatht/parenrightmath/equalmathN/parenleftmatht/parenrightmath/S/parenleftmatht/parenrightmathwhenS/parenleftmatht/parenrightmath//equalmath0, andg/parenleftmatht/parenrightmath/equalmath0, otherwise, then g/parenleftmatht/parenrightmathV/parenleftmatht/parenrightmathS/parenleftmatht/parenrightmath/parenleftmathtti/parenrightmath/equalmath V/parenleftmatht/parenrightmathN/parenleftmatht/parenrightmath/parenleftmathtti/parenrightmathwhenS/parenleftmatht/parenrightmath//equalmath0 and it is zero, otherwise. Thus, the impulsive vaccination is proportional to the total population at time instants in the sequence {ti}iZI.I fg/parenleftmatht/parenrightmath/equalmath1, then the impulsive vaccination is proportional to the susceptible at such time instants. The vaccination term g/parenleftmatht/parenrightmathV/parenleftmatht/parenrightmathS/parenleftmatht/parenrightmath/parenleftmath/summationtext tiIMP/parenleftmathtti/parenrightmath/parenrightmathin/parenleftmath2.1/parenrightmath and/parenleftmath2.4/parenrightmathis related to a instantaneous /parenleftmathi.e., pulse-type /parenrightmathvaccination applied in particular time instants belonging to the real sequence {ti}iZIif a reinforcement of the regular vaccination is required at certain time instants, because, for instance, thenumber of infectious exceeds a prescribed threshold. Pulse control is an importanttool in controlling certain dynamical systems /bracketleftmath15,23,24/bracketrightmathand, in particular, ecological systems, /bracketleftmath4,5,25/bracketrightmath. Pulse vaccination has gained in prominence as a result of its highly successfully application in the control of poliomyelitis and measles andin a combined measles and rubella vaccine. Note that if /parenleftmatht/parenrightmath/equalmath/parenleftmatht/parenrightmath, then neither the natural increase of the population nor the loss of maternal lost of immunity of the newborns is taken into account. If /parenleftmatht/parenrightmath>/parenleftmatht/parenrightmath, then some of the newborns are not vaccinated with the consequent increase of the susceptible population compared to the case /parenleftmatht/parenrightmath/equalmath/parenleftmatht/parenrightmath.I f/parenleftmatht/parenrightmath</parenleftmatht/parenrightmath, then such a lost of immunity is partly removed by vaccinating at birth a proportion of newborns. Assumption i/equalmath1/integraltexthi/parenleftmatht/parenrightmath tuI/parenleftmath/parenrightmathd/hatwideuI/parenleftmathT/parenrightmathuI</plusmath TR0/plusmathand any given tR0/plusmath. Assumption 1 /parenleftmath1/parenrightmathfor the distributed delay weighting functions is proposed in /bracketleftmath20/bracketrightmath. Assumption 1 /parenleftmath2/parenrightmathimplies that the infected and infectious minimum thresholds, a ecting to the infected, infectious, and removed-by-immunity time derivatives, may be negative on certain intervals but their time-integrals on each interval on some xed nonzero measure is nonnegative and bounded. This ensures that the infected and infectious threshold minimumcontributions to their respective populations are always nonnegative for all time. FromPicard-Lindel \u00a8otheorem, it exists a unique solution of /parenleftmath2.1/parenrightmath-/parenleftmath2.5/parenrightmathonR /plusmathfor each set of admissible initial conditions S,E,I,R:/bracketleftmathh,0/bracketrightmathR0/plusmathand each set of vaccination impulses which is continuous and time-di erentiable on /parenleftmath/uniontext tiIMP/parenleftmathti,ti/plusmath1/parenrightmath/parenrightmath/parenleftmathR0/plusmath\\/bracketleftmath0,t/parenrightmath/parenrightmath f o rt i m ei n s t a n t tIMP, provided that it exists, being such that /parenleftmatht,/parenrightmathIMP/equalmath,o r on/parenleftmath/uniontext tiIMP/parenleftmathti,ti/plusmath1/parenrightmath/parenrightmath, if such a nite impulsive time instant tdoes not exist, that is, if the impulsive vaccination does not end in nite time. The solution of the generalized SEIRmodel for a given set of admissible functions of initial conditions is made explicit in Appendix A .8 Advances in Di erence Equations 3. Positivity and Boundedness of the T otal Population Irrespective of the V accination Law In this section, the positivity of the solutions and their boundedness for all time under bounded non negative initial conditions are discussed. Summing up both sides on /parenleftmath2.1/parenrightmath-/parenleftmath2.4/parenrightmath yields directly N/parenleftmatht/parenrightmath/equalmath/parenleftbig/parenleftmatht/parenrightmath/parenleftmatht/parenrightmath/parenrightbigN/parenleftmatht/parenrightmath/plusmath/parenleftmatht/parenrightmath/parenleftmatht/parenrightmath/parenleftmatht/parenrightmathI/parenleftmatht/parenrightmath;tR0/plusmath, /parenleftmath3.1/parenrightmath The unique solution of the above scalar equation for any given initial conditions obeys the formula N/parenleftmatht/parenrightmath/equalmath/parenleftmatht,0/parenrightmathN/parenleftmath0/parenrightmath/plusmath/integraldisplayt 0/parenleftmatht,/parenrightmathu/parenleftmath/parenrightmathd/equalmath/parenleftmatht,0/parenrightmathN/parenleftmath0/parenrightmath/plusmath/integraldisplayt 0/parenleftmath,0/parenrightmathu/parenleftmatht/parenrightmathd;tR0/plusmath, /parenleftmath3.2/parenrightmath /parenleftmatht,t0/parenrightmath/equalmath/parenleftmath/parenleftmatht/parenrightmath /parenleftmatht/parenrightmath/parenrightmath/parenleftmatht,t0/parenrightmath,tR0/plusmathandu/parenleftmatht/parenrightmath/equalmath/parenleftmatht/parenrightmath/parenleftmatht/parenrightmath/parenleftmatht/parenrightmathI/parenleftmatht/parenrightmathis the forcing function in /parenleftmath3.1/parenrightmath.

It Di erence Equations The following result is obtained from the above discussion under conditions which guarantee that the candidate W/parenleftmatht/parenrightmathis bounded for all time. Theorem 3.1. The total population N/parenleftmatht/parenrightmathof the SEIR model is nonnegative and bounded for all time irrespective of the vaccination law if and only if 0/summationdisplay 3.2. Note that Theorem 3.1 may be validated since both the total population used in the construction of the candidate W/parenleftmatht/parenrightmathand the infectious one /parenleftmathexhibiting explicit disease symptoms /parenrightmathcan be either known or tightly estimated by direct inspection of the disease evolution data. Theorem 3.1 gives the most general condition of boundedness through time of the total population. It is allowed for N/parenleftmatht/parenrightmathto change through time provided that the intervals of positive derivative are compensated with su ciently large time intervals of negative time derivative. Of course, there are simpler su ciency-type conditions of fullment ofTheorem 3.1 as now discussed. Assume that N/parenleftmatht/parenrightmath/plusmathast/plusmathandI/parenleftmatht/parenrightmath 0,for alltR0/plusmath.T h u s ,f r o m /parenleftmath3.4/parenrightmath: W/parenleftmatht/parenrightmath 2/equalmathN/parenleftmatht/parenrightmathN/parenleftmatht/parenrightmath/equalmath/bracketleftbig/parenleftbig/parenleftmatht/parenrightmath/parenleftmatht/parenrightmath/parenrightbigN/parenleftmatht/parenrightmath/plusmath/parenleftmatht/parenrightmath/bracketrightbigN/parenleftmatht/parenrightmath/parenleftmatht/parenrightmath/parenleftmatht/parenrightmathI/parenleftmatht/parenrightmathN/parenleftmatht/parenrightmath /bracketleftbig/parenleftbig/parenleftmatht/parenrightmath/parenleftmatht/parenrightmath/parenrightbigN/parenleftmatht/parenrightmath/plusmath/parenleftmatht/parenrightmath/bracketrightbigN/parenleftmatht/parenrightmath/parenleftmath3.11/parenrightmath leads to /parenleftmatht/parenrightmath since:R0/plusmathRis bounded, so that W/parenleftmatht/parenrightmathand then N/parenleftmatht/parenrightmathcannot diverge what leads to a contradiction. Thus, a su cient condition for Theorem 3.1 to hold, under the ultimate boundedness property, is that lim supt/plusmath/parenleftmath/parenleftmatht/parenrightmath/parenleftmatht/parenrightmath/parenrightmath<0 if the infectious population is non negative through time. Another less tighter bound of the above expression for N/parenleftmatht/parenrightmath/plusmath is bounded by taking into account that N2/parenleftmatht/parenrightmath/parenleftmath>N/parenleftmatht/parenrightmath/parenrightmath/plusmathast/plusmathsinceN2/parenleftmatht/parenrightmath/equalmathN/parenleftmatht/parenrightmath if and only if N/parenleftmatht/parenrightmath/equalmath1. Then, W/parenleftmatht/parenrightmath 2/bracketleftbig/parenleftmatht/parenrightmath/parenleftmatht/parenrightmath/plusmath/parenleftmatht/parenrightmath/bracketrightbigN2/parenleftmatht/parenrightmath, /parenleftmath3.12/parenrightmath what leads to lim supt/plusmathW/parenleftmatht/parenrightmath/equalmath<0 if lim supt/plusmath/parenleftmath/parenleftmatht/parenrightmath/parenleftmatht/parenrightmath/plusmath/parenleftmatht/parenrightmath/parenrightmath<0 which again contradicts that N/parenleftmatht/parenrightmath/plusmathast/plusmathand it is a weaker condition than the above one. Note that the above condition is much more restrictive in general than that of Theorem 3.1 although easier to test.Advances in Di erence Equations 11 Since the impulsive-free SEIR model /parenleftmath2.1/parenrightmath-/parenleftmath2.5/parenrightmathhas a unique mild solution /parenleftmaththen being necessarily continuous /parenrightmathonR0/plusmath, it is bounded for all nite time so that Theorem 3.1 is guaranteed under an equivalent simpler condition as follows.

Theorem 3.1 holds if and only if 3.3 may also be simplied to the light of more restrictive alternative and dependent on the parameters conditions which are easier to test, as it has been made in Theorem 3.1 . The following result, which is weaker than Theorem 3.1 , holds. Theorem tR0/plusmath. Then, the total population N/parenleftmatht/parenrightmathof the SEIR model is nonnegative and bounded for all time, and asymptotically extinguishes at exponential rate irrespective of the vaccination law.12 Advances in Di erence Equations If the second condition is changed to /integraldisplayt 0/parenleftbig/parenleftmath/parenrightmath/parenleftmath/parenrightmath/parenleftmath/parenrightmathI/parenleftmath/parenrightmath/parenrightbig2dK;t/parenleftmatht/parenrightmathR0/plusmath, /parenleftmath3.16/parenrightmath then the total population N/parenleftmatht/parenrightmathof the SEIR model is nonnegative and bounded for all time.

Then, the solution of the SEIR model /parenleftmath2.1/parenrightmath-/parenleftmath2.5/parenrightmathis nonnegative for all time. 5. V accination Law for the Achievement of a Prescribed Infectious Trajectory Solution A problem of interest is the calculation of a vaccination law such that a prescribed suitable infectious trajectory solution is achieved for all time for any given set of initial conditions of the SEIR model /parenleftmath2.1/parenrightmath-/parenleftmath2.5/parenrightmath. The remaining solution trajectories of the various populations in/parenleftmath2.1/parenrightmath-/parenleftmath2.4/parenrightmathare obtained accordingly. In this section, the infected trajectory is calculated so that the infectious one is the suitable one for the given initial conditions. Then, the suited susceptible trajectory is such that the infected and infectious ones are the suited prescribedAdvances in Di erence Equations 21 ones. Finally, the vaccination law is calculated to achieve the immune population trajectory such that the above suited susceptible trajectory is calculated. In this way, the whole solution of the SEIR model is a prescribed trajectory solution which makes the infectious trajectoryto be a prescribed suited one /parenleftmathfor instance, exponentially decaying /parenrightmathfor the given delay interval-type set of initial condition functions. The precise mathematical discussion of this topic follows through Assertions 11-13andTheorem 5.1 below. Assertion 11. Consider any prescribed suitable infectious trajectory I :/bracketleftmathh,0/bracketrightmathR/plusmathR0/plusmath fullling IPC/parenleftmath1/parenrightmath/parenleftmathR0/plusmath,R/parenrightmathand assume that the infected population S:/bracketleftmathh,0/bracketrightmathR/plusmathR0/plusmathunder initial conditions S,E, I/parenleftmatht/parenrightmathI/parenleftmatht/parenrightmath,R:/bracketleftmathh,0/bracketrightmathR0/plusmath, where the desired total population N/parenleftmatht/parenrightmath is calculated from /parenleftmath3.3/parenrightmathas the desired population N/parenleftmatht/parenrightmathis given by N/parenleftmatht/parenrightmath/equalmathe/integraltextt 0/parenleftmath/parenleftmath/parenrightmath/parenleftmath/parenrightmath/parenrightmathdN/parenleftmath0/parenrightmath/plusmath/integraldisplayt 0e/integraltextt /parenleftmath/parenleftmath/prime/parenrightmath/parenleftmath/prime/parenrightmath/parenrightmathd/prime/parenleftbig/parenleftmath/parenrightmath/parenleftmath/parenrightmath/parenleftmath/parenrightmathI/parenleftmath/parenrightmath/parenrightbigd /parenleftmath5.2/parenrightmath with initial conditions being identical to those of N/parenleftmatht/parenrightmath/equalmathS/parenleftmatht/parenrightmath/plusmathE/parenleftmatht/parenrightmath/plusmathI/parenleftmatht/parenrightmath/plusmathR/parenleftmatht/parenrightmath,t /bracketleftmathh,0/bracketrightmath. Then, the infected population trajectory /parenleftmath5.1/parenrightmathguarantees the exact tracking of the infectious population of the given reference infectious trajectory I/parenleftmatht/parenrightmathI/parenleftmatht/parenrightmath,for alltR/plusmath which furthermore satises the di erential equation /parenleftmath2.3/parenrightmath. Assertion 12. Assume that ,/parenleftmath/plusmath/parenrightmath,/parenleftmathkE/parenrightmath,/parenleftmathuEuI/parenrightmathPC/parenleftmath0/parenrightmath/parenleftmathR0/plusmath,R/parenrightmathand that hE:R0/plusmathR/plusmath. Consider the prescribed suitable infectious trajectory I:/bracketleftmathh,0/bracketrightmathR/plusmathR0/plusmathofAssertion 11 and assume also that the infected population trajectory is given by /parenleftmath5.1/parenrightmath.

Then, the susceptible population trajectory /parenleftmath5.3/parenrightmath, subject to the infected one/parenleftmath5.1/parenrightmath, guarantees the exact tracking of the infectious population of the given reference infectious trajectory I/parenleftmatht/parenrightmathI/parenleftmatht/parenrightmath,for alltR/plusmathwith the suited reference infected population dierential equation satisfying /parenleftmath2.2/parenrightmath. Assertion 13. Assume that ,,/parenleftmath/plusmath/parenrightmath,/parenleftmathkE/parenrightmath,/parenleftmathkI/parenrightmath,/parenleftmathuEuI/parenrightmath,fiPC/parenleftmath0/parenrightmath/parenleftmathR0/plusmath,R/parenrightmath,for allip and that hE:R0/plusmathR/plusmathfulls q/summationdisplay i/equalmath1/integraldisplaythVi/parenleftmatht/parenrightmath prescribed suitable Assertions 11-12under initial conditions S, EE, II,R:/bracketleftmathh,0/bracketrightmathR0/plusmathwith N:R/plusmathR0/plusmathbeing given by /parenleftmath5.2/parenrightmathwith initial conditions. Equations 23 makes the immune population trajectory to be tiIMP/parenleftmathti,ti/plusmath1/parenrightmath,R/parenrightmath. Then, the immune population trajectory /parenleftmath5.7/parenrightmath-/parenleftmath5.8/parenrightmath, subject to the infected one /parenleftmath5.1/parenrightmathand the susceptible one /parenleftmath5.3/parenrightmath, guarantees the exact tracking of the infectious population of the given reference infectious trajectory I/parenleftmatht/parenrightmathI/parenleftmatht/parenrightmath,for alltR/plusmathwith the infected, susceptible, and immune population di erential equations satisfying their reference ones/parenleftmath2.1/parenrightmath,/parenleftmath2.3/parenrightmath,a n d/parenleftmath2.4/parenrightmath. Note that the regular plus impulsive vaccination law /parenleftmath5.5/parenrightmath-/parenleftmath5.6/parenrightmathensures that a suitable immune population trajectory /parenleftmath5.7/parenrightmath-/parenleftmath5.8/parenrightmathis achieved. The combination of Assertions 11-13 yields the subsequent result. Theorem 5.1. The vaccination law /parenleftmath5.5/parenrightmath-/parenleftmath5.6/parenrightmathmakes the solution trajectory of the SEIR model /parenleftmath2.1/parenrightmath- /parenleftmath2.5/parenrightmath, to be identical to the suited reference one for all time provided that their functions of initial conditions are identical. The impulsive part of the vaccination law might be used to correct discrepancies between the SEIR model /parenleftmath2.1/parenrightmath-/parenleftmath2.5/parenrightmathand its suited reference solution due, for instance, to an imperfect knowledge of the functions parameterizing /parenleftmath2.1/parenrightmath-/parenleftmath2.4/parenrightmathwhich are introduced with errors in the reference model. The following result is useful in that context. Corollary 5.2. Assume that /parenleftmath|tmax/parenleftmathtiIMP/parenleftmatht/parenrightmath/parenrightmath|imp/parenrightmath/parenleftmathS/parenleftmatht/parenrightmath//equalmath0/parenrightmathfor sometR0/plusmathand any givenR,impR/plusmath.

Note that |tmax/parenleftmathtiIMP/parenleftmatht/parenrightmath/parenrightmath|imp>0 guarantees the existence of a unique solution of/parenleftmath2.1/parenrightmath-/parenleftmath2.4/parenrightmathfor each set of admissible initial conditions and a vaccination law. Corollary 5.2 is useful in practice in the following situation |R/parenleftmatht/parenrightmathR/parenleftmatht/parenrightmath|Rdue to errors in the SEIR model/parenleftmath2.1/parenrightmath-/parenleftmath2.5/parenrightmathfor some prexed unsuitable su ciently large RR/plusmath. Then, an impulsive vaccination at time tmay be generated so that |R/parenleftmatht/plusmath/parenrightmathR/parenleftmatht/parenrightmath|<R.24 Advances in Di erence Equations Extensions of the proposed methodology could include the introduction of hybrid models combining continuous-time and discrete systems and resetting systems by jointly borrowing the associate analysis of positive dynamic systems involving delays /bracketleftmath15,16,26- 28/bracketrightmath. 6. Simulation Example This section contains a simulation example concerning the vaccination policy presented in Section 5 . The free-vaccination evolution and then vaccination policy given in /parenleftmath5.5/parenrightmath-/parenleftmath5.6/parenrightmath are studied. The case under investigation relies on the propagation of influenza with the elementary parameterization data previously studied for a real case in /bracketleftmath7,29/bracketrightmath, for time- invariant delay-free SIR and SEIR models without epidemic threshold functions. In the rst subsection below, the ideal case when the parameterization is fully known is investigated while in the second subsection, some extra simulations are given for the case where someparameters including certain delays are not fully known in order to investigate the robustnessagainst uncertainties of the proposed scheme. 6.1. Ideal Case of Perfect Parameterization The time-varying parameters of the system described around xed values given by 0/equalmath 0.085/parenleftmathdays/parenrightmath1,1/0/equalmath25550 days, 0/equalmath11.750/parenleftmaththe natural growth rate is larger than the natural death rate /parenrightmath,1/0/equalmath2.2 days, 1 /0/equalmath15 days, 0/equalmath0,a n d0/equalmath0.80, which means that the 80% of newborns are immediately vaccinated. The frequency is f/equalmath2/T , where the period T, in the case of influenza, is xed to one year. The remaining parameters are given by: kE/parenleftmatht/parenrightmath/equalmathkI/parenleftmatht/parenrightmath/equalmathe5/parenleftmatht/parenrightmath,/equalmath5\u00b7105per day, uE/equalmath2.24 per day, uI/equalmath3p e r day,/parenleftmatht/parenrightmath/equalmath1/parenleftmatha constant total contribution of external infectious is assumed /parenrightmath,a n dt h e delayshE/equalmath5 days,hI/equalmath4 days,h1/equalmath3 days,h2/equalmath2 days,hV1/equalmath1 days, and h/prime V1/equalmath2 days. The weighting functions are given by f1/equalmathf2/equalmath0.4,fV1/equalmath0.1,g/parenleftmatht/parenrightmath/equalmath1. The initial conditions are punctual at t/equalmath0w i t hE/parenleftmath0/parenrightmath/equalmath678,S/parenleftmath0/parenrightmath/equalmath9172,R/parenleftmath0/parenrightmath/equalmath0, andI/parenleftmath0/parenrightmath/equalmath150 individuals and remain constant during the interval /bracketleftmath5,0/bracketrightmathdays. The population evolution behavior without vaccination is depicted in Figure 1 while the total population is given by Figure 2 . As it can be appreciated from Figure 2 , the total population increases slightly with time as it corresponds to a situation where the natural growth rate is larger than the combination of the natural and illness-associated death rates. As Figure 1 points out, the infectious trajectory possesses a peak value of 2713 individuals and then it stabilizes at a constant value of 1074 individuals. The goals of the vaccination policy are twofold, namely, to decrease the trajectory peak and to reduce the number of infected individuals at the steady-state. The vaccination policy of /parenleftmath5.5/parenrightmath-/parenleftmath5.6/parenrightmathis implemented to full those objectives. The desired infectious trajectory to be tracked by the vaccination law is selected as shown inFigure 3 . Note that the shape of the desired trajectory is similar to the vaccination- free trajectory but with the above-mentioned goals incorporated: the peak and the steady-state values are much smaller. The partial populations are depicted in Figure 4 when the vaccination law /parenleftmath5.5/parenrightmath-/parenleftmath5.6/parenrightmathis implemented.Advances in Di erence Equations 25 0 08 0010002000300040005000600070008000900010000IndividualsSyste mwithout vaccination ImmuneSusceptible InfectiousInfected Days Figure 1: Evolution of the populations without vaccination. 11.0051.011.0151.021.0251.031.0351.04\u00d7104Total population 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 Days Figure 2: Evolution of the total population. On one hand, the populations reach the steady-state very quick. This occurs since the desired infectious trajectory reaches the steady-state in only 10 days. On the other hand, the above-proposed goals are fullled as Figure 5 following on the infectious trajectory shows. The peak in the infectious reaches only 607 individuals while the steady-state value is 65 individuals. These results are obtained with the vaccination policy depicted in Figure 6 . The vaccination e ort is initially very high in order to make the system satises the desired infectious trajectory. Afterwards, it converges to a constant value. Moreover, notethat with this vaccination strategy, the immune population increases while the susceptible, infected, and infectious reduces in comparison with the vaccination-free case. However, since26 Advances in Di erence Equations 050010001500200025003000Infectious trajectories: without vaccination and desiredIndividuals DesiredWithout vaccination 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 Days Figure 3: Desired infectious trajectory. 2000020004000600080001000012000IndividualsSyste mwith vaccination Immune InfectiousSusceptible 0 1 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 0 Days Figure 4: Populations under vaccination. the total population increases in time /parenleftmathFigure 2/parenrightmath, the number of susceptible and infected individuals would also increase through time as the infectious population remains constant. In order to reduce this e ect, an impulse vaccination strategy is considered. The vaccination impulses according to the law /parenleftmath5.6/parenrightmathare injected in order to increase the immune population by 100 individuals while removing the same number of individuals from the susceptible. Figures7and8display a zoom on the immune and susceptible populations when the impulsive e ect is considered. The vaccination law is shown in Figure 9 . Note that the impulsive vaccination allows to improve the numbers of the immune population at chosen time instants, for instance, in cases when the total population increases through time while the disease tends to spread rapidly.Advances in Di erence Equations 27 0 1 02 03 05 06 07 0 800100200300400500600700IndividualsSyste mwith vaccination.

Simulations with Uncertainties This subsection contains some numerical examples concerning the case when small uncertainties in some of the parameters of the system are present.

As it can be deduced from Figures 10,11,a n d 12, the proposed vaccination strategy is robust to small uncertainties in its parameters, especially in the delays. Also, the impulsivevaccination possesses the same e ect as in the example of the ideal case, that is, it increases the immune by 100 individuals at each impulsive instant and could be used to mitigate any potential deviation of the immune population due to the parameters mismatch. More technical solutions could be made for the case of presence of uncertainties, as for instance,the use of observers to estimate the state and the use of estimation-based adaptive control for the case of parametrical uncertainties.Advances in Di erence Equations 29 0 1 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 0050010001500200025003000VaccinationVaccination law with i mpulses Days Figure 9: Vaccination law with impulses. 0 1 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 00100200300400500600700Individuals I(ideal) I(uncertainties ) Days Figure 10: Infectious evolution in the presence of small uncertainties. 7. Concluding Remarks This paper has dealt with the proposal and subsequent investigation of a time-varying SEIR-type epidemic model of true mass-action type. The model includes time-varying point delays for the infected and infectious populations and distributed delays for the disease transmission e ect in the model. The model also admits a potential mortality associated with the disease, a potential lost of immunity of newborns at birth, the presence of thresholdpopulation residuals in the infected and infectious populations as well as the contribution to the disease propagation in the local population of potential outsiders taking part of a floating population. A combined regular plus impulsive vaccination strategy has been proposed toremove the disease e ects, the second one being used to correct major discrepancies with respect to the suitable population trajectories. The main issues have been concerned with the30 Advances in Di erence Equations E(uncertainties ) E(ideal) 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 800100200300400500600700800900Individuals Days Figure 11: Infected evolution in the presence of small uncertainties. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80010002000300040005000600070008000900010000IndividualsR(uncertainties )R(ideal) S(uncertainties )S(ideal) Days Figure 12: Immune evolution in the presence of small uncertainties. stability, positivity, and model-following of a suitable reference strategy via vaccination.

It remains prove thatAdvances in Di erence Equations 37 R/parenleftmatht/parenrightmath0,for allt/parenleftmath0,TI/bracketrightmath. It follows directly by directly calculating the unique solution of /parenleftmath2.4/parenrightmathon/bracketleftmath0,TI/bracketrightmathfor each given set of admissible initial ea l lt h ec o e cient functions which parameterize the SEIR model /parenleftmath2.1/parenrightmath-/parenleftmath2.5/parenrightmathand all the delay functions are bounded and either everywhere piecewise continuous or continuous on R0/plusmath, where IMP /parenleftmatht/parenrightmath:/equalmath{tiIMP :ti<t}IMP/parenleftmatht/plusmath/parenrightmathIMP is the set of impulsive time instants up till time t. The above expression follows from /parenleftmath2.4/parenrightmathin a direct, but involved, way by taking into account the following facts: /parenleftmatha/parenrightmathIMP/parenleftmatht/parenrightmathMP/parenleftmatht/plusmath/parenrightmathwith IMP /parenleftmatht/parenrightmathMP/parenleftmatht/plusmath/parenrightmathif and only if tIMP, /parenleftmathb/parenrightmaththe solutions of /parenleftmath2.4/parenrightmathare calculated as the homogeneous solution plus the forced one for each given initial conditions in the same way as it has been made before to obtain/parenleftmath3.3/parenrightmathfrom/parenleftmath3.1/parenrightmathfor the total population with the replacements /parenleftmath/parenleftmatht/parenrightmath/parenleftmatht/parenrightmath/parenrightmath /parenleftmath/parenleftmatht/parenrightmath/plusmath/parenleftmatht/parenrightmath/parenrightmathand the former forcing function by their current counterpart, /parenleftmathc/parenrightmaththe solution of the forced part of the solution associated with the impulsive actions is calculated as follows R/parenleftmatht/plusmath/parenrightmath/equalmathR/parenleftmatht/parenrightmath/plusmath/parenleftmatht/parenrightmathg/parenleftmatht/parenrightmathV/parenleftmatht/parenrightmathS/parenleftmatht/parenrightmath,a Outline of Proof of Assertion 10 The constraint E/parenleftmath0/parenrightmath</parenleftmathuE/parenleftmath0/parenrightmath/plusmath|/parenleftmath0/parenrightmath|/parenrightmath//parenleftmath/parenleftmath0/parenrightmath/plusmath/parenleftmath0/parenrightmath/parenrightmathtogether with the remaining valid ones of Assertion 9 imply E/parenleftmath0/parenrightmath>0f r o m/parenleftmath2.2/parenrightmathso that the proof of Assertion 9 remains valid. The following result gives conditions for the impulsive-free vaccination SEIR model /parenleftmath2.1/parenrightmath-/parenleftmath2.5/parenrightmathto be a positive dynamic system in the sense that any solution is nonnegative for all time under bounded absolutely continuous initial conditions S,E,I,R:/bracketleftmathh,0/bracketrightmathR0/plusmath, eventually subject to a set of isolated bounded discontinuities.

As a result, all the populations of the SEIR model /parenleftmath2.1/parenrightmath-/parenleftmath2.5/parenrightmathare nonnegative for all time and the result is proved for this case.
