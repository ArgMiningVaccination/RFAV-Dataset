President Mike Fitts on Dec. 8, 2017, announced that \"Only the Audacious, The campaign for an ever bolder Tulane\" has a goal of raising $1.3 billion. At the launch event, Lee Hamm, MD, senior vice president and dean of the School of Medicine and the James R. Doty Distinguished Professor, spoke about the school's exciting future and how the campaign has the ability to transform research and teaching. \"We look for having impact at many levels,\" Hamm said. \"We want to discover the next treatment of cancer, the next cure of an emerging, infectious disease, and we want to train the next gen - eration of physicians and scientists who will be leading research efforts throughout the country and taking care of patients.\" The campaign will elevate every facet of Tulane and the School of Medicine. The four key initiatives include pioneering research, transformative teaching, opportunity and diversity, and building an environment to support excellence. Tulane's largest fundraising campaign Only the Audacious BY HANNAH TOPPING$11.3 MILLION TO CENTER FOR AGING The National Institutes of Health awarded a Biomed - ical Research Excellence (COBRE) grant to the Tulane Center for Aging. The grant means an additional five years of funding for the multidisciplinary project that began in 2012. The COBRE award further establishes the Tulane center's research into aging and regen - erative medicine, expanding its cardiovascular focus to emphasize musculoskeletal aging. The center will also examine chronic low-grade inflammation, a hallmark of many age-related diseases, such as osteoarthritis, athero - sclerosis, Alzheimer's and macular degeneration. S.

Bone Marrow Transplant Unit A more comfortable space for patients BY FAITH DAWSON The Tulane Medical Center Bone Marrow Transplant Unit has moved into newly reno - vated space, increasing the unit from seven beds to 16. The $3.8 million renovation added patient-centric amenities like ambient lighting and furnishings that double as visitor beds. Safety features such as impervious seating and flooring, an electronic positive pressure system to clean air continuously, and filtered water at all outlets are part of the updated unit, which is specially designed for the comfort and protection of transplant patients. Louisiana-themed art, printed directly on easily cleaned sheet metal, is part of the new design. The more welcoming, homey environment in the new unit helps patients be more compliant with their therapy than in the old unit, said Hana Safah, MD, medical director of the unit. \"Now patients are more comfortable returning.\" Overheard \"The humanities have often been pushed to the side in medical school curricula, but our data suggests that exposure to the arts is linked to important personal qualities for future physicians.\"DR. ERIN BOH'S PSORIASIS WORK At the annual meeting of the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD), Erin Boh, MD, PhD, chair and professor of derma - tology, received the 2018 Outstanding Physician/Clinician Award from the National Psoriasis Foundation. The award was given in recognition of Boh's research and clinical work in the area of psoriasis. She also received a presidential citation for her work on the AAD board of direc - tors as chair of the member communica - tions committee. Boh serves on the AAD board of directors.Dermatology recognition4 tulane med | spring 2018Palliative care EASING SUFFERING Sonia Malholtra, MD, MS, FAAP , received a \"Champion of Excellence\" award from Heart of Hospice in 2017. Malholtra is assistant profes - sor of medicine and pediatrics at Tulane School of Medicine and director of palliative medicine and supportive care at University Medical Center New Orleans. Her medical education interests include teaching primary palliative medicine skills to medical students, residents, fellows and other allied health professionals. She has published in the Harvard Review of Psychiatry and has authored several book chapters on adult and pediat - ric palliative medicine includ - ing the American Academy of Hospice & Palliative Medicine's UNIPAC series. Palliative medicine is an interdisciplinary subspecialty that provides comprehensive treatment of physical, emo - tional, cultural and spiritual needs related to serious illness or injury. The word palliate means \"to ease;\" the focus of palliative medicine is to ease the suffering that results from illness and to reduce caregiver stress. \u2014Mary K.

Mulcahey, MD Sex-specific sports medicine Returning active women to play Mary K. Mulcahey, MD, director of the Tulane Women's Sports Medicine Program, keeps her focus on helping active women stay active in a way that best aligns with their goals and lifestyles. \"The psychological response to injury can significantly affect outcomes and return to play. Psychological effects are different for women than for men, and women may need a different approach in communication and treatment,\" said Mulcahey. \"The differences between men and women's injuries plus the sex-specific variation in response to injury supports the need for a medical team dedicated to the overall health care of women.\" Mulcahey practices at the Tulane Institute of Sports Medicine and at Tulane Lakeside Hospital for Women and Children. Her clinical interests include arthroscopy of the shoulder and knee, sports medicine, shoulder instability, rotator cuff disease, ligament recon - struction of the knee, shoulder reconstruction including total shoulder and reverse total shoulder replacements, and fracture care. Musculoskeletal health is the foundation of overall health, especially for women, accord - ing to Mulcahey. Her program works to ensure that patients build a strong foundation and have access to complete wellness across multiple disciplines, including OB/GYN, psychology, injury prevention and nutrition.Mulcahey received her medical degree from the University of Rochester School of Medicine in Rochester, New York, in 2006. She completed her orthopaedic residency and a fellowship in orthopaedic trauma at Brown University. She then had a fellow - ship in sports medicine at San Diego Arthroscopy and Sports Medicine Center. While in fellowship, she assisted with team coverage of the Major League Baseball San Diego Padres and San Diego State University. She then was in practice in the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Drexel University College of Medicine in Philadelphia for four years before joining the faculty at Tulane in 2017. While in Philadelphia, she was the ringside physician for professional boxing and mixed martial arts. At Tulane, Mulcahey is associate profes - sor in the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery of the School of Medicine. 5 tulane med | spring 2018DAVID JOHN DOUKAS, MD, holds the James A. Knight, MD, Chair of Humanities and Ethics in Medicine. He joined the School of Medicine in December 2017 to create and direct Tulane's Program for Medical Ethics and Human Values. VIEWPOINT : Q. How do you hope to improve medical professionalism training? If you're going to fulfill medical school requirements for a curriculum in medical profes - sionalism, you must have not only medical ethics, but also medical history\u2014a perspective of where we came from; reflec - tive narrative\u2014those aspects of the English language that pro - mote thoughtful analysis; and, observational skills\u2014that teaching fine art promotes not only seeing but also perceiving with context and richness. Q. So today's medical students should have an active pursuit in fields like music or art? I would like to see at Tulane required coursework in all of the noted medical humanities. We owe it to our students to have medical ethics and also humanities as an integral part of their development so they can further develop their critical thinking skills, which will then benefit all of their patients. Q. How should medical personnel address bias or prejudice in patients? When people act out with racist, sexist or cruel talk or jokes in healthcare settings, they are trying to make the listener uncomfortable, to say, \"These 'outliers' [to me] are not welcome.\" Without our being cold or cruel, one needs to say, \"This type of thinking is unwelcome here.\" It's a hard thing to do. The first time I had a patient who made a racial slur, I said, \"You don't really mean that. I don't want to hear you speak like that in my office, because you're dehu - manizing somebody, and we don't do that here.\" Q. What are the most pressing ethics issues for New Orleans? As one walks from Tulane School of Medicine across Claiborne Avenue to University Medical Center and on to the VA, you see many people encamped in tents and sitting in wheelchairs. Most are not there by choice, and you know that these people are likely not receiving many (if any) healthcare needs. Part of David John Doukas, MDThe importance of ethics and humanities in medical training BY FAITH DAWSON PAULA BURCH-CELENTANOthe problem is people who feel vulnerable oftentimes feel locked out or shut out. We have an obligation to let them in\u2014to care for them. Q. What end-of-life issues should people consider? One of the biggest issues that society still faces is the resis - tance by patients to have meaningful discussions with their loved ones on their values and preferences on future end- of-life care. By having these discussions, and documenting them with a living will and durable power of attorney for health care (freely available online), we can transform the quality of life for our future selves. We are allowed to say \"no\" to any treatment, at a time of our choosing, when compe - tent. It helps us and our loved ones have conversations about what we want, or don't want, in the future.6 tulane med | spring 2018 tulane med | spring 2018 1 Research: Biodefense, trauma care New Vaccine Against Bacte - rial Pathogen BY MARY ANN TRAVIS A safe, non-infectious vaccine to protect against the \"tricky\" and dangerous bacterial pathogen Burkholderia pseu - domallei is close to moving to the Good Manufacturing Practice stage and perhaps on its way to eventual Food and Drug Administration licensure. Lisa Morici, PhD, associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Tulane School of Medicine, and other researchers are developing the vaccine with funding from the Defense Threat Reduction Agency of the U.S. Department of Defense. Burkholderia pseudomallei occurs naturally in the soil in Southeast Asia and north - ern Australia. It can cause melioidosis, an elusive disease associated with spiking fevers, extreme pneumonia and difficult to treat abscesses.Melioidosis is often fatal due to misdiagnosis, and it is resis - tant to certain antibiotics. Burkholderia pseudomallei has potential to be used maliciously as a weapon if it is aerosolized. In her lab, Morici is mainly focused on a vaccine against Burkholderia pseudomallei for the biodefense community. However, she said, \"Development of a vac - cine for biodefense purposes could eventually be used to save lives in a public health setting.\"7 tulane med | spring 2018 2ILLUSTRATIONS: PAUL GARLANDHandbook for PTSD BY CAROLYN SCOFIELD They'll Never Be the Same: A Parent's Guide to PTSD in Youth (Central Recovery Press, 2018) is a handbook by Michael S.

BY CAROLYN SCOFIELD PHOTOGRAPHY BY CRAIG MULCAHY What makes a good doctor? Are the only measures of achievement election to the Alpha Omega Alpha honor society or a match with one of the most prestigious residency programs? Or is it something more\u2014as New Orleanians put it, the lagniappe\u2014that makes Tulane doctors stand apart? \"We think we can teach people the science of medicine,\" says Marc J. Kahn, MD, MBA, MACP , Peterman-Prosser Professor of medicine and senior associate dean for admissions and stu - dent affairs at Tulane University School of Medicine. \"What's harder to teach is the humanity. It's hard to teach empathy.\" Tulane's School of Medicine offers two unique programs that allow future doctors to approach their medical studies through non-traditional tracks. The Tulane Accelerated Physician Training Program, or TAP-TP , allows students to earn a combined bachelor's degree and medical doctorate in seven years. Students spend two years completing work toward their undergraduate degree, followed by a year working with a community organization before beginning medical school. Creative Premedical Scholars is open to students who want to major in liberal arts at Tulane and pursue a career in medicine after graduation. Students have to maintain a GPA of 3.6 or above and complete a number of premedical course requirements by the end of their sophomore year, but they don't have to take the MCAT. If admitted, they are granted early acceptance to Tulane School of Medicine. Kahn says both programs emphasize the art of medicine as well as a commitment to service for these future doctors. SETTING A GOAL EARLY Fourth-year medical student Erin Ricketts knew from a young age she wanted to study medicine. \"I came to Tulane because I wanted to be a doctor,\" Ricketts says. \"I wanted to practice medicine, and I didn't necessarily want to spend a lot of time focusing on things other than medicine to start out with, especially if it would cost me a lot of money.\" Ricketts spent a year working with a program that provided education and job training to at-risk youth. She wrote grants, designed and implemented educational programs for both after- school programs and summer camps, and tutored in remedial math for middle school students. That year of public service gave her insight she couldn't learn from a textbook. \"I learned a lot about people who don't have any access to any resources like healthy food or preventive programs like dentistry,\" Ricketts says. \"I learned what inequality means from a ground level and what can be done and is being done to make things more equal. A lot of that I think I'll take with me as a physician.\" Ricketts graduates medical school this spring and hopes to match with a program that combines internal and preventive medicine. The 23-year-old says she's excited to take the next step in her medical career and, because of TAP-TP , she'll have more time to pursue her goals. \"It will give me extra years when I'm young and healthy and can practice with patients,\" Rickets says. \"I can also spend some time traveling or getting involved in projects that don't pay so well because I do have that extra time.\" A'S & ACES Joshua Pincus chose to come to Tulane because he loved the school and the city. He didn't know about TAP-TP before beginning his freshman year. Then an email came through his Tulane email account, announcing an information session for a \"novel 2+1+4 bachelor degree/MD/public service program\" to be held in the lounge of his residence hall. Pincus applied, was interviewed and got accepted into the program two weeks later. \"It will save me a substantial amount of money and a year off Art & Soul10 tulane med | spring 2018the typical eight-year track, all while adding an enriching life experience through the year of service,\" he says. Pincus is currently in his service year and working with a non - profit organization called A's & Aces, which focuses on teaching tennis and life skills to New Orleans public school children. Pincus works in public schools all over the parish, doing in-school programming with PE classes, as well as after-school and Saturday programming. \"The kids I get to work with every day are inspiring and very bright,\" Pincus says. \"I am proud of them for the improvement they have made on the tennis court and in the classroom.\" The lessons Pincus is learning during his year of service will follow him into medical school. \"I've had to adjust to working a full-time job for the first time in my life, which has forced me to improve my time-management skills as well as take on more responsibilities,\" he says. TULANIANS FOR LIFE Lauren Lim and her husband, Jack Hua, met in TAP-TP . Hua grew up wanting to be a doctor, but Lim had other inter - ests too. She liked the flexibility offered by TAP-TP . Students who begin in the program but decide not to go to medical school aren't penalized. \"We realize that we are taking in kids, some who are not even 18 years old, and we're asking them to commit to something that is rather rigorous,\" Kahn says. \"Having said that, we haven't had many students drop out.\" Lim continued on the TAP-TP track and was elected to the AOA honor society. She and Hua are both DeBakey Scholars, a program that offers Tulane medical students the opportunity to pursue and complete a research project culminating in a capstone presentation prior to graduation. They both also received Aron Merit Scholarships to help defray the cost of their medical edu - cations. The couple matched at Tulane for their residencies. \"We're tied to Tulane for life,\" Lim says. Two classes have graduated from TAP-TP , and Kahn says the majority of students have stayed in New Orleans to continue their medical careers. \"One of the motivations for TAP-TP was to develop a pilot program to show that we could do this successfully,\" Kahn says. \"We also wanted to capitalize on community service, which the university believes in and the medical school believes in, and we wanted to attract brainpower that stays locally.\" MUSIC AND MEDICINE Kahn estimates nearly half of this year's first-year medical students majored in something other than science for their bachelor's degree. Kahn and Salvatore Magione, MD, of Drexel University studied the impact of the humanities on medical school students. \"We asked students at five medical schools how much time they spent reading or writing fiction, dancing, playing music or going to concerts and the theater,\" Kahn says. \"We found the higher the humanity score, the more empathetic, the more toler - ant of ambiguity, the more wisdom and the less burnout these students experience.\" Burnout is something Matthew Behrens hopes to avoid when he becomes a doctor. He wants to go into emergency medicine after he graduates and believes his years studying music will help. Behrens came to Tulane to be part of the Creative Premedical Scholars program. \"Knowing that I had an acceptance when I was 19 or 20, all of my classmates that I talk to can't even believe how good of a deal that is,\" Behrens says. \"I got to spend the next two years in under - grad studying what I wanted and doing interesting stuff.\" Behrens majored in music and spent a semester studying abroad in West Africa. The Creative Premedical Scholars pro - gram requires students to write an honors thesis, and Behrens wrote his on the modernization of music and storytelling in Dakar, Senegal. During his time in medical school, Behrens has participated in Tulane's Music in Medicine club, which holds open mic nights. \"I feel like the more places you can derive meaning in your life from, the healthier and more well-rounded you'll be,\" Behrens says. THE THEATRE MAJOR Jordan Eisenberg graduates this spring with a Bachelor of Arts in theatre. Her last semester before medical school is a busy one, preparing her for what's ahead. Eisenberg recently landed the role of Mary the Maid in the Tulane production of The Bald Soprano . \"I think there's a great deal of connection between theater and medicine,\" she says. \"One of the biggest things you do in theater is learn to work with a team. You're all working together to get to the same goal. You learn to work quickly on your feet. It's a dif - ferent kind of problem-solving but it's the same fundamentals.\" As a Creative Premedical Scholar, Eisenberg is grateful for the time she's been able to spend pursuing her passion for theater before she turns to her other love, medicine. \"I look at our rehearsal schedule and it's six days a week and if I was preparing to either take the MCAT or in my premed classes, I don't think I would have been able to handle doing those simul - taneously,\" she says. \"It allows me to immerse myself in it without being pulled in another direction.\" STANDING APART Kahn believes both of these non-traditional tracks improve the quality of the education here. \"These programs are consistent with the philosophy of the medical school,\" he says. \"We want a commitment to public ser - vice since medicine is a service profession, and we have an interest in well-rounded people who use both halves of their brain.\" \u00de11 tulane med | spring 2018PHOTO: JOHN RICHIE With a public service mindset, future medical student Joshua Pincus teaches tennis\u2014and life skills\u2014to local kids.12 13 tulane med | spring 2018As national leaders in adolescent medicine, infectious disease and nephrology, T ulane pediatricians are uncovering new ways to fight disease\u2014from kidney birth defects to HIV\u2014for all stages of childhood. BY KEITH BRANNONpreventing disease for our youngest patientsFROM TODDLERS TO TEENS14 tulane med | spring 2018 TThe stem cells have been incubating for about 18 days in a pool of nutrients to form the beginnings of a kidney. El-Dahr, MD, and his research team are coaxing them to develop into an organoid, a miniature organ in vitro with the same structure and function of a kidney, but at a much smaller scale. \"It's almost the size of a pinhead right now when we grow it,\" says El-Dahr, chair of the Department of Pediatrics and Jane B. Aron Professor. \"But it has all the elements of nephrons in it.\" El-Dahr is leading a $1.4 million study funded by the National Institutes of Health to characterize the epigenome of stem cells to find a more effective way to reprogram them to differentiate into progenitors of kidney cells. Ultimately, the goal is to figure out how to grow a fully developed kidney that's viable for transplantation. \"Building kidney organoids from human stem cells is not science fiction anymore,\" El-Dahr explains. \"Many labs, including ours, have done it. The next challenge rests on making the stem cell-derived organoids safe and functional. Our work will advance the knowledge and technology to rebuild a kidney from stem cells by knowing more about how to reprogram them.\" Kidney regeneration is just one of several federally funded studies ongoing within Tulane's Department of Pediatrics. For a group dedicated to Tulane's smallest patients, it has one of the most active research portfolios within the School of Medicine. Projects span from studies of Lassa fever and Ebola survivors in West Africa to one of the largest and longest- running studies of children in the United States born with HIV. The department is known for three primary research areas: nephrology, infec - tious diseases and adolescent medicine. Pediatrics brought in more than $5 million in research funding last fiscal year, accounting for almost 40 percent of the department's budget. That includes more than $3.2 million in NIH-funded research and almost $1.9 million in research grants from other sources. \"We are the leader in pediatric research in the city, in the region and in the state,\" El-Dahr says. BUILDING A KIDNEY El-Dahr's research team, which includes Zubaida Saifudeen, PhD, and Ryosuke Sato, PhD, focuses on the cellular and molecular regulation of kidney development. Birth defects are more common in the kidney and urinary tract with an estimated one out of every 500 births exhibiting some abnormality in kidney development. The condition causes between 30 to 50 percent of end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis in children. Children with severe disease may need a kidney transplant to recover, but the aver - age wait for an organ is three and a half years. The science to grow a full organ is still underdeveloped. Researchers can only grow organoids that resemble fetal kidneys. To overcome this, El-Dahr's lab is working to better understand the epigenetic mechanisms that dictate how stem cells differentiate into nephrons. \"The problem is that right now we are able to go from stem cells to precursor cells to progenitors and from those to mature filters (or nephrons), but it's very inefficient,\" he says. \"We think we can make the reprogramming process much more efficient. We've identified some obstacles that we can work on that would help the organoids mature while still in a dish to become more functional.\" The goal isn't to grow a full kidney in a dish but rather to make more mature organoids that can be placed onto a The tiny cluster of cells floating in a culture dish in pediatric nephrologist Samir El-Dahr's lab is about as big as a sesame seed. 15 tulane med | spring 2018 tulane med | spring 2018 PHOTO: JACKSON HILLscaffold to grow into a fully functional organ that could be transplanted into a patient. El-Dahr is optimistic that such a break - through is not far down the horizon. \"The field is moving very, very fast.\" ADVANCING CLINICAL TRIALS Basic science isn't the only focus for Tulane Pediatrics. It is also putting the pieces together to grow a world-class clinical trials program at Tulane Lakeside Hospital for Women and Children. Pediatrician John Carlson, MD, and child psychiatrist Stacy Drury, MD, PhD, are collaborating with LSU's Pennington Biomedical Research Center on a $1.4 million NIH-funded Institutional Development Awards project to build state-of-the art pediatric clinical research networks in the state. The network is linked to the Environmental Influences on Child Health Outcomes program, which sup - ports new pediatric clinical trials at all of Tulane's clinical sites. The research focuses on upper and lower airway diseases, obe - sity, neurodevelopmental disorders and prenatal, perinatal and postnatal health as well as other pediatric clinical conditions. \"My responsibility has been to expand and build our clinical research infrastructure,\" says Drury, vice chair of research in pediatrics. She sees growth opportunities in current areas of excellence within the department, such as the treatment of obesity-related diseases, irritable bowel syndrome, sickle cell anemia and neonatal intensive care. Drury is also working to connect more patients to local clinical trials via a new tab - let-based registry. In collaboration with Louisiana Public Health Institute, Drury is building the registry to let children seen at Lakeside Hospital have a chance to be part of the most up-to-date clinical trials to improve their health. Health in Our Hands has been active for adult patients but start - ing in June 2018, HiHO Kids, the pediatric version, will be available. \"The reason I want to build our clinical trials research is because I think that allows us to provide the best and highest level of patient care,\" Drury says. 'MELTING IN MY ARMS' One of the pilot projects supported by the clinical research grant is a study to see if one of the oldest tricks in parenting\u2014 singing to soothe a fussy baby\u2014can also have clinical benefits. While there have been music therapy studies in adults and older children, there's scant research on its effect on babies. Pediatrician Meghan P . Howell, MD, is studying how music therapy affects healthy newborns as well as babies born with neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) from drug exposure in utero. Children with NAS are often under - weight and suffer painful withdrawal symptoms, including extreme irritability and excessive crying. The NAS project is linked to a multicenter national study based out of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. \"The study opens up the discussion on how we can use different psychosocial interventions to help with NAS,\" Howell says. She is working to enroll 150 infants, including NAS patients from the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU), and partnering with music therapists from Loyola University's music department. Therapists will sing a lullaby like \"Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star,\" or perform different vocalizations based on reactive cues from the infant. They can also play recorded songs that include soothing nature sounds like ocean waves. Before, during and after the session, researchers monitor the baby's heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation and other vital signs. They are studying whether the interventions affect heart rate, sleep 1 OUT OF 500 Births exhibit some abnormality in kidney development$1.4 MILLION NIH study to reprogram stem cells into kidney cellsSamir El-Dahr, MD KIDNEY BIRTH DEFECTS16tulane med | spring 2018 patterns, fussiness and the amount of medicine needed to manage withdrawal symptoms. Howell began collecting baseline data on babies last year. On the first session, the parents were in the room with the music therapist. \"The father was holding the baby, and he made a comment to the music thera - pist. He said, 'I just feel like the baby is melting into my arms. I can just feel him relax,'\" Howell says. \"And so the parents have said when they've been able to be there and participate that they felt like the baby was calmer.\" Howell is also tracking outcomes for Tulane's NICU graduate clinic, a multi - disciplinary follow-up care program for babies who spend extended time in neo - natal intensive care. The program helps families as they navigate care options once they leave the hospital. \"We link them in with subspecialists and provide some maternal mental health screenings and maternal support as the parents make that transition from the NICU,\" she says. PROTECTING TEENS Tulane pediatric research is also connected to the New Orleans community. It's home to one of the largest NIH studies aimed at finding better ways to protect high- risk teens and young adults from contracting HIV. Section chief of adolescent medicine Sue Ellen Abdalian, MD, leads one of two major sites for Adolescent Medicine Trials Network's Comprehensive Adolescent Recruitment & Engagement Strategies (ATN-CARES) study, a community intervention in New Orleans and Los Angeles that targets high-risk youth between 14-24 years old. New Orleans has one of the highest rates of HIV infection in the country. In 2015, youth aged 13-24 accounted for 32 percent of all new HIV diagnoses in the city, according to state health officials. Abdalian's team is recruiting 750 at-risk HIV negative youth, particularly young men who have sex with men and trans - gender women. The study offers free sexually transmitted disease screenings every four months and HIV tests. Study counselors check in with participants peri - odically via text messaging. They also get automated texts that offer health and wellness tips. Each week, participants are asked seven text questions about illnesses and risky encounters. If answers raise a red flag, a counselor will reach out and may ask them to come in for a new test. Participants are randomly assigned to groups that get a mix of other support such as a life coach, a peer support group or both between testing visits. They are also offered referrals for services like pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a daily HIV medicine that can significantly reduce the chances of HIV infection. The goal is to test which supports can best prevent new infections. Should a participant become HIV positive, they will be offered immediate treatment, health care and enrolled in another study to test the impact of early antiretroviral therapy. Current HIV thera - pies can knock viral levels down to unde - tectable, but the virus hides in reservoirs in the body. These allow HIV to roar back if patients stop taking their medication. \"Our hypothesis is that if we can find adolescents who have been infected with HIV and diagnosed within three months of their infection\u2014and we treat them with just the standard of care\u2014that they will not establish this viral reservoir,\" says Jasmine Fournier, program manager for ATN-CARES. \"Then maybe they could go off of medication at some point and not have a viral rebound. So it would be like a remission, or perhaps in the future with new technology they could be com - pletely cured of HIV.\" The team is also working on another text message intervention aimed at youth who have been HIV positive for a while but have suppressing the virus. Often they aren't taking their medication regularly or have other complications, Abdalian says. \"We send them messages about taking care of themselves in every way including eating well, reducing stress, taking medi - cation and protecting themselves and oth - ers if they're sexually active,\" she says. \"They're all sorts of different kinds of health messages. It's not just about HIV.\" One of the biggest health obstacles is often youth's sense of invincibility. The idea that HIV/AIDS is something that happens \"to other people\" or that \"it can't happen to me\" is still a common refrain, Abdalian says. It makes it particularly painful when a patient she's worked with for months to prevent infection still ends up testing positive. \"It breaks my heart every time,\" she says. Worse are the rare cases when they lose a patient who develops AIDS from stop - ping their medication. It happens at least once a year, says health services manager Leslie Kozina, RN, CCRC, health services manager for the New Orleans Adolescent Medicine Trials Unit at Tulane. \"We work with them for a long period to try to do the right thing for their own bodies. And for whatever reason, they just can't do it,\" she says. \"There's no reason to die from HIV at this point. But if you don't take your medicine, you get sick ... eventually.\" While those are the hardest parts of working in HIV prevention, there are tri - umphs as well. Tulane participated in the two federal studies to test the safety and efficacy of PrEP for youth between the ages of 15-22. Kozina recently counseled two participants and let them know that the data from those studies were going to the Food and Drug Administration in an effort to make PrEP the standard of care to prevent HIV in high-risk young adults. She explained to them that they were helping move medicine forward\u2014and protecting other teens like them across the county. \"They did something important. I was happy to tell them this and they were really happy. We were jumping up and down,\" Kozina says. \"And, you know, the thrill of that is ... I think that's the best reward I've ever gotten in my 20 years here.\" \u00de PHOTOS: JACKSON HILLtulane med | spring 2018 Sue Ellen Abdalian, MD HIV PREVENTION 32% Of all new HIV diagnoses in New Orleans represent youth aged 13-24 (2015)750 At-risk HIV negative youth being recruited for HIV intervention program National spotlight Tulane pediatric infectious disease researchers are leaders in high-profile NIH investigations.HIV/AIDS STUDY Russell Van Dyke, MD, professor and chief of the section of pediatric infectious dis - eases, co-leads the Pediatric HIV/AIDS Cohort Study (PHACS), the largest long- term study of U.S. children born with HIV.

BY FAITH DAWSON ILLUSTRATION BY GREG MABLY19 tulane med | spring 2018 Only so much of a surgeon's knowledge can come from text - books or classroom instruction, he adds. Clinical education and experience contribute to the formation of a successful surgeon. \"You don't just go in with a Plan A, and this is one of the things that fascinates medical students a lot about surgeons: Rarely does Plan A actually work. Usually you have to have a Plan A, a Plan B, a Plan C, a Plan D, a Plan E. You have to have all these backup plans and scenarios,\" DuCoin says. As a surgeon, DuCoin says he pursues innovative treatments and solutions; as much as half of his practice, he estimates, consists of treatments he learned while in fellowship or from his research while at Tulane. In Frankfurt, Germany, DuCoin trained in peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) and brought that technology to Tulane, performing the first procedure in the region. POEM addresses patients with achalasia, a condition in which the esophagus doesn't carry food toward the stomach. Through POEM, DuCoin uses an endoscope to facilitate an incision in the distal esophagus, which loosens the muscle and restores peristalsis in the patient. TThe dichotomy of the surgical practice of Christopher DuCoin, MD, MPH, is defined by his two most common procedures. In morbidly obese patients, DuCoin's bariatric surgical interven - tion helps them eat less and thereby keeps their weight under control; in patients with esophageal or gastric conditions, surgery can actually help them eat more. These opposing benefits are part of the challenge of DuCoin's practice: The esophagus, a seemingly \"benign tube\" that con - nects the mouth and the stomach, is more than just a passageway. DuCoin is an assistant professor of general surgery and sur - gery clerkship director at Tulane University School of Medicine, as well as chief of the Minimally Invasive Gastrointestinal Surgery Section and director of the bariatric surgery program at Tulane Medical Center. He specializes in bariatric surgery and surgery of the foregut, including minimally invasive procedures and other procedures, from hernia repair to complex esophagectomy. Most of DuCoin's practice is made up of two types of surgeries: bariatric surgeries to promote weight loss (sleeve gastrectomy and bypass surgery); as well as esophageal and gastric surgery in three modalities: endoscopic, robotic and laparoscopic procedures, which address cancer, hernias and strictures like achalasia. Bariatric surgery can help people with morbid obesity become more confident and active. Weight-loss surgeries have improved dramatically in the last 20 years, and patient preparation, which can take as long as six months, improves results as well. \"Bariatric surgery has become safer than having your gallblad - der taken out. For elective surgery, it's one of the safest proce - dures we offer,\" DuCoin says. \"A lot of that comes from better patient selection, better preoperative evaluation and workup, and treatment of diseases such as cardiac and pulmonary diseases, before the patient even goes to the operating room.\" \"TIGER COUNTRY\" In early December, DuCoin had eight surgeries scheduled over the course of one day. \"Surgery is something I enjoy so much that someone could say, 'Wow, what an exhausting day;' I guarantee you, I went home and was exhilarated and felt great. It's something I look forward to.\" The following week, he had a six-hour esophagectomy sched - uled. \"I've already mentally rehearsed the case probably nothing short of 20 times. I go through the steps in my head: everything from positioning the patient, to what I think it will look like, to how I'll approach the procedure, various incisions. I go through it over and over and over.\" CRAIG MULCAHY20 tulane med | spring 2018Now he performs about five POEMs per month. DuCoin says he receives refer - rals from other hospitals in the city, as well as around the region. The esophagus, situated near major organs and blood vessels, rests in a high- risk area of the thorax, what a trauma surgeon colleague called \"tiger country.\" Consider the esophagectomy for cancer patients. \"A big cancer surgery involves usually a procedure on the stomach where you actually rebuild the stomach into the new esophagus,\" DuCoin says. \"You're operating on the chest to remove the [cancerous] esophagus; and you actually operate on the neck, where you hook the stomach up to the bottom of the oropharyngeal or upper esophagus.\" INFLUENTIAL MENTORS DuCoin graduated from Tulane in 2003 with a bachelor's degree in neuroscience and a master's degree in epidemiology from the School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine in 2005. After he graduated from medical school and completed a fellowship in minimally invasive surgery, he was drawn back to New Orleans, he says, by the opportunity to make a difference in a region that needed more surgeons. \"Because of my public health degree, [I thought,] where could I make the biggest impact with the skill set that I possess? It was New Orleans,\" he says. \"Coming back to Tulane was just the cherry on top; I was excited that the job was at Tulane.\" The Tulane practice has since grown to two surgeons since his arrival, with plans to add two more at University Medical Center and Southeast Louisiana Veterans Affairs Health Care System. The section is also planning for a minimally invasive and bariatric surgery fellowship for August. DuCoin partially credits his career to serendipity\u2014the good fortune of being mentored by people in the field. \"I had great mentors, even as a medical student, and these consisted of physicians who are now prominent national figures in esophageal and gastric surgery and bariatric surgery.\" Last year, DuCoin passed along some of his surgical knowledge during a mission trip to Le\u00f3n, Nicaragua. He and a group from New Orleans Medical Mission Services (NOMMS) traveled to Central America, where they brought much- needed surgical equipment and supplies. They also taught surgeons in the region new and innovative procedures. DuCoin performed a range of open general-surgery procedures such as thy - roidectomies and liver surgeries, teaching the local surgical residents and medical students. However, when DuCoin per - formed a laparoscopic appendectomy, a standard procedure in the United States, 19 Nicaraguan surgeons traveled across the country to observe. NOMMS, a group founded in 2001 by New Orleans physicians, brings medical and surgical supplies that are not always available in the countries they visit. \"It's a challenge operating in such a limited setting and it really tests your skill set. Yet, it's amazing to see how we all operate so alike while training and practicing surgery in different parts of the world,\" DuCoin says.THE NEXT GENERATION As clerkship director, DuCoin sees third- and fourth-year medical students in the surgery rotation. \"I think the students have a good experience, they get good mentorship here, they enjoy surgery,\" he says. \"I enjoy the mentorship and teaching. I can remember in training being mesmerized by a relatively simple case ... that the surgeon had so many algorithms on how to get through it. That's why I'm here; my role as a teacher is to help teach the surgeons coming behind me.\" Medical students are prone to \"aha moments,\" when the power of surgery comes across for them. \"They see the effect of surgery\u2014that's the aha moment; it's not the complexity in the OR. What was killing the patient\u2014 the cancer\u2014is gone; what was killing the patient\u2014their morbid obesity\u2014is resolving. ... The postoperative effects of the procedure is the hook,\" for many students. DuCoin says he himself still has aha moments\u2014particularly when a surgery goes exactly, precisely as planned. Those times are rare, and the field evolves so rapidly that, he predicted, in a decade surgeons would have a whole new repertoire of procedures to choose from. The thought excites him, he says. \"It's like a painter getting to paint a new painting. I'd hate to have to paint the same painting every day,\" he says. \"I love the idea that we'll be changing the canvas.\" \u00de\"I can remember in training being mesmerized by a relatively simple case ... that the surgeon had so many algorithms on how to get through it.\" \u2014Dr. Christopher DuCoin, MD, MPH21 21 ROUNDS It is with sadness that I report that Philip J.

Accordingly, in this issue of TulaneMed , we discuss groundbreaking science being done at Tulane focused on the embryogenesis of the kidney. However, in this issue we also address that part of medicine directed more towards the right side of the brain, namely the role of the arts. One program unique to Tulane is the Creative Scholars Program, which grants early acceptance to medical school to academically talented premedical undergraduates who major in the humanities or fine arts prior to coming to medical school. This program aims to train a more humanistic physician. Researchers at the School of Medicine have recently shown a correlation between medical student exposure to the arts and positive physician traits such as empathy, tolerance of ambiguity, and wisdom, while also showing less burnout. The School of Medicine wants to train and attract well-rounded physicians who understand both the science and art of medicine, which have often been considered separate in modern times. The great physician, Sir William Osler, though, best defined the art and science of medicine as \"twin berries on one stem.\" At the School of Medicine, we embrace this sentiment.23TMAA OUTST ANDING ALUMNUS: E.

Over the past 35 years on the Tulane faculty, he has helped to secure $40 million in grants, including one that paid for five new \"ballroom labs\" he designed in the J. Bennett Johnston building. After Hurricane Katrina, Clements played an instru - mental role leading a team into New Orleans that res - cued decades worth of research from Tulane laboratories. Q. As a child growing up in Fort Worth, Texas, were you a budding scientist? Truth be told, by fifth grade, I had decided I wanted to be a Marine after watching John Wayne in the movie Sands of Iwo Jima . But I was always interested in science. In ninth grade, I built a Van de Graaff generator, creating a high- voltage current that makes your hair stand on end. In 10th grade, I determined the charge of an electron by repli - cating the Millikan oil drop experiment.STANDOUTS : A career devoted to lifesaving vaccines Q. You attended college in Arlington, near Fort Worth. First, I served in Vietnam. I did six years of active duty in the Marines. When I got home, I enrolled in the University of Texas-Arlington. After I graduated, I got a tech - nician job in a microbiology lab that was trying to come up with a vaccine for cholera. That was in 1975 and I've been working on vaccines ever since. Q. How did you end up at Tulane? I got my first faculty appoint - ment at the University of Rochester in Rochester, New York. It was way too cold for a boy from Texas. So I started looking around for another job. Tulane has a great reputation. It did even back in 1982, back in the old, old days. Also, my mama is from Iowa, Louisiana, not far from DeRidder. So I knew a little bit about Louisiana. And I love New Orleans. It was a good fit for me. Q. What should we know about the vaccines that you worked on? What we really work on are things called adjuvants, things you add to vaccines to make them work better. Just think Tony Chachere's\u2014it makes everything you put it on a little bit better. Well, that's what adjuvants do, they amplify the body's immune response to a vaccine's antigens.BY KATY RECKDAHL JOHN CLEMENTS, PhDQ. The adjuvants you work on can improve access to vaccines by helping to reduce the amount of anti - gens needed in vaccines or allowing them to be delivered differently? Yes. Our primary focus is vaccines against diarrheal diseases for children in developing countries. These diseases do not affect children in developed countries, so they are not attractive targets for large pharmaceutical companies. Along with numerous other organizations, we explore novel ways to develop low-cost, safe, effective vaccines for these children. Q: I'm told you enjoy mentoring. Junior investigators are always asking questions that I would not have thought to ask. The answers allowed us to move forward in directions that I would not have moved on my own. Betzi Norton and Jacob Bitoun in our department will continue working on the same things that I'm working on now, in their own way. It's a natural progression. And because of them, my science won't end when I retire. That's a great consolation to me.The Tu la ne Donor Advised Fund A POWERFUL NEW WAY TO LEAVE YOUR LEGACY.
