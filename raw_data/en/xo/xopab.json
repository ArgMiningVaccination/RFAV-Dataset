If you've tried over-the-counter (nonprescription) acne products for weeks and your acne is still lingering, your doctor might recommend prescription-strength medications. However, many prescription treatments can be time-consuming and risky for specific groups. For example, pregnant women have limited treatment options for acne because of the side effects associated with these medications. [Some acne medications may cause congenital disabilities](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/expert-answers/pregnancy-acne/faq-20058045#:~:text=Acne%20medication%20known%20to%20cause,or%20your%20health%20care%20provider.) if taken while pregnant, including oral isotretinoin like Amnesteem or Claravis and topical retinoids.

This is usually available as a cream or gel and may be applied twice a day, 20 minutes after washing, to all parts of your face affected by acne. Benzoyl peroxide should be used sparingly, as [too much can irritate your skin](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/acne/treatment/). It can also leave your face sensitive to sunlight, so avoid too much sunlight and sources of ultraviolet (UV) light (especially tanning beds), or wear sunscreen. Topical retinoids. Retinoids clear up acne by removing dead skin cells from the skin's surface (exfoliation), which prevents them from building up within hair follicles and causing pimples. [Tretinoin and adapalene](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/acne/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20368048) are commonly prescribed topical retinoids used to treat acne. Retinoids are typically recommended for six weeks at a time. Topical antibiotics. [Antibiotics](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/acne/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20368048) can kill the bacteria on your skin that may infect plugged hair follicles and cause acne. A six-to eight-week course is usually recommended. Treatment is generally stopped at the two-month mark because there's a risk that the bacteria on your face can become resistant to the antibiotics.
