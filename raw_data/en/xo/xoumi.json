Transarterial Radioembolization for the for Hepatic Neoplasia Center for Health and Policy Studies, University of Calgary, November 2010 ii Executive Summary Introduction The intent of the report was to evaluate the social and demographic (S), safety and effectiveness (T) and fiscal and economic (E) factors related to transarterial radioembolization (TARE) for hepatic neoplas ia and their implications for provision of this technology in Alberta. This report focuses on treatment of primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and secondary metastatic tumour to the liver, most often from colorectal cancer (CRC) or neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) of the gut. Presently demand for TARE is limited to patients whom are not candidates for curative therapies, transarterial chemoem bolization (TACE) or who have failed other first-line therapies, and is estimated not to exceed 30 patients per year province wide. Methods Our literature review resulted in four published studies, describing three original randomized controlled trials (RCTs), 33 cohort studies, one meta-analysis, one systematic review and four health technology assessments (HTA) being selected for inclusion. A meta-analysis was performed using publis hed data on the outcomes of interest; data were available for analysis on median survival time, summary survival rates and summary radiological response rate. All data were extracted from the included cohort studies. A cost-effectiveness and budget impact anal yses were also completed. Effectiveness measure for the analyses was median survival time. Transarterial Radioembolization for the for Hepatic Neoplasia Center for Health and Policy Studies, University of Calgary, November 2010 iii Results TARE appears as safe as TACE and Sorafenib therapies for intermediate and advanced staged patients with HCC, respecti vely. TARE is as safe as chemotherapy for patients with liver metastases from colorectal cancer (CRCLM). TARE appears safe metastatic neuroendocrine tumours (mNET). Patients receiving TARE have demonstrated significant survival, radiological response and quality of life benefits as a resul t of treatment. Significant gaps in the evidence existed as reporting criteria are not standardized. The meta-analysis revealed that survival bene fits and radiological responses are seen in patients with portal vein thrombosis (PVT) and in patients whom have failed chemotherapy. Evidence suggests TARE should not be used as a first line therapy in patients with CRCLM or mNET. Economic analysis revealed that TARE is not cost-effective when compared to standard care therapies for intermediate and advanced HCC or CRCLM patients. Conclusions TARE appears safe and effective in HCC patients that have PVT, large tumours, good underlying liver function and less th an 20% lung shunting. TARE may also play a role in maintaining or downstaging patients to liver transplant or resection. TARE appears safe and effective in CRCLM and mNET patients who have failed all other first-line therapies. Budget impact considerations appear more appropriate than cost-effectiveness considerations given the relatively small demand for the technology.

Introduction 1.1. Purpose of Assessment The present report reviews the use of transarterial radioembolization (TARE) for the treatment of primary and secondary hepatic ne oplasia for the purpose of considering its potential as a publically funded health service in Alberta. 1.2. Report Objectives 1. To review the effectiveness/efficacy and safety of TARE compared to standard care for the treatment of patients with primary and secondary hepatic neoplasia. 2. To review the social, ethical and legal considerations for the provision of TARE for the treatment of patients with prim ary and secondary hepatic neoplasia. 3. To review the fiscal and economic considerations for the provision of radioembolization for the treatment of pati ents with primary and secondary hepatic neoplasia. 1.3. Research Questions Is the survival of patients with interme diate stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) receiving patients who receive transarterial chemoembolization (TACE)? Is the survival of patients with advanc ed stage HCC receiving TARE similar to patients who receive sorafenib chemotherapy? Is the safety of TARE similar to the safety of TACE and sorafenib therapy for patients with intermediate and advanced staged HCC? Transarterial Radioembolization for for Hepatic Neoplasia Center for Health and Policy Studies, University of Calgary, October 2010 2 Is TARE cost effective in intermediate and advanced stage HCC when compared to TACE and sorafenib therapy? Is the survival of patients with liver m etastases from colorectal cancer (CRCLM) receiving TARE similar to patients who r eceive systemic or regional chemotherapy? Can TARE safely be added to systemic or regional chemotherapy regimens, and if so are there survival benefits of the concomitan t therapy compared to standard of care for CRCLM patients? Is TARE cost effective in CRCLM patients when compared to systemic and regional chemotherapy? Is TARE safe, effective and cost effective for use in patients with neuroendocrine tumours of the liver (mNET)? 2. Background 2.1. Technology Definition TARE in the present context is used to describe a new technology specifically designed for the treatment of liver tumours (i.e . hepatic neoplasia), and can also be referred to as selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT) or radioembolization. TARE for liver tumours involves the selective delivery of radiation via intrahepatic arteries. TARE is emerging as a new and promising treatment modality for managing patients with nonresectable primary and secondary hepatic neoplasia 1. The specific delivery agent considered in the present report is yttrium-90 (Y90) microspheres. Y90 is a high energy beta emitting radioisotope that can be incor porated into glass or resin microspheres2. In for Hepatic Neoplasia Center for Health and Policy Studies, University of Calgary, October 2010 3 these microspheres are injected into the hepati c artery, usually via a transfemoral approach, and end up in the liver where they emit th eir beta energy. The selectivity of these microspheres for targeting tumour tissue, as opposed to normal liver parenchyma, is in large part due to the vascular supply of the tumour . The overwhelming majority of tumour tissue in the liver derives its blood supply from th e hepatic artery, while normal liver tissue is supplied mainly by the portal vein. This vascular selectivity allows for high doses of radiation to be absorbed by tumour tissue, while keeping the absorbed dose of radiation by normal liver tissue at a low level1, 3. The ability of TARE to selectively destroy cancerous tissues while sparing normal tissues circumvents one of the main limitations of external beam radiation. 2.2. Condition Definition TARE has been used to treat both primary and secondary hepatic neoplasia. Although there is preliminary evidence for the widespread use of this technology in a variety of liver metastases, the present report is fo cused on three of the most commonly reported and emerging indications for use. Specifically , primary hepatic neoplasia (hepatocellular carcinoma) and two cases of secondary hepa (colorectal cancer with liver discussed. 2.2.1 Hepatocellular Carcinoma Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a primary malignancy of the liver that is typically associated with chronic liver inflammation or cirrhosis. Worldwide, the vast majority of cases are related to chronic hepati tis B virus (HBV) infection4. In North America, the majority of Transarterial for Hepatic Neoplasia Center for Health and Policy Studies, University of Calgary, October 2010 4 cases occur in a cirrhotic liver, with hepatitis C virus (HCV) being the leading cause5, 6. HCC is the most common form of primary liver cancer and is a major health concern, accounting for more than 600,000 new cases worldwide per year4. HCC is one of the few cancers that has an increasing incidence in Canada. A Ca nadian report detailing the age-standardized incidences of HCC between 1969 and 1997 found a 3.4% increase per year in men and 1.2% per year in women. The authors of the report also included a fitted non-linear multiplicative model used to estimate the projected incidence and mortality of HCC in Canada for the year 2010, with the estimated number of new cases being 1,565 and the number of deaths being 802 7. Additional studies on the incidence rates for HCC predict that the 2011-2015 incidence rates per 100,000 could be as high as 18.5 (with 7,672 new cases each year) for males and 4.1 (with 1,709 new cases each year) for fe males amongst Canadians aged 40-84 years 8. The incidence of HCC is highest among the elderly, with incidence rates per 100,000 of almost 25 in persons 75 or older in the year 2000 9. This is thought to be largely due to the fact that a latency period of approximately 20 years ex ists between contraction of viral hepatitis and the onset of HCC. Practices of intravenous dr ug use, needle sharing, unsafe sex and unscreened blood transfusions during the 1960s, 1970s and early 80s are all thought to have contributed to the transmission of the HCV. Increased immigration from eastern Asian countries and other areas of high endemicity for HBV and HCV have contributed to the increased rates 7. The treatment options for HCC vary by the extent of disease, underlying liver function and the performance status of the patient. In Alberta, patients are staged and Transarterial Radioembolization for the for Hepatic Neoplasia Center for Health and Policy Studies, University of Calgary, October 2010 5 managed according to the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging system (see Appendix I). Patients with early stage disease can be ma naged using resection, liver transplantation or radiofrequency ablation (RFA). Unfortunatel y, only approximately 30% of patients are candidates for these curative intent therapie s. Patients with intermediate stage HCC may benefit from TACE and patients with advan ced stage HCC may benefit from sorafenib if they have preserved liver function. Unfortunately, approximately 30% of patients present with advanced liver failure (Child Pugh class C cirrhosis). If these patients are not liver transplant candidates they typically survive only between 3-6 months, regardless of the tumour characteristics, and as such are offered only palliative care 4. Based on the increasing incidence of HCC worldwide and in Canada, the poor prognosis of patients with intermediate and advanced stage HCC and the limited treatment options that exist, new technologies such as TA RE are receiving the attention of medical and health care providers. 2.2.2 Metastatic Colorectal Carcinoma Every year 850,000 people are diagnosed wi th colorectal cancer (CRC) and 500,000 die from the disease worldwide. CRC is the fourth most common cancer in Canada, with incidence rates only falling behind prostate, lung and breast cancer. In Canada, CRC is the second leading cause of cancer related deaths. It is estimated that in the year 2009, 22,000 Canadians were diagnosed with CRC and 9,10 0 deaths were attributable to the cancer. Alberta has the second lowest age standardized incidence and mortality rates of CRC in Canada, for both men and women; British Columbia has the lowest 10. Although the Transarterial Radioembolization for the for Hepatic Neoplasia Center for Health and Policy Studies, University of Calgary, October 2010 6 incidence and mortality rates of CRC have declined in recent years, the number of new cases is predicted to rise in coming years du e to the increasing population of seniors11. Colorectal cancer starts as benign polyps and, if left undiagnosed, progresses to cancerous tumours within any part of the large intestine. Screening techniques for detection of polyps include: examining stool for occu lt blood, sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy. The Forzani/MacPhail colon cancer screening center in Calgary has offered screening for average and high risk individuals since 2008. Albert a Health Services recommends screening for everyone over the age of 50. Cancer of the gastrointestinal tract commonly metastasizes to the liver as a result of portal vein drainage of the gut 12. In fact, approximately 50-60% of CRC patients will develop liver metastases at some point13. Secondary hepatic neoplasia resulting from CRC is commonly referred to as colorectal cancer with liver metastases (CRCLM). CRCLM patients, similar to HCC patients, usually present at tumour stages that are too advanced for surgical resection. It has been estimated that only 15% of cases will be candidates for surgical resection. As such, CRCLM is the primary cause of death in patients initially diagnosed with CRC. For the remaining patients, treatment options are usually palliative with regional or systemic chemotherapy being the standard of ca re. Management of patients with metastatic CRC (mCRC) in Alberta is according to the Alberta Health Services Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Clinical Practice Guidelines 14. Generally the guidelines acknowledge that mCRC usually represents an incurable situation, where best supportive care should be offered to patients in the hopes of maintaining or improving quality of life or prolonging life, if possible. Patients with low (i.e. good) Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scores Transarterial for Hepatic Neoplasia Center for Health and Policy Studies, University of Calgary, October 2010 7 - assess how the disease affects the daily living abilities of the patient - (i.e. 0, 1 or 2) are offered palliative chemotherapy. A variety of different chemotherapy regimens are available with the regimen selected dependent on an assessment of the individual patient's goals, physical status and other life circumstances. 2.2.3 Metastatic Neuroendocrine Tumours Neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) are ra re neoplasms that present a comple x challenge to diagnosis and treatment. NETs are slow growing tumours of the neuroendocrine system and are commonly found in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Metastases to the liver, from NETs (mNET) in the forgut, midgut and hindgut may occur and, as with mCRC, the liver may be the only additional site involved. Care for patients with liver metastasis from spread of GI NETs, is si milar to that of patients with either HCC or CRCLM, with resection, ablation, TACE, sys temic or regional chemotherapy all being possible treatment options. Again, most patients with liver metastases from NETs are not candidates for curative therapies and as such ar e offered palliative care. For this reason, there is some evidence to suggest that TARE may be a treatment option for these types of tumour metastases as well 15. 2.2.4 Other Secondary Liver Tumours The liver is the second most common site for meta static spread, after the lymph nodes. Primary sites most commonly metastasizing to the liver are the eye (77.8%), pancreas (75.1%), breast (60.6%), rectum (56.8%), and stomach (48.9%) 16. Although there is the potential for any primary cancer to Transarterial Radioembolization for the for Hepatic Neoplasia Center for Health and Policy Studies, University of Calgary, October 2010 8 metastasize to the liver, the extent to which the primary site metastasizes to other locations is one of the main determinants for treatment with TARE. Specifically, while some primary tumours seem to selectively metastasize to the liver (i.e. CRC) others spread without this specificity (i.e. lung). TARE is typically not considered a treatment option for liver metastases with extensive extra-hepatic spread as these patients are at an extremely advanced stage of disease. 3. Methodology 3.1. Literature 3.1.1 Literature Search We searched the following electronic databases: MEDLINE (OVID), PubMED, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (OVID), Cochrane CENTRAL Register of Controlled Trials (OVID), EMBASE (OVID) , NHS Economic Evaluations Database (OVID), Health Technology Assessment Database - University of York (OVID), Database of Reviews of Effects (OVID), and EconLit (EBSCO). These databases were searched for clinical trials, cohort studies systematic reviews/meta-analyses, health technology assessments (HTAs) and economic reports pu blished between 1950 and February 2010. Observational studies, case reports, animal an d in vitro studies, duplicate publications, preliminary reports of data later presented in fu ll, dose-finding studies, and studies that did not follow patients for more than three months and with greater than 20% loss to follow-up were excluded. The Search Strategy is presented in Appendix II. We also searched both manufacturers' websites, the reference lists of studies included in our review, the national registry of current and ongoing clinical trials as well as any unpublished material that the Transarterial Radioembolization for the for Hepatic Neoplasia Center for Health and Policy Studies, University of Calgary, October 2010 9 EAG thought should be included. A complete list of grey literature sources is presented in Appendix III. The Expert Advisory Group (EAG) provided expert opinion on the search strategy for this review. 3.1.2 Selection of Literature The titles and abstracts yielded by our sear ch of the literature were reviewed by two independent reviewers (LS, LH). Decisions re garding full text papers to review were bas ed on the explicit inclusion/exclusion criteria detailed below. Disagreements were resolved through discussion and consensus. Papers were selected for full text review if they were identified as an RCT, cohort study, HTA, systematic review, meta-analysis or economic report. Additionally, they had to focus on patien ts who received TARE for the treatment of primary or secondary hepatic neoplasia, were fo llowed for at least three months after the start of the intervention and reported on at leas t one of the following: survival, radiological response, toxicities, tumour markers, adverse events or quality of life measurements. It was decided that cancer types included in the review should be limited to HCC, CRCLM and mNET of the liver. Because such a small number of non HCC, CRCLM and mNET patients have received TARE, addressing th e appropriateness of use in these patient populations was not feasible. The EAG was consulted and agreed. After the full text review, it was decided that cohort studies published before 1990 and that did not present data separately for each included cancer type (i.e. HCC, CRCLM or mNET) would be excluded. Also, only retrospective cohort studies with a significant number of patients were included. These addi tional exclusion criteria (i.e. studies published prior to 1990 and retrospective cohort studies) were added to narrow the included studies to Transarterial Radioembolization for the for Hepatic Neoplasia Center for Health and Policy Studies, University of Calgary, October 2010 10 a feasible number, to focus on the most current and relevant information on the therapy and to focus on the cancer types included in the report. All RCTs included patients with CRCLM and were judged to be of high quality according to CONSORT statement checklist - (See Appendix IV). Quality assessments were not performed for cohort studies. 3.1.3 Results of Literature Search A total of 373 titles and abstracts of potential RCTs, cohort studies, meta-analyses, systematic reviews, HTAs and economic reports were retrieved. 116 articles were selected for full text review. In addition, we found four HTA reports. The full Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH) 17, Medical Services Advisory Committee (MSAC)18, National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE)19 and California Technology Assessment Forums (CTAF)20 reports are available on the internet. The completeness of the RCT search was confirmed by comparison with the RCTs identified from the most recent HTA. Another phase III RCT was submitted by a member of the EAG who thought it should be included, as it was published in August of 2010 it was not originally included in the report. The final results of the literature review, and included in this report, are 43 studies. Four published studies describing three original RCTs, 33 cohort studies, one meta-analysis, two systematic re views and four HTA reports comprised the 43 included studies. For HCC, no RCTs were identified, 18 cohort studies, one HTA and one meta-analysis were included. For mCRC, 3 RCTs, 13 cohort studies, 3 HTAs, one systematic review and one meta-analysis were included. Lastly, for mNET one systematic review and two cohort studies were included. For a Quorum diagram of the full literature search results see Appendix V and for details of the included studies see Appendix VI. Transarterial Radioembolization for for Hepatic Neoplasia Center for Health and Policy Studies, University of Calgary, October 2010 11 For the three RCTs identified, the usual care comparator (i.e. control arm) was either systemic chemotherapy or regional chemothera py (hepatic arterial chemotherapy (HAC)). The intervention for the was systemic chemotherapy + TARE or HAC + TARE. Thus, the RCTs evaluated the addition of TARE to a standard chemotherapy regimen. In total, papers included for HCC reported on 1103 patients, with mean ages between approximately 52 and 65 years, published between 1994 and 2010 and reported on outcomes such as survival, radiological response, time to disease progression (TTDP), alfa-fetoprotein (AFP), serious adverse events (SAE), toxicities and health related quality-of-life (HRQL). In most, TARE was the only treatment, although in some treatment with TARE or TACE occurred. For CRCLM papers, a total of 840 patients were reported on, with mean ages between 55 and 65 years, published between 1992 and 2009. Outcomes addressed are the same as with HCC patients, with the excepti on that HQRL and AFP were not reported and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) was. Comparato rs for CRCLM patients included systemic or regional chemotherapy. The two included mNET studies, reported on a total of 76 patients, mean ages reported were 58 and 61 years and both were published in 2008. Outcomes reported included survival, radiol ogical response and hormone levels. No comparators were examined. 3.1.4 Data Extraction Data extraction was performed by two independent reviewers (LS, LH). Data extraction was performed using a form developed by our team (see Appendix VII). Information was extracted in three different categories: Study Design, Treatment Details and Outcome Measures. The following information was extracted: Study Design - type (i.e. Transarterial Radioembolization for for Hepatic Neoplasia Center for Health and Policy Studies, University of Calgary, October 2010 12 RCT, cohort study, meta-analysis/systematic review, HTA), sample selection (i.e. random, consecutive, other), type of microsphere (i.e. TheraSpheres or SIR-Sphere), type of cancer staging (i.e . BCLC, Child-Pugh, Okud a etc.), sample size (n), median age, mean age, gender of sample, loss to sample (i.e number of participants not available for follow-up) and quality of life; Treatment Details - any relevant treatment details such as, number of treatments, concomitant therapy, dosage, treatment/patient accrual dates etc.; Outcome Measures - radiological response data (i.e. CT, MRI, PET), tumour size, tumour volume, tumour marker (i.e. CEA, AFP etc., TTDP, mortality, median survival, toxicities and SAEs). 3.2. Social Systems and Demogr aphics (S) Approach to Analys is This section included information intended to address the profiles of illness and patterns of care, as well as to identify potenti al inequities in health status or care across population groups. Also included in this section were data used to estimate the need for TARE in Alberta. Information from published articles retrie ved through our literature search, medical specialty books and clinical experts that were consulted for this report was included in this section. To estimate the poten tial demand for TARE in Alberta, we used both published incidence and prevalence rates, for both Canada and Alberta, along with Alberta specific diagnosis data for the conditions indicated for TARE. This data, along with the ICD-9 and ICD-10 diagnostic codes, are presented in Tables 1 and 2. Transarterial Radioembolization for the for Hepatic Neoplasia Center for Health and Policy Studies, University of Calgary, October 2010 13 3.3. Technology Effects and Effectiveness (T) Approach to Analysis The RCTs evaluating the safety and effectiveness of TARE were analyzed qualitatively. There were not sufficient RCTs or data to perform any quantitative analyses. The clinical outcomes of interest identifi ed throughout the literature were median survival, survival rates, radiological response, tumour marker response, SAE and quality of life measures. Unfortunately, collection of data varied from study to study. Specifically, standardized criteria are seldom reported and the type of data reported between studies varied. The majority of cohort studies were un controlled. Cohort studies were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively. A meta-analysis was performed using published data on the outcomes of interest. Data was available for analysis on median survival time, summary survival rates and summary radiological response rate. There were insuffi cient data for meta- analyses of the other outcome measures; ho wever we addressed them qualitatively where appropriate. With respect to the meta-analyse s performed for survival and radiological response, we developed a list of factors that could account for heterogeneity if it were observed. These factors included: cancer type (i.e. HCC, CRCLM or mNET), sphere type (i.e. TheraSpheres or SIR-Spheres), presence of extrahepatic disease or portal vein thrombosis and response criteria used (i.e. WHO or RECIST). Only the variables of cancer type and response criteria could be tested in a meta-regression analysis due to inconsistencies in reporting of the other factors. There were not enough data for an analysis on mNET patients for any of the outcome measures, but a qualitative summary of the use of TARE in Transarterial Radioembolization for for Hepatic Neoplasia Center for Health and Policy Studies, University of Calgary, October 2010 14 these patients is included at the end of th e section. The meta-analysis and meta-regression were performed using the meta and metareg packages, respectively, in STATA version 9.0. For the median survival analysis, the median survival times were retrieved from studies which reported them and estimated from the Kaplan-Meier curves for those that did not report the median but presented the Kaplan -Meier curve. The median times were plotted for each author and by type of cancer, but it was not possible to calculate summary estimates of the median survival time as patient specifi c data were not reported. The median of the median survival times (i.e the median survival time of all the included survival times) was calculated both overall (both HCC and CRCLM) an d by cancer type. In total, 15 studies had data available for analysis 21-35. Of the included studies, nine were HCC papers21, 23, 24, 27-29, 32, 33, 35 and six were CRCLM papers22, 25, 26, 30, 31, 34. The summary survival rates (i.e. the mean survival rate of all patients included in each study) at six, 12 and 24 months were estimated from the Kaplan-Meier curves where available. In each case the 95% confidence intervals for the survival rate were estimated using binomial confidence intervals which do not take into account censored observations (i.e. an incomplete observation; in this case mainly due to patients surviving past the study completion date). This will result in an undere stimation of the length of the confidence interval when censoring was present. The number of censored observations was very small in most studies, but increased as time increa sed. Therefore the confidence intervals for 24 months are those which will be underestimated the most. The summary survival rates were estimated using the inverse variance method and the heterogeneity across studies examined. Summary estimates were presented by cancer type. A total of 15 studies were included in the Transarterial Radioembolization for the for Hepatic Neoplasia Center for Health and Policy Studies, University of Calgary, October 2010 15 survival rate analysis21-29, 31-36; ten including patients with HCC21, 23, 24, 27-29, 32, 33, 35, 36 and five including patients with CRCLM22, 25, 26, 31, 34. A meta-analysis of summary radiological re sponse rates was also conducted. This was done by combining the proportions of complete and partial responses and the 95% confidence intervals using the inverse variance method and the heterogeneity examined. The summary estimates were also calculated for each cancer type and each response criteria (i.e. WHO or RECIST) separately and the heterogeneity within each was examined. WHO and RECIST criteria were selected as the two most commonly reported response criteria (see Table 3 for response criteria). In total ten studies were included in the analysis 22, 23, 26, 27, 31, 33, 34, 37-39; three including HCC patients23, 27, 33 and seven including CRCLM patients22, 26, 31, 34, 37- 39. 3.4. Economic (E) Approach to Analysis This report undertakes a cost-effectiveness analysis. Effectiveness is measured in terms of life-years gained, while costs are brok en into pre-treatment, treatment, and post- treatment, and then aggregated, for each of the comparators. For HCC, these comparators were obtained from the HCC provincial clinical guidelines41 and include: 1) TACE, using regular chemotherapy and using DC beads; 2) TARE; 3) Sorafenib. TACE is typically used in intermediate HCC patients (i.e. BCLC stage B), while sorafenib is used in advanced HCC patients (i.e . BCLC stage C). The analysis will look at Transarterial for the for Hepatic Neoplasia Center for Health and Policy Studies, University of Calgary, October 2010 16 using TARE versus TACE for intermediate patients and TARE versus sorafenib for advanced patients. An analysis for CRCLM was also performe d. The selected comparators include: 1) TARE; 2) Palliative treatment (in which pa in-relieving medication is the only treatment given) These comparators were selected after th e Technology and Effectiveness component revealed that other standards of care for CRCLM were superior to TARE in the outcome measures addressed therefore not an appropria te comparison for this patient population (i.e. TARE would not be administered as a first-line therapy). For mNET, an economic analysis could not be completed due to a number of factors. These factors included, but were not limited to, the level and quantity of evidence available for this population, the lack of appr opriate comparators for this population and the lack of Alberta specific clinical guidelines for this population. The analysis includes costs from the health care perspective - societal costs, such as lost caregiver salaries or drugs paid out-of-pocket or via private insurance plans, are not included because data for these measures could not be obtained. Healthcare system costs include treatment costs paid by Alberta Health and Wellness, as well as associated physician and inpatient costs. Due to imprecision in esti mating costs, variation will be accounted for in all calculations. This is further detailed in section 6.2 and Table 7a and 7b. The specific model used to simulate the costs based on this uncertainty is a Markov model, in which there are specific chances of adverse events occurring. The timeframe for Transarterial Radioembolization for the for Hepatic Neoplasia Center for Health and Policy Studies, University of Calgary, October 2010 17 cost estimates assumed that the time between tr eatments (for those who receive more than one) is an identical three months for both TARE and TACE and that all patients receiving sorafenib would do so for 5.5 months while palliative therapy for CRCLM would be provided for six months. Resource requirements are given in Table 7a. Effectiveness measures are detailed in Table 7a. Cost measur es are detailed in Table 7b. The effectiveness measures do not consider (directly) patient quali ty-of-life, which is one intended benefit of the TARE treatment. All measures, included in the analysis were taken from previous literature, the meta-analyses performed in this report, experts consulted for this report and EAG members. Effectiveness measures included median survival times, serious adverse events and minor adverse events. Clinical path ways were identified through the literature and through consultation with experts in the field and the EAG. In the model, a cohort of 100 patients was drawn, with the chan ce of death or other adverse events occurring during each treatm ent. These are mentioned further in section 6.2.2. Costs were then aggregated and averag ed for the 100 patients. This was done 100 times in a Monte Carlo-style analysis, with a grand average reported as the overall cost in Table 8. This allowed for the results to be relatively uninfluenced by any extreme cost values. Incremental costs and effectiveness - the differences in costs and life years gained between TARE and a comparator treatment -- were then calculated with the differences in cost divided by the differences in effectiveness, this ratio yields a cost per life year gained value that informed the final results. Sensitivity analyses, including life expectancy differences and the elimination of treatment rela ted deaths (i.e. all patients fully complete Transarterial Radioembolization for the for Hepatic Neoplasia Center for Health and Policy Studies, University of Calgary, October 2010 18 their treatment) were also completed, and are not ed in section 6.2.4 and Table 9. An overall budget impact is given in section 6.2.4 and Table 10. 4. Social Systems and Demographics (S) 4.1. Patterns of Illness 4.1.1. Burden of Illness description of condition(s) Cancers of the liver may be conveniently divided into two major groups, primary cancer of the liver, also known as hepa tocellular carcinoma (HCC), and metastatic tumour to the liver, most often from colorectal cancer (CRC). The major risk factor for HCC is viral hepatitis, particularly HBV and HCV4. It is estimated that 1 in 12 persons worldwide is chronically infected with HBV or HCV. In endemic countries, HBV spread is vertical from mother to child with the tumour presenting decades later. HCV infection is most commonly diagnosed in the 3rd and 4th decades of life, with parenteral transmission from past blood products or intravenous drug use being the most common mode of infection. The acute infection with HCV is often asymptomatic and on ly after 20-30 years will patients typically present with signs and symptoms of chronic he patitis that has progressed to cirrhosis and HCC. Alcohol induced cirrhosis remains an important cause of cirrhosis and HCC in North America, however Canadian data suggests that increases in incidence of HCC is mainly attributable to hepatitis B and C infection, as alcoholic cirrhosis has declined in recent years 40. Based on Alberta Health and Wellness data, the incidence of HBC and HBV infection more than doubled from 2004-200 8, from a rate of 7.1 to 15.7 per 100,000 Albertans. Alcoholic cirrhosis has also increased in this time period, although not as significantly, from a rate of 11.7 to 14.8 pe r 100,000 Albertans. Insulin resistance has also Transarterial for Hepatic Neoplasia Center for Health and Policy Studies, University of Calgary, October 2010 19 been linked to HCC, and with rates of obesi ty and diabetes increasing rapidly in North America, we may expect further increases in HCC due to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Lang and associates estimated the annual cost of HCC in the United States to be $454.9 million dollars with per patient costs of $33,000 (1999 dollars)41. Healthcare costs and lost productivity accounted for 89.2% and 10.8 % total costs respectively. Costs associated with localized HCC accounted for the highest proportion (44.5%) of the total cost of illness, or 202.5 million. Regional, distant, an d unstaged HCC accounted for 31.0%, 13.9% and 10.6% of total costs, respectively41. Colorectal cancer starts as benign polyps which, if not removed, can progress to cancerous tumours within any part of the large intestine. Due to venous drainage of the gut into the portal vein, spread of the cancer to the liver is a likely occurrence. CRC is common and there is a large economic toll on society from health care costs associated with care; in fact, costs of treatment continue to rise. Rise s in health care costs are primarily driven by newer regimens of chemotherapy and biologics th at have been accepted as standard of care. These new regimens, while expensive, have prov en to be significantly more effective, with survival benefits of 8 - 10 months, over the older less expensive regimens 42. Individuals also have to bear the burden of this cancer throug h years of life lost, disability, pain, emotional impact on family members, and loss of family income. Neuroendocrine tumours typically are the re sult of either a carcinoid tumour or an islet cell neoplasm. Most commonly NETs are foun d in the GI tract. The GI tract contains as many as 15 endocrine cell types, all of which may be a potential source for the development of endocrine tumours. It is es timated that approximately 10- 20% of NETs Transarterial for Hepatic Neoplasia Center for Health and Policy Studies, University of Calgary, October 2010 20 originating in the GI tract will metastasize to the liver 43. Both carcinoid and islet cell tumour types have the possibility to metastasize to the liver, carcinoid tumours of the liver tend to result in the excessive production of serotonin, resulting in carcinoid syndrome. Carcinoid syndrome is characterized by flushing of th e skin, diarrhea and breathing difficulties. Additionally, approximately 20% of patients with carcinoid syndrome present with carcinoid heart disease at diagnosis, most commonly involving the tricuspid valve 44. Carcinoid tumours have a relatively indolent growth pattern and a capacity for hormone secretion, which results in bizarre yet typical clinical syndromes45. Because of this relatively predictable progression and presentation, there are many tr eatment options available most of which are also treatment options for HCC or CRCLM patients. 4.1.2. Population Dynamics 4.1.2.1 Primary cancer of the liver Cancer of the liver is one of only a few can cers known to be increasing in Alberta. The major risk factors for HCC are HBV and HCV infection. Over 2 billio n people will have serological evidence of hepatitis and 400 million will become chronic carriers. Worldwide between 0.5 and 1.2 million individu als succumb to either cirrhosis or HCC annually46. The number of newly diagnosed patients with HCC is paralleled by the number of deaths attributed to HCC. Other risk facto rs include hereditary hemochromatosis, almost any kind of cirrhosis and diabetes mellitus bu t these are over shadowed in importance by viral hepatitis. In the Far East, HBV infection may become chronic in children and HCC can develop in a non-cirrhotic liver, although patients with cirrhosis are at increased risk for the Transarterial Radioembolization for for Hepatic Neoplasia Center for Health and Policy Studies, University of Calgary, October 2010 21 malignancy. Studies have shown that prevention of neonatal HBV infection will prevent development of cirrhosis and HCC. A vaccine is now available for the prevention of HBV infection. The American Association fo r the Study of Liver Disease (AASLD)47 recommends screening certain high risk groups and vaccinating those who are not already immune or infected. This includes (in addition to pregnant women), persons born in hyperendemic areas, men having sex with men, intravenous drug users, patients on dialysis, HIV infected patients, healthcare workers, and family and household contacts of HBV infected persons. In Alberta routine vaccination is offered to all Grade 5 students. Those falling into high risk groups are also offered vaccination. While Canadian provinces have done a good job of vaccinating their citizens, the future does not look as positive. It has been estimated that by the year 2040 one third of the Canadi an population will be immigrants, many coming from endemic areas of the world. High in cidence areas include Sub-Saharan Africa, the People's Republic of China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Over 40% of all cases of HCC are diagnosed in the People's Republic of China. The availability of less expensive vaccines may eventually reduce the pool of infected individuals and hence the burden of HCC. HCV infection accounts for one third of HCC cases annually. Many patients have no recollection of contracting HCV and only presen t with end stage liver disease 20-30 years after the fact. The acute phase is often asymptomatic, and by the time the patient is aware of the symptoms, they may have developed cirrhosis and HCC. Ultimately 20-56% of patients with chronic HCV infection will develop HCC. There is no vaccine available against HCV. Transarterial for Hepatic Neoplasia Center for Health and Policy Studies, University of Calgary, October 2010 22 Men are far more likely to develop HCC. This disparity is more pronounced in high incidence regions. Although not fully understood , differences in sex distribution are thought to be due to variations in hepatitis virus carri er states, exposure to environmental toxins, and the trophic effect of androgens48. Older patients, with long stan ding liver disease, are most likely to develop HCC. A population based study in the US identified racial and ethnic variations in the incidence of HCC. The incidence of HCC was highest among Asians, nearly double that of Hispanics and four times higher than Caucasians 49. Cirrhosis and HCC often occur in vulnerable populations within our society, as viral hepatitis is often seen in immigrants or intravenous drug users. In terms of education level of infected individuals, evidence suggests that having less than 12 years of education is associated with an increased risk of infection 50. Language barriers, mental health and addiction issues (intravenous drug users and alcoholics) and poorer socioeconomic st atus are often barriers to treating patients with viral hepatitis, cirrhosis and HCC. The number of patients with end stage liver disease is growing in Alberta. Screening for HCC is recommended for patients with cirrhosis51. The combination of ultrasound of the liver with or without monitoring of the serum marker AFP is recommended for screening for HCC in the hope of detecting tumours when they are small and amenable to curative therapy. There has been an increasing utiliz ation of liver resection and liver transplantation in Alberta in the past several years (See A ppendix VIII). Liver resections for both primary liver cancer and colorectal carcinoma metastasis have increased steadily in the Calgary Health Region between 1991 and 2004 52. The percentage of adult liver transplants performed at the University of Alberta Hospital in Edmonton increased from an average of 7.5% between Transarterial Radioembolization for for Hepatic Neoplasia Center for Health and Policy Studies, University of Calgary, October 2010 23 1990-1999 to an average of 19.9% between 2000-2009 ( p<0.001). There has also been an increase in the number of new HCC patients requiring TACE at the Foothills Medical Centre in Calgary with an average of 0.61 new TACE patients per month from 2003-2005 compared to 1.11 new patients per month from 2006-2008. Using Alberta Health and Wellness data it is clear to see this pattern of increasing incidence of HCC in Alberta. From 2004 to 2008 the incidence of HCC has increa sed from approximatel y 11 to 15 per 100,000 Albertans (see Tables 2c and 2d). 4.1.2.2 Secondary cancer of the liver Colorectal cancer is the most common gastrointestinal malignancy and the second most common cause of cancer death in Alberta. It is estimated that the lifetime risk of an individual developing colorectal cancer is abou t 1 in 14 men and 1 in 17 women in Alberta. In recent years there have been 560 deaths annually and more than 1,400 new cases each year in Alberta53. In about 50-60% of CRC cases the cancer spreads to the liver and results in CRCLM. While resection surgery can be curative, only 20% of patients will be surgical candidates. Most patients with CRCLM are not candidates for surgery because of tumour size, location, multifocal nature or inadequate hepatic capacity. With improved commitment to screening programs for CRC incidence rates have declined in the past 15 years. Although incidence rates of CRC have fallen, over 90% of CRC cases are diagnosed in patients over th e age of 50 years. With the prevalence of CRC higher in elderly patients, it is estimated that incidence rates will rise in the future alongside the aging population. In Alberta the inciden ce of CRC in 2008 was approximately 36 per 100, 000 Albertans (See Table 2c and 2d). Transarterial for Hepatic Neoplasia Center for Health and Policy Studies, University of Calgary, October 2010 24 Several risk factors exist for the development of CRC. Approximately 25% of CRC cases can be attributed to family history; as such, patients with a family history of CRC should be screened regularly. Inflammatory bowel disease is also associated with a higher risk of developing CRC. Modifiable risk factors in clude smoking, alcohol use, diet, and activity levels. Information on the burden of illness for CRCLM was limited and gaps existed. It was difficult to address issues such as psycho-soci al, economic and physical activity and lifestyle effects of CRCLM. However, as most case s of CRCLM are not curable, and involve chemotherapy as treatment, the burden of illness is very high. NETs can, and do, metastasize to the liver as a result of portal venous drainage of the gut, a common primary site for NETs. The term carcinoid syndrome or carcinoid tumours of the liver refer to hepatic metastases that are a result of mNET. NETs of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract are rare. They vary wi th respect to location and each are associated with distinct clinical settings. Carcinoid tumours, resulting from the spread of GI NETs, are also rare and account for less than 1% of all malignant disorders in the United States. It is estimated that mNET account for 10% of all metastatic liver lesions 54. The rate of carcinoid tumours has increased in the US from 1.09 ca ses per 100,000 in 1973, to 5.25 cases per 100,000 in 200455. Alberta incidence rates for 2004 were approximately 2 per 100, 000, slightly below the US rate. This rate has in creased slightly in the province with 2008 incidence rates being 2.64 per 100, 000 (See Table 2c and 2d). The median age at diagnosis is 64 years and the median survival for patien ts with grade 3 or 4 tumours is 10 months 44. Transarterial Radioembolization for for Hepatic Neoplasia Center for Health and Policy Studies, University of Calgary, October 2010 25 Family history of cancer and a long-term history of diabetes mellitus are risk factors for developing NETs43. Information on the burden of illness for mNE T patients was limited and addressing issues such as psycho-social, economic, physica l activity and lifestyle effects of mNET was difficult. However, as most mNET patients are in advanced stages of disease the burden of illness is very high. 4.2. Patterns of Care 4.2.1. History 4.2.2.1 Primary cancer of the liver Therapy with curative intent can only be offered to approximately 30% of patients presenting with HCC51. Resection is usually offered to patients without cirrhosis, as long as there is no evidence of portal vein involvem ent or extra-hepatic spread. Liver failure following resection is a major concern in cirrhot ic patients, and for the best results surgery should be restricted to patients with Child Pugh class A cirrhosis, who have a normal bilirubin and no evidence of portal hy pertension (no varices, splenomegaly or thrombocytopenia)51. In carefully selected patients, surgical resection can result in 5 year survival of approximately 70%56. However, approximately 70% of patients will have a recurrence of HCC within 4 years of surgical resection56. Initial experience with liver transplantation was poor with high recurrence rates when liver transplantation was employed as a salvage procedure for patients with large tumours who were not candidates for surgical resection. The landmark study of Mazzaferro, et al. demonstrated that carefully selected HCC patients with small tumours could do as well as other liver transplant recipients Transarterial Radioembolization for the for Hepatic Neoplasia Center for Health and Policy Studies, University of Calgary, October 2010 26 without HCC57. Survival rates in excess of 70% at 5 years with recurrence rates of <20% are expected if the Milan criteria (1 tumour < 5c m or 3 tumours each <3 cm) are used to select patients for liver trnasplantation58. Patients who are treated with resection or liver transplantation often require several months to convalesce after the operation. Patients with HCC who are awaiting a liver transplant are of ten too ill to continue working and often do not return to work until at least 6-12 months after transplant. With median waiting times for liver transplantation being more than one year, a patient can be on long-term disability for a considerable period of time while they await and recover from liver transplantation surgery. Percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA ) is an increasingly common technique used to treat patients with small tumours (<5 cm) where by the tumour is destroyed using thermal energy administered by a probe introduced under ultrasound guidance. RFA is a day procedure and is better tolerated then surgery. HCC 2cm can be successfully ablated in 97% of subjects and survival rates comparable to surgical resection have been reported for RFA of very early stage HCC 59. However, recurrence rates are higher for RFA compared to surgery, especially if tumours are larger than 3 cm. Recent meta-analysis have shown that RFA is superior to percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI) in ablating small tumours60, but the later technique may still be employed if the HCC is near the liver capsule or blood vessels (where heat sink can occur with RFA). For patients who are not candidates for resection, ablation or transplantation, treatment options currently employed include TACE, TARE and sorafenib. The proper selection of therapy depends on a variety of tumour and patient factors. TACE has been shown in meta-analysis to improve survival in patients with intermediate stage HCC (large or Transarterial Radioembolization for for Hepatic Neoplasia Center for Health and Policy Studies, University of Calgary, October 2010 27 multifocal HCC with no extrahepatic spread)61. There is no standard technique for performing TACE, and although generally we ll tolerated TACE can result in 2-3% peri- procedural mortality related to complications of the procedure62. TACE is best avoided in patients with portal vein thrombosis as there is an increased risk of liver failure due to ischemia. TACE performed with doxorubicin emitting beads (DC TACE) may be better tolerated and result in improved outcomes in a subgroup of patients (eg. Child Pugh class B cirrhosis or ECOG PS =1) 63. For patients with advanced HCC (malignant portal vein involvement or extrahepatic spread) sorafenib has been shown to result in a small but significant increase in life expectancy compared to placebo (10.7 vs. 7.9 months median survival) 64. Sorafenib therapy is generally well tole rated, but frequently causes hypertension, diarrhea and hand-foot reactions and it costs ~$5400 per month. Technological advancements have allowed the delivery of tumouricidal doses of radiation to the liver while sparing normal liver tissues, although this technique is not widely available in Alberta. TARE was developed as a new technique with the potential to deliver aggressive local radiation effects on the tumour with fewer systemic side-effects. Preliminary evidence would suggest that both TACE and TARE may also play a role in bridging patients to resection, ablation or transplantation. 4.1.2.2 Secondary cancer of the liver Metastatic Colorectal Carcinoma The history of care for mCRC patients was relatively stable until the late 1990 s and early 2000s. With 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) introd uced in 1957 and development of the biomodulator leucovorin (LV), the 5-FU/LV regimen of chemotherapy was for Hepatic Neoplasia Center for Health and Policy Studies, University of Calgary, October 2010 28 standard of care until very recently65. Median survival time for patients receiving 5-FU/LV was 12 months. The development of both irinotecan and oxaliplatin, which in clinical trials have shown to extend survival on average 8 months over the 5-FU/LV regimen, have shifted the standard of care to newer regime ns that include one or both of these agents42. These agents are expensive, and account for the majority of increased treatment costs seen in mCRC. Regimens consistently been shown to impr ove survival, albeit with increased toxicity. Different iterations of the FOLFOX regimen exis t, with the method and time frame of drug delivery and the dose of oxaliplatin varying, numbers are used to differentiate the regimens with FOLOFX6 being the most current. In a pivotal randomized phase III study by Tournigand et al. (2004) 66, patients either received FOLFIR I or FOLFOX6 regimens as first line therapy and then crossed over to the other arm, to receive second line therapy with the other chemotherapy regimen, once unacceptable toxicity or disease progression was observed. Hence, patients received both FOLFIRI and FOLFOX6 regimens. Overall survival was 21.5 months for the patients who received FOLFIRI first and 20.6 months for patients receiving FOLFOX6 first. This stud y was the first to demonstrate an overall survival in excess of 20 months. It is important to note that in this study 84% of patients had liver metastases. Subsequent studies demonstra ted that the greatest survival benefits are observed when patients are exposed to all thr ee chemotherapy agents currently considered for standard of care (i.e. FU/LV, oxaliplatin and irinotecan) 65. In general, toxicities and SAE are higher with these new regimens than with 5-FU/LV, but the survival benefit seems to outweigh the potential risks of therapy. A dditionally, the safety profiles of FOLFIRI and Transarterial for Hepatic Neoplasia Center for Health and Policy Studies, University of Calgary, October 2010 29 FOLFOX differ with FOLFIRI having sign ificantly nausea/vomiting, alopecia) FOLFOX 4 toxicities (i.e. neutropenia and neurosensory)65. Choice on which regimen to use is governed by patient and physician preference. Newer biol ogic agents have also been shown to increase survival times when combined with chemotherapy regimens. Bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody, when combined with chemotherapy regimens has been shown to increase median survival times by approximately three to four months, when added to FOLFIRI/FOLFOX regimens it is approximated that a median survival time of 23 months could be reached 67. Metastatic Neuroendocrine Tumours The frequency and severity of hepatic metastases from mNET and the associated hormone production and protracted clinical co urse make a large number of treatment options possible45. As with HCC, surgical resection or transplantation are the treatments of choice for eligible patients. Typically, only 10% of patients will be candidates for surgical resection due to the extent of disease. Unfort unately, even for those who are candidates, frequent recurrence of disease after resection o ccurs and is evidence of the persistent nature of these tumours45. For patients not candidates for sur gery, RFA, transarterial embolization (TAE), TACE and systemic chemotherapy ar e all possible treatment options. Treatment with any of these therapies is based on the extent of disease progression, and like with HCC and CRCLM, patients that have large tumours (>3cm) and poor underlying liver function face a poor prognosis. If TACE or TAE are sel ected they are performed according to the same protocol used for HCC. Transarterial Radioembolization for for Hepatic Neoplasia Center for Health and Policy Studies, University of Calgary, October 2010 30 4.2.2. Procedures Overview and Trends 4.2.2.1. Standard Care HCC is usually diagnosed in cirrhotic individuals as a suspicious nodule on ultrasound. Dynamic contrast imaging with CT, MRI or contrast enhanced ultrasound (along with AFP) is used to establish the diagnosis. Liver biopsy is rarely required to make the diagnosis. These tests are also used to determine th e extent of disease in the liver and if there is extra-hepatic dissemination. A standard batter y of tests are done to measure the patient's liver and renal function. In Alberta, the standard staging criteria followed is the BCLC staging criteria (see Appendix I). A guidelin e for the treatment of HCC has been developed for Alberta Health Services by the Provincial Gastrointestinal Tumour Team 68. A multidisciplinary team should decide on res ectability, transplantation or RFA. Non- resectable, intermediate stage, patients withou t extra-hepatic disease and no main portal vein thrombosis are potential candidates for treatment with TACE. The typical BCLC intermediate stage patient, that would be a candidate for TACE, should have good underlying liver function (Child-Pugh A or B) and performance status (ECOG = 0 or 1). The tumour characteristics for this stage woul d include multinodular disease, absence of extra-hepatic metastases, patency of the portal vein and adequate liver and kidney function. The goal of therapy is to maintain or to impr ove the patient's quality of life, and to prolong life if possible. TACE, like TARE, relies on the fact that most of the blood supply to the tumour is preferentially derived from the hepatic artery. It involves the placement of an intravascular catheter into the hepatic artery, using a femoral approach, then injecting chemotherapeutics for Hepatic Neoplasia Center for Health and Policy Studies, University of Calgary, October 2010 31 and embolic agents, which occlude the relevant branches of the hepatic artery. TACE targets tumours in two fashions. There is an ischemic effect on the tumour, which results from the embolization of feeding arteries, and there is a chemotherapeutic effect from the drug regimen. There is no consensus on how to perform TACE or on which chemotherapy agent is best 62. If doxorubicin is considered, assessment of left ventricular ejection function by a multi gated acquisition scan (MUGA) or cardiac ultrasound is suggested prior to the procedure. TACE is performed as an inpatient procedure with a median hospital stay of 4 days (IQR 3-5 days, range 2-25 days) at the Foot hills Medical Centre in Calgary. The length of inpatient stay is dependant on extent of pos t-embolization syndrome and side effects of chemotherapy. Sorafenib is the standard of care for patien ts with advanced HCC. Sorafenib is an of multiple cell surfa ce tyrosine kinases. In two placebo controlled trials involving over 800 patients demonstr ated an increased overall survival of 2-3 months64, 69. The Provincial Gastrointestinal Tumour Team felt that the role of TARE was yet to be determined and it was not included in the clinical practice guidelines. Some members of the team believed TARE however may have a ro le in patients who are not candidates for TACE (i.e. those with portal vein thrombosis (PVT) etc), in patients with very large tumours or in patients who have failed TACE. The Provincial Gastrointestinal Tumour Te am has also developed clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of mCRC in Alberta14. Metastatic colorectal cancer describes the situation where a cancer that originated with in the colon or rectum (and, often, regional Transarterial Radioembolization for for Hepatic Neoplasia Center for Health and Policy Studies, University of Calgary, October 2010 32 lymph nodes) has spread to other organs (typica lly, the liver and/or lungs). \"Generally, this represents an incurable situation for which palliative options (e.g. best supportive care, palliative chemotherapy) may be considered\"14. \"In the situation where the liver represents the major site of spread (CRCLM), and resecti on of metastases would be facilitated by a reduction in the size of the liver metastasis, pati ents should be treated with chemotherapy to optimal resectability rather than to maximal response or progression\"14. \"Only a limited number of chemotherapy cycles should be delivered to minimize the consequences to normal liver tissue and their resultant ad verse effects post-liver metastastectomy\" 14. The goals of therapy in this case include maximizi ng the patients' quality of life, and prolonging survival. As mentioned in section 4.1.2.2., standard palliative chemotherapy for treatment of CRCLM, has shifted from the exclusive 5 -FU/LV regimen to the newer FOLFIRI and FOLFOX6 regimens which include agent's iri notecan and oxaliplatin respectively. As outlined in the provincial clinical guidelines, sequences of therapy may include FOLFIRI followed by FOLFOX6, FOLFOX6 followed by FOLFIRI, FOLFOX6 followed by irinotecan or a combination of other drug ad ministrations and sequences. For the purposes of this report, standard of care for CRCL M patients will be restricted to FOLFIRI and FOLFOX6 regimens. The FOLFIRI regimen incl udes the concurrent administration of 180mg/m 2 of irinotecan over 90 minutes, with 200mg/m2 leucovorin over two hours followed by a bolus of 400mg/m2 of 5-Fluorouracil, all given intravenously. A continuous administration, over forty-six hours, of 2,400mg/m2 5-Fluorouracil is then given every two weeks intravenously14. If a patient progresses on FOLFIRI they are typically switched to a Transarterial Radioembolization for for Hepatic Neoplasia Center for Health and Policy Studies, University of Calgary, October 2010 33 FOLFOX6 regimen. The FOLFOX6 regimen is id entical to the FOLFIRI regimen with the exception that 100mg/m2 of oxaliplatin, over two hours, is administered instead of irinotecan14. Again, progression on this regimen usually constitutes a switch to FOLFIRI or irinotecan. It is noted in the guidelines, that due to oxaliplatins propensity to cause sensory neuropathy, the preferential sequence involves non-oxaliplatin regimens first (i.e. FOLFIRI) and then at disease progression a switch to an oxaliplatin containing regimen14. The sequence of FOLFIRI then FOLFOX6 or vice versa has be en shown to be equivalent in terms of survival benefit66. Provincial guidelines for the treatment of mNET have not been developed. As mentioned in 4.1.2.2. many treatment options exist for mNET with TAE and TACE being the standard care for non-resectable or abla table patients. For patients with rapidly advancing disease, or TACE failures, pallia tive chemotherapy is also offered. 4.2.2.2. TARE As mentioned previously, patients with non-resectable tumours that have limited extra-hepatic disease and good underlying liver function are potential candidates for treatmen t with TARE. Additionally, patients are evaluated for hepatic vascular anatomy, arteriovenous shunting, renal function and the general ability to tolerate the implanted radiation. The careful selection of patients is crucial for treatment safety, as adverse events are directly related to patient suitability. As many of the pre-treatment assessments require radiological evaluation, a radiological work up is highly recommended for all patients considered for treatment. The pre-treatment work up should include the following tests: hepatic for Hepatic Neoplasia Center for Health and Policy Studies, University of Calgary, October 2010 34 combined angiogram/CT scan possible embolization of the gastro-duodenal or other artery that might result in inadvertent delivery of microspheres MAA nuclear medicine SPECT scan to calculate a shunt fraction Tests of liver function If a patient is considered suitable after all pre-treatment evaluation, the procedure is scheduled and the microspheres are ordered. The specific dosing information and ordering process for obtaining the spheres is discussed in section 5.1.1. The TARE procedure is an outpatient procedure, albeit a long one. At Stanford Medical Center, the patient is told that the first angiographic/radiological workup w ill take 12 hours and the second (injection of microspheres) will consume 6 hours of time. This time is spread over a two day period. On the day of treatment, the patient is asked to arrive approximately two hours before the procedure is scheduled. Typically paperwork, medical history and allergy information is taken and an IV containing anti-nausea medication and a mild steroid to reduce possible side effects is administered. Routine lab work is performed prior to moving the patient to the appropriate angiography suite. The patient is also required to not eat or drink for a specified time the night before the procedure 70. In the angiography suite, the interventional radiologist inserts a catheter into the femoral artery and to the liver. An angiogram is taken to ensure the catheter is properly placed in the hepatic artery. Once the catheter is in place, the microsphere dose and delivery set is brought into the suite and attached to the catheter (see Appendix IX). The Transarterial Radioembolization for for Hepatic Neoplasia Center for Health and Policy Studies, University of Calgary, October 2010 35 microspheres are then infused under fluoroscopy. The infusion takes approximately 20 minutes. After infusion of the microspheres, the ca theter is removed and the artery sealed. The incision leaves a small mark in the groin area, which is cleaned and bandaged prior to relocation to the recovery room. The patient needs to lie flat for two to four hours while staff monitor and provide post-procedure instructions including radiation safety guidelines. If all goes according to plan, the patient is allowed to return home the same day. Many patients experience nausea or flu-like symptoms which generally subside in three to four days. 4.2.2.3 Comparators The two comparators for TARE with respect to standard of care for HCC patients in Alberta ar e TACE (intermediate stage pa tients), and sorafenib (advanced staged patients)68. TACE and TARE are very similar procedures and involve many of the same pre- treatment evaluations, equipment, techniques, staff and support. The main differences between TACE and TARE, with respect to procedure protocol, is the additional angiogram required for TARE, the actual infusion of microspheres and the precautions that must be taken to assure that the radioactive material is set up, handled and stored properly. Of importance is the fact that TACE is performed as an inpatient procedure, while TARE is typically an outpatient procedure. The two most appropriate comparators for TARE with respect to standard of care for CRCLM patients in Alberta are system ic and regional chemotherapy. A variety of Transarterial Radioembolization for the for Hepatic Neoplasia Center for Health and Policy Studies, University of Calgary, October 2010 36 chemotherapy drug regimens exist, the most commonly employed regimens being FOLFIRI and FOLFOX6. No comparator was selected for mNET, as no clinical guidelines exist for standard of care in Alberta, and due to the relatively diverse array of treatment options (including systemic and regional chemotherapy regimens). For patients that do not respond to chemotherapy, RFA, TACE and TARE have a ll been used as standard of care. These procedures are performed in a fashion cons istent with what is described for HCC. 4.2.3. Access to Technology in Alberta Access to TARE in Alberta is assumed to parallel access to T ACE, although currently TARE is only performed in Edmonton. As the protocol for these two procedures is almost identical, it is assumed that access to the technology would be similar as well. As such, it is anticipated that there will be no barrier s to care in terms of waitlists or utilization. The main consideration relevant to access is the fact that TARE will likely only be performed in Calgary or Edmonton requiring patien ts to travel to these centers if they live in other jurisdictions. 4.2.4. Demand for Technology Demand for TARE is anticipated to be limited, at least initially, to the cancer types identified in the report (i.e. HCC, CRCLM and mNET), although TARE has and is used in other cases of metastatic disease (i.e. breast, lung, eye etc). Using AHW data, in 2008, it was estimated that 1,422 patients had hepatic neoplasia in Alberta a (i.e. HCC, secondary malignant neoplasm of the liver, carcinoid syndrome). Another 1,266 Albertans were a Both physician and inpatient claims data were used for all prevalence, incidence and demand estimates and may result in an overestimation of actual patients as the anonymization proced ure could not be validated. Transarterial for Hepatic Neoplasia Center for Health and Policy Studies, University of Calgary, October 2010 37 diagnosed with CRC, many of which will develop CRCLM at some point. These numbers represent the largest demand possible for TARE (in 2008) and obviously are not realistic, given the curative therapies available for those patients in early disease stages. However, as TARE may play a role in maintaining patients on transplant waitlists or prior to resection or ablation, some patients in early stages may still contribute to the demand for the technology. The liver transplant program at the University of Alberta is one of the largest programs in Canada and transplants approximately 60-7 0 patients a year. Currently there are approximately 130 patients on the transplant list, with nearly 20% of patients dying yearly before an organ donor becomes available 71. The University of Alberta program is the western Canada center for transplants, thus patients from other provinces are represented on the waitlist. Presently demand for TARE is limited to patients whom are not candidates for curative therapies, TACE or have failed other first-line therapies, and is estimated not to exceed 30 patients per year province wide. It is important to note, as will be discussed in section 5.4.3, demand for TARE is higher in certain subgroups due to contraindications to alternative therapies (i.e. patients with PVT etc.). With respect to geographical considerati ons for demand of the technology, using Alberta data, it would appear that approximately 60% of patients, with one of the included diagnoses, reside in an urban location (i.e. Ca lgary, Edmonton, Lethbr idge, Medicine Hat or Red Deer) and 40% reside in rural locations. When the province is split into north and south approximately 59% of patients reside in locati ons closer to Calgary, while 41% of patients are closer to Edmonton. Inciden ce of all of the included diagnoses rises with age; individuals over the age of 50 will comprise the group wi th the highest demand for the technology. All Transarterial Radioembolization for the for Hepatic Neoplasia Center for Health and Policy Studies, University of Calgary, October 2010 38 patient data was obtained from Alberta Health and Wellness. See Table 2f for all Alberta data. 4.3. Health System Capacity 4.3.1. Workforce Capacity A consistent theme in the meta-analyses and HTA pa pers was the requirement for an institutional multidisciplinary team to be in place. The key members of the team include radiologists, interventional radiologists, surgeons, medical and radiation oncologists, hepatologists and clinical staff. It is doubtful if collective expertise exists outside of Calgary and Edmonton, as TACE is only performed in these locations and the procedures involve many of the same disciplines. The learning curve for administering physicians should be relatively short as the procedures themselves ar e within the skill set of a typical interventional radiologist. 4.3.2. Infrastructural Capacity When considering the Alberta context, capaci ty to offer TARE currently resides in Edmonton where they ha ve had experience with approximately 75 patients in the last 4 years. In the majority of cases the role of TARE was as a salvage therapy, as patients were either unsuitable or had failed other therapy options. In a small group of TARE recipients, patients may be downstaged (go from non- resectable to resectable or even to transplantation); however, of the initial 21 HCC patients who underwent TARE in Edmonton, only one patient was downstaged to surgical resection. Both Edmonton and Calgary have the necessary equipment and support to provide the therapy. Most of the equipment, IT and programs are already in place for TACE and Transarterial Radioembolization for for Hepatic Neoplasia Center for Health and Policy Studies, University of Calgary, October 2010 39 other related procedures. After consulting an expe rt in the field, it is anticipated that only minimal alterations in currently employed procedures would have to occur for the provision of TARE in Calgary. 5. Technology Effects and Effectiveness 5.1. Current Context 5.1.1. Technology The need for noninvasive local and regional treatment options, specifically targeting hepatic neoplasia, was and is the driving for ce behind the development and introduction of TARE. TARE represents a localized treatment option with the distinct ability to selectively destroy tumour tissue while sparing normal tissue. It also has the distinct advantage of being able to be delivered repeatedly without compro mising a cirrhotic liver, one of the limitations associated with TACE. While still in its infancy with respect to overall adoption and diffusion, many centers that employ the proced ure report significant survival and clinical benefits. As described earlier, the basic premise on which this technology is based is exploiting the tumours natural blood supply via the hepatic artery. While the specific type of microsphere used can vary with respect to size, material, concentration and dose (all described in later sections), Y 90 is the principle radioactive component of all microspheres. The physical characteristics of Y90 make it a suitable candidate for this type of localized therapy. Y90 is a pure beta emitter which decays to stable zirconium-90 with a physical half- life of 64.1 hours. Y90 is produced by high-purity separation from strontium-90, a fission product of uranium in a nuclear reactor72. for Hepatic Neoplasia Center for Health and Policy Studies, University of Calgary, October 2010 40 The recommended dose to the liver is between 80 and 150 Gy (Gy refers to gray, a unit for amount of absorbed radiation). The amount of radioactivity required (GBq) (GBq - gigabecquerel - is a unit of radioactivity) to de liver the desired dose can be calculated by multiplying the desired dose (Gy) by the liver mass (kg) and then dividing that product by 50. This method for calculating dose is referred to as the partition model. Activity Required (GBq) = [Desired dose (Gy)][Liver Mass (kg)] The empirical model for dose calculation, accepts the safety margins of the dose known from previously reported literature, and chooses the most safe and effective dose from it. The recommended dose of spheres based on the empirical model, is 3.0 GBq for tumours which have greater than a 50% in volvement of the liver, 2.5 GBq for tumours between 25 and 50% involvement and 2.0 GBq for tumours with less than 25% involvement. Of importance, the dose administered has to be adjusted based on the percentage of lung shunting observed (see 5.3.1). The microspheres remain permanently in the liver after administration, and by approxim ately day 11 post-administration have decayed to 6% of their original activity 73. Due to the specific dimension of the sphe res (20-60 \u00b5m) they become lodged in the microvasculature surrounding the tumour74. Microspheres of this size distribute more homogenously in the vascular bed and provid e higher concentration in the tumour tissue75. The microspheres are too large to pass through the capillary bed (8-10 \u00b5m) and enter venous circulation; therefore they are permanently trapped in the liver76. The emitted beta radiation has a mean penetrable distance of approximately 2.5mm, which permits a local radiotherapeutic effect while minimizing the concurrent damage to surrounding liver tissue. 50 Transarterial Radioembolization for the for Hepatic Neoplasia Center for Health and Policy Studies, University of Calgary, October 2010 41 This penetrable distance also means that in large tumours, the cancerous tissue at the margins of the tumour will be killed but cancerou s cells could still remain in the center of the mass. It has been reported that 80-90% of tumour cells are killed with TARE1. 5.1.2. Technology Comparison There are two different manufactures of microspheres. Sirtex Medical Limited (Sydney, Australia) manufactures SIR-Sphe res and MDS Nordion (Otta wa, Canada) manufactures TheraSpheres. With respect to the ph ysical characteristics of the spheres, both spheres are biocompatible, contain yttrium-90 and are somewhere between 20 and 60\u00b5m. SIR-Spheres are resin based spheres while Ther aSpheres are glass based spheres. The main differences between the spheres are size, densi ty and activity. With respect to size, SIR- Spheres are between 20 and 60\u00b5m while TheraSpheres are between 20 and 30\u00b5m. The glass TheraSpheres are three times heavier per volume than the resin spheres, and contain 50 times more activity per share 1. For detailed product information see Table 4. SIR-Spheres are supplied in 5 mL of water in a vial, and each vial contains 3GBq of activity and a total of 40-80 million microspheres. The vial is shipped in a 6.4mm thick lead pot. The total package sent to users includes, a crimp-sealed SIR-Spheres microspheres glass vial within a lead pot, and a package insert within a Type A packing bucket. SIR-Spheres should be stored inside the transporta tion container at room temperature (15-25 oC)73. TheraSpheres are supplied in 0.6 mL of s terile, pyrogen-free water contained in a vee-bottom vial secured within a clear acrylic vial shield. Each milligram contains between 22,000 and 73,000 microspheres. TheraSpheres ar e supplied in six differe nt dose sizes (3, 5, 7, 10, 15 and 20 GBq). Each TheraSpheres do se comes with an administration set, and an Transarterial Radioembolization for the for Hepatic Neoplasia Center for Health and Policy Studies, University of Calgary, October 2010 42 administration accessory kit is supplied to each new user site. This kit includes reusable accessories including and acrylic box base, top shield, removable side shield, bag hook and a RADOS RAD-60R radiation dosimeter72. Calibration for radioactivity and particle size validation is performed, for both spheres, before the product is shipped. Each manufacturer provides a dose calibration table, with the shipment, that details the rate of decay per hour. The way in which calibration is performed accounts for shipping time and allows the user to receive the product such that they are able to administer the dose prior to any decay occurring. The rate of decay is an indirect way of adjusting the dose of ra dioactivity delivered to the patient. Both manufactures require orders to be placed no later than the Tuesday one week prior to treatment and the scheduled treatment date has to be stated in the order. The dose is delivered on treatment day, and for SIR-S pheres treatment has to be on a Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday. For TheraSphere, th e calibration date can be one to two weeks before treatment as long as treatment date is known. Only one included study evaluated the use of both spheres in a similar population, mNET patients, outcomes were similar between both groups. However, post embolization syndrome is more common with SIR-Spheres due to their larger size. It appears selection of which sphere to use is mainly governed by availability and indication for use and not differences in efficacy. 5.1.3. Health Canada Approval MDS Nordion received a Notice of Comp liance issued pursuant to paragraph C.08.004(1)(a), indicating that they have co mplied with sections C.08.002 or C.08.003 and C.08.005.1 o f the Food and Drug Regulati ons, for their prescription pharmaceutical Transarterial Radioembolization for for Hepatic Neoplasia Center for Health and Policy Studies, University of Calgary, October 2010 43 TheraSpheres. The Notice of Compliance was issued on March 05, 199877. Products that receive a Notice of Compliance have met Health Canada's regulatory requirements for safety, efficacy and quality. TheraSpheres are licensed in Canada as a Class III medical device for the treatment of hepatic neoplasia in patients who have appropriately positioned hepatic arterial catheter. Sirtex Medical Limited has not applied for a Notice of Compliance, for SIR-Spheres in Canada. 5.2. Condition(s) and Limitations 5.2.1. Best Practice The Radio Embolization Brachytherapy Oncology Consortium (REBOC), an independent group of experts from the fields of interventional radiology, radiation oncology, nuclear medicine, medical oncology, and surgical oncology has published guidelines intended to guide ongoing clinical practice and future investigations of TARE 78. In this publication the group identifies 14 recommendations for practice that were developed in 2006. For development of the recommendations, all published and unpublished data on the use of Y 90 microspheres was reviewed and recommendations on clinical practice were developed using categories of consensus employed by the pane l. The categories used were similar to those used in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines, with all recommendations being in Category 2A (i.e. there is uniform panel consensus, based on lower-level evidence including clinical experience, that the recommendation is appropriate) 78. For a summary of these 14 recommendations see Appendix X. Transarterial Radioembolization for for Hepatic Neoplasia Center for Health and Policy Studies, University of Calgary, October 2010 44 A treatment algorithm for Y90 microsphere treatment was also developed78, and is similar to the protocol followed at the Foot hills Medical Center in Calgary for treating patients with TACE. Because of this it is anti cipated that best practice guidelines for TARE would only require slight modifications to guid elines already followed. Of importance, it is stressed throughout the literature that a multidis ciplinary team be involved in the review and selection of patients to be treated with TARE . A team such as this has been in place in Southern Alberta since 2001. Patients with pr imary or metastatic liver tumours are discussed at weekly multidisciplinary meeting of Tom Baker Cancer Centre HPB Neoplasia Group. Groups such as this should be incorporated into best practice. 5.2.2. Other Jurisdictional Guidelines SIR-Spheres are indicated for the treatment of unresectable me tastatic liver tumours from primary colorectal cancer. SIR-Spheres are al so approved with adjuvant hepatic artery chemotherapy (HAC) or FUDR (Floxuridine). SIR-Spheres are contraindicated in patients who have previously had external beam radiation therapy to the liver, have ascites or are in clinical liver failure; have mark edly abnormal liver function tests; have greater than 20% shunting of the hepatic y, abnormal vascular disseminated extra-hepati c malignant disease; been treated with capecitabine within the two previous months, or who will be treated with capecitabine at any time following TARE; or has portal vein thrombosis. SIR-Spheres have TGA inclusion in Australia, pre-market approval by the FDA in the US and BSI consent in Europe (C mark) for use in colorectal cancer that has metastasized to the liver. Transarterial for Hepatic Neoplasia Center for Health and Policy Studies, University of Calgary, October 2010 45 TheraSpheres are available in Canada an d Europe for the treatment of hepatic neoplasia, and in the US for HCC. TheraSpheres are contraindicated in similar instances to SIR-Spheres; when there is abnormal vascul ar anatomy, severe liver dysfunction or pulmonary insufficiency and >20% lung shunting. TheraSpheres are not contraindicated in portal vein thrombosis unless there is complete occlusion of the main portal vein. MDS Nordion also identifies high risk factors, for which the physician must consider patients on a case by case basis to determine if the benefi ts of treatment outweigh potential risk. These high risk factors include, infiltrative tumour type, \"bulk tumour type\" (i.e. tumour volume >70%, or too many to count), AST or ALT > 5times ULN, bilirubin > 34\u00b5mol/L, and tumour volume > 50% combined with an albumin < 30g/L. TheraSpheres are approved in the US by the FDA under a humanitarian device exemption and have BSI consent in Europe (C mark). 5.2.3. Diffusion of Technology Both spheres are used extensively all over the world. SIR-Spheres are used in treatment centers in Australia, US, Europe, Sin gapore, Hong Kong, New Zealand and India. TheraSpheres have treatment centers in Kuwait, So uth Africa, India, Belgium, Spain, France, Italy, Germany, US and Canada. The majority of treatment centers, using either sphere type, are located in the US with over 200 centers offering TARE. As only TheraSpheres has Health Canada approval, it is the only sphe re currently used in Canada. There are three centers offering TARE in Canada: Royal Vi ctoria Hospital in Montreal, QC; Vancouver General Hospital in Vancouver, BC; and University of Alberta Hospital in Edmonton, AB. The University of Alberta Hospital has treated 75 patients thus far. Transarterial Radioembolization for the for Hepatic Neoplasia Center for Health and Policy Studies, University of Calgary, October 2010 46 5.3. Effects/Effectiveness 5.3.1. Safety As mentioned previously, the safety of TARE is largely dependent on the proper selection of patients and the involvement of a multidisciplinary team throug hout the procedure. The team should include expertise in areas of interventional radiology, radiation oncology, nuclear medicine, medical physics , hepatology, surgical oncology, medical oncology and radiation safety. With respect to proper selection of patients, a retrospective study of 121 patients from five clinical tria ls has shown that the following 5 pre-treatment risk factors were associated with at least 48% of all serious adverse events related to the use of TARE72. Infiltrative tumour type \"Bulk disease\" (tumour volume the target liver volume, or tumour nodules too numerous to count) AST or ALT > 5 time ULN Bilirubin > 34\u00b5mol/L Tumour volume > 50% combined with an albumin < 30g/L In addition to the high risk factors, TARE is contraindicated when there is >20% lung-shunt fraction, as determined by a nuclear medicine scan, and when extrahepatic vessels cannot be protectively embolized. If a high degree of shunting exists, the microspheres will inadvertently be delivered and trapped in the lung causing radiation pneumonitis. The lung-shunt fraction is calculated by injecting hepatic artery and imaging with scintigraphy. The 99mTc-MAA particles are similar in size to the microspheres and will emulate the pattern of distribution expected in the actual TARE procedure. After injection, Transarterial Radioembolization for for Hepatic Neoplasia Center for Health and Policy Studies, University of Calgary, October 2010 47 the patient is positioned under a gamma camera and the regions of interest are defined as the liver and lungs. The activity of the particles that pass through the liver and lodge in the lungs can then be calculated. The amount of 99mTc-MAA deposited in the lungs is then taken as a % of the amount of 99mTc-MAA deposited in the liver and lungs to give the lung-shunt fraction. Fortunately, lung-shunt fractions in excess of 20% rarely occur. If the lung-shunt fraction is > 10% dose reductions for TARE are recommended. With respect to the embolization of extrahep atic vessels, there is again the possibility of inadvertent delivery of microspheres to the gastrointestinal tract, stomach, kidneys, pancreas etc. therefore abnormal vasculature needs to be identified, and embolized, in the first angiographic procedure. Gastritis (and ga stric ulceration) is one of the main serious adverse events reported throughout the literature. Gastritis occurs when microspheres travel to the duodenum and stomach. This can only happen when microspheres pass into the small vasculature originating from the hepatic hilum. Sirtex has published guidelines in their SIR- Spheres training manual for physicians that id entify the main causes of inadvertent delivery of spheres to the duodenum and stomach and provide recommendations for avoiding this complication. Of note, they recommend a large amount of contrast be used in the angiographic procedure. Although loading arter ies with contrast may not be good for the patient, it is necessary with TARE as it is th e only way to identify small arteries passing from the liver to the other organs. They recommend 3- 4ml/sec for 5 seconds (a total of 15-20mls of contrast in one angiogram run) 79. Throughout the literature various adverse events are reported, however most are not severe and TARE appears to be well tolerated when performed properly. A summary of the Transarterial Radioembolization for the for Hepatic Neoplasia Center for Health and Policy Studies, University of Calgary, October 2010 48 most commonly reported mild and moderate adverse events (grade 1 and 2), followed by the serious or life threatening events (grade 3 and 4) is discussed. For this report the grading system was based on the Common Termi nology Criteria for Adverse Events 80. Mild and moderate adverse events include post-embolization syndrome, which is common to the first week following TARE. This usually involves fever, nausea, abdominal pain and fatigue. Most cases are resolved three to seven days after treatment. Post-embolization syndrome seems to be less common with TheraSpheres than SIR-Spheres, likely due to the slightly larger size of SIR-Sphere microspheres resulting in a slightly greater embolic effect 81. Other mild and moderate events commonly reported include diarrhea, shaking, chills, abnormal liver function tests, lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia17. In some cases oral analgesics for pain or anti-emetics for nausea are prescribed to patients experiencing these events. Post-embolization syndrome is far less common in TARE than TACE. Additionally, nausea, hair loss and vomiting that are associated with TACE and chemotherapy are not nearly as frequent with TARE. Serious events reported throughout the literat ure include death, radiation hepatitis, radiation gastritis, radiation pneumonitis, radi ation-induced cirrhosis, hepatic necrosis and GI ulceration. Serious adverse events that can occur immediately after treatment include acute pancreatitis and acute peptic ulceration. Both of these events are marked by acute abdominal pain immediately after implantati on of the microspheres, and likely indicate inadvertent delivery of spheres to other organs 79. Post-implant nuclear scans may be used to verify microsphere placement, in the event that spheres have been deposited in other organs patients should be treated using best standard practice for these conditions. Delayed serious Transarterial Radioembolization for the for Hepatic Neoplasia Center for Health and Policy Studies, University of Calgary, October 2010 49 events include radiation pneumonitis and ra diation hepatitis. Radiation pneumonitis can result when there is excess shunting to the lung , or when very high doses of radiation are administered. Radiation pneumonitis can present anywhere from days to weeks after TARE and is usually suspected when patients develop a non productive cough79. Radiation pneumonitis is diagnosed by a chest x-ray and treatment typically involves systemic corticosteroids and supportive care until the disease is resolved. It is recommended that radiation doses to the lung should not exceed 30Gy in a single session and 50Gy cumulatively, although there have been reports of patients receiving lung doses in excess of these amounts without the development of radiation pneumonitis 82. Radiation hepatitis occurs when normal liver parenchyma receives a high dose of radiation. It can be difficult to diagnose as it may occur weeks after treatment. Progressive deterioration in liver function can indicate radiation hepatitis and a liver co re biopsy should be performed to confirm. Again treatment involves systematic corticosteroids and supportive care until the inflammation settles 79. The incidence of these serious events was higher in early use of TARE, since then training, guidelines for the pre-treatment angiogram and patient selection criteria have improved and fewer grade 3 and 4 events are being reported. There is wide variation in the reporting of adverse events and toxicities throughout the literature. Some studies report grade 3 and 4 events, while some report all events and others report the number of patients that ha ve any event. For this reason providing an overall estimate of adverse events and toxicities related to TARE is not feasible. However, in the largest single report on the use of TARE (n=291) approximately 20% of patients had grade 3 or 4 toxicities (i.e liver function tes ts, blood tests etc); however there were no serious Transarterial for for Hepatic Neoplasia Center for Health and Policy Studies, University of Calgary, October 2010 50 adverse events reported33. One of the HTAs identified in this report detailed the rate of serious adverse events as 2-3%, with trea tment related mortality at approximately 1%18. These rates are in line with other treatments offered for hepatic neoplasia62. Addressing the safety of TARE compared to standard of care is difficult due to the lack of RCTs comparing the treatment options. In the three RCTs included in this report, examining CRCLM patients, the number of serious and life threatening events (grade 3 and 4) for TARE + HAC compared to HAC alone was identical in one study 83, one study found 13 events in the combined TARE + chemotherapy group and five in the chemo group alone 84, and the final study found six grade 3 or 4 toxicities in the chemotherapy alone arm and one in the combination arm85. It is important to note that in all three RCTs the chemotherapy regimen employed is no longer consid ered standard of care in Alberta. Also, it is important to recognize that no evidence of a difference is not the same as evidence of no difference. Studies examining TARE with newer chemotherapy regimes in CRCLM patients are currently underway. In a recent phase I dose escalation study, 23 irinotecan-na\u00efve patients were enrolled into three dose escalati ng groups (i.e. 50, 75 and 100mg/m2)39. Each group received a different dose of irinotecan in initial chemotherapy cycles (1 to 3) and then the full dose of 100mg/m 2 in cycles 3 to 9. On the first cycle of chemotherapy a single administration of TARE was given. The adverse event profile showed that 48% of patients experienced at least one grade 3 or 4 adverse even t, but that all but one event resolved after a one week delay in protocol chemotherapy. A dditionally, two grade 3 events of transient abdominal pain were directly associated to th e TARE therapy. The safety profile observed Transarterial Radioembolization for for Hepatic Neoplasia Center for Health and Policy Studies, University of Calgary, October 2010 51 was similar to that of studies that use sing le-agent irinotecan for CRCLM patients, and the authors concluded that the combination of TARE and systemic chemotherapy with irinotecan demonstrated an acceptable saf ety profile at the dose level of 100mg/m2 in all cycles39. Another phase I study examining the use of TARE with FOLFOX4 systemic chemotherapy, had 20 patients, in three groups, receive different doses of oxaliplatin (i.e. 30, 60 and 85mg/m 2) in the first three cycles of chemotherapy86. After the third cycle of therapy, all patients received full dose oxaliplatin (85mg/m2) for the remaining cycles. The other chemotherapy agents in the FOLFOX4 regimen were administered in full doses in all cycles (i.e. FU/LV). The results of the study showed that the combined therapy was generally well tolerated, but that there were significantly more grade 3 and 4 adverse events (i.e. neutropenia and leukopenia), in the highest dose group, than reported in phase III trials with FOLFOX4 alone. For this reason, the authors concluded that the maximum tolerated does of oxaliplatin with concomitant TARE is 60mg/m 2 in the first three cycles of chemotherapy86. Three additional studies, one examining the use of TARE with concomitant FOLFOX6 (FOXFIRE), one with concomitant FOLFOX6 and bevacizumab (SIRFLOX), and a third examining the use of TARE with concomitant FOLFIRI and cetuximab, are currently underway. These studies will aim to determine the risks and benefits of adding TARE to modern chemotherapy regimens, and are timely in nature. With respect to the safety of TARE in HCC, one prospective cohort study that compared the effectiveness of TARE or TACE, in downstaging patients to transplantation, was found and demonstrated a slight differen ce in the number of grade 3 and 4 for Hepatic Neoplasia Center for Health and Policy Studies, University of Calgary, October 2010 52 toxicities with the TACE group having 26% and the TARE group having 7%87. A phase III RCT is currently underway (SORAMIC), in wh ich 375 patients over approximately three years will receive SIR-Spheres in conjunction with sorafenib versus SIR-Spheres alone, results of which will have major implicat ions for advanced staged HCC patients. From the minimal amount of safety data reported for comparative and concomitant therapies it appears that TARE is similar to TACE in HCC patients and chemotherapy in mCRC patients, or does not add significantly to the safety profile, in the number of serious and life threatening adverse events. Of note, the FOLFIRI and FOLFOX6 regimens, included in the mCRC clinical practice guidelines for Alberta, have higher doses of irinotecan and oxailplatin respectively than the maximum tolerated doses in the studies mentioned above. A dose reduction, at least in initial chemotherapy cycles, would likely be necessary if TARE was administered as a c oncomitant therapy. Safety data on TARE and TACE in mNET patients was very limited and as such could not be critically evaluated. Another relevant safety issue is the radiat ion exposure for personnel involved in the administration and handling of Y 90 microspheres. Typically, radiation exposure to personnel involved in the TARE procedure is well within acceptable limits. It is the responsibility of the administering institution to check with th eir regulatory body for acceptable occupational radiation exposure limits, as various standards ex ist. For typical exposure levels for personnel involved in the TARE procedure see Table 5. Transarterial Radioembolization for for Hepatic Neoplasia Center for Health and Policy Studies, University of Calgary, October 2010 53 5.3.2. Efficacy/Effectiveness RCTs Two RCTs were identified through the literature search; a member of the EAG submitted an additional third RCT. The three RCT s were judged to be of high quality88. In the first study by van Hazel et al. (2004)89 randomization was performed by a computer based randomization program in the second, Grey et al. (2001)83, randomization was described as a blinded envelope batch method controlled by an independent party and in the third, Hendeliz (2010) randomization was pe rformed by the minimization technique. In two studies radiological response data was reviewed independently. In van Hazel et al. (2004), one blinded radiologist looked at all CT sc ans and Grey et al. (2001) two independent and blinded radiologists reviewed the CT scans; if there was more than a 10% disagreement from the mean of the two measurements, in the calc ulated tumour volume, a third radiologist was consulted. In the third study, Hendeliz (2010) , radiological assessment was only described as being done locally. There was less than 20% loss to follow up in all three studies and patients were treated on an intention to treat basis. In the RCT reported by van Hazel et al. (2004) 89, patients with CRCLM, were randomized to either a systemic chemotherapy alone, n=10, (control arm) or a systemic chemotherapy with the addition of a single administration of TARE with SIR-Spheres, n=11, (experimental arm). The primary aim of the study was to compare the response rate and toxicity from adding a single treatm ent of TARE to a standard regimen of fluorouracil/leucovorin chemotherapy. Patients in both arms received 5-fluorouracil at 425 mg/m 2/day plus 20 mg/m2/day of leucovorin for five consecutive days and repeated the Transarterial Radioembolization for the for Hepatic Neoplasia Center for Health and Policy Studies, University of Calgary, October 2010 54 cycle at four weekly intervals. The chemotherapy regimen was continued until unacceptable toxicity, patient request or disease progression. Patients in the experimental arm received a single dose of SIR-Spheres on the third or four th day of the second cycle. Once protocol therapy had ceased, other supportive therapy an d non-protocol chemotherapy was allowed. Outcome measures reported included: radiogra phic response as assessed by CT scan and Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) criteria (see Table 3 for criteria), TTPD, survival, toxicity and advers e events, and quality of life. With respect to radiological response, for the first integrated response, six patients had stable disease and four patients showed progressive disease in the chemotherapy alone group, while ten patients showed a partial re sponse and one showed stable disease in the combination arm. For best confirmed response, tw o of the patients that had initially showed a partial response did not get confirmatory sc ans. The difference in response between the arms was statistically significant ( p < 0.001). The TTPD was also significantly different between the arms with the median TTPD for the chemotherapy arm being 3.6 months and for the combination arm 18.6 months (p <0.0005). Median survival for the chemo alone arm was 12.8 months and for the combination arm was 29.4 months (p = 0.025). There were a total of five grade 3 and 4 adverse events in the chemo alone arm and 13 in the combination arm. There was also one treatment related death in the combination arm that was attributed to neutropenia associated with the chemothera py. Changes in quality of life measures were almost identical between the two arms ( p=0.96). Overall, findings from the study show that the addition of a single administration of TARE, to a systemic chemotherapy regimen, increased response rate, time to disease Transarterial Radioembolization for the for Hepatic Neoplasia Center for Health and Policy Studies, University of Calgary, October 2010 55 progression and survival when compared to the chemotherapy regimen alone in patients with CRCLM. There were more serious adverse events in the combination arm; the authors attributed many of these events to the grea ter period that the combination arm received protocol treatment. The authors concluded that the addition of TARE to a standard chemotherapy regimen will enhance treatment efficacy and improve patient outcome. The second study by Gray et al. (2001) 83 was aimed at examining the benefits of adding TARE to regional chemotherapy in non-resectable, non-ablatable CRCLM patients. Specifically, patients were randomized to eith a regimen of hepatic arterial chemotherapy (HAC) with floxuridine, n = 34, (control arm) or the same chemotherapy regimen plus a single administration of TARE with SIR-Sphere s, n = 36, (investigational arm). The trial was initially designed to enter 95 patients but ceased at 74, and 70 of these patients were eligible to receive treatment. Accrual of patien ts was halted for three reasons: 1) increasing reluctance of patients and physicians to have patients randomized 2) absence of ongoing funding for the trial and 3) Pre Market Applic ation to the FDA, based on time to disease progression and radiological response, for regi stration of SIR-Spheres in the US. Patients had metastases limited to the liver and lym ph nodes in the porta hepatis. All patients underwent surgical laparotomy, cholecystectomy and insertion of a permanent hepatic artery catheter accessible by a subcutaneous port. A ll patients received 12 day cycles of continuous infusion of floxuridine at 0.3 mg/kg of body wei ght/day that were repeated at four weekly intervals. Chemotherapy was continued until th ere was evidence of disease progression, extra-hepatic metastases, unacceptable toxicities , port failure or at the patient's request. Patients in the investigational arm received a single injection of SIR-Spheres within four Transarterial Radioembolization for for Hepatic Neoplasia Center for Health and Policy Studies, University of Calgary, October 2010 56 weeks time from the surgery to place the hepati c artery access port. The dose of SIR-Spheres was calculated using the empirical model. Outcome measures reported included: radiological response (assessed by CT scan, measured by both tumour area and volume), tumour marker (CEA), TTDP, survival, toxicity and adverse events, and quality of life. Radiological response data show that more than twice as many patients in the investigational arm achieved either a complete or partial response as assessed by tumour area (p = 0.01) and volume ( p = 0.03). Changes in CEA paralleled those of tumour area and volume, with larger decreases in CEA seen in the investigational arm compared to the control arm ( p = 0.004). Both radiological response and tumour marker response show more patients in the control arm had progressive dise ase as their best response to treatment. The TTDP was longer for the interventional arm, as measured by both tumour area ( p < 0.01) and tumour volume ( p = 0.04). Overall, the survival an alysis did not show a significant difference in survival benefit between the two arms. There was however a divergence of the survival curves for the two arms at 15 months , after which a significant survival benefit for the interventional arm existed. The number of grade 3 and 4 adverse events was identical between the two arms; quality of life measures were not significantly different between the arms. The results of the study suggest that the addition of a single administration of SIR-Spheres to a standard regimen of HAC improved effectiveness when measured by radiological and tumour marker response, as well as prolonging TTDP. Additionally, the results suggest that the addition of SIR-Sphere s to HAC does not adversely affect quality of life or add significant toxicity. Transarterial Radioembolization for the for Hepatic Neoplasia Center for Health and Policy Studies, University of Calgary, October 2010 57 A third RCT, was identified by a member of the EAG90, and included in the report after its publication in August 2010. Again, this study was aimed at evaluating the addition of a single administration of TARE to a standard chemotherapy regimen in CRCLM patients. This study enrolled 44 patients with poly-c hemotherapy-refractory CRCLM in two arms, with the control arm receiving a standard 5-FU chemotherapy regimen (n=23) and the intervention arm receiving the same chemotherapy regimen with the addition of a single administration of TARE (n=21). The primary outcome measure reported was time to liver progression (TTLP). The median TTLP was 2.1 and 5.5 months in the control and combination arms, respectively [HR=0.38 (95%CI: 0.20-0.72), p=0.003]. The median time to tumour progression (TTP) was 2.1 and 4.5 mont hs, [HR=0.51 (95%CI: 0.28-0.94), p=0.03]. Grade 3 or 4 toxicities were recorded in 6 patients following 5-FU mono-therapy and in 1 patient following TARE plus 5-FU treatment ( p=0.10). The investigators concluded that this RCT met its primary endpoint by demonstrating that a single hepatic arterial injection of SIR-Spheres microspheres added to a standard protracted IV infusion of 5-FU significantly extends the time to both local and overall di sease progression. They also concluded that treatment was well tolerated and did not add relevant toxicity, and TARE should therefore be considered as a valid therapeutic option for patients with poly-chemotherapy-refractory liver-limited mCRC. Overall results from the three included RCTs suggest that the addition of TARE, using SIR-Spheres, to standard 5-FU/LV sys temic and regional chemotherapy regimens, increases the effectiveness of treatment (i.e. survi val, time to disease progression, radiological Transarterial Radioembolization for for Hepatic Neoplasia Center for Health and Policy Studies, University of Calgary, October 2010 58 response etc.) while not adding significantly to overall toxicities in patients with non- resectable CRCLM. HTAs National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), United Kingdom (2009)19 This report was prepared as an overview an d rapid review of the literature to assist members of the Interventional Procedures Advisory Committee to make recommendations about the safety and efficacy of selective internal radiation therapy as an interventional procedure. It was stressed that the report shou ld not be regarded as a definitive assessment of the procedure. The report focused on the use of TARE primarily in CRCLM. It gave a brief overview of what the procedure involves, and reviewed two RCTs as well as four case series to assess safety and efficacy. The report also included a literature review section, based on excerpts from the HTA performed by the Au stralian Medical Services Advisory Committee (MSAC) discussed below 18. NICE concluded that many of the uncontrolled studies made differentiating the side effects of concomitan t local or systemic chemotherapy from the possible side effects of TARE difficult. Th e use of non-protocol chemotherapy once the initial protocol had finished in the two RCTs was problematic and that few studies attempted to address quality of life outcomes. Overall, it was recommended that there was insufficient evidence of effectiveness of TARE, using SIR-Spheres, and that public funding should not be supported at this time for this procedure 19. Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH), Canada (2007)17 This five page report examines the use of TARE in HCC. As there are no RCTs examining the use of TARE in HCC, information from the largest case series studies were Transarterial Radioembolization for the for Hepatic Neoplasia Center for Health and Policy Studies, University of Calgary, October 2010 59 included. In total nine studies (six TheraSpheres and three SIR-Spheres studies) were included in the report. A short section on admini stration and cost was included in the report. In the administration section, both TheraSpheres and SIR-Spheres were objectively compared in terms of their physical attributes , mechanisms of action, and administration. The typical patient care pathway was descri bed (i.e. pre-treatment, treatment and post- treatment procedures), although it was fairly superficial in nature. Adverse events common to the procedure were also detailed. Cost of both TheraSpheres and SIR-Spheres were reported, costs for administration and follow up procedures were not reported, and no cost-effectiveness analysis was performed. Overall, with respect to safety and efficacy, it was concluded that there is limited evidence, from se veral case series, indicating that TARE with microspheres may reduce tumour size and incr ease survival times. Additionally, in some patients TARE with microspheres may result in enough tumour reduction to permit liver resection or transplantation. Medical Services Advisory Committee (MSAC), Australia (2005)18 By far the most comprehensive HTA, the MSAC assessment on SIR-Spheres for the treatment of non-resectable liver tumours is very well done. Two main research questions were addressed in the report: 1) What are the safety, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of SIR-Spheres used alone or in combination with chemotherapy for treating non-resectable, non-ablatable hepatic metastases secondary to for Hepatic Neoplasia Center for Health and Policy Studies, University of Calgary, October 2010 60 2) What are the safety, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of SIR-Spheres for treating or 131I-lipiodol (a radioactive particle)? Eight cohort studies were included for the safety evaluation. In the included SIR- Sphere studies, seven deaths attributed to radiation hepatitis, radiation gastritis, acute hepatic necrosis and sepsis associated with neutropeni a were reported in over 500 patients treated with the microspheres, resulting in a fatality rate of less than 1%. Safety of SIR-Spheres compared to alternative treatments was onl y addressed through the two RCTs identified (same two included in this report) which, as mentioned previously, had one study reporting identical numbers of grade 3 and 4 adverse even ts (Grey et al., 2001) and the other reporting 13 in a combination chemotherapy + TARE ar m and five in the chemotherapy alone arm (van Hazel et al., 2004). Two small RCTs and four uncontrolled case series reports were identified for inclusion in the evaluation of the effectivene ss of SIR-Spheres in CRCLM patients. The RCT performed by van Hazel et al. (2004) showed a significant survival benefit of TARE + chemotherapy over chemotherapy alone, although it was noted that the chemotherapy regimen employed in the study is no longer the standard of care. In the six studies included all showed some anti-tumour effect of SIR-Sphe res in terms of tumour response. Only the van Hazel et al. (2004) study however used st andardized criteria to measure tumour response, and similar to the observed survival benefit, a significant advantage of the combined therapy also existed for tumour res ponse rate. For the effectiveness evaluation of SIR-Spheres in HCC, two case series of fair quality were included. Both studies reported up Transarterial Radioembolization for the for Hepatic Neoplasia Center for Health and Policy Studies, University of Calgary, October 2010 61 to 50% of patients demonstrating either a co mplete or partial tumour response. The authors concluded this was weak evidence (i.e lack of level one evidence) to support the use of SIR- Spheres in HCC. Overall recommendations, with respect to the original two research questions, were that interim public funding should be supported for the use of SIR-Spheres in combination with 5-FU/LV, in patients with non-resectabl e, non-ablatable CRCLM, with the collection of survival data to be reported to MSAC in three years. It was also recommended, due to insufficient evidence, that public funding should not be supported for the use of SIR-Spheres in HCC. Both recommendations were en dorsed by the Minister for Health and Ageing on November 28, 2005. California Technology Assessment Forums (CTAF), United States (2010)20 This recent report out of California was aimed at providing an assessment of the evidence for the use of TARE for the treatm ent of CRCLM. The report examined five criteria as they related to the use of TARE in this patient population. 1) The technology must have final approval from the appropriate government regulatory bodies. 2) The scientific evidence must permit concl usions concerning the effectiveness of the technology regarding health outcomes. 3) The technology must improve net health outcomes. 4) The technology must be as beneficial as any established alternatives. 5) The improvement must be attainable outside of the investigational setting. The review provided a brief background of the history for mCRC care and describes alternate therapies and TARE. Evidence related to the five criterions is then reviewed. A Transarterial Radioembolization for for Hepatic Neoplasia Center for Health and Policy Studies, University of Calgary, October 2010 62 total of two RCTs, one small retrospective st udy comparing TARE to TACE, 21 case-series and one systematic review were included. Th e two RCTs included are the same two RCTs intitially identified for inclusion in this report and have been described above. The evidence for each of the 21 case-series was summarized in a table and a brief paragraph summarizing their results was included. It was found that pa tients treated were on average 60 to 65 years of age and were approximately 66% male. All pati ents included in the studies had inoperable liver metastases from colorectal cancer. There was a wide range of included patients with some having failed two or more chemotherapy regimens to those who received TARE as first-line treatment. Radiological response rates varied from 0-90% and median survival times ranged from 4.5 to 14.5 months. The aut hor concluded that the clinical outcomes were not impressive given the current median survival times for patients with mCRC are in excess of 29 months. It was noted however that in cases where patients had failed all other treatment options TARE was effective in pr olonging survival. It was recommended that comparative trials with a clear definition of the patient population should be conducted. The one retrospective study that compared TARE with TACE as a salvage therapy was also reviewed. This study found no difference between the treatments. It was noted that the study was underpowered and that the unmatched observational study design likely contributed to a patient selection bias. It was concluded that no meaningful conclusions on health outcomes could be made from this study. In terms of safety, it was reported that patients receiving TARE will experience post- embolization syndrome (20-55%), radiation hepatitis (4.1%), radiation pneumonitis (<1%) and gastric and duodenal ulcers (5%), respectively based on the literature. It was also noted Transarterial Radioembolization for the for Hepatic Neoplasia Center for Health and Policy Studies, University of Calgary, October 2010 63 that at least two large trials (SIRFLOX and FOXFIRE), as discussed in section 5.3.1 of this report, are now underway and will provide impor tant safety and efficacy information for use of TARE in CRCLM patients. In conclusion it was determined that TARE for the treatment of CRCLM does not meet four of five criteria identified for improvement in health outcomes. These four being, the scientific evidence must permit concl usions concerning the effectiveness of the technology regarding health outcomes, the technology must improve net health outcomes, the technology must be as beneficial as any established alternatives and the improvement must be attainable outside the investigational setting. HTA Summary Overall the results of the four HTAs are inconclusive with respect to recommendations on public funding. Most of th is is due to the fact that they were each commissioned to look at different research questions. The NICE19, MSAC18 and CTAF20 reports focused on Y90 microsphere treatment for CRCLM. While the MSAC report is well done, the fact that 5-FU/LV is no longer the standard of care for patients with non-resectable, non-ablatable CRCLM leaves recommendations about its use with SIR-Spheres relatively useless. With respect to the use of TARE in HCC, it appears the consistent conclusion from all three (where mentioned) HTAs was that there is insufficient evidence at this point to make any recommendations on public funding. It is important to note that a consistent theme in all three reports was the use of TARE (and specifically SIR-Spheres) in trea ting non-resectable, non-ablatable CRCLM and HCC has revealed statistically significant survival and tumour response benefits and should continue to be investigated. Transarterial Radioembolization for the for Hepatic Neoplasia Center for Health and Policy Studies, University of Calgary, October 2010 64 Meta-Analyses and Systematic Reviews Three studies were identified as meta-analyses or systematic reviews. One systematic review published in the Cochrane Collaboration91, examining treatment options for mNETs, only included RCTs that evaluated the use of TARE for mNET patients and found no RCTs, cohort or case-control studies comparin g treatment options in patients with mNETs (i.e no studies were identified for inclusion and thus no evaluations were completed). The authors of this study concluded that future re search was needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TARE for this population. This st udy will not be summarized below. Ultimately one meta-analysis 74 and one systematic review92 were summarized in the analysis. Vente et al. (2009)74 The authors of this paper cite the lack of overall knowledge on survival and tumour response benefits from TARE as the basis fo r conducting a structured meta-analysis. A systematic review of the literature was first conducted, in which 44 articles were ultimately identified as studies meeting the inclusion cri teria. After further review and data extraction were performed, a further 14 articles were exclud ed. In total 30 articles were included in the review and analysis. The search strategy and inclusion/exclusion criteria of this review was similar to the one employed in the present report. Studies were divided into two groups based on cancer type (i.e. CRCLM, HCC). Medi an survival data and tumour response data were extracted for all studies. When data from all 30 studies were analyzed together without separation into cancer type, tumour response was found in 999 of 1,21 7 patients treated with TARE; with tumour response assessed by CT scans. The authors of this study chose to use \"any response\" as their outcome measure, which comprised patien ts that originally were reported to be in Transarterial for the for Hepatic Neoplasia Center for Health and Policy Studies, University of Calgary, October 2010 65 complete response, partial response and stable disease categories. Analysis revealed that the percentage of patients showing any tumour response to treatment varied between 29 and 100. When the patients with CRCLM were analyzed separately (i.e. 18 studies, 681 patients), with the two covariates of chemotherapy regimen (old or new) and line of treatment (salvage or first-line), only line of treatment made a significant difference in the rate of tumour response. Specifically, it was found that 91% of patients showed any response when treated with TARE as a first-line therapy compar ed to 79% of patients when TARE was administered in a salvage setting. In HCC patients, the only subgroups included were based on the type of microsphere used (SIR-Sphere or TheraSpheres). It was found that in the 12 studies, 318 patients, 89% of patients treated with SIR-Spheres showed any response and 78% of patients treated with TheraSpheres showed any response ( p = 0.02). Median survival times for CRCLM patients ranged from 6.7 to 17.0 months from time of TARE treatment. No meta-analysis was reported. In HCC patients, median survival varied from 7.1 to 21.0 months from time of TARE treatment. No meta-analysis was reported. The authors of this study concluded that , in HCC, TARE with resin microspheres (i.e. SIR-Spheres) is significantly more effecti ve than TARE with glass microspheres (i.e TheraSpheres). They also state, that the im pact on survival will become known only when the results of phase III clinical studies are published. Townsend et al. (2009)92 The objective of this systematic review was primarily to assess the impact of TARE on progression free survival in CRCLM patients. Secondary objectives included assessing the impact of TARE on overall survival, response rate , quality of life, toxicity and rate of hepatic Transarterial for for Hepatic Neoplasia Center for Health and Policy Studies, University of Calgary, October 2010 66 resection in CRCLM patients. Only RCTs in patien ts with unresectable liver metastases from colorectal cancer were included. Thus, this review focused on the results of the two published RCTs identified in the present report. The authors of this report concluded that with respect to clinical practice, TARE should only be given to patients within a clinical trial due to the lack of efficacy evidence. Additionally, with respect to research they concluded that more RCTs are necessary; RCTs that are not industry-supported, that examine TARE in addition to newer chemotherapeutic regimens and that stratify patients based on their extent of extra-hepatic disease. Cohort Studies For ease of presentation all efficacy data will be reported, for the prospective cohort studies, in sections related to the outcome measure they address. Each section will begin by addressing efficacy in HCC followed by CRCLM pa tients. There were not enough studies, or data, for any analysis concerning mNET pati ents. We discuss the state of evidence for mNET patients at the end of this section. Meta-analyses were performed for outcome measures where sufficient data existed and are described where appropriate. For a summary of all data included in the meta-analyses see Table 6. Median Survival Time The overall median survival time of all patients in the 15 studies included receiving TARE was 50.6 weeks or 11.6 months. When looking at the individual cancer types, it was found that HCC patients had a median survival time of 59.6 weeks, or 13.7 months, and CRCLM patients had a median survival time of 41.4, or 9.5 months (See Figure 1 for median survival results). It is important to note that in three of the HCC papers, the median survival Transarterial Radioembolization for for Hepatic Neoplasia Center for Health and Policy Studies, University of Calgary, October 2010 67 time was taken for only a subset of the reported patients27, 33, 35. In one only BCLC stage B patients were included49, and in two only patients with no evidence of PVT were included27, 33, 35. This was done as no median survival data could be retrieved for the entire cohort. With respect to HCC patients, the median survival time of 13.7 months is similar to median survival times of intermedia te staged patients receiving TACE62, 93. In a recent quality assurance study completed at the Foothills Medi cal Center, it was reported that intermediate staged patients (i.e. BCLC stage B) receiv ing TACE had a median survival time of 15.8 months93. Additionally, the University of Alberta Hospital has reported a median survival time of 11.1 months in its experience with 21 initial HCC patients treated with TARE. This median survival time is slightly below the 13.7 month value obtained from the meta-analysis, but notably 43% of patients in the Univer sity of Alberta cohort were BCLC stage C or worse. Median survival times are longer for pati ents in early stages of the disease (i.e. BCLC stage A) and with better underlying liver fu nction (i.e. Child-Pugh A) for both therapies. A small number of BCLC stage A patients have received TARE, but individually reported data for this group were limited therefore direct co mparisons with TACE could not be made for this population. There was wide variability in the patient inclusion criteria for the studies, with some including patients without any extra-hepatic spread and some that included patients with minimal spread and with or wi thout the presence of PVT. For this reason, strict comparisons with TACE and between speci fic patient populations are difficult. Of importance is the fact that many of the patients included in the studies would not be candidates, or have failed, other first-line tr eatment options like TACE (i.e. patients with PVT). Thus, that median survival times are sim ilar to those of intermediate staged patients Transarterial Radioembolization for for Hepatic Neoplasia Center for Health and Policy Studies, University of Calgary, October 2010 68 receiving TACE, would suggest a degree of e fficacy in a patient population without many treatment options. Median survival times of advan ced staged patients receiving sorafenib, are reported to be between 6.5 and 10.7 months69, 94. It would appear that TARE could increase efficacy, in terms of median survival times, over standard of care in this population but without individual data for advanced staged patients receiving TARE comparisons could not be made. Median survival time for CRCLM patients receiving TARE was found to be 41.4 weeks or 9.5 months. The median survival time fo r first-line, standard of care, chemotherapy regimens (i.e. FOLFOX6/FOLFIRI) are in excess of 20 months 66. Thus it would appear, in terms of survival benefit, that TARE would not represent a treatment option with increased efficacy over standard of care. However, the vast majority of patients in the included studies had failed all other first-line chemotherapies and were therefore considered chemo-refractory patients. Median survival times in excess of 6 months are a significant improvement for chemo-refractory patients with relatively no other treatment options. In a recently published study, patients who had failed other chemotherapy regimens, but that were irinotecan naive, had TARE therapy in conjunction with irinotecan. Median survival time was reported at 12.2 months 39. Therefore, as has been clearly demonstrated with older chemotherapy regimens83, 89, 90, it is likely that TARE in conjunction with newer chemotherapy regimens could demonstrate increased survival times. Clinical trials are currently underway to investigate this. It should also be noted that in some of the included studies, in all of our survival analyses, patien ts received systemic or regional chemotherapy (with older regimens) in conjunction with or after TARE 25, 34. Transarterial for for Hepatic Neoplasia Center for Health and Policy Studies, University of Calgary, October 2010 69 Summary Survival Rates Overall six, 12 and 24 month summary survival rates (i.e. for both HCC and CRCLM) were 73, 46 and 20% respectively. Summary survival rate is the mean survival rate as estimated from the Kaplan-Meier survival curve of each included study. For overall summary survival rates see Figures 2, 3 and 4. Summary survival rates for HCC were 75, 51 and 24 % at six, 12 and 24 months respectively (see Figures 5, 6, and 7). Survival rates for CRCLM were 70, 39 and 10% at six, 12 and 24 months respectively (see Figures 5, 6 and 7). Significant heterogeneity existed in both canc er groups at six and 24 months, but no heterogeneity existed at 12 months. With respect to HCC, survival rates of 51 % at 12 months and 24% at 24 months are below those recently reported for intermediate TACE patients at Foothills Medical Center. Specifically, rates of 68.4% and 41.4% were repor ted at 12 and 24 months, respectively, rates that are in line with published data on TACE. However, because TARE studies included patients with BCLC stage C disease direct comparisons to TACE are difficult as typically these patients are excluded from TACE treatment. Based on the analysis, it was observed that the largest HCC cohort publication examining the use of TARE, by Salem and colleagues (2010) 33, was clearly representative of the larger sample in terms of survival rates. Because of this, and due to the fact that the authors performed very specific and comprehensive sub-analyses, it was decided that BCLC stage B patient survival rate data from this study would provide the best comparison for TACE. In this study, BCLC stage B patients had 12 and 24 month survival rates of 65% and 40% respectively, rates that are nearly identical to BCLC stage B patients receiving TACE at Foothills Medical Center 93 (i.e 68.4% and 41.4%). for Hepatic Neoplasia Center for Health and Policy Studies, University of Calgary, October 2010 70 In the two phase III RCTs examining the use of sorafenib in advanced HCC patients69, 94, one study reported the six month survival rate at 53%57 and the other reported a 12 month survival rate of 44%58. The overall survival rate from our analyses were above both of these, but again due to the differences in inclusion criteria a direct comparison of survival rates between TARE and sorafenib cannot be made. Six, 12 and 24 month survival rates of CRCLM patients were 70, 39 and 10% respectively. These rates are well below those of published rates on the use of FOLFOX6/FOLFIRI chemotherapy regimens. As noted with the median survival time analyses, because many of the patients that received TARE were chemo-refractory patients, direct comparisons with published FOLFOX6/FO LFIRI rates are not appropriate. Clinical trials examining the use of TARE in conjunction with these regimens are now underway. Initial phase I data, on the concurrent administration of TARE and oxaliplatin or irinotecan, would suggest that the combined treatment will provide significant clinical benefits 39, 86. Radiological Response Overall summary response rate was 42.8% fo r the ten included studies. For overall summary response rates see Figure 8. Of note, an overall response rate for one paper with HCC patients could not be retrieved33. It was therefore decided to include a subset of the reported cohort, and only BCLC stage B patients, as was done for the median survival analysis. For CRCLM papers, one included study reported responses at the lesional rather than patient level 38 and, as noted with the other analyses, some patients received systemic or regional chemotherapy in conjunction with or after TARE34, 37, 39. Transarterial Radioembolization for for Hepatic Neoplasia Center for Health and Policy Studies, University of Calgary, October 2010 71 HCC patients had an average response rate of 40.5% in the three studies included in the analysis (see Figure 9). There was significant heterogeneity, and as all studies used WHO, response criteria could not account for it. There was wide variability in the three studies with one paper reporting only a 21% response rate 23 and another reporting a 51% response rate33. The study reporting a 51% response rate was the same study in which only BCLC stage B patients were included in the analysis an d therefore could represent a cohort with less advanced disease 33. When making direct comparisons, data from the University of Alberta Hospital shows its experience with TARE, thus far (n=21), has resulted in a response rate of 52% in patients with both BCLC stage B and C disease. Thus it would appear that response rates of approximately 50% could be expected in intermediate staged patients receiving TARE. A recent meta-analysis of TACE reported that a median response rate of 38% was observed in 34 studies using WHO criteria 62. In the two phase III RCTs examining the use of sorafenib in HCC response rates of 3.3% and 2% with RECIST criteria were reported69, 94. In terms of radiological response, sorafenib is a disease stabilizer, with the ma jority of patients not showing progression or regression of lesions. TARE response rates are well above those observed with sorafenib, and although there is limited data for individual comparison in advanced stage patients, at the University of Alberta Hospital 55% of patients who obtained a response were BCLC stage C. The response rate for CRCLM patients was 43.6% in the seven included studies (See Figure 9). There was significant heterogeneity observed and a sensitivity analysis with WHO or RECIST criteria was performed. Using RE CIST criteria, an average response rate of Transarterial Radioembolization for for Hepatic Neoplasia Center for Health and Policy Studies, University of Calgary, October 2010 72 41.5% was reported with no heterogeneity observe d. With WHO criteria the response rate is 44.7% and heterogeneity was still observed. As some of the included studies had systemic or regional chemotherapy as concomitant or subsequent therapy, it is likely that treatment factors could account for the heterogeneity although this was not tested. In clinical trials of FOLFOX6 and FOLFIRI response rate s of ~55% have been reported 66. Of note, in two of the RCTs included in this report, that examin ed the use of TARE with older systemic or regional chemotherapy regimens, response rates of 44% and 72% were reported with RECIST criteria83, 89. Downstaging While survival and response data on the w hole may be the two most important and reported outcome measures, the ability of a trea tment to bridge or maintain a patient to curative treatment options also deserves ack nowledgement. Two important reasons for this exist. One reason being that patients with HCC are only conferred the UNOS priority status upgrade if they meet the Milan (T2) criteria. If a patient can be downstaged to T2 they gain a significant advantage in priority for a life saving liver transplant87. Another reason is that every year patients with HCC die, or are delis ted due to disease progression, while awaiting an organ. An intention-to-treat analysis of th e UNOS database suggests that this occurs in 18% of HCC patients awaiting liver transplantation95. If a therapy can maintain a patient's status, or increase the TTDP, it may increa se the time they are on transplant lists and essentially increase their chances for transplant . Although downstaging rates are very small, and some would argue insignificant, there is some evidence to suggest that TARE may be more effective than TACE in downstaging a subgroup of patients to resection and transplantation. Specifically, a recent study examined the ability of TACE or TARE to Transarterial for Hepatic Neoplasia Center for Health and Policy Studies, University of Calgary, October 2010 73 downstage Milan T3 patients to T2 status87. Forty three T3 patients, with no significant differences in any pre-treatment patient charac teristics, including tumour size, Child-Pugh, BCLC stage tumour were trea ted with each therapy (TACE and TARE) and downstaging and TTPD evaluated. It was found that 37% of TACE and 61% of TARE patients obtained a WHO PR. It was also fo und that T2 stage was obtained in 31% of TACE patients and 58% of TARE patients. Additionally, 23% of TACE patients and 42% or TARE patients were downstaged to RFA. In terms of TTDP, the median time to UNOS progression was 18.2 months for TACE and 33 . 3 months for TARE. These data suggest that, in T3 patients, TARE may me more effective than TACE in terms of downstaging and TTDP. When evaluating these results with respect to the Alberta context, based on University of Alberta transplant program data , 20 patients with HCC died or were removed from the transplant list between 2005 and 2009. Of note, 17 of these patients were delisted due to disease progression and could represent a select group suitable for TARE maintenance. Tumour Marker Tumour marker response data are sparsely reported throughout the literature. AFP (for HCC) and CEA (for CRCLM) are the two most commonly reported markers, and a variety of methods for reporting them after TARE exist. Commonly, measures of these tumour markers are taken at baseline (measurem ent is standard to the pre-treatment work up) and then post treatment levels are expressed as a percentage of baseline levels. Tumour marker data, generally, parallels the radiol ogical response data with responses or non- responses being observed in both measures. Importa ntly though, it is highly variable on the patient level; some patients will see dramat ic and significant reductions in AFP or CEA Transarterial Radioembolization for the for Hepatic Neoplasia Center for Health and Policy Studies, University of Calgary, October 2010 74 accompanying a robust radiological response, while others will experience a significant reduction in tumour markers without an accomp anying radiological response. Some reports suggest that tumour marker data may be a be tter early predictor (<3months) of response to treatment with radiological data bet ter predicting later response (>3months)34. Quality of Life Only one study was identified that evaluated quality of life in TARE36. In this study, 28 patients diagnosed with HCC who were abou t to receive TACE or TARE were followed for one year. HRQL assessments were administered at baseline, three months, and six months. None of the pre-treatment patient characteristics, identified for analysis, were significantly different between the groups (i.e . gender, ethnicity, bilirubin, albumin, INR, AFP, Child's Pugh etc.). At three months, patients treated with TARE reported a significantly higher score on both measures of functional well-being and overall health-related quality of life than patients treated with TACE ( p < 0.001). At six months, only functional well-being was still significantly higher for the TARE group ( p < 0.04). The authors of this study attributed number of tr eatments as one possible factor contributing to the higher scores of TARE patients. Specifically, as TARE patients had on average one or two treatments in the firsts six months, TACE patients had on average three or four treatments in this same time frame. This difference in number of treatments also was a limitation, as patients receiving TARE would be assessed at a longer post-treatment time than TACE patients (i.e. time elapsed betwe en last treatment and HRQL assessment). mNET patients Two studies examining the use of TARE in mNET patients were included54, 96. In one 34 patients with unresectable mNETs of the liver were administered TARE in for Hepatic Neoplasia Center for Health and Policy Studies, University of Calgary, October 2010 75 conjunction with a seven day infusion of 5-FU chemotherapy62. Patients had failed resection (29%), majority had extra-hepatic meta stases (59%). Fifty percent of patients had a RECIST response (C R + PR) post-treatment. Median survival was not reached by time of publication; however 59% of the cohort was still alive 37 months after treatment. Three gastric ulcerations an d one early death from liver dysfunction were reported62. In another study, 42 patients with mNETs of the liver, who had failed all other treatment options, were administered TARE with either SIR-Spheres or TheraSpheres11. Patients had a RECIST response rate (CR + PR) of 50% in the SIR-Sphere group and 54% in the TheraSpheres group. Median survival times were not available at the time of publication, but the projected times were 28 months for the SIR-Sphere group and 22 months for the TheraSpheres group (a non-significant difference). Overall, these two studies, and a subsequent retrospective review on TARE for mNET of the liver 97, suggest that TARE is effective and well tolerated in this population. Summay of Effectiveness Evidence Evidence from cohort studies suggests the use of TARE in non-resectable, HCC patients is effective. Patients receiving TARE have demonstrated significant, radiological response and quality of life benefits, as a result of treatment, without significant additions to toxicity and safety profiles. TAREs effective ness compared to standard of care for intermediate (i.e TACE) and advanced staged pati ents (i.e. Sorafenib) is less clear. Overall survival rates for patients treated with TARE at 12 and 24 months are below those of TACE, likely because more advanced patien ts are candidates for TARE. However, the median survival times of BCLC stage B patients receiving TARE are similar to those Transarterial Radioembolization for for Hepatic Neoplasia Center for Health and Policy Studies, University of Calgary, October 2010 76 reported for the same group of patients receiving TACE. Radiological response rates of BCLC stage B patients receiving TARE are re ported around 50% which is higher than the 38% rate published in a recent meta-analysis of TACE62. On measures of survival and radiological response it appears patient inclusi on criteria largely determines effectiveness. Importantly, TARE has demonstrated effective ness in treating patients with PVT, a contraindication for treatment with TACE, and in patients that have failed or who are not candidates for TACE. Additionally, there is preliminary evidence to suggest that TARE may be more effective than TACE in downstaging to, as well as maintaining patients at, UNOS T2 stage for transplantation. At present, ba sed on cohort studies, evidence suggests TARE is similar to TACE in terms of effectiveness in BCLC stage B patients. With respect to TAREs effectiveness for advanced staged patients, evidence would suggest that overall survival times and radiol ogical responses are higher than those of sorafenib. However, radiologic criteria such as WHO and RECIST have been criticized for assessing response to targeted therapies such as Sorafenib as necrosis without change in size of lesion can reflect response. Newer modified criteria such as EASL and mRECIST have been introduced to help with this limitation bu t are rarely reported in the literature. Issues of patient inclusion criteria, in the included cohort studies, preclude any strict conclusion on TAREs effectiveness over sorafenib for trea tment of advanced HCC patients. However, it should be noted that based on data from the University of Alberta hospital's experience with TARE, six of 11 (55%) patients who experien ced a radiological response were BCLC stage C patients. Sorafenib has an average response rate of 3% in BCLC stage C patients 69, 94. Transarterial for Hepatic Neoplasia Center for Health and Policy Studies, University of Calgary, October 2010 77 Evidence from cohort studies suggests the use of TARE in non-resectable CRCLM patients is effective. Patients receiving TARE have demonstrated significant survival benefits and radiological responses, as a result of treatm ent, without significant additions to toxicity and safety profiles. TARE is not as eff ective as FOLFOX6/FO LFIRI chemotherapy regimens (i.e. standard of care for CRCLM patients). However, in chemo-refractory patients TARE is very effective and one of very few tr eatment options available. TARE can also be safely and effectively combined with the older chemo-therapy regimen of 5-FU/LV. Clinical trials currently underway will shed light on the safety and efficacy of concurrent TARE and FOLFOX6/FOLFIRI therapy, preliminary eviden ce would suggest a significant benefit of the combined therapy on both patien t survival and radiological response39, 86. In the two studies included in this report, TARE has demonstrated that it is safe and effective for use in mNET patients that have failed other standard of care therapies54, 96. Specifically, significant radiological responses were seen in both studies and survival times were much longer than previously reported for similar patients. Significant gaps in the evidence existed with respect to all outcome me asures, highlighting the need for further investigations. The role of TARE for treatm ent in non-resectable mNET patients is unclear at this point. 5.3.3. Comparative Benefits and Risks With respect to safety, evidence suggests that when proper patient selection a nd pre- treatment work up is performed TARE is as sa fe as comparable treatments for intermediate and advanced staged patients with hepatic neoplasia. With respect to HCC patients and TACE, it appears that one of the safety benefits of TARE is the low rate of post- Transarterial for Hepatic Neoplasia Center for Health and Policy Studies, University of Calgary, October 2010 78 embolization syndrome and the avoidance of side effects associated with chemotherapy in general. This low rate translates into higher pati ent satisfaction and is one of the reasons that TARE can be performed as an outpatient procedure. Additionally, the rate of peri-procedure mortality is lower with TARE (<1%)18 compared to TACE (2.4%)62. The major risk of TARE compared to TACE is the inadvertent de livery of microspheres to other organs that can occur. With proper pre-treatment work up and a multidisciplinary team involved in patient selection this risk is minimized. TARE can also be safely administered to patients with PVT and who have had prior TACE failure. Another benefit of TARE is that it can be administered repetitively without significant risk of radiation hepatitis in patients with good underlying liver function. With respect to CRCLM, it appears that TARE has a similar safety profile to alternative chemotherapies. Risks of comb ination therapy (TARE + FOLFOX6/FOLFIRI) have yet to be determined. Benefits of TARE therapy for chemo-refractory patients cannot be understated for a patient population where relatively no other treatment options exist, and average survival times are 3-6 months. TARE appears to be safe and effective for mNET patients as well, but with limited data at this point addressing appropriateness of use in this patient population is difficult. 5.4. Delivery Context 5.4.1. Delivery Considerations Most requirements for delivery of TARE in Alberta are already in place. This is a procedure that has very specific technical skill requirements, all of which an interventional radiologist is capable, but that must be learned and perfected before treatment can occur. Transarterial Radioembolization for the for Hepatic Neoplasia Center for Health and Policy Studies, University of Calgary, October 2010 79 MDS Nordion offers physician training to any center that is considering TARE with TheraSpheres. Training consists of didactic lectur es covering the entire spectrum of treating patients with TheraSpheres, including patien t selection, dosimetry, infusion techniques, clinical considerations, and radiation safety issues. Relatively no patient education issues are id entified in the literature. As radiation levels are low enough for this procedure to be performed as an outpatient procedure, issues for patients are related to adverse events. Pa tients are briefed before being discharged on possible side effects and events to be aware of , most events resolve themselves 4-7 days post treatment (i.e. fatigue, chills, nausea etc.). 5.4.2. Related procedures All technologies required for TARE are currently in use for interventional procedures in both Calgary and Edmonton. In addition to the items supplied from the manufacturer as part of the administration ki t, a Nalgene container and a Nalgene acrylic shield are required as well as two different radi ation detectors capable of detecting radiation levels less than 0.1mR/h. These items are require d for radiation safety of staff and to ensure that staff leaving the interventional suit are not contaminated98. Due to the fact that TARE is performed as an outpatient procedure and there is the risk of inadvertent delivery of microspheres to the gastrointestinal tract or stomach, antiulcer medications are given at the time of discha rge to minimize gastric irritation. Unless complications arise, patients should be seen two weeks after TARE treatment. This visit is highly recommended as it provides the treating physician with a clinical assessment and rapid learning curve of the patients' tolerance to therapy98. This visit allows monitoring of adverse Transarterial Radioembolization for for Hepatic Neoplasia Center for Health and Policy Studies, University of Calgary, October 2010 80 sequelae and allows confirmation that the patien ts ECOG score has not deteriorated. If the patient tolerates the first treatment well, they can be considered for further treatment if required (i.e. bilobar tumours). Lab tests within the two week period following treatment should be left to the discretion of the trea ting physician. Thirty days post-treatment follow up assessment must be done. Assessment of response and overall clinical status must be evaluated at this time. Liver function tests, CT scans, and a complete blood count with differential must be performed. Furthe r MR or PET imaging may be helpful 98. 5.4.3. Implementation Considerations It appears that in terms of safety and efficacy, results reported throughout the literature on the use of TARE can be generalized to Alberta. This is most evident when comparing published results to those of the University of Alberta Hospital's initial experience with TARE. Response rates, median survival, and patient demographics seem to parallel published values. Additionally, as TACE outcomes reported at the Foothills Medical Center are in line with published values, comparisons between TARE and TACE made in the literature should remain appropriate in the Al berta context. It ther efore is assumed that TARE could safely and effectively be implem ented in Alberta. Major issues related to implementation, at present, are proper pati ent selection, formation/maintenance of a multidisciplinary medical team for patient care and provision based on appropriate patient population.

Literature Review Findings A brief review by the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH)17 in 2007 noted the cost of TheraSpheres 90Y technology in the United States was $13,000 ($14,592 CAN in 2010 dollars) . The cost was for the technology alone, and not inclusive of treatment administration costs such as CT or MRIs, and not inclusive of follow- up costs. Costs were confirmed via pe rsonal correspondence with the companies. In 2005, an economic analysis of TARE, using SIR-Spheres, in non-resectable liver tumours was completed in Australia for MSAC18. From the analyses, the incremental cost- effectiveness per life year gained of using SIR-Spheres plus FOLFOX6/FOLFIRI, compared to FOLFOX6/FOLFIRI alone, was between $8,009 and $33,961for the base cases ($7,857 and $33,314 CAN in 2010 dollars), implying that adding the SIR-spheres, in the base cases, would be cost effective to th e $50,000 baseline level. Recommendations for public funding were not made, as more safety and efficacy data would be needed, especially for combining these new chemotherapeutics with TARE. In 2008, an economic analysis of sorafenib for treatment of HCC was completed in Canada99. From the analyses, an incremental cost-effectiveness per life year gained of using sorafenib versus best support care (palliati ve care) was $75,759 ($82,575 CAN in 2010 dollars), implying that sorafenib increased life expectancy but would be cost effective only when a baseline level of $100,000 is used. Overall, no specific study of the cost-eff ectiveness of TARE was found. The MSAC report concluded that it could be cost effecti ve, in baseline cases, to the $50,000 level. Transarterial for for Hepatic Neoplasia Center for Health and Policy Studies, University of Calgary, October 2010 82 Compared to palliative care, sorafenib was not found to be cost effective to the $50,000 level. 6.2. Economic Analysis 6.2.1. Approach and Unit Costs The economic analysis is a cost-effectiveness study. Cost-effectiveness ratios compare the costs and effectiveness of two different treatm ents. Three different comparisons were made: one comparing TACE with TARE for BCLC stage B patients with HCC, one comparing TARE with sorafenib for BCLC stage C patients with HCC, and one comparing TARE with palliative care for patients with CRCLM. A Markov model was designed to account for variations that may be seen in the parameters that make up the cost-effectiveness calculations. The effectiveness measure is median survival time, in years, of each treatment. Median survival was selected as the best indicator of treatment effectiveness as it is th e most standardized metric between treatment alternatives. Median survival times from first treatment are given in Table 7a. Median survival times for each treatment were taken eith er from previous clinical studies, the meta- analyses performed in this report or were Al berta specific data obtained from clinical experts, and are summarized in the table. When survival times were taken from previous clinical studies, studies with the largest sample size (i.e. highest level of power) or the highest level of evidence (i.e. RCT) were selected. Me dian survival times obtained from the meta- analyses performed in the present report were used based on similar logic. Alberta specific data on the use of TACE and TA RE were obtained from a clinical expert in the field and an EAG member respectively and were used as indicators of current practice in the province. Transarterial Radioembolization for the for Hepatic Neoplasia Center for Health and Policy Studies, University of Calgary, October 2010 83 For BCLC stage B patients, it was assumed that TACE survival is 15.8 months93 and that TARE survival was 17.2 months33. For BCLC stage C patients, it was assumed that TARE survival could either be 7.333 or 11100 months, and sorafenib survival was 10.764 months. For CRCLM, it was assumed that me dian TARE survival is 9.53 months (value taken from meta-analysis), and pa lliative care survival is 6 months101. The costs are a sum of pre-treatment procedures, which are incurre d only once, the treatment itself, and post- treatment procedures, the latter two of which are incurred every time a treatment takes place. The number of treatments was determined by consulting an EAG member and by using values reported in the highest level of published evidence. A list of costs and the units used in each stage of treatment are given in Table 7a and 7b, with issues for costs noted below. There is imprecision in the costing data, due to the variety of sources used, prices that change year-to-year, and the unavailability of deta iled costing data in Alberta. As a result, a random cost was selected for each simulati on, as determined from a gamma distribution, with the parameters listed in Table 7b. This allows for a range in which a cost was chosen during each simulation (accounting for uncertain ty in the precise cost), as will be noted below. This range, when averaged over many simulations, will allow an accurate middle estimate to be calculated for costs. The clinical pathway for pre-treatment, treatment, and post-treatment are cited in Table 7a. The care pathways were identified by consultation with a clinical expert in the field, an EAG member for this report and the Alberta Clinical Practice Guidelines for the included diagnoses. There are some differe nces in the procedures required in each treatment, as noted in Table 7a. In pre-tr eatment, TARE requires an angiogram in for Hepatic Neoplasia Center for Health and Policy Studies, University of Calgary, October 2010 84 patients and a CT-angiogram in some patients, to allow for diagnosis of lung and other organ shunting. This is in addition to an in itial physician consult, full blood test, liver function test, nuclear scan, and a CT scan, which is also completed with TACE, sorafenib (without the nuclear scan), and in palliative treatment (without the nuclear scan) for CRCLM. In treatment, TACE requires, on average, four in-hospital days of treatment and one dose of chemotherapy. TARE require s one TheraSpheres administration and one outpatient hospital day bed stay. Both require liver imaging and an angiogram to be done at time of treatment. Sorafenib involves taki ng four 200mg tablets daily, with a physician consult each month. One sensitivity test ru n with TACE is with treatment done by DC Beads, instead of regular chemotherapy, which does not require embolic particles. Post- treatment, all treatments require a physician c onsult. TACE and TARE require a blood test, a nuclear scan, and a CT scan post-treatment, while sorafenib includes all of those items except the nuclear scan. Additional usage of hospital resources is noted in section 6.2.2. These resources being increased inpatient or outpatient stays resulting from adverse events. From these, incremental effectiveness and incremental costs - the differences between the treatments - were calculated, wi th a cost per life year gained being the incremental costs divided by the incremental e ffectiveness. This was done by drawing a sample cost from each distribution, and then calculating average costs for a sample of 100 individuals. Each individual was assigned a random, uniform draw to determine whether they will suffer (and incur costs for) an adverse event, which could be minor or major, or whether they die during treatment, in which case no further costs would be incurred. A uniform draw also was made to determine the ex act number of treatments - whether it is a Transarterial Radioembolization for the for Hepatic Neoplasia Center for Health and Policy Studies, University of Calgary, October 2010 85 half unit above, or below, the mean number of treatments given in Table 7a (i.e. if 2.5 treatments is listed, then the uniform draw woul d determine if the individual received 2 or 3 treatments). Another sample of costs was then drawn from each distribution, with average costs calculated for a sample of 100 individuals. This was repeated 100 times, with an overall average cost calculated. This was done for each regimen, inclusive of pre-treatment, treatment, and post-treatment, with the ec onomic results given in Table 8. Results are discussed in Section 6.2.4. Costs are in current Canadian dollars. No discounting was used, as the duration of usage of these therapies is less than two years , as determined by life expectancy values, and forecasting of costs into the future is not attempted. Costs were measured as incurred from the perspective of the Alberta healthcare system, and do not include societal costs such as lost work wages, or out-of-pocket costs incu rred by individuals. The quality of life of patients was not explicitly measured or accounted for in the analysis, which is a caution that must be taken when considering the results. Qu ality of life for patients using sorafenib or TARE has not been explicitly noted in previous studies. To determine quality of life information would require further studies, such as an RCT. However, TARE is intended to produce higher quality of life for patients with BCLC stage B and stage C non-resectable tumours. This will only be partly accounted for by a smaller chance of a serious adverse event, with the concurrent costs to the system, occurring. 6.2.2. Costs of Services Avoided In this analysis, it is assumed that TARE is not going to be used as a complementary treatment to the alternatives of TACE (for BCLC st age B patients) or sorafenib (for for Hepatic Neoplasia Center for Health and Policy Studies, University of Calgary, October 2010 86 stage C patients). TARE will instead repla ce initial TACE or sorafenib treatments. A downgrade or upgrade in the type of tumour may result in future TACE or sorafenib treatments, but will not be tracked here. As a result, a patient who receives TARE does not incur the costs of the alternative treatment. The entire cost should not be considered, as it is already being incurred either for TACE or sora fenib. Hence, incremental costs will be used in the budgetary impact below. TARE, as noted in Table 7a, has a smalle r likelihood of serious and minor adverse events occurring. A serious adverse event would be an event, such as a severe bleeding event, which incurs an in-hospital visit which la sts multiple days. A mean cost of $5,000 was given for these events, with a gamma distribution applied to the cost estimate, meaning higher and lower costs could be incurred. A mi nor adverse event would be an event, such as post embolization syndrome, which incurs a day-vi sit to a hospital. A mean cost of $500 was given for these events, with a gamma distribution applied to this cost estimate. These costs were used to estimate the resource usage from th e different degrees of severity from adverse events. TARE has a lower likelihood of adverse events compared to TACE or sorafenib usage. This results in lower post-treatment hospital utilization, and hence lower overall system costs. 6.2.3. Demand Estimates Based on the CADTH report, 820 primary liver cancer cases were noted in Canada in 2003. Assuming Alberta has approximately 10% of the population in Canada, using a non age-weighted average implies approximately 82 cases in Alberta. Based on Alberta in- hospital claims, in 2008 there were 103 cases of in-hospital visits due to primary malignant Transarterial Radioembolization for for Hepatic Neoplasia Center for Health and Policy Studies, University of Calgary, October 2010 87 neoplasms of the liver (ICD-10 code: C22.x) and 232 cases due to secondary malignant neoplasms of the liver (ICD-10 code: C78.7) . The demand estimates used in the budget impact analyses are a percentage of the total patients recorded in the in-hospital claims. This is due to the fact that all BCLC stages are in cluded within the diagnosis codes and many will be candidates for treatments other than those examined in the present report. Hence, in the budget impact estimates we included three diffe rent scenarios representing four possible levels of demand for TARE in Alberta. Levels of demand were estimated based on discussion with an EAG member and a clinical ex pert in the field. For the results of the budget impact analysis see Table 10. Table 10 calculated the additional costs of using the entire TARE protocol compared to other, currently used treatments (TACE with chemotherapy, TACE with DC beads, sorafenib or palliative care) for four different patient population estimates of 10, 20, 30 and 82 patien ts. Incremental cost differences are noted for each treatment, and the incremental cost multiplied by the number of patients gives the total budget impact. The total budget impact is discussed in Section 6.2.4. 6.2.4. Results of Economic Evaluation The results of the economic evaluation are given in Table 8. The average costs are determined from 100 simulations, each with 100 patients given a set of costs derived from the gamma distribution of each cost variable. The simulations were run in Matlab 7.8 (The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA). Table 8 give s the average cost of a specific treatment (TACE with basic chemotherapy, TACE with DC beads, sorafenib and palliative care) and the life years gained from treatment, includin g pre-treatment, treatment and post-treatment costs. The mean number of treatments is listed in Table 7.a., and is incorporated into the Transarterial Radioembolization for for Hepatic Neoplasia Center for Health and Policy Studies, University of Calgary, October 2010 88 cost. All the treatments listed above are co mpared with the proposed new treatment, TARE. The incremental changes (in costs and life years gained) from using TARE compared to the current specific treatment ar e given with incremental costs divided by incremental life years gained. This results in a cost per life year gained estimate. This is the cost effectiveness measure of using TARE compared to the current, standard treatment. For the average course of ther apy (2.5 treatments of TACE62, 1.5 of TARE100, 5.5 months of sorafenib64, and 6 months of palliative treatment), the healthcare system costs are $41,720 for TACE chemot $5,221 for pall iative treatment. TARE resulted in a gain in life expectancy of .116 years compared to TACE for BCLC stage B patients, while sorafenib resulted in a gain in life expectancy of .284 years compared to TARE for BCLC stage C patients. For CRCLM, TARE resulted in an increase of .296 years of life expectancy. By calculating the differences in both co st and life years gained (effectiveness) between the standard treatment and TARE, incremental cost-effectiveness estimates can be calculated. Cost-effectiveness ratios represent system costs required, on average, to extend life by one year. These estimates show that moving from TACE with chemotherapy to TARE resulted in a cost per life year gained of $117,328 for BCLC stage B patients. TACE with DC beads to TARE resulted in a cost per life year of $118,078 for BCLC stage B patients. Sorafenib is less costly and more effective than TARE for BCLC stage C patients. For CRCLM, moving from palliative treatmen t to TARE resulted in a cost per life year gained of $169,287. These estimates do not me et the range of $50,000 to $100,000 that is generally accepted as a cost effective switch in treatments 102. Transarterial Radioembolization for the for Hepatic Neoplasia Center for Health and Policy Studies, University of Calgary, October 2010 89 Several sensitivity estimates were calculated . These sensitivity analyses help to emphasize which costs are directly related to the treatment, as opposed to the course of the disease. This is accounted for in a sensitivity analysis that eliminates the possibility of death. This, especially in BCLC stage C patients, would not be a side-effect of treatment, but caused directly by the disease. Assuming all patients complete their treatment in full, the revised costs are given in Table 9. Overall results do not vary significantly from the baseline results in Table 8, as the incremental costs d ecrease only slightly. The cost per life years gained for moving to TARE from current stan dard treatments remained above $100,000 per year gained, with the lowest estimate occurring if TARE was used instead of TACE with basic chemotherapy, which has an additional cost per life year gained of $107,319. An additional sensitivity analysis was done on the life years gained assumption for TARE in BCLC stage C patients compared to sorafeni b. Assumption 1 uses .608 life years gained, which was based off a small-sample study 33. Assumption 2 uses a higher estimate of life years gained of .916 and is an Alberta specific estimate that was obtained from an EAG member that performs the treatment in the provin ce. Using the original analysis in Table 8, however, the cost-effectiveness ratio is well a bove $100,000 - a gain of approximately 1.2 weeks when using TARE compared to sorafenib ca me at an additional cost of approximately $17,000. This resulted in a cost per life years gained of approximately $713,000 when switching to TARE (with the increased life exp ectancy assumption) compared to sorafenib. Another simulation completed was to omit the post-treatment nuclear scan for patients whom received TARE. This simulation was a dded after an EAG member commented that post-treatment nuclear scans were not always competed. Although REBOC Transarterial for for Hepatic Neoplasia Center for Health and Policy Studies, University of Calgary, October 2010 90 recommendations, as noted in previous sections, state that post-nuclear scans should be included incorporated into best practice78. In this case, the average cost was reduced to $53,688. This did not change the incremen tal cost-effectiveness results between TARE and the other treatments for both BCLC stage B an d C patients, as all ratios remained above $100,000, which is above the generally accepted threshold. The overall budget impact is given in Table 10. These costs are the additional costs of receiving TARE compared to the previous tr eatments for a set number of patients noted in each row. Sensitivity results here include different estimates of patient populations. The AHW total estimates are assumed to be an ov erestimate, since they in clude all BCLC stage patients, not specifically those in BCLC B and C stages. Hence, comparisons are made given a patient population of 10, 20 and 30 per year. As a conservative baseline, the CADTH estimates for Alberta (with 82 patients per year) are also given for HCC patients. The estimates allow for budget impact estimates to be calculated, with varying percentages of the yearly estimated patient population switching to TARE from standard of care (i.e from TACE or sorafenib for HCC, and palliative care for CRCLM). These show that, using the CADTH estimates for patient population, the budget impact of shifting to TARE from current standards of care for HCC would range from approximately $1,100,000 to $1,400,000 (from using TACE and sorafenib, respectively, to using TARE). Assuming a lower estimate of ten HCC patients switching to TARE treatment, the range for budget impact decreases to $136,000 to $171,000 pe r year. When comparing palliative care to TARE, additional cost estimates range from $5 01,000 if ten new patients use TARE, to $1,500,000 if thirty new patients use TARE for CRCLM. At this point determining the actual Transarterial for for Hepatic Neoplasia Center for Health and Policy Studies, University of Calgary, October 2010 91 level of demand is not appropriate, but after consultation with clinical experts and an member of the EAG it is unlikely that demand would be higher than 20-30 per year total for treatment with TARE (i.e. both HCC and CRCLM patients). Overall, the additional life years gained from using TARE compared to current standard treatments is relatively small - rang ing from .024 years (approximately 9 days) to .116 years (42 days) for HCC, and .296 years (108 days) for CRCLM treatment. These small changes result in high incremental cost effectiveness estimates for switching to TARE. These estimates are above the generally accepted threshold of $50,000 per life year gained, and are in fact above $100,000, which is the upper bound in most cost-effectiveness acceptability ranges 102. Future technologies and changes in the patient population will have an impact on the analysis, and are not included in this analysis. Survival data, especially when looking at BCLC stage C patients with TARE is highly preliminary, as few patients with this extent of disease have received the treatment, and subj ect to change. Data on CRCLM and the use of TARE with concomitant chemotherapy is also extremely preliminary, as newer agents are just beginning to be investigated in conjunction with TARE, and could potentially change the results of the analysis. If the life years gained estimate increases, this will increase the chance of TARE with concomitant chemothera py becoming cost-effective. The quality of life of patients suffering from these inoperable tumours is also a factor not accounted for in the present analysis and deserves consideration. By focusing on system costs in the analysis, societal costs, such as lost caregiver wages, and the living standards of patients, are not considered. Transarterial Radioembolization for the for Hepatic Neoplasia Center for Health and Policy Studies, University of Calgary, October 2010 92 7. Discussion 7.1. Assessment Limitations One overarching limitation of this report, and of the literature on TARE to date, is the lack of standardized reporting in outcome measures and patient selection criteria. As such, with respect to outcome measures, we chose to focus on survival data as this measure is concrete and provides measurable endpoi nts. With respect to all the other outcome measures identified in this report, the lack of standard radiological response criteria, the lack of standardized follow up and reporting times, and the lack of quality of life assessments all prove problematic for the generalization of results. The development of the RECIST criteria for radiological response evalua tion in 2002 will hopefully reduce variability associated with response reporting. As for th e time that elapses between treatment and assessment of various outcome measures it will be up to the clinical community and societies to develop and enforce standardized timelines. This is most apparent in the present study when measuring the time to radiological response. For example, some studies report responses at three months, others at eight months and others do not report time to follow up at all, or only report median time to re sponse. These differences in time to response reporting are major sources of heterogeneity an d make the evaluation of efficacy difficult. The high variability in patient inclusion criteria used in the studies reviewed is also a limitation. As underlying liver function, exten t of disease spread, portal vein involvement, size and multifocality of tumours and a host of other variations in patient characteristics are inherent with this population, it is difficult to generalize results across studies. While some studies do a good job of subgroup analysis and reporting, others do not. At this point, Transarterial Radioembolization for the for Hepatic Neoplasia Center for Health and Policy Studies, University of Calgary, October 2010 93 preliminary evidence would suggest that TARE is more appropriate for some patients than others (i.e. Child-Pugh A; patients with mi nimal cirrhosis), but until more data on how patient characteristics affect outcomes are av ailable conclusions can not be drawn. As with many new technologies, the la ck of prospective RCTs also proves problematic in the present report. It is anti cipated, and widely accepted, that phase III RCTs evaluating the efficacy of TARE compared to TACE and the other comparators for HCC and CRCLM are difficult to power and plan. This is primarily due to the fact that massive numbers of patients would be necessary to demonstrate significant differences in clinical outcome measures. Because of this, reliance on high quality prospective cohort studies and systematic reviews will have to be accepted by medical and healthcare providers. The last major limitation of the present report deals with the fast pace at which treatment options for hepatic neoplasia are being developed and introduced to the medical community. In some sense, pinpointing survival benefits and efficacy results of TARE and comparators is like trying to shoot a moving target. With no consensus reached on how and which drugs to include in TACE, and with the vast array of chemotherapy regimens and agents available for the treatment of CRCLM, trying to evaluate the appropriateness of TARE is difficult, especially with the above noted limitations factored in. 7.2. Evolving Developments A recent consensus statement to come out of the Multidisciplinary Treatment of Hepatocellular Carcinoma Conference suggests th at conventional TACE is likely to be phased out by newer drug-eluting microsphe re TACE (DEB-TACE). These drug-eluting microspheres would provide an embolization effect similar to the particles currently used in Transarterial Radioembolization for the for Hepatic Neoplasia Center for Health and Policy Studies, University of Calgary, October 2010 94 conventional TACE, while providing a sustained and controlled drug release. thus eliminating many of the acute e ffects of the chemotherapeutics63. Two types of drug-eluting spheres are currently manufactured. TACE with DEBs is being performed in Calgary at the Foothills Medical Center and University of Alberta Hospital in Edmonton; prospective data collection on their effectiveness is planned. Th e additional cost associated with DEB TACE would be approximately $1500 per treatment and likely would not result in significant changes in the cost-effectiveness analysis performed. Additionally, a variety of systemic therapies similar to sorafenib are being investigated in randomized trials. These anti-a ngiogenic agents may play a role in managing advanced hepatic neoplasia patients on thei r own, or intermediate stage patients in combination with TACE or TARE. The contributi on of these new agents to the standard of care for intermediate and advanced staged patients has yet to be determined. RCTs currently underway to examine the influence of TARE as a first-line, concomitant or salvage therapy are all underway . A major RCT set to be completed in 2016 will compare in four arms TARE, RFA, TACE and TACE followed by RFA. The results of this trial are thought to be paramount in determining TAREs role in managing patients with unresectable HCC. There are also trials curre ntly underway examining the use of TARE either alone or with Sorafenib compared to Sorafenib alone and will help distinguish TAREs role in advanced HCC. Similarly, a trial ex amining TARE + Sorafenib versus TARE alone for control of HCC as a bridge or downstaging option to transplant is also underway. For CRCLM patients trials examining the use of TARE with FOLFOX (SIRFLOX) and FOLFIRI (FOXFIRE) are now being conducted. Th ese trials will provide safety and efficacy Transarterial Radioembolization for the for Hepatic Neoplasia Center for Health and Policy Studies, University of Calgary, October 2010 95 data necessary for any conclusion on the appropriateness of use of TARE as a first line therapy in CRCLM patients. 7.3. Impacts on Alberta Health System Findings of the S and T components of th e report support the use of TARE in the Alberta health system for a select group of patients. TARE seems to be safe and effective in patients with HCC, CRCLM and mNET. Patients that have PVT, large tumours, good underlying liver function and less than 20% lung shunting are ideal candidates for this therapy in Alberta. The included meta-analysis reveals that survival benefits and radiological responses are seen in patients that would not ot herwise be candidates for standard therapies. The results of the report also suggest that presently TARE should not be used as a first line therapy in patients with CRCLM or mNET. Based on the economic evaluation, TARE is not cost effective in HCC or CRCLM when compared to TACE, Sorafenib or palliati ve care. It is however very important to acknowledge that the economic analysis is based on survival data from studies with heterogeneous patient inclusion criteria. Thus, the results should be interpreted with extreme caution, especially for comparisons of TARE to sorafenib in BCLC stage C HCC patients. The economic analysis would likely be substantially different with specific subgroup survival data for each BCLC stage and for patients failing or not candidates for TACE. At present, it appears that TARE would only be performed in Edmonton. Physician and staff training would have to occur before th e procedure could be offered in Calgary. It is anticipated that demand in Alberta would be approximately 20-30 patients a year. The Transarterial Radioembolization for for Hepatic Neoplasia Center for Health and Policy Studies, University of Calgary, October 2010 96 report also identified transplant waitlist maintenance and downstaging as possible areas for increased utilization of TARE; this was a ccounted for in the demand estimate. 7.4. Implications for Alberta The practical implications for Alberta are status quo. TARE is performed in Edmonton on a case by case basis for patients whom have failed all other standard therapies. The evidence suggests this is where TARE has a role and fills a gap in the spectrum of care. The economic analysis shows that a move from standard of care to TARE is not cost effective for HCC or CRCLM. Budget impact cons iderations appear more appropriate given the very small demand for the technology in Alberta. The use of TARE in HCC patients for transplant waitlist maintenance and downstaging deserves attention and is one area where a move from standard of care may be warranted. 8. Conclusions The incidence of HCC and CRCLM is rising worldwide and in Alberta. The vast majority of patients diagnosed with HCC, CRCLM or mNET are not candidates for curative therapies and face a poor prognosis with estima ted survival times generally under one year. TACE, sorafenib and chemotherapy regimens have been established as standard of care for these patients and have increased survival times. TARE is a new technology that has proven to be safe and effective for treating pati ents with unresectable liver metastases. The results of this report suggest that sur vival times of patients with intermediate stage HCC receiving TARE are similar to patients who receive TACE. Presently, there is not enough survival data to make conclusions on the survival of advanced staged HCC patients Transarterial Radioembolization for for Hepatic Neoplasia Center for Health and Policy Studies, University of Calgary, October 2010 97 receiving TARE compared to sorafenib therapy. TARE is effective in patients whom are not candidates for TACE. The safety of TARE for intermediate and advanced staged patients with HCC is similar to TACE and sorafenib therapy. From the healthcare systems' perspective, TARE is not cost effective when compared with TACE or sorafenib therapy. The cost-effectiveness of TARE compared to these standard therapies would likely change with specific sub group survival data. With respect to unresectable CRCLM patients, the survival time of patients who receive TARE is inferior to the survival time of patients who receive standard chemotherapy regimens. There is insufficient evidence to ev aluate the safety and efficacy of adding TARE to standard chemotherapy regimens, although preliminary evidence would suggest the concomitant therapy is safe and effective. TARE can safely be added to older chemotherapy regimens. TARE is safe and effective for ch emo-refractory patients. When compared to palliative care, TARE is not cost effective. TARE appears to be safe and effective in unresectable mNET patients who have failed or whom are not candidates for alternati ve therapies. A cost-effectiveness analysis of TARE for mNET patients could not be performed. Transarterial for Hepatic Neoplasia Center for Health and Policy Studies, University of Calgary, October 2010 98 9.
