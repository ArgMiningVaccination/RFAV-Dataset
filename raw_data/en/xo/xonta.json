This plan is based on input and feedback from Tribes, tribal organizations, urban Indian organizations, Indian Health Services, Montana Department of Health and Human Services (DPHHS) leaders, and other key stakeholders. As the leader for American Indian Health at DPHHS, my overarching goal is to empower American Indians to achieve better health outcomes. I am guided by DPHHS's commitment to tribal sovereignty and to providing leadership to decrease the health disparities that contribute to a nearly 20-year gap in life expectancy for American Indians in Montana, compared to all Montanans. Our commitment is grounded in DPHHS's mission to improve and protect the health, well-being, and self-reliance of all Montanans. My role is to assist DPHHS in identifying factors contributing to American Indian health disparities and to promote strategies DPHHS and its partners will pursue to address them. To achieve a reduction in health disparities among American Indians, DPHHS advocates for effective state and tribal health policy and resource allocation through increased tribal-state collaboration. We are committed to building mutually-respectful relationships by collaborating with tribal leaders, urban Indian organizations, other Indian organizations, state agencies, and additional key stakeholders. As we move forward with implementation of the strategic plan and building out an annual action plan, I am excited about what we will achieve together to improve the health of American Indians in Montana. My background: In October 2018, I was recruited to serve as the Director of American Indian Health. I am an enrolled member of the Fort Peck Tribe (Assiniboine/Sioux) and was born and raised in Great Falls, where I graduated from Great Falls High School. I attended Montana State University in Bozeman and graduated with a BA in Political Science. Upon graduation, I joined the National Tribal Employment Rights Office (TERO) in Seattle for four years before pursuing a career in healthcare. I worked as an Admission/Marketing Director at a skilled nursing facility for several years where I gained much of my nursing and healthcare experience while serving as a tribal liaison. I worked for the Muckleshoot Tribe of Indians starting in 2013 as the Director and co-founder of Washington's largest tribally-owned and operated in-home care agency. I bring over 20-years combined healthcare and tribal experience to DPHHS. In the work I engaged in this last year as Director of American Indian Health for Montana and in my previous work nationally, I continue to be inspired by Chief Crazy Horse's vision of our people rising up and coming together, respecting each other's differences, and re-establishing broken relationships to heal a sick world. Much of his vision can be seen coming to light today in the efforts American Indians are engaged in across the nation. These efforts are rooted in the healing ways of our ancestors, and Karen Cantrell 3 emphasize the use of traditional foods, spiritual healing, equine therapy, and improved state and tribal relations, to name just a few. As Crazy Horse's vision has inspired my leadership in American Indian health in Montana, I am also grounded in the stories of our people in Montana and a belief that our collective wisdom and history provide a roadmap toward health and wholeness. Crazy Horse Monument, Black Hills, South Dakota Crazy Horse's Vision Crazy Horse (Lakota: Thaka Witko, literally \"His-Horse-is-Crazy\") Shortly before his death on September 5, 1877, the Teton Sioux Chief Crazy Horse had a final vision in which he saw his people being driven into spiritual darkness and poverty while the white people prospered in a material way all around them. But even in the darkest times, he saw that the eyes of a few of his people kept the light of dawn and the wisdom of the earth, which they passed on to some of their grandchildren. He saw the coming of automobiles and airplanes, and twice he saw the great darkness and heard the screams and explosions when millions of people died in two great world wars. But he saw, after the second great war passed, a time come when his people began to awaken, not all at once, but a few here and there, and then more and more, and he saw that they were dancing in a beautiful light of the Spirit World under the Sacred Tree even while still on Earth. Then he was amazed to see that dancing under the tree were representatives of all races who had become brothers, and he realized that the world would be made new again and in peace and harmony not just by his people, but by members of all races of mankind. Crazy Horse shared his vision with Chief Sitting Bull during a pipe ceremony just days before he was murdered. He said, \"upon suffering beyond suffering, the red nation shall rise again and it shall be a blessing for the sick world. A world filled with broken promises, selfishness and separations. A world longing for light again. I see a time of seven generations, when all the colors of mankind will gather under the sacred tree of life and the whole earth will become one circle again. In that day, those among the Lakota who will carry knowledge and understanding of unity among all living things, and the young white ones will come, to those of my people to ask for wisdom. I salute the light within their eyes where the whole universe dwells, for when you are at the center within you and I am at the at place within me, we are as one.\" - Crazy Horse from James Medicine Tree1 1 Brown, V.

Mission: To improve and promote the health, well-being, and self-reliance of American Indians in Montana. RESPECT Continually exhibit a deep respect for beliefs and cultures different from our own. HUMILITY Exemplify humility and honesty in order to recognize opportunities to build trusted relationships between Tribes, urban Indian organizations, and state. HONOR Honor tribal sovereignty and established government-to-government relationships, upholding all promises and commitments made, so that we may teach others and ourselves that we can be trusted. EMPOWER Build on diverse strengths, skills, and resources to empower American Indians to embrace traditional and cultural practices to uplift one another. 5 Background In a 2013 report on the health of Montanans2 , DPHHS documented severe health disparities among American Indians living in Montana. The report found that American Indians in Montana die at a median age of 50 years, more than 20 years earlier than non-Indian Montanans. The gap in life expectancy is driven by elevated death rates for heart disease, cancer, respiratory illnesses, injuries, and suicide is also substantially higher. These health disparities are rooted in longstanding challenges, including poverty and unemployment, racial discrimination and historical trauma, inadequate housing, and food insecurity, among others. As a result of consultation with tribal health directors, urban Indian health organizations, and other Indian organizations, Governor Steve Bullock established a Director of American Indian Health position within the Director's Office at DPHHS in 2015, to lead the state's effort in addressing the main factors contributing to health disparities experienced by American Indian people in Montana. The Director of American Indian Health is responsible for identifying the sources of health disparities and developing strategies for health equity, while providing a forum for addressing tribal-state health issues. Montana became one of the first states in the country to create a Director of American Indian Health position under an Executive Order of the Governor, although a handful of others have created small programs as part of larger minority-health initiatives. The Director of American Indian Health within the DPHHS's Directors Office works on behalf of the eight federally-recognized Tribes and the five urban Indian health organizations in Montana. This model has been presented in state, regional, and national settings as a tool to form strong tribal-state partnerships on health care issues. This framework serves as an effective forum for achieving unity and guiding the collective needs of tribal governments and urban Indian health programs to address the health of American Indians in Montana. In October 2018, DPHHS recruited Karen Cantrell, an enrolled member of the Fort Peck Tribe (Assiniboine/Sioux), to serve as the Director of American Indian Health. 2 MT DPHHS. (2013).
