Chiropractic care is used most often to treat neuromusculoskeletal complaints, including, but not limited to: back pain, neck pain, pain in the joints of the arms and legs, and headaches. Chiropractors detect and remove subluxations, or misalignments of the spine, allowing proper communication between the brain and body therefore restoring function to the nervous system. As a result, many patient's experience improvements in a variety of conditions in addition to musculoskeletal complaints. The SuNu team brings together practitioners with years of experience in a diverse range of Chiropractic techniques including the Webster Technique, Graston Technique, Diversified, Activator, SacroOccipital Technique, Kinesiotaping, Thompson Technique, Pre-Natal and Post-Partum Care, Pediatric Care, Chiropractic Craniosacral and more. Sound Therapy [Read More](13-description) SuNu currently offers these sessions using a combination of Tibetan Singing Bowl Therapy, with Acoustic/Tonal Frequency, and microcurrent using The Healy Personalized Microcurrent Frequency Device. A Frequency, Sound & Vibration treatment is both a passive and participatory experience. The passive aspect is that you become more relaxed by laying down and slowing your breath. By doing this, you prepare yourself to become the receiver of sound. It's in this place of stillness that you participate by becoming more open and aware of each sound that comes in. Sound helps create the pathway to this place of stillness the same as a mantra helps you to arrive at the still point of meditation. This personalized combination of sound, vibration, and frequency is always customized and tailored to fit your daily current needs. Support using massage or craniosacral techniques can be provided if you are needing more physical support, or emphasis on frequency and vibration is used if you're needing more energetic support. Sound and vibration have been utilized in various cultures for thousands of years as a tool for healing. Sound helps to facilitate shifts in our brainwave state by using entrainment. Entrainment synchronizes our fluctuating brainwaves by providing a stable frequency which the brainwave can attune to. By using rhythm and frequency, we can entrain our brainwaves and it then becomes possible to down-shift our normal beta state (normal waking consciousness) to alpha (relaxed consciousness), and even reach theta (meditative state) and delta (sleep; where internal healing can occur). Healing through vibration Physics tells us that everything vibrates at a specific frequency. Every object, person, building, tree, mountain, or planet is a vibration in a vast ocean of energy. Nature is vibration. You are vibration. The universe is vibration. Each object or thought vibrates at different frequencies that create either harmony or dissonance in the local field. We all have a natural state of vibration. When the body fall out harmony resulting in various states is discord; voice, music, and singing bowls can help. Tibetan/Himalayan Singing Bowls produce pure vibrations capable of correcting these imbalances in our subtle bodies. When there is disease or distress in the body, the cells vibrate out of balance. Therefore, it is particularly effective to place singing bowls directly on the body-so that the vibrations are in an optimal position to affect any internal imbalances. Healing through sound The music you listen to can either help create harmonizing and sympathetic vibrations or chaotic and disorganized vibrations. Coherent, harmonizing vibrations promote healing, balance, and peace in both your mind and body. The music of the singing bowls is used to restore balance to your mind and body. Using specific sequences, vibratory coherence can be strengthened, assisting with healing and helping to settle the mind. It can shift you out of your thought stream and into an expanded state of awareness in which you perceive the world differently. Healing with frequency The Healy analyzes the frequencies in the information field you need right now, and then delivers individualized microcurrent frequencies to harmonize your bioenergetic field. Massage Therapy [Read More](3-description) 90 Minute Massages are able to be bookable online! Please call to schedule a 60 minute session. SuNu Wellness Center takes great pride in the ability of our massage therapists to bring about healing and change. Our team is extremely knowledgeable in regards to the human body and brings a diverse set of skills to the table, such as Swedish/Relaxation, Deep tissue, East-West Bodywork, Neuromuscular therapy, and Postpartum Craniosacral, Reiki, Cupping and more.

Biodynamic Craniosacral Therapy is a gentle, light-touch healing modality that helps balance the nervous system and restore health and vitality to the body. During a session the client remains fully clothed and receives the treatment on a massage/bodywork table. Through a series of light-touch hands-on holds at various areas of the body, the practitioner provides a neutral listening presence that supports the client's body in reorienting towards health. The practitioner listens to the tissues and fluids within the body and helps the client locate areas of the body that are under-resourced as well as areas that express health. Through witnessing and acknowledging tension, compression, or pain, combined with an appreciation of potency and vitality, bodies are capable of shifting, reorganizing, and releasing tension and trauma. The work aims to increase overall wellness, integration, and reconnect with wholeness. Acupuncture [Read More](1-description) Acupuncture, Craniosacral with Adrienne, and East-West Extended follow-up appointments for current clients are able to be scheduled online! (Please note if you are a new patient to one of these services, you will need to call to schedule your first appointment) Acupuncture, one of the main forms of therapy in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), has been practiced for at least 2,500 years. In acupuncture, certain points on the body associated with energy channels or \"meridians\" are stimulated by the insertion of super fine needles, that range from 0.12mm to 0.30mm. If compared to a normal hypodermic needle at 29mm, acupuncture needles are barely felt at all. The points can be needled between 15 and 90 degrees relative to the skin's surface, depending on treatment. Acupuncture restores health by removing energy imbalances and blockages in the body. TCM practitioners work with the vital force or energy called Qi. (pronounced \"chee\") It flows throughout the body between the skin and the internal organs, and along channels or pathways called meridians. Qi regulates the spiritual, emotional, mental, and physical harmony of the body by keeping the forces of yin and yang in balance. Yang is a principle of heat, activity, brightness, outwardness, while yin represents coldness, passivity, darkness, interiority, etc. TCM does not try to eliminate either yin or yang, but to keep them in harmonious balance. The overall experience for those receiving acupuncture treatments can vary greatly. Most report feeling very relaxed during the treatment and many fall asleep. Some find the treatments to be very invigorating and energizing. Almost all report decreased stress and improved well-being. Interestingly, it is rare that a patient reports overall discomfort or pain associated with the treatments, even if they went in with a good deal of concern or fear over the idea of needling. Whatever the case, it is worth looking into further if you are interested in this traditional form of healing. Call or email today for a free informational consult with one of our acupuncturists. Zen Shiatsu [Read More](11-description) This Shiatsu is a hands-on bodywork treatment that implements Eastern holistic philosophies using a trio of stretch, breath and pressure. Pressure is applied along the body's meridian channels to improve flow and circulation along the energy, blood and lymphatic systems. During a session, Five Element Theory of Traditional (East Asian) Chinese Medicine is utilized as an assessment tool demonstrating how all aspects of human life - i.e., movement, diet, emotions - are interconnected. Five Element philosophy organizes all natural phenomena into five groups \u2014 wood, fire, earth, metal, and water. An imbalance in one or more of these elements can give rise to physical, mental and/or emotional challenges. Five Element Theory shows how the structures and systems of the body are connected to each other and how they relate to the environment and the natural world. Shiatsu literally means \"finger pressure\" and was derived from the ancient principles of Acupuncture. It was then applied to the traditional form of Japanese massage called Anma developed in the 1300s. The history of a more modern form of Shiatsu was developed by Tokujiro Namikoshi in the 1920s. Created by Shizuto Masunaga in the 1950s, Zen Shiatsu sports a more dynamic model, adding his understanding of physiology, psychology, and self-care to the foundations of East Asian medicine. A Zen Shiatsu treatment is given on a floor mat or low table. Unlike many forms of bodywork, Zen Shiatsu rarely uses any oils or lotions. The form is performed fully clothed and it is recommended that clients wear something loose-fitting and comfortable. Zen Shiatsu is about giving support to the entire system while encouraging natural change in emotional balance and mind/body connection. By loosening blockages and promoting flow of energy, Zen Shiatsu can alleviate symptoms and help restore health and wellbeing. There are a number of potential short and long-term benefits of Zen Shiatsu including reduction of pain, headaches, and back discomfort. It can assist with healthy elimination, strengthen the immune system and may improve the quality of sleep. It can also maintain vitality by increasing flexibility, furthering healthy transitions throughout pregnancy, and easing emotionally charged stress by lifting the mood and calming the mind. In a Zen Shiatsu session at SuNu, one can first expect a full TCM-based Five Element intake process followed by hands-on bodywork for general energy balancing along with invitations for lifestyle change. Each intake is individually designed to best suit the needs of the client. An intake involves discussion and discovery, as well as hands-on bodywork. Follow-up sessions reflect a deeper and more customized treatment of imbalances and often result in more pronounced physical, emotional, and mental health benefits. Reiki [Read More](9-description) This service is bookable online! Reiki is a safe, non-intrusive hands-on healing technique for physical ailments, but it is much more than a physical therapy. It is a holistic system for balancing, healing and harmonizing all aspects of the person - body, mind, emotions and spirit - and it can also be used to encourage personal and spiritual awareness and growth. Reiki is \"holistic\" because it affects the whole person - body, mind and spirit - encouraging deep relaxation and a sense of well-being, and assisting the physical body's own healing ability to operate more effectively and efficiently. Reiki balances and heals on four levels: Physical: the physical body and any pain or illness Emotional: what you are feeling and experiencing Mental: thoughts and attitudes Spiritual: your capacity to love yourself and others unconditionally Group Sessions Group Sessions at Sunu are a way to connect with others as you receive support and healing. They are drop in format, and allow you experience services in community at a price point that makes it very accessible! Integrative Nutrition [Read More](4-description) Nutrition is a key element of good health. Integrative Health and Nutrition Coaching is a modern natural approach to developing a healthy balanced diet while taking into account the person as a whole. Holistic health is an approach to treating a person's well being by taking into consideration all aspects of life. A long term course of action includes emotional and spiritual health along with the physical body. Modern traditional medicine tends to focus on treating symptoms rather than finding the root cause. If a person is experiencing a symptom or chronic condition, the problem has most likely been developing for some time. The goal of integrative nutrition is to facilitate a health recovery plan as well as build a strong foundation for long term optimum health. Sunu's Kristin Elam can work with you to design a personalized program to help to recover and protect your health, prevent allergic reactions and alleviate symptoms of many disorders.
