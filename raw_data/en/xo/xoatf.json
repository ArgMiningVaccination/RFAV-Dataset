STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE Chapter : Science System and Performance (SSP) SOP# : 02 02 02D Section : Section 2: Immunization Subject : NSHA: Vaccine Cold Chain Investigation Approved by: Approval Date : (Revised September 6/2017) Applies To: Public Health Staff INTRODUCTION Successful immunization programs are dependent upon proper handling , storage and rigorous cold chain management of vaccines. Careful management of vaccine resources are critical as products are expensive and can be in short supply. Vaccines are sensitive biological products that may be less effective when exposed to temperatures outside of the recommended cold chain parameters. Every cold chain incident must be investigated in order to obtain sufficient information about the circumstances under which the exposure occurred by assessing the duration and temperature of exposure to determine if the vaccine(s) are viable and safe for reuse. Vaccine stability information and vaccine pricing are proprietary information that will be held by the Biological Depot only. The purpose of this standard operating procedure is to outline the process for the management of a cold chain incident, specifically; SOP#: 02 02 02D Page 2 of 21 Please note: The SOP posted to the online \"SOP Manual\" on Public Health Central's SharePoint intranet should be considered as the \"c urrent\" document. Any documents appearing in paper form should be checked against the electronic file version prior to use. 1) Management of a cold chain incident at an external/internal holding point (service provider, public health office ); 2) Management of a cold chain incident during transport between holding points; 3) Management of a cold chain incident caused by equipment failure at the bio -depot. Section 1 - Management of a Cold Chain Inci dent at an External/Internal Holding Point (Process for P rovider or Public H ealth Cold Chain I nvestigations) 1.1 The Zone 1.1.1 Upon notification of a cold chain failure local Public Health (PH) advises the provider to: 1.1.2 Quarantine the exposed vaccine in a working fridge .
