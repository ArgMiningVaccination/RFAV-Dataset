This form of Boswellia is exceptionally potent. It's 10x more effective than other forms because it's been formulated to contain more beneficial boswellic acids and less of the less-important ones. - DLPA: DLPA (D, L-phenylalanine) boosts the activity of your brain's natural pain-killing neurotransmitters. Doctors often recommend this natural substance to support a wide range of discomfort. - Nattokinase: Nattokinase is a food-based enzyme that enhances circulation. It promotes a swift and thorough delivery of CuraRelief's body-supporting properties. Lively Vitamin Co. Joint Jive Lively Vitamin Co.

GlucosaGreen is a shellfish-free form of glucosamine that is easily absorbed and exceptionally beneficial to bone and joint comfort.* - MSM: MSM encourages a natural inflammatory response and helps relieve occasional discomfort and soreness, plus it combats age-related bone and joint problems.* - Chondroitin Sulfate: This joint-lubricating nutrient plays a crucial role in building strong cartilage for solid bones and mobile joints.* - Hyaluronic acid: Hyaluronic acid has been gaining popularity in sports and performance supplements because of its unique ability to stimulate the growth of surrounding cartilage. Bonus! It doubles as a hydrating and smoothing skin-enhancer!* - Devil's Claw: This herb promotes healthy inflammatory levels which boost joint, ligament, tendon, bone, and muscle health.* - Collagen: Produced naturally by the body, collagen is an essential protein used to rebuild joint-cushioning cartilage. It's a vital part of this joint-jiving blend because it helps maintain healthy bone and joint structure even while we age!* Wild Theory Soothe \u2014 Broad Spectrum CBD Pain Blend Needing something on hand for those days you push yourself too hard at the gym?
