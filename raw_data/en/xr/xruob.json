I nfluenza Vaccines & Ordering Flu vaccine deliveries will commence as per the National Cold Chain Service (NCCS) vaccine delivery calendar.

HSE mobile V accination teams will provide the c hildren's LAIV on-site in schools between October & December 2023 to: oSenior Infants in primary schools oEligible children in primary age special schools The NIO will be facilitating Community Pharmacies and GP practices to link with local primary schools to provide on- site LAIV to children in other year groups where possible Parent / guardians of all eligible children will be encouraged to avail of the flu vaccine from participating GPs or Community Pharmacies COVID -19 Booster C ampaign The patient groups recommended for a COVID -19 autumn booster are outlined in Appendix 2. For full clinical guidance please see https://www.rcpi.ie/Portals/0/Document%20Repository/Healthcare%20Leadership/NIAC/CH5a%20COVID - 19%2027.04.2023%20Final.pdf?ver=0um90z0gi3e6xSSGAM52Bg%3D%3D COVID -19 Vaccines and O rdering The COVID -19 vaccine to be used for the aut umn / winter campaign is yet to be confirmed. Pharmacies should not commence ordering for the a utumn / winter campaign until further information is available as to which vaccine will be used. Vaccination Training and E ducation Pharmacists who have completed the required training can supply and administer COVID -19 and Influenza vaccines. You can find out more information about training on the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland websi te www.thepsi.ie/gns/education/Training_for_Pharmacists_Vaccinations.aspx Training is available complete the relevant modules on HSELanD prior to the administration of COVID -19 vaccines. This training will be updated in due course to reflect any changes in vaccine type which may occur for the autumn / winter campaign. Influenza Vaccine modules on LAIV and QIV through Vaccination Centres (CVCs) have now closed. HSE Vaccination teams will be mobilised from operational bases (at least 2 per CHO). For the autumn / winter campaign, HSE Vaccination teams will offer the following vaccination services: COVID -19 clinics for: o Children aged 6 months - 11 years o Prisons COVID -19 and Flu vaccines for those eligible who are: o Residents in Long Term Residential Care Facilities (LTRCFs) including Older Persons, Mental Health and Disability - in a key change from last season, HSE teams will offer both COVID -19 and Flu vaccines to eligible residents in all LTRCFs, and not just those which are HIQA regis tered o Health and Care Workers (HCW) - HSE team s will facilitate clinics in workplace settings for HCWs , with support from peer vaccinators. HCWs can also be vaccinated through Community Pharmacies. o Hard to reach groups o Housebound - for housebound referral pathway see: https://www.hse.ie/eng/about/who/gmscontracts/2019agreement/ o In-patients in acute hospitals In addition, HSE mobile teams may set up temporary and pop- up clinics a s required during the campaign, to provide COVID -19 and/or Influenza vaccines in local areas to target uptake in particular locations or cohorts . Some operational bases can provide temporary clinics on- site if required. Aside from the pathways listed abov e, the majority of COVID -19 boosters and Flu vaccinations will be provided in the community, through Community Pharmacies and GPs. Eligible individuals who previously attended CVCs for their COVID -19 boosters will now be coming forward to their local Pharm acy or GP ; based on trends in uptake rates to date, it is estimated that Community Pharmacies should plan for an increase in demand of approximately 10% compared to last winter for COVID -19 boosters. Pharmacy Finder Community Pharmacies are key in providi ng easy access and choice to those who require vaccinations. As we are now focused on co- administration for those who are eligible for both vaccines, t he Flu and COVID -19 Pharmacy Finder is in the process of being merged see https://www2.hse.ie/services/pharmacies -flu-and-covid - vaccines/ . A number of P harmacies offering vaccination are not currently displayed in t he public access HSE Pharmacy Finder. It is important that pharmacies providing vaccination services are listed on the Pharmacy Finder, and that this is kept up to date and accurate for each vaccination campaign. The Pharmacy Service Listing form to add/update the pharmacy details is available at https://www.hse.ie/eng/pharmacy -service - request/ . We ask Pharmacists to review and update their details on the new amalgamated Flu/COVID -19 Finder. Conclusion I would like once again to express my sincere gratitude to Community Pharmacies and their teams for the efficient manner in which the COVID -19 and Influenza Vaccination Programme s have been delivered to date. I would also like to wish you and your team every success in delivering these vaccination programmes to your patients over the coming months. Please be assured of the HSE's continued support at this time.
