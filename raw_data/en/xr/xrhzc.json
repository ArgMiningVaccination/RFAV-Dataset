Yes, for Service Dogs; No, for therapy dogs. We only allow working Service Animals, in accordance with the American with Disabilities Act (ADA). Under the ADA, \"a service animal is a dog that has been individually trained to work or perform tasks for assisting a person with a disability.\" Service dogs are working animals, not pets. Dogs whose sole function is to provide comfort or emotional support do not qualify as service animals under the ADA. Pets, comfort animals, emotional support or therapy animals are not permitted at the aquarium. Upon arrival at the park, please check in with Admissions so a supervisor can review some logistical items with you and issue a Service Dog Admission pass*. Thank you for your cooperation to ensure a safe and successful visit for yourself, your service dog, the animals cared for at the aquarium, and other park guests. *As stipulated by the ADA, Aquarium staff may request that a service dog experiencing difficulty or demonstrating problematic behaviors, such as barking or lunging, be removed from the Aquarium immediately. We ask that you promptly comply with any such request for the safety and welfare of all. I'm a member of the media and would like to arrange a visit or take some photographs. Who should I contact? Commercial photography or filming is prohibited without express permission of WCS Public Relations. The PR department can be reached at [jdelaney@wcs.org](mailto:jdelaney@wcs.org) or 718-265-7908 Will the Aquarium accept an animal I cannot care for? Every year, the New York Aquarium receives many inquiries from people who would like to donate wild animals or exotic pets; however, we are not able to accept them. If you have an animal in need of a new home, please contact local and regional rescue organizations that specialize in caring for unwanted pets, such as the [ASPCA](http://www.aspca.org/). Plans for a pet should always include care for its entire lifespan. Remember that exotic animals almost never make good pets. Do you offer behind-the-scenes tours? While we do not currently have tours behind the scenes, we do have some great up-close animal experiences this Summer! [Check out our Wild Encounters](https://nyaquarium.com/vip) for sea lion and penguin programs on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays in July and August. You can also [participate in learning experiences](https://nyaquarium.com/learn) through our Education Department - with programs for children, families, schools and other audiences.
