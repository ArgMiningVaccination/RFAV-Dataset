With love and light, blessings from angel and money reiki practitioner pratanu banerjee of India. Date of experience: August 30, 2021 With distance healing it can be a challenge to measure results. With my soul level healing, there was a lot of heartbreak. I did notice a lightness after the session and the follow up information on what he perceived energetically helped to put what was gong on in perspective. I am thankful that Evananda cares to follow through with providing whatever is needed for you to feel better. Getting to the root of issues is worth the investment. Date of experience: November 27, 2015 Reply from Evananda - Divine Energy Healing\u00ae Evananda has always stayed in a welcoming space creating an inviroment for healing to be an outcome. I may not be a new ager per say born in the 70's, but I will say I respect Evananda allowing for people to reach him by any means necessary to have a real connection. More Blessing to all that are seeking healing and understanding to their own path. Lyf Date of experience: November 29, 2015 Reply from Evananda - Divine Energy Healing\u00ae Was pleasantly surprised by Evan's approach and depth of spirituality... With over 40 years of traveling this path, I found Evan and his \"work\" refreshing, substantial, fun and to the HEART of the matter... Upon walking through his front door, there was/is an immediate connection... He is a clear conduit of his guru and his sessions -I had 2 in the last month- are first rate... Blessings to all... Date of experience: December 24, 2015 Mr. Rofheart, Evananda, is a man of faith, practice and experience. The time with him having spent, was mystical from the beginining and I have found that having engaged with him a number of times, I find that \"dabbling with and into realms of un-realized conciousness\" is how I would most accuratley portray my personal experience with the man, Evan Rofheart. He has exhibited commitment, and dedication towards aquiring metaphysical and Hindu/yogi style lessons, techniques, belief and teachings. He seems to portray a loving kindness of altruism and faith, in his way. I have recieved a kriya from an un seen realm (to my eyes), by the man. That introduction into it's bestowal upon me, remains one of the most personally intense and palliable spiritual experience I have been through. Thank you quite much. Date of experience: November 22, 2015 He has mastered the rare ability of fine-tuning your kundalini to whatever is your need at the time (done both tune-up and tone-down). He is also an expert at finding that special spirit companion (did for me). Has helped me clear karmic issues (brought healing). I have dealt with him for years now. If you are serious he will work diligently with you. Highly recommend him! Date of experience: May 31, 2016 Reply from Evananda - Divine Energy Healing\u00ae After years of therapy I decided I help on a more profound mind-body-spirit level. Working with Evan has been one of the best decisions I have ever made. I have made more growth with him in 3 months than in 3 years of any traditional method of healing. Evan has been indispensable to me. He is kind, loving, honest, real and sage beyond words. I would recommend him for any problem you have - physical, emotional, or spiritual. He is the REAL DEAL. Date of experience: January 02, 2017 I have now had two remote healing sessions with Evan, and he has really helped me with some deep spiritual issues. I originally contacted him because I was having some difficulty making an important career decision and in one session Evan clarified everything for me and helped me to refocus on what my needs really were. The second time was for a Soul Healing recently. I had split with my longtime girlfriend and I was feeling a little lost and heartbroken, the one remote soul healing got me back to where I needed to be and I have been now able to move forward in my relationships. Thanks Evan. Date of experience: August 30, 2019 Evananda is a truly gifted healer. At first I was not sure, but then after he gave me more details of his healing work, I decided to try it. It was a great decision. I feel he did a good and thorough Divine healing on my overactive kundalini. I also know he removed blocks and such that was making my life difficult. Overall, I would highly recommend him, and I wouldn't mind going back again for another healing. Date of experience: January 28, 2016 I believe Evan is a genuine healer. I've had a number of sessions with him and all have been positive and effective. I only wish he would communicate a little better. After having several treatments, I still haven't the slightest idea what he does, when he does it and what information comes through in the process, if any. I know he doesn't want to interfere with the process by getting our minds and expectations involved. But a little feedback and verbal communication might help to satisfy the curious mind. Date of experience: November 21, 2015 Evan is a true healer. Seeking him out has tremendously made my situation more understanding. For a while, I was lost and confused as to why I was feeling down and out (just like many other ascending souls on this planet). Evan helped me to get a better understanding of my life's purpose and in doing so he has helped me to remove blocks and negativity in my life so I can fully reach my potential. Already I feel relieved and full of life. It can only get better from here. I look forward to working with Evan and the help of Shirdi Sai Baba again to continue to grow spiritually. Date of experience: March 24, 2016 Evan did a distant divine energy healing for me using Divine energy from Shirdi Sai Baba and It's been less than a week, and so far it seems to be working very well with a lot of improvement in how I am feeling and how am able to tackle a difficult phase in life. I have full trust in Sai Baba and Evan's process and believe it will continue to heal me at the soul level and help me get back on track in life. Thanks a lot Evan and I hope one day I can meet you in person in NY. Date of experience: February 03, 2017 Hi Everyone, I was in a lot of trouble and depression but fortunately God heard my prayers and I started surfacing again thru Evananda Divine Energy Healing. Have faith and some patience and ud see miracles happen. Amen. Date of experience: November 22, 2015 Reply from Evananda - Divine Energy Healing\u00ae I feel very lucky and deeply grateful that I had the chance to meet Evan. He has offered tremendous help to me and my family for serious issues related to mental health, stress, depression and protection from negative energies. I don't have enough words to describe his healing abilities. Evan is a very good and honest man with ethics and a very deep spiritual knowledge. That is the reason why I chose him to be my teacher. I am very lucky I found him and I will always consult him in times of need. Evan is an example of a true healer. THANK YOU for all of your precious help! Date of experience: December 22, 2015 This man is connected to the Devine. I felt better just communicating with him . Some are gifted where they are an Antena I think we are to a degree and I know we can expand our own but sometimes we get caught up in the world things outside ourselves we allow them to enter our emotional life wreaking havoc on the body through the mind because we don't realize it's all a choice ! Then we need a little help balancing it out again ..... It's like someone grabbing your arm when your about to fall :). Thank you . Date of experience: November 21, 2015 Reply from Evananda - Divine Energy Healing\u00ae Evan, has been a very dedicated person in my case. Always giving me hope and I know that he is doing what he can and not giving up. The soul healing has helped me emensly brought me back to the point where I don't have anymore depression, I am not going through being a handbasket case when things go wrong, I feel more confident of myself, and feel more positive about life. Physically it has also helped me, and I know it takes time but I am waiting with a heart full of hope and anticipation for other issues to turn around. Thank you Evan from the bottom of my heart and God truly bless you for being an healing angel in my life. Date of experience: November 24, 2015 Evan has a great deal of depth and high levels of Clairvoyance. This may be because of his years of experience in the spiritual path and devotion to Sai baba. i have been his client for over 3 years and he has guided me at times of confusion and peril. i have no doubt about his healing and psychic abilities. Date of experience: November 23, 2015 Reply from Evananda - Divine Energy Healing\u00ae Evan is a very charismatic healer, and I want to thank him for his courage, integrity and sharing spirit! With his extremely open heart and directness he gained my trust and appreciation. I could feel the the healing very intensely and the results were often immediate. I would suggest to anyone who has the courage to explore more inside or need instant healing help to contact him. Date of experience: January 23, 2017 Reply from Evananda - Divine Energy Healing\u00ae Evan did his healing process on my piles of heartache and I'm really starting to feel some powerful shifting. I have been experiencing so much heartache, I couldn't see around the big dark blob of stuck energy, no matter how much meditation, massage and other healing I was doing. A week or so after Evan's healing, like he said, the energy started moving and shifting. I feel an opening, a space - a place where the light can get in. I'm feeling lighter, more optimistic, and like there is a way through this darkness. In fact, the darkness is getting lighter and less dense. Thank you Evan for your powerful healing. I know there is still a little more to go, but I'm feeling more hopeful and encouraged and I couldn't have gotten here without you! Thank you from the bottom of my heart!!
