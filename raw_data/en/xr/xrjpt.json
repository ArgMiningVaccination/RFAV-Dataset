Being spiritually clean is part of living a spiritual life. Being spiritually clean does not mean you have to be spiritually perfect but you do have to constantly work on your spiritual life. As one of my friends said, \"Living spiritually clean means to let every decision you make be based upon whether or not it will enhance your spiritual life\". Living spiritually clean means always choosing the path which is going to bring you closer to your higher power or enhance your spiritual life. Sometimes living spiritually clean is hard because always choosing the route which enhances your spiritual life is not easy. Sometimes it feels so good, to be bad. And by bad we mean to choose the more human defect rather than the spiritual principle. Sometimes we choose to go with our character defects instead of enhancing our spiritual life without even knowing we're doing it. The point is that when you do become aware, you take action, and you take that action to get you closer to your higher power - whatever that may be. Living spiritually clean is not merely staying sober it is a way of life. It means practicing spiritual principles into every aspect of your day to day. It means not lying, cheating, stealing, manipulating, acting out of fear, acting out of ego with your job, relationships, friends, family, or everyday life. Being spiritually clean means to put into action all the spiritual stuff you talk about in meetings in the rest of your life. We can talk the talk but we have to walk the walk. Being spiritually clean does not mean you have to be perfect. Being imperfect makes a way cooler story and allows everyone to learn, grow, and develop. If none of us made mistakes we would be unable to identify with anyone elses life. Luckily we are imperfect, we get to grow, and we get to relate to other people and their flaws. We continue to be spiritually clean even through our mistakes by learning from them and choosing to take action towards enhancing our spiritual life. If we don't learn anything from our mistakes and continue to act unspiritual then we are not spiritually clean. Being aware that something is wrong and continuing to do it is not spiritual. To know something is wrong and to continue to do it has more to do with a mixture of morality and inflated ego.Sometimes, even those of us who try to stay spiritually clean get caught in human ego; we consciously choose the unspiritual path. Eventually, we come back around and learn from that choice and we don't make it again. We take that mistake and that decision and use it to enlarge upon our already spiritual life. Personally, this is what it means to be spiritually clean. Being spiritually clean and being spiritually perfect are different. If you are spiritually clean you are not perfect and that is ok, you learn from your mistakes. I haven't met someone that was spiritually \"perfect\" but if you do please let me know!
