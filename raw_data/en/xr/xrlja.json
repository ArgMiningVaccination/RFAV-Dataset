Because it is \"energy\" medicine, diluted and shaken up or potentized, some people are more responsive than others. Sensitive people respond well, as do folks who are cleaner, less toxic. Homeopathic remedies work on several levels. The remedies commonly found available in health stores or online typically come in lower potencies such as 6c, 6x or 30c, 30x. These remedies, e.g. Arnica montana, or Rhus toxicodendron, can treat anything physical from sprains, acute pain, to headaches, diarrhea, gas or bloating, and poison oak. These low potencies are shorter acting, for acute conditions. Most homeopathic remedies are made from plants or minerals, some such as snake venom Lachesis, are made from animal source. Remember because they are diluted, none are toxic past the 12c or 24x potency. The higher potencies (LM, 1M, 10M) are only available from practitioners of homeopathy who have advanced knowledge or training. These potencies are deeper acting, especially on the mental and emotional levels. They may be called constitutional remedies, one single remedy in high potency (LM, 1M, 10M), which can treat the whole body, mind, emotions, spirit. Homeopathy can seem too subtle, yet when you match the correct homeopathic resonance with the body, a huge shift can occur on all levels! I always tell my patients that this is the best thing I can do for them, giving them their constitutional remedy. It can help clear some deep/past grief, fear or anger that is holding back healing. Typically patients don't get a constitutional remedy from me until their 3rdvisit, as the first two visits we focus on detoxification and rebalancing the organs and hormones Here are two interesting cases of patients who responded well from homeopathy: Case 1: LS, a young man in his 20s came to see me feeling lousy: low energy, out of sorts, depressed, and with joint pains. When I tested him via applied kinesiology or muscle testing, I found he had a miasm, a homeopathic term for feeling the effects from a neurological toxin (vaccine, metal, drug, etc.) With two doses of the correct homeopathic remedy, Medhorrinum 10m, the dark cloud lifted. After two rounds of enzymes and drainage/circulatory detox supplements, his pain lifted and his energy returned. He returned to his full expression of being: robust, creative and full of life. With homeopathy, I was able to help his body remove the obstacles to cure and support his own healing ability, or vital force. Case 2: BR, a highly sensitive person whose work was interior design, came to me with extreme anxiety. She couldn't relax, sleep or focus, and felt suicidal. She even questioned her relationship with the man she loved and had been with for 8 years. With the proper electrolytes, amino acids, B vitamins and homeopathic remedy (Thuja LM1), she felt some relief immediately. Her nervous system continued to heal over the next weeks and months. She now feels great, loves her work and relationship again, and even got married a few months ago. "}
