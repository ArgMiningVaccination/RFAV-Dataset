Individuals with 2 documented doses of a rubella -containing vaccine or previous serological evidence of rubella immunity (rubella IgG positive) do not require further dose s regardless of subsequent negative rubella serology. Post -exposure: Measles o Susceptible eligible contacts of a measles case should receive either MMR or immune globulin depending upon the time -lapse from exposure, age and health status. Susceptible contacts 12 months of age and older should receive measles - containing vaccine unless vaccine is contraindicated. The vaccine should be administered within 72 hours of exposure and should not be delayed pending serology results. Children younger than 18 months of age who have received one dose of measles containing vaccine (considered up to date) should receive a second Alberta Health Services Standard #07.270 June 1 , 2023 Immunization Program Standards Manual Page 4 of 12 Provincial Population and Public Health Priorix \u00ae M-M-R\u00ae II dose of measles containing vaccine ensuring the recommended interval spacing between the vaccine doses. If measles -containing vaccine is contraindicated or if more tha n 72 hours since exposure have elapsed, Immune Globulin (Ig) may be indicated. See Immune Globulin Biological Page #07.250 . If measles -containing vaccine is administered more than 72 hours after exposure, it may not provide protection against the current exposure bu t would offer protection against subsequent exposures. Note: As an outbreak control strategy during a measles outbreak, the Medical Officer of Health may recommend MMR vaccine for children 6 -11 months of age inclusive. Mumps o Susceptible eligible contacts should be immunized (this is not likely to prevent or alter severity of mumps from current exposure ; however if current exposure to mumps does not cause infection, this dose should induce protection against subsequent infection ). Rubella o Susceptible eligible contacts may be immunized ( this is not likely to prevent or alter rubella from current exposure ; however if current exposure to rubella does not cause infection, this dose should induce protection against subsequent infection ). For fur ther guidelines related to post -exposure follow -up refer to the following (https://www.alberta.ca/notifiable -disease -guidelines.aspx?utm_source=redirector ): Public Health Notifiable Disease Management Guidelines - Measles Public Health Notifiable Disease Management Guidelines - Mumps Public Health Notifiable Disease Management Guidelines - Rubella Specific Travel Indications and Recommendations Individuals travelling to areas where measles is circulating in Canada or the United States and all countries outside of Canada and the United States . Infants: 6 months up to and including 11 months of age One dose of MMR va ccine. o Note: Two additional doses of measles -containing vaccine should be administered as per routine schedule at 12 months of age and older respecting recommended intervals. Children: 12 months up to and including 17 years of age Dose 1: Day 0 Dose 2: four weeks after dose 1 o Note: When both MMR vaccine and varicella vaccine are indicated for children 12 months up to and including 12 years of age, MMR -Varicella combined vaccine should be considered. Adults (18 years of age and older) Adults born in 1970 or later o Two life -time doses with at least four weeks between doses. Adults born prior to 1970 o Adults born prior to 1970 without a documented history of measles - containing vaccine, history of laboratory -confirmed measles disease or laboratory evidence of measles immunity should receive one dose previously drawn, positive measles IgG serology results or laboratory confirmed measles disease can be accepted as immunity to measles disease.

Refer to supporting Standards as indicated: Immunization of Health Care Workers, Immunization of Post -Secondary Health Care Students and other Students in High -Risk Occupational Programs and Immunization of Transplant Candidates and Recipients. Measles p ost-immunization serology (measles IgG) Note: serology (alone or in addition to measles IgG serology) is inadvertently drawn when an individual present to their family physician with an expected reaction (measles -like rash) following immunization with measles containing vaccine. Although measles IgM can indicate evidence of acute disease it can also be present following recent immunization. Assessment of positive measles IgM results should include checking for recent immunization with measles containing vaccine. In the event of a recent positive measles IgM serology result immediately follow -up with Zone Notifiable Disease program for further advice and direction. Mumps pre -immunization serology (mumps s: In Alberta mumps IgG is no t accepted as evide nce of immunity to mumps disease . It should be noted that in other jurisdictions a positive mumps IgG results may be accepted as evidence of immunity. If an individual has other historical laboratory evidence of past mumps disease (such as isolation of mumps virus from nasopharyngeal swa bs, saliva, urine or cerebral spinal fluid) then these tests can be taken as confirmation of mumps disease. When performing a medical record review it should be noted that mumps IgM serology has the potential for false positive findings therefore for the p urposes of immunization decisions; historical evidence of positive mumps IgM is not an acceptable indication of immunity .12 Rubella pre -immunization serology (rubella IgG) : Not routinely indicated. If previously drawn, a history of documented positive rub ella IgG serology can be accepted as immunity to rubella disease. Note : Rubella IgG serology results may be used in other specific situations to determine immunity to rubella.

Administration of another live vaccine within the past 1 -3 months (see Spacing Considerations above). Precautions: Egg allergy , including anaphylaxis, is not a contraindication to immunization with MMR vaccine as the amount of egg protein found in the vaccine is not felt to be enough to cause an allergic reaction. Observation for 30 minu tes post immunization is recommended for clie nts who have experienced anaphylaxis to eggs . The use of MMR vaccine in individuals who suffered thrombocytopenia after a first dose of live measles, mumps, and rubella vaccines should be carefully eval uated in terms of risk -benefit. Individuals, who devel op vaccine -associated thrombocytopenia, should be referred to their physician for serology to assess immunity to measles, mumps and rubella and to determine the need for vaccine. A second dose of vaccine should only be given if non -immune and after consult ation with zone MOH/designate. Immunization with measles -containing suppress tuberculin reactivity. Measles -containing vaccines are contraindicated in individuals with active, untreated tuberculosis as a precautionary measure. Tuberculosis m ay be exacerbated by natural measles infection, but there is no evidence that measles vaccine has the same effect . Possible Reactions Common: Redness, swelling and tenderness at injection site Burning and/or stinging at injection site for a short duration immediately following injection Fever, rash, and/or measles -like rash appearing between the 6th and 23rd day following immunization Irritability Arthralgia/arthritis 1-3 weeks following immunization (more common in post pubescent females) Uncommon: Lymphadenopathy Nervousness, abnormal Rare: Anaphylaxis Febrile convulsions As with any immunization, unexpected or unusual side effects can occur. Refer to the product monograph for more detailed information. Pregnancy Live vaccines are contraindicated in pregnant women.

Administration with Other Products See schedule section for recommended intervals between all measles, mumps, rubella and varicella vaccines. With the exception of Yellow Fever vaccine, MMR can be administered simultaneously with other live vaccines or separated by a n interval of at least 4 weeks. o Recent limited data suggest it may be preferable for children aged 12 months up to and including -23 months of age to receive MMR and Yellow Fever vaccine at least 30 days apart if time permits, because of lower seroconversion rates for mumps, rubella, and yellow fever in those immunized simultaneously than in Alberta Health Services Standard #07.270 June 1 , 2023 Immunization Program Standards Manual Page 11 of 12 Provincial Population and Public Health Priorix \u00ae M-M-R\u00ae II those immunized 30 days apart. The study did not include infants younger than 12 months of age, but it is reasonable to follow the same guidance for infants under 12 months of age. o For individuals 2 ye ars of age and older MMR can be administered simultaneously with Yellow Fever vaccine or separated by an interval of at least 4 weeks. LAIV/QLAIV may be administered any time before or after the administration of other live attenuated or inactivated vaccines. o Specialists recommending alternate spacing for specific high risk individuals may be accommodated on a case by case basis. MMR vaccine can be given at the same time as other inactivated and live vaccine using a separate needle and syr inge for each vaccine. The same limb may be used if necessary, but different sites on the limb must be chosen. Tuberculin skin tests should be given either before or at the same time as MMR vaccine; otherwise, the tuberculin skin test should be delayed for 4 weeks following MMR vaccine . Immune globulins (IG) and antibody -containing blood products cannot be given concurrently with live vaccines and need to be separated by specified time intervals depending upon the dosage and the biological. MMR vaccine shou ld be given at least 14 days prior to administration of an IG preparation or blood product, or delayed until the antibodies in the IG preparation or blood product have degraded. If the interval between administration of vaccine and subsequent administratio n of an IG preparation or blood product is less than 14 days, the vaccine dose should be repeated after the recommended interval. See Recommended Schedules Standard - Guidelines for Interval Between Immune Globulin and other Blood Products and Live Vaccines for spacing considerations . If MMR is given to rubella susceptible women less than 3 months from receipt of the RhIg (RhoGam, Anti -Rho D), serological testing should be done 3 months after the MMR dose to assess the immune response. If MMR is given 3 months or more following Rh Ig then serology is not necessary.
